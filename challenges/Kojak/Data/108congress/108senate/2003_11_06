JAMES, Public Printer.\n[[Page S14084]]\n\n\n\n                          MEDICARE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to express \nconcern about the current discussion on Medicare, particularly the \nprescription drug bill. The first point I would make is that the \nprocess has been, I think, subverted because all the conferees are not \ninvited to participate in conference meetings. Many of my colleagues in \nthe Democratic caucus who have voted for the bill and are named as \nconferees have not been given access to all of the deliberations and \ndiscussions.\n  I know Senator Baucus and Senator Breaux have been there and are \ndoing an admirable job representing the viewpoints of the Democratic \ncaucus, but this is not the way procedurally to conduct deliberations \non such important measures as Medicare reform and prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors. But those are procedural issues.\n  The substance also troubles me, particularly the discussion of cost \ncontainment, premium support, income relating--all of these are \neuphemisms but have extremely important consequences in the lives of \nseniors and, indeed, in the lives of everybody throughout the country.\n  The conference is examining these proposals and exploring ideas that \nare not just about prescription drug benefits for seniors. In fact, the \nconference discussions have taken on a rather controversial cast \nbecause we are talking seriously now about Medicare reform. But we are \nnot just talking about Medicare reform; I would argue we are talking \nabout proposals that would perhaps lead to the end of the Medicare \nprogram, eventually, as we know it.\n  Back in 1995, Newt Gingrich said that his approach to Medicare was to \nlet it ``wither on the vine,'' to undercut it, undermine it, underfund \nit, so that eventually it would become a remnant, not a vital part of \nthe American fabric. That, I fear, might be taking place right now in \nits first steps.\n  Of course, as we deliberate these issues with respect to Medicare \ndrug benefits, one major issue that concerns me is that we have \nallocated $400 billion. That seems like a great deal of money but, \nfrankly, it is not. When we consider, over the 10-year period we are \ntalking about, that seniors will spend $1.8 trillion on \npharmaceuticals, $400 billion is not a lot of money. Indeed, compared \nto what we are spending on some efforts overseas--Iraq being the most \nprominent at the moment--that $400 billion over 10 years is not an \nastounding total.\n  In fact, I would argue it is insufficient to give the benefits that \nmost seniors expect to receive and believe we are discussing at the \nmoment.\n  One of the particular issues that I am disturbed about is first this \nnotion of cost containment. My impression of cost containment is that \nwe would somehow be able to contain the cost of prescription drugs we \nare buying and seniors are buying, but that is not the view of the \nconferees about cost containment.\n  Cost containment is really Medicare expenditure containment. I think \nthat is a fallacy. If we can't control the cost of pharmaceuticals \nthrough market forces, then we will never catch up with the explosion \nof costs. But then to arbitrarily say we are going to cap what we will \nput into Medicare, to me, is a fundamentally erroneous approach to this \nvery difficult problem. In fact, the cost containment issue the \nconference is discussing is not directed precisely at the \npharmaceutical program. It is going to be applied across the board to \nall Medicare expenditures.\n  Ostensibly, what the conferees are talking about now is capping the \ngeneral fund contribution to Medicare. There are two sources of \nfinancing for the Medicare program. First is the Medicare trust fund, \nthen second is general revenues. The conference position today, I am \ntold, is if our general expenditures exceed 45 percent in any two \nconsecutive years, we arbitrarily stop funding Medicare--not just the \npharmaceutical portion, but the whole program. To me, that is the wrong \napproach--setting arbitrary limits not based upon the health conditions \nof our seniors but based upon our fiscal situation here in Washington.\n  Indeed, we all understand that Medicare is an extremely popular \nprogram. A Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard School of Public Health \nsurvey found that 80 percent of seniors have a favorable impression of \nMedicare, and 62 percent believe the program is well run. Seventy-two \npercent of people age 65 and over thought seniors should be able to \ncontinue to get their health insurance coverage through Medicare over \nprivate plans.\n  It is an extremely popular program. It is efficiently run with very \nlow overhead. And it is in danger of being scuttled because we are \nattempting to apply arbitrary limits to our contributions to Medicare.\n  There is another aspect that concerns me very much in this whole \ndebate; that is, this notion of premium support. These euphemisms sound \ninnocuous but the consequences could be quite severe to the long-term \nhealth and viability of Medicare.\n  Premium support is the notion that we are going to entice private \nhealth insurers to go in and take the place of the Medicare Program. If \nthe market would allow for that, that is great. We want competition and \nchoice. It provides for more efficient allocation of resources. But \nwhat the conferees are proposing is a $12 billion slush fund that will \nfavor private companies over the government-run system. I think the \nonly reason we have to do that is, in reality when you look at the \nMedicare system today, it is in many cases more efficient than private \nhealth insurers.\n  The way these private health insurers are going to be making their \nmoney is not to serve every senior, but to be very careful and very \nselective--to cherry-pick the senior population--and get the healthiest \nseniors into their plans; and in addition to that, get subsidies from \nthe Federal Government to their bottom line by simply saying we can't \nmake enough money to participate in this market--not that we can't \nserve enough seniors.\n  I think that is wrong. That will severely and significantly undercut \nthe Medicare Program.\n  It has been estimated that a result of premium support will be that \nrates for seniors across the country will no longer be uniform. They \nwill be variable based upon the region and based upon how many private \nplans are participating. They could vary from one area to another. \nRhode Island and New England is a small area. We could have one rate in \nEast Providence, RI, and 10 minutes away in Massachusetts the rates \ncould be entirely different.\n  Today, seniors count on predictability, reliability and the certainty \nthat the rates are stable and uniform. We could lose that. That is a \nmajor concern of mine.\n  There is another concern also; that is, the fact that we are on the \nverge of accepting this notion of means testing. The euphemism of the \nmoment is income relating Medicare Part B premiums. They have laid out \na situation where seniors who are making over $80,000 a year would \ngradually see their Federal subsidy reduced from a current level of 75 \npercent. Certainly at that level of income there is an argument to \nbe made that seniors can afford to pay more than the majority of \nseniors whose incomes are much less than $80,000, and are probably \ncloser to $15,000 to $20,000 a year.\n\n  We are fracturing the program by means-testing premiums. We are \ngiving incentives for wealthy seniors to ask, Why should I participate \nat all? This is not a program that helps me. I can get my health \ninsurance coverage in the private market, and I will do that.\n  The fragmentation--both in terms of geography because of premium \nsupport, and in terms of income because of this notion of means \ntesting--will begin that slow, I am afraid, and irreversible process of \nwithering Medicare. It makes no sense.\n  One of the reasons we enacted the Medicare Program in 1965 was \nbecause private health insurance companies would only insure the \nwealthiest and healthiest seniors, leaving the vast majority of seniors \nwith nothing. The burden of those seniors was the burden of every \nfamily in this country.\n  As I grew up in the 1950s and the 1960s, it was not uncommon to have \na grandmother or a grandfather living in your home because they simply \ncould not support their health care needs. They could not support \nthemselves. Medicare changed that more than any other program in this \ncountry.\n  It is widely popular, and based on the simple notion that, first, we \nare going to provide the benefit equally to all of our seniors. We are \nnot going to fragment it by region or by income. We\n\n[[Page S14085]]\n\nwill provide a system of care. We essentially are going to do what \ninsurance should do--take the broadest possible risk pool of all \nseniors--healthy seniors, unhealthy seniors, the frail and elderly \nseniors, and the young and vigorous seniors. They are all going to \nparticipate. That is the efficient, fair, and sensible way to do it.\n  We are on the verge, I fear, of ruining that system--not just for the \nmoment but for all time.\n  I hope in the next several days we can resolve these issues \nfavorably. But I am concerned if we proceed on this course we will not \nreally be doing anything for seniors, the prescription drug benefit \nmight be illusory, and the long-term effect will be severe and perhaps \ncause fatal damage to Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14085-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14085-S14086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the \nnomination of William Pryor. Since President Bush came into office, the \nSenate has confirmed 168 of his nominees and has decided so far not to \nproceed with only 4. That is a 97.7 percent success rate for the \nPresident. It is preposterous to say that Senate Democrats are \nobstructing the nomination process.\n  The few nominees who have not received our support are too extreme \nfor lifetime judicial appointments, and Mr. Pryor's nomination \nillustrates the problem. His views are at the extreme of legal \nthinking, and he does not deserve appointment to an appellate Federal \ncourt that decides so many cases involving basic legal rights and \nconstitutional protections. The people of the Eleventh Circuit deserve \na nominee who will follow the rule of law and not use the Federal bench \nto advance his own extreme ideology.\n  The issue is not that Mr. Pryor is conservative. We expect a \nconservative President from a conservative party to select conservative \nnominees. But Mr. Pryor has spent his career using the law to further \nan ideological agenda that is clearly at odds with much of the Supreme \nCourt's most important rulings over the last four decades, especially \nin cases that have made our country a fairer and more inclusive nation \nfor all Americans.\n  Mr. Pryor's agenda is clear. He is an aggressive supporter of rolling \nback the power of Congress to remedy violations of civil rights and \nindividual rights. He has urged the repeal of Section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act which helps to ensure that no one is denied the right to \nvote because of their race. He vigorously opposes the constitutional \nright to privacy and a woman's right to choose. He is an aggressive \nadvocate for the death penalty, even for persons with mental \nretardation. He dismisses--with contempt--claims of racial bias in the \napplication of the death penalty. He is a strong opponent of gay \nrights.\n  Somehow, despite the intensity with which Mr. Pryor holds thee views \nand the many years he has devoted to dismantling these legal rights, we \nare expected to believe that he will suddenly change course and \n``follow the law'' of he is confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit. \nRepeating that mantra again and again in the face of his extreme record \ndoes not make it credible. Actions speak louder than words, and I will \ncast my vote based on what Mr. Pryor does, not just on what he says.\n  Mr. Pryor's supporters say that his views have gained acceptance by \nthe courts, and that his views are well within the legal mainstream. \nBut actions paint a different picture. He has consistently tried to \nnarrow individual rights, far beyond what any court in this land has \nbeen willing to hold.\n  Just this past term, the Supreme Court rejected Mr. Pryor's argument \nthat it was constitutional for Alabama prison guards to handcuff \nprisoners to ``hitching posts'' for hours in the summer heat. The court \nalso rejected his argument that States could not be sued for money \ndamages when they violate the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  Mr. Pryor's position would have left workers who are fired in \nviolation of the Family and Medical Leave Act without a remedy.\n  The court rejected his argument that states should be able to \ncriminalize private sexual conduct between consenting adults.\n  The court rejected his far-reaching argument that counties should \nhave the same immunity from lawsuits that States have.\n  The court rejected his argument that the right to counsel does not \napply to defendants with suspended sentences of imprisonment.\n  The court rejected Mr. Pryor's view on what constitutes cruel and \nunusual punishment in the context of the death penalty. The court held, \ncontrary to Mr. Pryor's argument, that subjecting mentally retarded \npersons to the death penalty violated the Constitution.\n  Just this spring, even the Eleventh Circuit, a court already \ndominated by conservative Republican appointees, rejected Mr. Pryor's \nattempt to evade the Supreme Court's decision. Mr. Pryor tried to \nprevent a prisoner with an IQ of 65 from raising a claim that he should \nnot be executed, when even the prosecution agreed he was mentally \nretarded.\n  This is not a nominee even close to the legal mainstream. His actions \nin seeking to evade the Supreme Court's decision speak volumes about \nwhether he will obey its decisions if confirmed to the Eleventh \nCircuit.\n  Mr. Pryor and his supporters keep saying that he is ``following the \nlaw,'' but repeatedly he attempts to make the law, using the Attorney \nGeneral's office in his state to advance his own personal ideological \nplatform.\n  If, as his supporters urge, we look to Mr. Pryor's words in \nconsidering his nomination, we must review more than just his words \nbefore the committee at his confirmation hearing. We have a duty to \nconsider what Mr. Pryor has said about the Supreme Court and the rule \nof law in other context as well.\n  Mr. Pryor ridiculed the Supreme Court of the United States for \ngranting a temporary stay of execution in a capital punishment case. \nAlabama is one of only two States in the Nation that uses the electric \nchair as its only method of execution. The Supreme Court had agreed to \nhear the case to decide whether use of the electric chair was cruel and \nunusual punishment. Mr. Pryor, however, said the court should have \nrefused to consider this constitutional issue. He said the issue \n``should not be decided by nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit \non the Supreme Court.'' Those are his words, and they don't reflect the \nthoughtfulness that we want and expect in our judges. If Mr. Pryor does \nnot have respect for the Supreme Court, how can we possibly have any \nconfidence that he will respect that court's precedents if he is \nconfirmed to the Court of Appeals?\n  Finally, Mr. Pryor's nomination does not even belong on the Senate \nfloor at this time. His nomination was rushed through the Judiciary \nCommittee in clear violation of our committee rules on ending debate.\n  An investigation into Mr. Pryor's controversial role in connection \nwith the Republican Attorney Generals Association was interfered with \nand cut short by the committee majority and has never been completed. \nMost of our committee members agreed that the investigation raised \nserious questions which deserved answers in the committee, and they \ndeserve answers now, before the Senate votes. The Senate is entitled to \nwonder what the nominee's supporters have to fear from the answers to \nthese questions.\n  The fundamental question is why--when there are so many qualified \nattorneys in Alabama--the President chose such a divisive nominee? Why \nchoose a person whose record casts so much doubt as to whether he will \nfollow the rule of law? Why choose a person who can muster only a \nrating of partially unqualified from the American Bar Association? Why \nsupport a nominee who is unwilling to subject key facts in his record \nto the light of day?\n  We count on Federal judges to be open-minded and fair and to have the \nhighest integrity. We count on them to follow the law.\n  Mr. Pryor has a first amendment right to pursue his agenda as a \nlawyer or an advocate, but he does not have the open-mindedness and \nfairness essential to be a Federal judge. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst ending debate on this nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S14086]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14086-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, this morning I rise to talk about what \nhas been happening in this Chamber with regard to judicial nominations, \nand especially those nominations that have been put forward by the \nPresident with respect to the circuit courts.\n  The court of appeals is that branch in our Federal court system which \nis directly under the Supreme Court, an incredibly important place \nwhere a lot of judicial precedent is set.\n  We have had several judges being filibustered this year by the other \nside; just recently, Charles Pickering, a wonderful man with incredible \nqualifications, incredible political courage. With all the debate that \nhappened about him and his qualifications--people can check the \nCongressional Record for it--but the bottom line is this man deserves \nan up-or-down vote. If he is granted an up-or-down vote, he would be \napproved because he was able to get 54 votes against 43 negative votes. \nUnfortunately, there is a minority in the Senate choosing to \nfilibuster. That 54 votes should be enough to put him on the circuit \ncourt where he deserves to be.\n  I have no objection to people voting against judges. That is their \nright to do under the Constitution. But the Constitution specifically \nspells out only five instances where a supermajority is required in the \nSenate for approval, and moving to the consideration or the approval of \nthe President's judicial nominees is not on that list.\n  Why is this debate so important to have on whether we should allow \nthe Senate to filibuster judges or whether we should just have straight \nup-or-down votes on judges after a good amount of debate? If one side, \nmeaning one political party, chooses to filibuster judges, the other \nside is going to be forced to filibuster. In other words, a precedent \nis set.\n  Someday the Democrats will get back in power in the White House and \nwill be sending judges up to this body, and if they continue to \nfilibuster the President's nominees, a precedent will be set, and our \nside will have no choice but to filibuster their judges. The reason is \nvery simple: If they filibuster more conservative type judges, and we \ndo not filibuster theirs, our court system will just go further and \nfurther to the left.\n  Politics and the judiciary--we are supposed to try to separate those \nas much as possible, even though it is impossible to completely \nseparate them.\n  So, Madam President, I appeal to our colleagues on the other side \nthat this obstructionism purely for political gain is a dangerous \nprecedent to set in the Senate. We need to become statesmen in this \nbody and do what is right for our Republic. This is really about the \nfuture of our Republic. Judges and the third branch of our Government \nhave to have somewhat independence from the legislative branch and from \nthe executive branch. It is critical, I believe, that we have a fair \nprocess going forward.\n  The system really is broken at this point. Another problem we are \ngoing to face in the future by staging this political battle on judges \nis that good people are not going to want to go through the nomination. \nMiguel Estrada is the perfect example. He was an extraordinary nominee \nwho would have made an extraordinary judge and the ugliness this \nprocess has become resulted in him asking the President to withdraw his \nnomination. The toll of was too great on him and on his family. He \ncould not take it anymore.\n  If we continue to drag more nominees through this political mess, it \nis going to be harder to get good people, the kind of people we want \nserving on the bench.\n  I make this appeal to my colleagues: This nonsense going on with \nfilibustering circuit court judges needs to stop. I respect the fact \nthat Senators want complete debate. We should have full debate on \njudges. But once they have their full debate, their complete \ninvestigation, questions are asked and answered, then we need an up-or-\ndown vote, straight up-or-down vote. There is no place in the judicial \nnomination process for filibustering.

The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14086-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14086-S14087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTHY FORESTS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise to speak about the Healthy Forests \nlegislation which we recently passed on the Senate floor. Since we \npassed it--I remind everyone it was a strong bipartisan effort which \nresulted in 80 votes out of 100 votes in the Senate supporting this \neffort--we have now run into further procedural snags. As I was sitting \nhere listening to the Senator from Nevada talk about the snag we have \nrun into with regard to trying to get votes on judges, I was reminded \nof the similarity.\n  It took us a long time to get this bill to the Senate floor, the \nHealthy Forests legislation. The process we went through was one in \nwhich I believe we showed America how we should be working together in \na bipartisan fashion to cross party lines, cross regional lines, and \nbuild broad support for meaningful legislation to solve a serious \nproblem.\n  We did that. We had a bipartisan coalition that came forward with a \nstrong bill. I will talk a little bit about what the bill would mean to \nAmerica. We passed it in the Senate with 80 votes. Yet today we are \nstalled in being able to move forward and appoint conferees to get \ntogether with the House and work out the differences between the two \nbills and come forward with strong legislation.\n  Unfortunately, this procedural maneuver of stopping us from being \nable to move forward into a conference with the House is simply another \nmechanism similar to a filibuster. In fact, it might ultimately be \nbacked up by a filibuster to stop us from procedurally being able to \nmove forward on important legislation. In effect, it allows anybody who \nwants to to vote for the bill, knowing it is going to be stalled and \nthat we will not allow it to then go to conference and keep moving \nforward.\n  The Healthy Forests legislation is critically needed. I just received \nthe most recent analysis of the statistics. When we debated the bill, \nwe talked a lot about the damage going on in California with the \nwildfires then burning there. Just to remind everybody about what those \nfires meant, a study I have in front of me evaluates just 4 of the 13 \nfires that were burning in California last week as we considered the \nlegislation.\n\n  The estimated cost to date--which is not finished--of fighting just \nthose 4 fires is $65.8 million. That is 4 of the 13 fires in \nCalifornia. When you look at the rest of the country, as I discussed in \nthe debate last week, we have burned 3.8 million acres in America this \nyear. Last year it was nearly 7 million acres. The year before, it was \nover 3 million, and the year before that, it was over 7 million acres. \nThe running 9-year average for the number of acres we have burned in \nour forests is 4.9 million acres per year.\n  The Forest Service estimates over 100 million acres of forest lands \nare at unnaturally high risk of catastrophic wildfires and large \ninsect-disease outbreaks because of unhealthy forest conditions. Again, \njust looking at those 4 fires in California, $65.8 million worth of \ncost to fight them so far, 1,622 structures lost. We all know there \nwere many lives lost in those fires. There were lives lost in Idaho \nthis year fighting fires, my State. I am sure if other Senators from \nthe States in which these fires are burning could be here right now, \nthey would point out the damage in their States, not only from the cost \nof fighting the fires but in terms of the loss of life and the loss of \nproperty.\n  It is important we move ahead with this legislation. I am here to \ncall on my colleagues from the Democratic side of the aisle to work \nwith us again, as we worked in bringing forward the bill, to go into \nconference and work to achieve the objectives of this legislation.\n  Some have said: Let's just send our bill to the House and tell the \nHouse it must accept our bill. It is our bill or no bill.\n\n[[Page S14087]]\n\n  Frankly, our constitutional Framers set up a system of government in \nwhich there are two Houses of Congress: the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. I don't think it is realistic for the Senate to simply \nsay to the House you have to take our bill, and not only do you have to \ntake our bill, but we are not going to conference with you if you won't \ntake our bill as is.\n  I understand the desire by those who negotiated with us to reach the \ncompromise, to build a bipartisan solution, to try to keep the bill we \nnegotiated here intact to the maximum extent possible. In fact, in our \nnegotiations, I committed to them that is what my objective would be if \nI am able to be on the conference committee. I believe each one of our \nSenate conferees will fight to the best of their ability to make sure \nwe keep intact the Senate version of this bill. It was a good bill. It \nhad a strong vote. But we must recognize the reality that in order to \nachieve legislation in this country, both Houses of Congress are \nentitled to work on the final product.\n  The refusal to go into conference until there is an agreement in \nadvance that the House will take the Senate bill is a position which \ncould be taken on every bill. If you think about it, every piece of \nlegislation that goes through the Senate, one would think the Senators \nwould prefer over the House. People in the Senate could simply take the \nposition we will not go into conference with the House unless they will \ntake our version of the bill.\n  If you think about it a little further, it becomes immediately \napparent the House could do the same thing. The House could say to the \nSenate: We are not going to go into conference with you unless you take \nour bill.\n  The reality of the way our constitutional system operates is, we have \na conference committee between the House and Senate. We work out our \ndifferences. We try to come forward with a bill that brings forward the \nmaximum strengths of both systems. Then we come back to both bodies. \nThe Senators in the Senate, the Congressmen in the House, will each \nthen have another chance to register their opinion. If they believe \nthey didn't get a sufficient amount of what they were hoping to see in \nthe legislation, they, again, in the Senate, have the opportunity for a \nfilibuster or to simply vote no on the legislation if they don't want \nto support it. But to stop us from even being able to take the next \nprocedural step to go to the House and go into conference and try to \nsee what kind of legislation we can come up with to address these \ncritical issues is, in my opinion, inappropriate.\n  Again, I call on all my colleagues to step forward and allow us to \nmove to the next procedural step to go into conference with the House \nand work on this critical legislation.\n  What does it do? This legislation reflects a comprehensive effort to \nfocus on forest health. As I indicated, we have over 100 million acres \nin America today that are at an unnaturally high level of risk for fire \nor insect infestation.\n  The average loss of acres to fires alone is 5.4 million acres per \nyear. In this bill, we put together a comprehensive effort to improve \nthe health of our forests in terms of both the risk of fire and insect \ninfestation. We will lower the number of catastrophic fires. We will \nestablish new conservation programs to improve water quality and \nregenerate declining forest ecosystems. We will protect the health of \nthe forests by establishing an accelerated plan to promote information \non forest-damaging insects and related diseases. Endangered species, \ncommunity and homes of Americans will be safeguarded through the \nstewardship of these forest lands.\n  We are going to establish a new predecisional administrative review \nprocess and allow for additional analysis under NEPA. We are going to \nimprove the management tools available to our forest managers so they \ncan get scientifically supported management practices implemented on \nour forest lands.\n  We will direct the Secretary of Agriculture to give priority to \ncommunities and watersheds in hazardous fuel reduction projects. We are \ngoing to have language in there for the first time ever in this country \nthat specifically protects old-growth forests. We have language to \nexpedite the judicial review process so that we end the litigation \nparalysis that is probably the most significant thing that is stopping \nus from effective forest management implementation.\n  Finally, we are going to significantly increase the resources we are \nputting into healthy forest management. I just told the number of \ndollars we are spending on fighting fires--on the fires in California. \nThat was approximately $66 million. We are going to put in $760 million \nannually to help us manage our forests nationwide and preserve these \nincredible environmental gems for our future while maintaining our \nability to have the kind of natural-resource-based economies that grow \nup around our forests.\n  Madam President, this is a critical issue; it is critical whether one \nis concerned about environmental aspects, health and safety aspects, \nloss of life, loss of property, or simply the loss of our incredibly \nwonderful Federal forests.\n  Again, I call on my colleagues to stop the procedural maneuvers that \nare prohibiting us from proceeding to a conference with the House. At \nthis point, I will conclude my remarks and yield the remainder of my \ntime to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14087-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14087-S14090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CARE AND TREATMENT OF RETURNING GUARD AND RESERVE FORCES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, a couple of weeks ago we received reports \nfrom inquiring UPI reporter Mark Benjamin and a very active veterans \nadvocate Steve Robinson, director of the National Gulf War Resource \nCenter, that there was a significant problem with the care and \ntreatment of returning guardsmen and reserves coming back from Iraq and \nAfghanistan to Fort Stewart, GA. There were, at the time, indications \nthat some of the Guard and Reserve perceived they were not getting the \nsame priority of care, treatment, and housing as was received by those \nwho had been on active duty before they were sent to the combat \ntheater.\n  So working with my colleague, Senator Leahy, with whom I cochair the \nNational Guard caucus, we sent our military LAs to visit Fort Stewart, \nGA, and on to Fort Knox and Fort Campbell, KY. We wanted to visit other \nsites and will continue to visit other sites to see if the problems at \nFort Stewart were isolated or were they present at other Army \nmobilization and demobilization sites.\n  What Senator Leahy and I found is detailed in the report. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I don't have time to go over the entire \nreport, but I think many colleagues will find it of interest to know \nwhat we experienced.\n  First, let me say that the Army was very open and responsive to our \nstaff when they came to review the situation. They were most anxious to \nhave us get a complete look at the situation and to offer to help in \nany way they could. So they recognized there was a problem.\n  Basically, there are not enough medical personnel--doctors, \nclinicians, support staff, specialists--available during ``peak'' \nmobilization and demobilization phases at a number of mobilization \nsites. Consequently, injured and ill soldiers have a difficult time \nscheduling appointments with medical care providers and seeing the \nspecialists required to get the best possible care. Some of them had \nbeen waiting literally months to get the kind of care they deserve.\n  Compounding the problem, large numbers of soldiers either mobilizing \nor demobilizing created shortages of available housing at mobilization \nsites, which resulted in some of the returning guards and reservists \nbeing placed in housing totally inadequate for their medical condition. \nSome of these Guard and Reserve members who had been activated and were \ncoming back were put in temporary barracks, with outside latrines, \nwhere they normally would house Guard or Reserve members called up for \nsummer maneuvers.\n\n[[Page S14088]]\n\n  We could neither confirm nor deny that there was any difference in \nmedical treatment between the returning formerly Active and Guard and \nReserve soldiers coming back, but one of the things that was different \nwhen the Active came back to the bases from which they had been \nmobilized was that they already had their housing, so they could go \nback to the housing from which they started. The Guard and Reserve \ncoming back from service had to be put in some form of temporary \nhousing, which, in some instances, was clearly inadequate for people \nwith injuries or illnesses.\n\n  So what is being done? Senator Leahy and I issued the report to \nhighlight the problems to senior leaders at the Army, National Guard, \nand the Army Reserve. I was very encouraged by the response the \nmilitary gave us. The Acting Secretary of the Army, Les Brownlee, \nvisited Fort Stewart on Saturday, the weekend after we sent our teams \nthere. He met with me last week to lay out his plans for dealing with \nthe situation. He recounted what he discovered at Fort Stewart and \npromised swift support and changes, where necessary.\n  Specific issues addressed by Secretary Brownlee included the adequacy \nof facilities and where they would get treatment. He said, if \nappropriate, soldiers will be moved to facilities where they can \nprovide more timely care. We suggested that if they don't have the \nmedical personnel available there, why not send them someplace else. He \nsaid he would encourage the commands to contract out for special \nservices, such as MRIs, for example. If they don't have the equipment, \nthey can contract out.\n  I also asked the Secretary to allow soldiers in a medical hold status \nto be moved to facilities closer to their home, using military, \nveterans health administration, or civilian providers, as necessary. \nSecretary Brownlee told me some of the soldiers at Fort Stewart had \nalready been moved to nearby Fort Gordon, where the medical staff was \nnot so badly overworked. Also, at his direction, the Army Medical \nCommand is transferring medical care clinicians to mobilization sites \nthat need them.\n  The Secretary has also established minimum standards for housing in \nmedical hold status. He said, No. 1, facilities will be climate \ncontrolled, meaning air-conditioned and heated. Some of the facilities \ndidn't have that. Second, facilities must have showers and restrooms \nindoors, and not a path in the back, and facilities must be clean and \nin good repair. The Secretary also indicated he is considering erecting \nprefab facilities to alleviate the housing shortages during \nmobilization and demobilization surges that could be used to house \nmedical hold soldiers.\n  Secretary Brownlee has issued policy guidance that allows the Army to \ndeactivate Guard and Reserve personnel who do not meet the physical \nrequirements for deployment due to a preexisting condition. One of the \nproblems at Fort Stewart was the fact that some 10 percent of the Guard \nand Reserve called up had not had adequate pre-callup medical care, a \nsituation we are addressing with the TRICARE measures, and they could \nnot be deployed. They were then the responsibility of the Army at Fort \nStewart, and at the time we were there, a third of the 650 soldiers on \nmedical hold had never even been deployed because they did not meet the \nstandards for deployment. Those people will be sent home rather than \nkept on medical hold.\n  Also, after meeting with Secretary Brownlee, I followed up with LTG \nSteven Blum, Chief of the National Guard Bureau and LTG James Helmly, \nChief of the Army Reserve, asking them to work with the Army in \nresolving these issues. Specifically, we asked their cooperation:\n  No. 1, by doing a better job medically prescreening Guard and Reserve \nsoldiers so they do not activate soldiers who cannot serve.\n  No. 2, to coordinate the callup and retention of medical personnel--\nclinicians, support staff, specialists--to ensure the Army mobilization \nsites have sufficient medical personnel onsite.\n  I saw in the news today where the Department of Defense is looking to \ncall up certain support personnel from other Reserve units, other than \nthe Army, to provide perhaps naval medical personnel to assist with \ncaring for the sick and injured soldiers.\n  No. 3, we asked them to check on Guard and Reserve soldiers who are \non medical hold, making sure somebody was looking after them, to let \nthem know they have not been forgotten, or to find out if they have \nother needs.\n  Further, Senator Leahy and I have asked the GAO to conduct a survey \ninto the Army's medical hold process to ascertain the breadth of the \nproblems that we saw at Fort Stewart and Fort Knox, and to determine if \nthere is any disparity in medical treatment of returning guardsmen and \nreservists who come back in demobilization and have health care \nproblems.\n  It is our understanding that the Senate Armed Services Committee, as \nwell as its House counterpart, is going to conduct hearings into the \nconditions uncovered by Mark Benjamin and confirmed by Senator Leahy's \nand my investigation, but I regret very much, as all of us do, that \nthis situation has occurred. It is unacceptable to all of us to think \nthat injured, ill soldiers returning from the theater of battle would \nnot get the medical care they need, would not be placed in appropriate \nhousing.\n  Once it came to our attention and we brought it to the Army's \nattention, we are very encouraged by the way everybody is handling \nthis, from the garrison commanders and medical directors to \nmobilization staff to the Acting Secretary of the Army. This is a \nmatter of taking care of our soldiers regardless of whether they are \ntraditional active-duty soldiers or National Guard and Army Reserve \nsoldiers.\n  Senator Leahy and I are going to continue to monitor the progress of \nthe Army in addressing these issues. We plan on sending staff to \nadditional mobilization sites in the next few weeks and months to make \nsure there are no problems. We know that in the next few months the \nNational Guard and Reserve will be mobilizing thousands of additional \ntroops. We want to make sure the Army gets it right and keeps it right. \nThe next mobilization schedule is to begin in the January-April \ntimeframe, which means when they go, we want to make sure soldiers get \ntimely care and housing, suitable to getting well, no exceptions.\n  We know the Army knows of the problems and is aggressively tackling \nthem. We expect garrison commanders at mobilization sites to continue \nto do their best, and we will continue to support them, as well as \nevery soldier in the war on terrorism. We owe a great debt of gratitude \nto our fighting men and women. They have and deserve our highest regard \nand respect. We will do all we can to ensure they get the kind of care \nwe would expect for them.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                U.S. Senate National Guard Caucus Report\n\n       Senators Kit Bond and Patrick Leahy, co-chairs of the U.S. \n     Senate National Guard Caucus, dispatched their aides to Ft. \n     Stewart to investigate reports that activated Guard and \n     Reserve members were being poorly housed, with inadequate \n     medical attention, while on ``medical hold.''\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n        Approximately 650 members of the National Guard and the \n     Army Reserve who have answered the call-to-duty and in many \n     cases were wounded, injured or became ill while serving in \n     Iraq, are currently on medical hold at Ft. Stewart, GA. Army \n     base. As a result of an investigation by a reporter and \n     expeditious follow-up by a veteran service organization \n     representative it has come to our attention that these \n     National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers have been receiving \n     inadequate medical attention and counsel while being housed \n     in living accommodations totally inappropriate to their \n     condition. Of the roughly 650 injured soldiers currently \n     awaiting medical care and follow-up evaluations, \n     approximately one-third of these soldiers were found not \n     physically qualified for deployment and therefore never \n     deployed overseas. The remaining two-thirds deployed overseas \n     and were returned to Ft. Stewart as a result of wounds or \n     injuries sustained while serving or as the result of illness \n     encountered either before or after deployment. Regardless of \n     the nature of the medical malady, these soldiers have been \n     enduring unacceptable conditions for as many as 10 months.\n       The return of the 3rd Infantry Division from the Middle \n     East (18,000-strong which is permanently stationed at the \n     base), has forced commanders to lease barracks from the \n     Georgia National Guard that were designed as temporary \n     quarters for National Guard soldiers undergoing annual \n     training. They are not designed to accommodate wounded, \n     injured or ill soldiers awaiting\n\n[[Page S14089]]\n\n     medical care and evaluation. The Army has designed a \n     Disability Evaluation System that is purposely slow to ensure \n     that National Guard and Army Reserve citizen-soldiers who are \n     found not physically qualified for duty receive a fair and \n     impartial review when undergoing a medical evaluation board. \n     The process, similar in many respects to the workmen's \n     compensation process, requires that these soldiers be given \n     every opportunity to recover. If full recovery is not \n     possible, the system works to establish a baseline condition \n     before the soldier is evaluated by a medical evaluation \n     board.\n        The situation at Ft. Stewart unfortunately was, and \n     remains, hampered by an insufficient number of medical \n     clinicians and specialists, which has caused excessive delays \n     in the delivery of care. Exacerbating the situation, was the \n     Army's placement of wounded and injured soldiers in housing \n     totally unsuitable for their medical condition. Additionally, \n     these soldiers were placed under the leadership of soldiers \n     who were also injured, resulting in a situation where the \n     sick and injured were leading the sick and injured. \n     Furthermore, the perception among these soldiers is that the \n     traditional active duty soldier is receiving better care, \n     compounding an already deteriorating situation that had a \n     devastating and negative impact on morale. Most of the \n     soldiers in the medical hold battalion, which was established \n     administratively to provide a military structure for the \n     soldiers, have families living within hundreds of miles; yet \n     they have been unable to join their families while awaiting \n     the final deliberation of their cases.\n        In the short term, we must alleviate the unacceptable \n     conditions at Ft. Stewart and determine if the problem is \n     isolated to Ft. Stewart alone or part of a larger system wide \n     problem.\n        Alleviating the problem at Ft. Stewart will require the \n     immediate assignment of additional medical clinicians, \n     specialists and medical support personnel and/or the \n     transfer, where appropriate, of our National Guard and Army \n     Reserve soldiers to faculties close to their families so they \n     can continue to receive quality care and await further \n     medical reviews if necessary in an environment conducive to \n     healing. We must also ensure that the conditions at Ft. \n     Stewart are not replicated elsewhere, while ensuring the \n     fixes we install at Ft. Stewart are applied throughout the \n     Army if necessary. In the long term, the Congress must \n     address the physical readiness of the National Guard and the \n     Reserve by passage of a pending bill, TRICARE for Guard and \n     Reservists, to ensure that every member of the Guard and \n     Reserves has adequate health insurance coverage and is \n     medically ready to deploy.\n\n\n                          Fundamental Problem\n\n        More than 650 members of the National Guard and Army \n     Reserve, who have been activated and put on active duty (some \n     of whom have already served in Iraq or Afghanistan) are \n     currently on medical hold at Ft. Stewart, GA. These numbers \n     change almost daily as some soldiers are returned to duty, \n     others receive medical evaluations for medical conditions \n     that prohibit their continued service on active duty, while \n     more soldiers are brought into the system (the result of \n     sustaining injuries, wounds or falling ill overseas; or \n     failing to qualify for deployment after being mobilized \n     because of injuries or preexisting conditions.)\n        About one-third of the citizen-soldiers currently in the \n     disability evaluation system at Ft. Stewart could not \n     originally deploy with their units because they were not \n     medically fit, while approximately two-thirds were injured, \n     wounded or fell ill while on deployment overseas and were \n     returned stateside to receive special medical attention. When \n     the 3rd Infantry Division, which is based at Ft. Stewart, \n     returned from its deployment in Iraq, available housing was \n     in short supply which resulted in those on medical hold being \n     moved from one barracks to another in a form of musical \n     housing. The U.S. Army resorted to leasing open-bay barracks \n     with detached restroom facilities and no air-conditioning in \n     most cases, which are normally used to house Georgia National \n     Guard troops during their two weeks of annual training.\n        These National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers have been \n     kept in place at Ft. Stewart according to standard Army \n     policy while they await medical care and work-ups, which \n     senior officials say is designed to protect their careers \n     and ensure they receive the best medical care. The goal is \n     to put these medically held Reserve soldiers in a holding \n     pattern until they are healthy enough to return to duty \n     and go back to their units or to prevent soldiers from \n     being permanently discharged from service until the nature \n     of their conditions have been fully assessed and optimal \n     treatment regime prescribed. When soldiers cannot return \n     to duty, a final determination about their status is made \n     by a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB). The MEB process can \n     take anywhere from an average of 42 days to 76 days after \n     the soldier's treatment has been ``optimized.'' That is \n     when a sufficient diagnosis and treatment regime has been \n     put in place to establish enough confidence to make a \n     decision. Some troops have been on medical hold for more \n     than 10 months.\n       The primary task of the Army Medical Department is to \n     return these soldiers to duty. While undergoing medical care \n     and reviews they can be assigned light duty around the post. \n     Adequate convalescence requires a great deal of rest in most \n     cases and cannot be properly pursued if there are unnecessary \n     life stressors, such as placement in housing that is designed \n     to house ``healthy'' National Guard forces on annual \n     training--not injured, wounded or ill soldiers.\n       The barracks for these medically held National Guard and \n     Army Reservists are totally inappropriate for soldiers \n     injured, wounded or ill who are in need of quality care and \n     are garrisoned in a stateside Army installation. The worst \n     accommodations to which these medically challenged soldiers \n     were subjected are 1950s-style, concrete-foundation barracks \n     with no air-conditioning or insulation and detached toilets \n     and shower facilities, though they do have heat. On a \n     relatively cooler day in the area (October 22nd), the \n     temperature in one of these huts was noticeably warm if not \n     stifling. Bunks sit in open bays, no more three feet apart. \n     In some cases, there are no footlockers for the troops to \n     store their gear. In a few of the better barracks, for \n     soldiers with more severe medical conditions, there is air \n     conditioning, indoor-plumbing, and storage space.\n       The fundamental problem, as summarized colorfully by one of \n     the base commanders, is that soldiers are going through a \n     ``go slow medical review system while living in `get them the \n     hell out of here barracks.''' Many of the medically held \n     reservists--mostly from Southern states like Georgia, \n     Alabama, and Florida--expressed frustration and anger over \n     the duration of their medical hold and the quality of their \n     housing while in this seemingly interminable holding pattern.\n\n\n                          complicating factors\n\n       Feeding these justifiable frustrations are several real and \n     perceived considerations regarding their medical care and \n     treatment on the base.\n       There has been a shortage of clinicians and specialists to \n     see the medically held Reservists and to accelerate the \n     review and treatment process. At various points over the past \n     several months there may have been only a handful of doctors \n     to care for these hundreds of troops, as well as to assist \n     with regular forces and their families. Most reserve doctors \n     called to active duty were deployed forward, and those \n     remaining in the states can stay on duty for only 90 days \n     before returning to their civilian practices. One soldier on \n     medical hold said it took him almost three weeks to get a \n     follow-on appointment necessary to optimize his care.\n       Further feeding the anger and frustration is inadequate \n     leadership. Typically, a soldier will receive advice, \n     counsel, and assistance in accessing the military's health \n     system from the soldiers's unit or from upper echelon chain-\n     of-command. The units of the medically held reservists, \n     however, have deployed abroad in most cases, and their \n     commanders are focused on their operational mission overseas. \n     The Reservists at Ft. Stewart have been grouped together in a \n     ``medical hold'' battalion for administrative purposes but \n     the effectiveness of the unit chain of command is suspect.\n       Additionally, many of the battalion leaders--at the officer \n     and NCO level--are sick themselves, raising the question of \n     whether these leaders are capable to care for themselves, let \n     alone hundreds of their comrades. Without a familiar advisor \n     and leader, deployed away from home and their parent National \n     Guard or Army Reserve commands, and lacking experience \n     dealing with a huge bureaucracy like the Army, these \n     Reservists were left without the leadership to which they \n     were accustomed.\n       Moreover, many of the medically held Reservists perceive \n     bias against them on the post. Whenever they go the hospital, \n     PX, or dining hall, they are asked whether they are a \n     Reservist or a traditional active duty service member. This \n     question is made for accounting purposes, but it makes the \n     Reservists--many of whom are likely disappointed about being \n     on sick call in the first place--feel like they are being \n     singled out. Similarly, many of the medically held \n     Reservists, lacking sufficient knowledge of the military's \n     medical bureaucracy, chalk up delays in treatment to \n     preferential treatment for active forces.\n\n\n                         an avoidable situation\n\n       This situation could have been avoided. In early June, \n     medical and garrison staff realized that there would be a \n     surge in housing needs when the 3rd Infantry Division \n     returned from Iraq. The division was manned at over 115 \n     percent authorized strength, which would force commanders to \n     use triple bunks to accommodate 6500 troops in their barracks \n     that usually hold about 4300. These commanders recognized \n     then that these permanently assigned troops would have to \n     take priority over the troops temporarily at the post on \n     medical hold. Six weeks ago, medical staff submitted a \n     request up the chain-of-command for 18 additional care \n     providers who could help manage and accelerate the reviews of \n     the medical holds. No action was taken on the request.\n       At about the same time, the garrison commander submitted a \n     request to 1st Army Headquarters at Ft. MacPherson, Georgia, \n     for additional funds to renovate the barracks that are leased \n     from the Georgia National Guard. The command provided $4 \n     million, divided into two parts, but the prospective \n     contractors could not begin work until this week. That \n     project, which would have taken 90 days at the very least, \n     was postponed pending the outcome of the investigations the \n     Army has currently undertaken after media reports about the \n     medical hold situation surfaced.\n       Additionally, it is reported that the Army had the \n     opportunity in the initial stages of\n\n[[Page S14090]]\n\n     the mobilization process to provide for rear-detachment \n     elements staffed by National Guard personnel. These elements \n     are designed to provide stateside oversight and support to \n     National Guard personnel and units deployed overseas. Had \n     they been present it is possible the conditions described \n     herein might have been identified and rectified before they \n     reached a crisis point.\n\n\n              medical readiness of the guard and reserves\n\n       It is clear that part of the situation was created by the \n     fact that some of the mobilized reservists were not as \n     healthy as possible. Almost ten percent of Guard/Reserve \n     personnel mobilized for duty at Ft. Steward could not deploy \n     because of a medical condition and were put on medical hold \n     status for some period of time.\n       In the barracks visits, there were also troubling \n     indications that a handful of Reservists were knowingly \n     activated and sent to mobilize with medical conditions that \n     would preclude them from actually deploying. Such an \n     unjustified deployment might have been designed to take \n     advantage of the fact that once soldiers are activated (put \n     on active duty orders) they become the full-scale \n     responsibility of the U.S. Army. The service is then charged \n     with their care and feeding to include medical care and \n     medical evaluations.\n       The hundreds of Reservists who could not deploy because \n     they were medically unready raises a number of larger \n     questions, which the caucus has already begun to address \n     through its effort to ensure every member of the Guard and \n     Reserves has adequate health insurance. The caucus will \n     continue to address the issue in detail during its ongoing \n     investigation of the medical readiness and mobilizations, \n     examining questions like whether the resources and process \n     for screening at the unit level within the National Guard and \n     Army Reserve ranks are sufficient, and how to explain the \n     recall of soldiers to active duty who are not fit for duty.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       There are a number of actions that the Army must take to \n     address this situation at Ft. Stewart and the larger issue of \n     ``medical holds,'' which will continue to arise as the \n     country pursues the war against terrorism and sustains \n     operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas where \n     military forces are operating.\n       In the short term, the Army National Guard and the Army \n     Reserve must jointly provide for the leadership, guidance and \n     medical care our Reservists require to operate at maximum \n     proficiency. These dedicated and loyal soldiers need to know \n     what to expect in the medical review process. They need to \n     understand thoroughly the Army's health care system, warts \n     and all. This strong, steady leadership must have the goal of \n     reaffirming the Army's seamless support for the ``Army of \n     One'' and the country's gratitude for their service and \n     sacrifice, reassuring them that they are not forgotten \n     despite the fact they are separated from their units.\n       To move the Reservists along to a Medical Evaluation Board \n     if required, many more doctors need to be assigned to Ft. \n     Stewart and, specifically, to these cases. The biggest delay \n     in getting the Reservists off medical hold is the wait to \n     optimize care. Many soldiers are seeing a different doctor \n     every time they enter the hospital, each of whom may \n     prescribe a different remedy. Additional doctors and \n     specialists, who could help coordinate care, would provide \n     greater continuity-of-care, one of the central reasons to \n     keep them at their mobilization station in the first place.\n       It is unacceptable to have these citizen-soldiers--every \n     one of whom answered the call-to-duty--living in such \n     inadequate housing. However, more adequate barracks cannot be \n     completed quickly because it will take almost three months to \n     complete any upgrades. Other 3rd Infantry Division barracks \n     are unlikely to become available soon.\n       It would be far better to send these troops back home. They \n     could be assigned to another Military Treatment Facility \n     (MTF), a State Area Command (STARC) or possibly a VHA medical \n     facility closer to their families. Liaisons from the TRICARE \n     management authority could ensure that they are receiving \n     adequate care and that they would be available to return to \n     Ft. Stewart if they get better and can return to duty. The \n     benefit to morale among the medically held Reservists would \n     far outweigh any of the unlikely risks that might go along \n     with moving troops away from their mobilization station. \n     Current Army Regulation 40-501 directs medically held \n     soldiers to remain near their mobilization post, but there is \n     no statutory restriction against assigning them to another \n     facility close to home.\n       In the longer-term, the Army, working together with the \n     leadership of the National Guard and the Army Reserve, must \n     ensure that our citizen-soldiers who are identified for \n     activation are medically ready to deploy. Enactment of the \n     cost-share TRICARE proposal for Reservists, currently \n     attached to the Senate version of the Fiscal Year 2004 \n     Supplemental Spending Bill for Iraq and Afghanistan, would \n     ensure that every member of the Reserves has access to health \n     insurance and would increase the likelihood that citizen-\n     soldiers are medically and physically ready for duty.\n       Currently, reservists are required to complete a physical \n     once every five years. The high percentage of reservists \n     found to be physically unable to deploy raises the questions \n     of whether this five-year interval is too long. Another \n     question the Caucus may want to raise, is the Army's \n     mobilization and demobilization policy sufficient in \n     providing a housing standard for soldiers on medical hold? \n     Furthermore, is the working relationship between the Army's \n     medical department and the Veterans Health Administration \n     (VHA) structured to allow for the transfer of soldiers on \n     medical hold from Army military facilities to VHA facilities? \n     Also, new medical case management software included in the \n     second version of the military's Composite Health Care System \n     (CHCS II) will permit continuity-of-care wherever a soldier \n     accesses care. Guard and Reserve units across the country \n     could assign liaisons to help manage a Reservist's care and \n     maintain contact with their mobilization base at any point.\n       Lastly, it has been reported that architectural hardware \n     and software exist that will allow the Army to equip its \n     hospitals, dining halls, and commissaries with scanners that \n     could read an ID that can show whether a member of the \n     service is from the active component or the Reserves. Perhaps \n     the Caucus should look at such systems as a means of \n     addressing the perceived bias that exists when reservists are \n     queried about their service status.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Bond for his \nleadership on veterans issues throughout this Congress, as he always \ndoes. I have been over to Walter Reed Army Hospital on three different \noccasions. Families tell me they are being treated extremely well. The \nsoldiers are very complimentary of the health care they have received, \nbut there have been some problems.\n  It is important we make sure every soldier injured in the service of \nthe United States of America be given the best medical care, wherever \nhe or she is in this country.\n  I salute Senator Bond for his work in that regard. We want to make \nsure that happens. I believe it is happening, at least in the areas I \nhave personally examined. We will continue to monitor them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14090-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PRYOR, JR., TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 310, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of William H. \nPryor, Jr., of Alabama, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nEleventh Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes equally divided for debate on the nomination prior to the vote \non the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am pleased to be here today to seek \nan up-or-down vote on the attorney general of Alabama, Bill Pryor, who \nhas been nominated to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals of the \nUnited States of America. Chairman Hatch is, at this moment, chairing \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. He is not able to be here at this \nmoment, but he wants to make a statement because he feels very strongly \nthat Bill Pryor is an extraordinarily qualified individual, as I do.\n  I had the honor of having Bill Pryor work for me. I had not known him \nuntil shortly before I was elected attorney general of Alabama in 1994. \nI talked with him about coming to work with me. He had been with two of \nthe best law firms in Birmingham. He was a partner in a highly \nsuccessful law firm. He knew financially it would be a cut for him and \nhis family, but he decided to come to Montgomery to be chief of \nconstitutional and special litigation and to help improve the legal \nsystem in America.\n  As I have said before, I have not known a single individual in my \nhistory of practicing law who is more committed, more dedicated, has \nmore integrity about the issues that are important to the legal system \nof America, a man who is more committed to improving the rule of law in \nAmerica. Bill\n\n[[Page S14091]]\n\nPryor is that kind of person. He is a decent family man. He is a \nprincipled church man. He is a person who believes the law is something \nthat ought to be followed.\n  In fact, right now, he has found himself, as is his duty as attorney \ngeneral, to bring the case brought by the judicial inquiry commission \nin Alabama against Judge Moore, the chief justice of the Alabama \nSupreme Court, whom the judicial inquiry commission charged with not \ncomplying with a Federal court order. Here he is doing his duty again, \nas he has done time and again, even when it was not politically popular \nto do so. Even when conservative friends and Republican friends very \nmuch disapproved, he has tried to identify what the law is. He is \ncommitted to doing what the law says, and he has proven it time and \nagain.\n  Bill Pryor grew up in Mobile, AL. His father was band director at \nMcGill-Toolen High School, a wonderful Catholic high school in Mobile.\n  He was raised in the church. His mother taught at an African-American \nschool. His family considered themselves Kennedy Democrats in the \n1960s. That is the way he was raised. He went to law school at Tulane \nUniversity, one of America's great law schools. He graduated magna cum \nlaude at that fine law school, at the top of his class, and his fellow \nmembers of the Tulane Law Review elected him editor in chief, the \nfinest honor any graduating senior in a law school can obtain, to be \nnamed editor in chief of the Law Review. He did an extraordinary job \nwith that.\n  Upon his graduation, he applied for and was hired to be a law clerk \nfor the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the sister circuit to the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which he would sit on when he is \nconfirmed. He clerked for one of the legends of the Fifth Circuit, \nJudge John Minor Wisdom, who was probably, more than any other judge--\nJudge Rives, Judge Tuttle, and Judge Wisdom are the judges who have \nbeen credited with changing and breaking down the rules of segregation \nin the South during a very difficult period.\n  Judge Wisdom has always had the most superior law clerks. They come \nfrom all over the country, and yet he selected Bill Pryor, and Attorney \nGeneral Pryor remained a great admirer of Judge Wisdom.\n  I say that to say the charges that have been brought against him just \ndo not ring true. The things that are said about Bill Pryor do not \nreflect the man we know in Alabama, do not reflect the qualities of the \nindividual known in this State of Alabama by Democrats, Republicans, \nAfrican Americans, Whites, everybody in the State. They know him. They \nknow the quality of his integrity. They know his commitment to law. Of \nthat, they have no doubt. There is no doubt about this.\n  So what do we have? We have a group Senator Hatch often calls the \n``usual suspects.'' We have groups that are attack groups. They go into \npeople's records and backgrounds and they seek any way they can to \ndistort a person's record, caricature them as something they are not, \nand then come up to this Senate and ask us, based on distorted and \ndishonest information, to vote them down. That is not right.\n  What has been done to Bill Pryor and several other nominees who have \nbeen sent up here is not right. What we have been seeing is once these \ngroups all come together and they make their appeals to the leadership \non the other side, they have been given support on these nominations. \nThey have stuck together and blocked them. The minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, has led the Democratic Senators and they have blocked a series \nof highly qualified, superb nominees. That is very frustrating. I \nbelieve it is unfair.\n  I will share a few things that are relevant to this issue. The People \nfor the American Way is the group that has raised most of the issues. \nThey refer to him as a rightwing zealot, unfit to judge. How about this \nline: He personally has been involved in key Supreme Court cases that \nby narrow 5-to-4 majorities have hobbled Congress's ability to protect \nAmericans' rights.\n  If one reads that carefully, what they will see is that he, as \nattorney general of the State of Alabama, has been involved in \nlitigation in the United States Supreme Court that he prevailed on, \nthat he won. He has won a number of cases in the Supreme Court \ndefending interests of States, and States do have interests. A lot of \ntime we forget the interests of the States in America. We just willy-\nnilly pass legislation and then when somebody defends a State, as an \nattorney general is sworn to do--he is sworn to defend the laws of the \nState of Alabama, the constitution of the State of Alabama. And when \nthe Congress of the United States passes laws that abrogate those \nrules, if he has a legitimate case in court, he has not only a choice, \nhe has a duty to defend those laws against erosion by the national \nGovernment.\n\n  One law they have complained about and complained about incredibly \nwas that under the Americans with Disabilities Act, this Congress \nallowed people to sue the employer, but the historic document of \nsovereign immunity says one cannot sue States unless they authorize the \nsuit. The power to sue is the power to destroy a government. \nGovernments, since before our founding, have understood that doctrine. \nIt is a part of the law of every State in America, and Attorney General \nPryor said in that small number of cases that amount to 4 percent of \nthe complaints under the Americans with Disabilities Act, one could not \nsue the State of Alabama for damages. A person could sue to get their \njob back, they could sue to get promoted, but they just could not get \ndamages because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. He took it to \nthe Supreme Court and the Supreme Court agreed with him. When Senator \nMark Pryor from Arkansas was attorney general in Arkansas, he joined on \nthe brief. So this was not an extreme view; it was a prevailing view.\n  They said he was against disability rights. How disturbing that is. \nTo say Bill Pryor, who had a sworn obligation and did it to defend the \nState of Alabama legal rights, was somehow against the disabled is \nstunning to hear.\n  I want to mention a couple of things in regard to the type of \nbipartisan support he has gotten in Alabama. I mentioned earlier last \nnight the support he has gotten from a number of individuals of real \nprominence in the State. Dr. Joe Reed, the chairman of the Alabama \nDemocratic Conference, an arm of the Democratic Party of Alabama, has \nstrongly endorsed Mr. Pryor. Dr. Reed is a partisan Democrat. He sits \non the Democratic National Committee. I assure my colleagues all \nDemocratic candidates who seek to win a primary in Alabama, including \nPresidential candidates, call Dr. Reed when they are thinking about \ncoming to Alabama. They seek his support, because when he speaks, a lot \nof voters follow.\n  He said this about Mr. Pryor: A first-class public official, will be \na credit to the judiciary and a guardian of justice.\n  Mr. Alvin Holmes, probably the most outspoken African American in the \nlegislature, said this about Mr. Pryor:\n\n       I am a black member of the Alabama House of Representatives \n     having served for 28 years. During my time of service in the \n     Alabama House of Representatives I have led most of the \n     fights for civil rights of blacks, women, lesbians and gays \n     and other minorities. I consider Bill Pryor as a moderate on \n     the race issue.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       Finally, as one of the key civil rights leaders in Alabama \n     who has participated in basically every civil rights \n     demonstration in America, who has been arrested for civil \n     rights causes on many occasions, as one who was a field staff \n     member of Dr. Martin Luther King's SCLC, as one who has been \n     brutally beaten by vicious police officers for participating \n     in civil rights marches and demonstrations, as one who has \n     had crosses burned in his front yard by the KKK and other \n     hate groups, as one who has lived under constant threats day \n     in and day out because of his stand fighting for the rights \n     of blacks and other minorities, I request your swift \n     confirmation of Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit because of his \n     constant efforts to help the causes of blacks in Alabama.\n\n  He noted his help with the church bombing case, and he noted Bill \nPryor's early commitment that he would eliminate an old provision in \nthe Alabama constitution that prohibited interracial marriage. It had \nbeen there, been declared unconstitutional, but it was still in the \nconstitution. Bill Pryor believed it ought not to be in the \nconstitution. According to Mr. Alvin Holmes:\n\n       Every prominent white political leader in Alabama (both \n     Republican and Democrats) opposed my bill or remained silent \n     except Bill Pryor who openly and publicly asked the white and \n     black citizens of Alabama to vote and repeal such racist law. \n     He gives Bill Pryor all the credit for that.\n\n[[Page S14092]]\n\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee is here. He knows how much I love and respect and \nadmire Bill Pryor. I believe he has broad bipartisan support. He is a \nbrilliant lawyer, committed to the highest principles of justice in \nAmerica, committed to giving every American an equal right in court, \ncommitted to high ideals. He is a man of faith, a man who takes his \nfaith seriously, who is thoughtful but who has demonstrated that he \nwill follow the law even if it conflicts with his deepest and most \nsincere opinions.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time is available to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes was available to each side at \nthe beginning of the debate. The majority has 16\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How many?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen and a half minutes on the majority \nside.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Our side has 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand there is a request on the \nRepublican side to accommodate the scheduling, then, to have this vote \nat noon. One of the things I have learned in 29 years here is to always \ntry to accommodate other Senators on scheduling, for both parties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote be at 12, with the additional \ntime to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, only the Republican leadership can answer \nwhy it refuses to proceed on what all of us know are the real \npriorities--not hollow priorities--of the American people in these \nwaning days of the legislative session. We have a number of annual \nappropriations bills on which the Senate has yet to act. We do know the \nlaw requires us to finish those by September 30. We are now well into \nNovember and we have yet to act on them.\n  We should look at the purpose of some of these appropriations bills \nthat are being held up while we are wasting time trying to do things \nfor political points. We are holding up the appropriations for \nAmerica's veterans. What a bad time to send that signal, when our \nveterans, and many who are about to become our veterans, are serving so \nbravely in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We are holding up appropriations for law enforcement. As one who \nserved for 8\\1/2\\ years in law enforcement, I know how much our law \nenforcement people rely on those funds. We are holding up \nappropriations for the State Department. We are holding up \nappropriations for the Federal judiciary. We are holding up \nappropriations for housing. We are holding up appropriations for many \nother things. But we will talk and talk and talk about three or four \njudges.\n  There is unfinished business of providing a real prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors, but we will instead talk and try to make political \npoints. We have the Nation's unemployment, having seen for 8 years \nadding a million jobs a year, having seen in the last 2\\1/2\\ years \nlosing more than a million jobs a year. We talk about the economy \nimproving. Tell that to the American families who can't find a job, or \nfind two or three jobs because they are so low paying they are working \n80 hours a week and not having time to be with their children or their \nfamilies.\n  We see the corporate and Wall Street scandals, the mutual funds, and \nothers. Those concern those of us who have invested and placed our \ntrust and financial security at risk in the securities market. I think \nof a number of people in Vermont who are approaching retirement time \nand see these scandals where their money is being taken away and they \nsee a Senate unwilling or unable to move legislation addressing that.\n  Of course, we are not doing oversight on the war in Iraq. We are \nsigning blank checks, but we are not doing oversight.\n  Lowest Vacancy Rate in 13 Years: I mention this only because, instead \nof considering these very important matters--matters that seem to be \nneglected by both the White House and the Congress--Republican \nleadership insists on rehashing the debate on one of a tiny handful of \njudicial nominees in which further Senate action is unlikely. \nCertainly, when the Republican leadership was considering the judicial \nnominees of a Democratic President in the years 1995 to the year 2000, \nthey showed no concern about stranding more than 60--let me repeat \nthat, more than 60--of President Clinton's judicial nominees without \nhearings or votes. They did not demand an up-or-down vote on every \nnominee. They were content to use anonymous holds to scuttle scores of \nnominees.\n  This is not a question of having a filibuster or a cloture vote. If \none member, just one member of the Republican caucus objected to one of \nPresident Clinton's nominees, they didn't have to stand up here and say \nso. They could just let their side know and the person was never given \na hearing, never given a vote.\n  There were numerous extraordinarily well-qualified people. In fact, \nthey stood by while vacancies rose from 65 in January 1995 when the \nRepublicans took over the majority, to 110 when Democrats assumed \nSenate leadership in the summer of 2001. Republicans presided over the \ndoubling of circuit court vacancies from 16 to 33 during that time by \nsimply refusing to allow President Clinton's nominees to have a vote. \nAs I said, over 60 of them were never allowed to have a vote.\n  McCarthyite Smears: So why do they insist that the Senate now consume \nthis precious floor time to rehash the debate on one of the President's \nmost controversial nominees to the independent Federal judiciary, the \nnomination of William Pryor? Perhaps it is to give some on the \nRepublican side another chance to continue to make false arguments \nabout judicial nominations. Perhaps it is to give some platform for \nbaseless and McCarthyite accusations that Senators oppose Mr. Pryor \nbecause of his religion.\n  This is the worst of religious McCarthyism I have heard, although \nthere are aspects that are actually amusing. We had one of these \nRepublicans go on a Sunday morning show, I guess, to accuse me of being \nanti-Catholic. When asked about it, we responded I didn't see it \nbecause my wife and I were at Mass, as we are on every Sunday morning, \nand that was when the program was on. But I suspect it is to distract \nfrom the real concerns that affect Americans every day.\n  The facts show the Senate has made progress on judicial vacancies in \nthose areas where the administration has been willing to work with the \nSenate. Yesterday, the Senate confirmed the 168th of President Bush's \njudicial nominees.\n  Incidentally, I should point out, of that 168, 100 of them were \nconfirmed during the 17 months the Democrats controlled the Senate, and \nI was chairman; 68 of them during the 17 months the Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate.\n  It is kind of hard to say we are partisan on this when in 17 months \nwe confirmed 100 of the President's nominees and in the 17 months the \nRepublicans confirmed 60. Actually, we could have confirmed several \nmore had the Republican leadership just scheduled votes on these \nnoncontroversial nominations. The truth is, in less than 3 years' time \nthe number of President Bush's judicial nominees the Senate has \nconfirmed has exceeded the number of judicial nominees confirmed for \nPresident Reagan, who was the all-time champ to get judges confirmed in \nthe first 4 years in office. Everybody acknowledges that President \nReagan had more judges confirmed in his first 4 years than any \nPresident ever had in the Republican-controlled Congress and \nRepublican-controlled Senate. He confirmed more judges in 4 years than \nanybody else until President Bush, who has had 7 more Federal judges \nconfirmed in less than 3 years than President Reagan did in 4.\n  To give you some idea, here are the Clinton nominees over a period \nof, actually, 5 years: 248 were confirmed, and 63 of them were blocked \nby the Republicans--63. Some are ones where we had cloture votes and we \nwon on the cloture votes and got them through. Twenty percent of \nPresident Clinton's nominees were blocked by the Republican-controlled \nSenate.\n  Between 2001 and 2003, President Bush sent 16 through, and 4 were \nblocked; or 2 percent were blocked. Actually, 2 percent is pretty \ndarned good.\n\n[[Page S14093]]\n\n  Look at what has happened on vacancies when the Republicans were in \nthe majority. Look at how vacancies skyrocketed because they were \nblocking usually by a one-person anonymous filibuster. President \nClinton's nominee vacancies skyrocketed. During the 17 months when I \nwas chairman and the Democrats were in the majority, look at how we \nquickly brought down those vacancies of all of President Bush's \nnominees. Ironically, President Bush nominated people to fill vacancies \ncreated because the Republicans refused to allow President Clinton's \nnominees to go through. Of course, they continue to go down.\n  If debates like this are staged to give some a platform for repulsive \nsmears that Democrats are opposing Mr. Pryor because of his religion, \nthey will have to enter a realm of demagoguery, repeating false \nallegations and innuendo often enough to hope that some of their mud \nwill stick.\n  Senate Democrats oppose the nomination of William Pryor to the \nEleventh Circuit because of his extreme some, with good reason, use the \nword ``radical''--ideas about what the Constitution says about \nfederalism, criminal justice and the death penalty, violence against \nwomen, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Government's \nability to protect the environment on behalf of the American people. Of \ncourse, those substantive concerns will not do much to help raise money \nfor the Republican Party or seem provocative in a flyer placed on \nwindshields late on the day before an election and hardly get a mention \non the evening news. So some Republican partisans will be putting the \ntruth to one side. They dismiss the views of Democratic Senators doing \ntheir duty under the Constitution to examine the fitness of every \nnominee to a lifetime position on the Federal bench and choose, \ninstead, to use smears and the ugliest accusations they could dream up.\n  This started in the aftermath of the first rejection of the Pickering \nnomination in the Judiciary Committee. After the committee voted not to \nrecommend him to the full Senate, insinuations were made on this Senate \nfloor that Democrats opposed him because he is a Baptist. From that \ntime to now, I have waited patiently for Republican Senators to disavow \nsuch charges which they know to be untrue.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee \ntrotted out an offensive cartoon targeting a nominee, and asked us to \ndenounce it. Even though it was taken off a website run by two private \nindividuals, of whom I had never heard before and who have no \nconnection to Democratic Senators, we appropriately denounced it \nwithout hesitation.\n  Abusing Religion For Wedge Politics: But when slanderous accusations \nwere made by Republican Senators, and ads run by a group headed by the \nPresident's father's former White House counsel and a group whose \nfunding includes money raised by Republican Senators and even by the \nPresident's family, no apologies or denunciations were heard. Other \nRepublican members of the Judiciary Committee and of the Senate have \neither stood mute in the face of these McCarthyite charges, or, worse, \nhave fed the flames.\n\n  These accusations are harmful to the Senate and to the Nation and \nhave no place in this debate or anywhere else. Just a few weeks ago, \nPresident Bush rightly told the Prime Minister of Malaysia that his \ninflammatory remarks about religion were ``wrong and divisive.'' He \nshould say the same to members of his own party. Today, Republican \nSenators have another chance to do what they have not yet done and what \nthis Administration has not yet done: Disavow this campaign of division \nwaged by those who would misuse religion by playing wedge politics with \nit. I hope that the Republican leadership of the Senate will finally \ndisavow the contention that any Senator is being motivated in any way \nby religious bigotry.\n  An Extreme and Divisive Nominee: Let us take William Pryor. Many of \nus opposed his nomination to the Eleventh Circuit because of his \nextreme--in fact, some would view radical--ideas about what the \nConstitution says about federalism and what the Constitution says about \ncriminal justice and the death penalty, his views about violence \nagainst women, or the Americans With Disabilities Act, or the \nGovernment's ability to protect the environment on behalf of all \nAmerican people--not just the environment to protect just Republicans \nor just Democrats but all Americans.\n  I am stunned as I read and reread reports. Just to see how radical \nhis ideas are, just today I learned of the sworn affidavits made under \noath by the former Republican Governor of Alabama, Bob James and his \nson. They explained the circumstances under which Governor James came \nto appoint Mr. Pryor as attorney general. We keep hearing about how \nAttorney General Pryor just looks at the law, he will just stand by the \nlaw, and he will call them as he sees them. In sworn affidavits, the \nGovernor who appointed him said Mr. Pryor was only hired after making \nexplicit promises--explicit promises--that he would defy court orders \nup through and including orders of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  This is a man we want to give a lifetime tenure on the court of \nappeals, which is one step below the United States Supreme Court; \nsomebody who would take a job where he has made promises that he would \ndefy court orders, including the Supreme Court of the United States; a \nperson who takes an oath to uphold the Constitution but says give me \nthe job and don't worry about that oath, I promise I will defy them.\n  These statements were made under the penalty of perjury by a former \nRepublican Governor of Alabama. He recounts how Mr. Pryor persuaded him \nthat he was right for the job by showing them research papers from his \ntime in law school about nonacquiescence in court orders. Indeed, the \nGovernor and his son say that Mr. Pryor's position on defying court \norders changed only when he decided he wanted to become a Federal \njudge.\n  I have been here 29 years. I don't remember any President, Republican \nor Democratic, who would think of sending up a nominee who has told \npeople he will get his job with a promise that he will defy courts. \nThis is so violative of even what Mr. Pryor said in sworn statements \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Assuming that the sworn statement of the former Republican Governor \nof Alabama and his son are true, this information is consistent with \nextremism.\n  Elsewhere, Mr. Pryor's record is shocking. I cannot imagine any \nPresident--I have been here with six Presidents, Republican and \nDemocrat--who would send somebody up here with that kind of a record.\n  I pride myself in voting for nominees of Presidents. President Ford, \nPresident Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, President \nClinton, and even the current President Bush, I probably have voted for \n98 or 99 percent of all the nominations. But this is one that never \nshould even have come to us. It is not a question of whether to vote it \nup or down--it shouldn't even be here. In fact, the President ought to \nwithdraw this nomination because, if this affidavit of Governor James \nis true--and he did make it under pain of penalty of perjury--that \nmeans Mr. Pryor sat with Governor James and promised to undermine the \nvery basis of the stability of the United States Government and its \nlegal system.\n  I don't understand how any Senator, Republican or Democrat, can \ncontinue to support this nomination.\n  There are a whole lot of other reasons.\n  Again, I cannot believe any President would send a nominee here who \nhas done this.\n  There are some other reasons he shouldn't be a judge on the Eleventh \nCircuit. These reasons have prompted a chorus of opposition of \nindividuals and organizations and editorial pages across the Nation, \nthe South, the East, and the West. Organizations and individuals \nconcerned about justice before the Federal courts include Log Cabin \nRepublicans, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Alliance for \nJustice, and many others have provided the committee with their \nconcerns and bases for their opposition. We have received letters of \nopposition from organizations that rarely take positions on nominations \nwho feel strongly about this one and are compelled to write, including \nthe National Senior Citizens Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, Sierra \nClub, and others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of all of the letters that have \nbeen sent\n\n[[Page S14094]]\n\nin opposition to Mr. Pryor's confirmation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of Bill Pryor, to the 11th \n                        Circuit Courts of Appeal\n\n\n                           elected officials\n\n     Congressional Black Caucus\n\n\n                     civil rights movement veterans\n\n     Rev.

Madam President, the ABA indicates concern about this \nnomination. The Standing Committee of the Federal Judiciary gave Mr. \nPryor a partial rating of not qualified to sit on the Federal bench. \nAnd indications from these peer reviews have been enough to raise red \nflags in the confirmation process.\n  Let me talk about some more of the reasons we oppose William Pryor. \nLike Jeffrey Sutton, Mr. Pryor has been a crusader for the federalist \nrevolution, but Mr. Pryor has taken an even more prominent role. Having \nhired Mr. Sutton to argue several key federalism cases in the Supreme \nCourt, Mr. Pryor is the principal leader of the federalist movement, \npromoting state power over the Federal Government. A leading proponent \nof what he refers to as the ``federalism revolution,'' Mr. Pryor seeks \nto revitalize state power at the expense of Federal protections, \nseeking opportunities to attack Federal laws and programs designed to \nguarantee civil rights protections. He has urged that Federal laws on \nbehalf of the disabled, the aged, women, minorities, and the \nenvironment all be limited.\n  Limiting Worker And Environmental Protections: He has argued that the \nFederal courts should cut back on the protections of important and \nwell-supported Federal laws including the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, the Clean Water Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act. He has repudiated decades of legal \nprecedents that permitted individuals to sue states to prevent \nviolations of Federal civil rights regulations. Mr. Pryor's aggressive \ninvolvement in this ``federalist revolution'' shows that he is a goal-\noriented, activist conservative who has used his official position to \nadvance his ``cause.'' Alabama was the only state to file an amicus \nbrief arguing that Congress lacked authority to enforce the Clean Water \nAct. He argued that the Constitution's Commerce Clause does not grant \nthe Federal Government authority to prevent destruction of waters and \nwetlands that serve as a critical habitat for migratory birds. The \nSupreme Court did not adopt his narrow view of the Commerce Clause \npowers of Congress. While his advocacy in this case is a sign to most \npeople of the extremism, Mr. Pryor trumpets his involvement in this \ncase. He is unabashedly proud of his repeated work to limit \nCongressional authority to promote the health, safety and welfare of \nall Americans.\n  Mr. Pryor's passion is not some obscure legal theory but a legal \ncrusade that has driven his actions since he was a student and \nsomething that guides his actions as a lawyer. Mr. Pryor's speeches and \ntestimony before Congress demonstrate just how rooted his views are, \nhow much he seeks to effect a fundamental change in the country, and \nhow far outside the mainstream his views are.\n  Mr. Pryor is candid about the fact that his view of federalism is \ndifferent from the current operation of the Federal Government and that \nhe is on a mission to change the Government to fit his vision. His goal \nis to continue to limit Congress's authority to enact laws under the \nFourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause--laws that protect women, \nethnic and racial minorities, senior citizens, the disabled, and the \nenvironment--in the name of sovereign immunity. Is there any question \nthat he would pursue his agenda as a judge on the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals--reversing equal rights progress and affecting the \nlives of millions of Americans for decades to come?\n  Mr. Pryor's comments have revealed insensitivity to the barriers that \ndisadvantaged persons and members of minority groups and women continue \nto face in the criminal justice system.\n  Attacking the Voting Rights Act: In testimony before Congress, Mr. \nPryor has urged repeal of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act--the \ncenterpiece of that landmark statute--because, he says, it ``is an \naffront to federalism and an expensive burden that has far outlived its \nusefulness.'' That testimony demonstrates that Mr. Pryor is more \nconcerned with preventing an ``affront'' to the states' dignity than \nwith guaranteeing all citizens the right to cast an equal vote. It also \nreflects a long-discredited view of the Voting Rights Act. Since the \nenactment of the statute in 1965, every Supreme Court case to address \nthe question has rejected the claim that Section 5 is an ``affront'' to \nour system of federalism. Whether under Earl Warren, Warren Burger, or \nWilliam Rehnquist, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that \nguaranteeing all citizens the right to cast an equal vote is essential \nto our democracy--not a ``burden'' that has ``outlived its \nusefulness.''\n\n  His strong views against providing counsel and fair procedures for \ndeath row inmates have led Mr. Pryor to doomsday predictions about the \nrelatively modest reforms in the Innocence Protection Act to create a \nsystem to ensure competent counsel in death penalty cases. When the \nUnited States Supreme Court questioned the constitutionality of \nAlabama's method of execution in 2000, Mr. Pryor lashed out at the \nSupreme Court, saying, ``[T]his issue should not be decided by nine \noctogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.''\n  Aside from the obvious disrespect this comment shows for the Nation's \nhighest court, it shows again how results-oriented Mr. Pryor is in his \napproach to the law and to the Constitution. Of course, an issue about \ncruel and unusual punishment ought to be decided by the Supreme Court. \nIt is addressed in the Eighth Amendment, and whether or not we agree on \nthe ruling, it is an elementary principle of constitutional law that it \nbe decided by the Supreme Court, no matter how old its members.\n  Mr. Pryor has also vigorously opposed an exemption for persons with \nmental retardation from receiving the death penalty, exhibiting more \ncertainty than understanding or sober reflection. He authored an amicus \ncuriae brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the Court should not \ndeclare that executing mentally retarded persons violated the Eighth \nAmendment. After losing on that issue, Mr. Pryor made an unsuccessful \nargument to the Eleventh Circuit that an Alabama death-row defendant is \nnot mentally retarded.\n  Mr. Pryor has spoken harshly about the moratorium imposed by former \nIllinois Governor George Ryan, calling it a ``spectacle.'' Can someone \nso dismissive of evidence that challenges his views be expected to hear \nthese cases fairly? Over the last few years, many prominent Americans \nhave begun raising concerns about the death penalty, including current \nand former supporters of capital punishment. For example, Justice \nO'Connor recently said there were ``serious questions'' about whether \nthe death penalty is fairly administered in the United States, and \nadded: ``[T]he system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to \nbe executed.'' In response to this uncertainty, Mr. Pryor offers us \nnothing but his obstinate view that there is no problem with the \napplication of the death penalty. This is a position that is not likely \nto afford a fair hearing to a defendant on death row.\n  Mr. Pryor's troubling views on the criminal justice system are not \nlimited to capital punishment. He has advocated that counsel need not \nbe provided to indigent defendants charged with an offense that carries \na sentence of imprisonment if the offense is classified as a \nmisdemeanor. The Supreme Court nonetheless ruled that it was a \nviolation of the Sixth Amendment to impose a sentence that included a \npossibility of imprisonment if indigent persons were not afforded \ncounsel.\n  Like Carolyn Kuhl, Priscilla Owen and Charles Pickering, Mr. Pryor is \nhostile to a woman's right to choose. There is every indication from \nhis record and statements that he is committed to reversing Roe v. \nWade. Mr.\n\n[[Page S14096]]\n\nPryor describes the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade as the \ncreation ``out of thin air [of] a constitutional right,'' and opposes \nabortion even in cases of rape or incest.\n  Mr. Pryor does not believe Roe is sound law, neither does he give \ncredence to Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He has said that ``Roe is not \nconstitutional law,'' and that in Casey, ``the court preserved the \nworst abomination of constitutional law in our history.'' When Mr. \nPryor appeared before the Committee, he repeated the mantra suggested \nby White House coaches that he would ``follow the law.'' But his \nwillingness to circumvent established Supreme Court precedent that \nprotects fundamental privacy rights seems much more likely.\n\n  Mr. Pryor has expressed his opposition to fair treatment of all \npeople regardless of their sexual orientation. The positions he took in \na brief he filed in the recent Supreme Court case of Lawrence v. Texas \nwere entirely repudiated by the Supreme Court majority just a few \nmonths ago when it declared that: ``The petitioners are entitled to \nrespect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their \nexistence or control their destiny by making their private conduct a \ncrime.'' Mr. Pryor's view is the opposite. He would deny certain \nAmericans the equal protection of the laws, and would subject the most \nprivate of their behaviors to public regulation.\n  A record of activism: On all of these issues--the environment, voting \nrights, women's rights, gay rights, federalism, and more--William \nPryor's record of activism and advocacy is clear. That is his right as \nan American citizen, but it does not make him qualified to be a judge. \nAs a judge it would be his duty to impartially hear and weigh the \nevidence and to impart just and fair decisions to all who come before \nthe court. In their hands, we entrust to the judges in our independent \nFederal judiciary the rights that all of us are entitled to enjoy \nthrough our birthright as Americans.\n  The President has said he is against what he calls ``judicial \nactivism.'' How ironic, then, that he has chosen several of the most \ncommitted and opinionated judicial activists ever to be nominated to \nour courts.\n  The question posed by this controversial nomination is not whether \nMr. Pryor is a skilled and capable politician and advocate. He \ncertainly is. The question is whether--not for a 2-year term, or a 6-\nyear term, but for a lifetime--he would be a fair and impartial judge. \nCould every person whose rights or whose life, liberty or livelihood \nwere at issue before his court, have faith in being fairly heard? Could \nevery person rightly have faith in receiving a just verdict, a verdict \nnot swayed by or yoked to the legal philosophy of a self-described \nlegal crusader? To read Mr. Pryor's record and his extreme views about \nthe law is to answer that question.\n  The President has chosen to divide the American people, the people of \nthe Eleventh Circuit, and the Senate with this highly controversial \nnomination. He should clean the slate and choose a nominee who can \nunite the American people.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from New York on the Senate \nfloor. Would he seek time?\n  I yield the floor. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Twenty-three minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President. I thank our great leader of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Pat Leahy, leader on our side, for his \nstalwart defense of having a mainstream Judiciary and for his \nleadership on so many other issues.\n  I will note what we all start by noting: We have now confirmed 168 of \nthe President's nominees and opposed 4. The President is getting his \nway 98 percent of the time on judicial nominations. To say that is \nobstructionism is to rewrite Webster's Dictionary. We have bent over \nbackwards to be fair.\n  In fact, in many of our States, including my own State of New York, \nwhen the President and the White House ask for an agreement, we do \nagree; we are in the process of filling every vacancy in New York. I \ndon't agree with many of the judges we are nominating on particular \nissues but they meet the fundamental test. The only litmus test I have \nis not on any one issue but, rather, will the judge interpret the law, \nnot make it. That is what the Founding Fathers wanted judges to do in \ntheir infinite wisdom. I say ``infinite'' because my hair stands on \nedge; the longer I am around, the more I respect the wisdom of our \nFounding Fathers. In their infinite wisdom, they wanted judges to \ninterpret law, not make it; they wanted the Senate, in its infinite \nwisdom, to be a check--a real check, not a rubberstamp--on the \nPresident's power to nominate. The Senate is a cooling saucer.\n  The other side says, let the majority rule. We know what will happen. \nEvery single one of the President's nominees, so many chosen through \nideological prisms, will be approved. I don't think we have had a \nsituation, since the President has nominated anyone--I may be wrong--\nwhere a single Republican opposed any of the President's nominees. Is \nthat the open, grand debate the Founding Fathers envisioned? I may be \noff by an instance here and an instance there, but I am sure if you \ntabulate all the votes taken by Republicans on all of the nominees, the \nnumber of ``no'' votes, the percentage of ``no'' votes, is \ninfinitesimal.\n  Yes, we are blocking judges by filibuster. That is part of the \nhallowed process around here of the Founding Fathers saying the Senate \nis the cooling saucer. We do not work as quickly as the House. We are \nnot as restricted as the House. That is how it was intended to be. I \ndon't believe in tit for tat. This is not a tit-for-tat comment, but \nthe other side did not even let 50 judges come up for a vote in \ncommittee. They blocked a far higher percentage of President Clinton's \njudges than we have blocked of President Bush's judges.\n  The means is not the issue here; it is the end. So that is how it is. \nWe have been very careful when we have opposed nominees. We have tried \nto give the President--it makes sense to do it--the benefit of the \ndoubt. But some nominees are so far out of the mainstream, it is so \nclear they are going to make law, not interpret law, that we believe it \nis our constitutional obligation to our country and to the next \ngeneration of Americans to oppose them. Mr. Pryor is one of those \nnominees.\n  What the other side has tried to do is two types of things. One, they \nsay we are opposing someone because of their race or sex, his or her \nreligion. Those are cheap shots. We are opposing people because they \nare ideologically out of the mainstream, without any discrimination. If \nthey are Black and out of the mainstream, or a woman and out of the \nmainstream, or Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish and out of the \nmainstream, we are going to oppose them.\n\n  The second thing they try to do is say it is because of one \nparticular issue. There is a litmus test on Justice Brown; they are \nsaying it is on affirmative action. On Attorney General Pryor, they are \nsaying it is because of the issue of abortion.\n  Let's look at the record. I, myself, Senator Leahy, and just about \nevery Democrat have voted for a majority of judges who disagree with \nour views on affirmative action and abortion. The number of judges I \nhave voted for who are pro-life in the last 2 years far exceeds the \nnumber I have voted for who are pro-choice. That demolishes any \nargument of a litmus test. I have not asked too many judges their views \non affirmative action, but my guess is, how ideologically driven the \nPresident's nominees are, that I have voted for a large number of \nnominees who disagree with my view on affirmative action as well. But \nit is not a litmus test. It is again a question, Will they make law or \nwill they interpret law?\n  If we look at Attorney General Pryor's record, he is not a mainstream \nconservative. He is far out of the mainstream. Let me give some \nexamples.\n  On criminal justice issues, I tend to be conservative. I tend to \nagree often with my Republican colleagues on criminal justice and other \nsuch issues. But, again, there are limits. He defended his State's \npractice of handcuffing prisoners to hitching posts in the hot Alabama \nsummer for 7 hours\n\n[[Page S14097]]\n\nwithout giving them a drop of water to drink, and when the conservative \nsupreme court said this violated the 8th amendment ban on cruel and \nunusual punishment, he criticized the court's decision, saying they \nwere applying their ``own subjective views on the appropriate methods \nof prison discipline.''\n  How about States rights? Attorney General Pryor has been one of the \nstaunchest advocates of the Reagan court's efforts to roll back the \nclock not just to the 1930s but to the 1890s. He is an ardent supporter \nof an activist Supreme Court agenda cutting back Congress's power to \nprotect women, workers, consumers, the environment, and civil rights.\n  As Alabama attorney general, why was he the only one of 50 attorneys \ngeneral urging the Supreme Court to undo significant portions of the \nViolence Against Women Act? The Violence Against Women Act is not out \nof the mainstream. In fact, it has overwhelming support from both \nparties. But here is Pryor, way beyond.\n  How about on the case of child welfare? At the same time he was \nconceding that Alabama had failed to fulfill the requirements of a \nFederal consent decree regarding the operation of the State's child \nwelfare system, he was demanding that the State be let out of the deal. \nIt is not so much the position he took but the comments he made \nafterward. Attorney General Pryor said:\n\n       My job is to make sure the State of Alabama isn't run by \n     federal courts. . . . My job isn't to come here and help \n     children.\n\n  I wonder how many Alabamians would agree with that statement.\n  When it comes to the environment, more of the same concerns. We have \nhad a consensus for 40 years that the Constitution allows the Federal \nGovernment to regulate interstate waters. Not Attorney General Pryor--\nagain, the lone attorney general to file an amicus brief arguing the \nConstitution does not give the Federal Government the power to regulate \ninterstate waters. He took this position despite decades of precedent \nand the Federal Clean Water Act, standing for the contrary position.\n  He has been probably the staunchest advocate of States rights of all \nthe attorneys general, of the ability of the States to do what they \nwant and the Federal Government cannot tell them what to do. But then, \nall of a sudden, when the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore made a decision \nthat overruled the State of Florida, only one attorney general \nintervened on behalf of either side; 49 attorneys general, whatever \ntheir views, had the good sense not to intervene in that highly charged \ncase. Not Attorney General Pryor. It is so contrary to everything he \nbelieved in, everything else, that when he says, I will interpret the \nlaw--which he has stated before us; every nominee does, and some do, \nand some don't, and we have to make a judgment whether, when they say \nit to us, it will actually happen. As we all know, once we appoint \nthem, the horse is out of the barn--lifetime appointment; they are \nthere forever. But when he goes through a pretzel-like contortion--\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask my colleague to yield me another \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But when he goes through such a contortion to advocate \nagainst States rights on Bush v. Gore, you say this is not a man \ninterpreting law; this is a man who is outcome determinative. He comes \nto the result he wants and then takes the law in that direction.\n  I do not have an easel here, so I thank my staff aide for helping me \nhold up this very heavy sign. It is heavy in its words.\n  Here is what Grant Woods, a former Republican attorney general of \nArizona, said:\n\n       I would have great question of whether Mr. Pryor has an \n     ability to be nonpartisan. I would say he was probably the \n     most doctrinaire and most partisan of any attorney general I \n     dealt with in 8 years. So I think people would be wise to \n     question whether or not he's the right person to be \n     nonpartisan on the bench.\n\n  That did not come from some wild-eyed, crazy, liberal Democrat. It \ncame from the attorney general--a Republican--of a conservative State, \nArizona. He makes the case as good as anybody.\n  Let me say, in conclusion, Bill Pryor is a proud and distinguished \nideological warrior. I respect him for it. But ideological warriors, \nwhether from the left or from the right, are bad news for the bench. \nThey want to make law, not interpret it. That is not what the Founding \nFathers wanted and that is not what the American people want from their \njudges. I oppose the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes \nand then I will yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to respond briefly to Senator Schumer's \ncomments.\n  There have been a lot of words used: ``extreme views,'' ``radical \nviews,'' words of that nature, ``way outside the mainstream of legal \nthought.'' Then you listen. Show me what happened, what positions he \nhas taken that are outside the mainstream.\n  He cited this hitching post case and said people were held without \nwater, which was very much disputed, and I submit was not the truth. \nBut, at any rate, the State had stopped that procedure. The case the \nattorney general defended was whether or not guards could be sued \npersonally and made personally liable for carrying out what at one time \nhad been the established policy of the prison system. That is what went \nbefore the Supreme Court. He did the right thing.\n  He was criticized for certain States rights issues on the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. He challenged a small part of that act that violated \na State's procedures and rights of immunity and won that case in the \nSupreme Court.\n  He is recognized for the Children's First Program in Alabama that was \nto put large amounts of money into improving procedures for children in \nAlabama. He was one of the leaders in the State in promoting and \nworking for that.\n  Time and time again, he has proven to be a powerful, effective \nlawyer. Thurbert Baker--the Senator talked about an attorney general \nfrom Arizona, who only knew Mr. Pryor, I am sure, only at attorneys \ngeneral meetings. But Thurbert Baker, the Democratic attorney general \nof Georgia, an African American, knows him. This is what Thurbert \nBaker, an attorney general, an African American, said about Bill Pryor:\n\n       [He] has always done what he thought was best for the \n     people of Alabama.\n\n  And Mr. Baker said:\n\n       [He] know[s] that his work on the bench will continue to \n     serve as an example of how the public trust should be upheld.\n\n  Former Democratic Alabama Governor Don Seigelman said:\n\n       Bill Pryor is an incredibly talented, intellectually honest \n     attorney general. He calls them like he sees them. He's got a \n     lot of courage, and he will stand up and fight when he \n     believes he's right.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to say a few words about the \nnomination of Bill Pryor to serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I come to this debate with some personal knowledge of the \nnominee, having served as attorney general of Texas for 4 years during \nthe time Bill Pryor served as attorney general of Alabama.\n  Before I get to the specific comments about this outstanding nominee \nand distinguished law enforcement official, I want to say a little bit \nabout the process.\n  The process of confirming judicial nominees in the Senate is broken, \nand it cries out for reform and a fresh start. Since I have been in the \nSenate, I have heard those who have attempted to justify the poor \ntreatment of President Bush's judicial nominees based upon alleged poor \ntreatment of President Clinton's judicial nominees. We have somehow \ngotten involved in this game of tit for tat, of recrimination, that \ndoes not serve the best interests of the American people. We have \ngotten into unprecedented obstruction of\n\n[[Page S14098]]\n\njudicial nominees by filibuster, which has never in the history of this \ngreat Nation happened until recently, and it is a tragedy.\n  As some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle observed, if a \nminority of Democrats are successful in blocking a bipartisan majority \nin the Senate from an up-or-down vote on a judicial nominee, when the \nroles are reversed, which at some time in the future they may be, and a \nDemocrat is in the White House, Republicans are going to want to use \nthe same tactic on nominees of a Democratic President--something I \nbelieve would be wrong, but my views do not necessarily control what \nhappens in this body.\n  The point is, we are on a downward spiral of destruction not only of \nthis great institution, but damaging in the process the fine \nreputations of these individuals who have come forward to offer to \nserve the American people. We are treating them as common criminals. We \nare mischaracterizing their resumes, their reputations in the process, \nand I believe doing great harm in the process.\n  I want to say our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who \nclaim to be--in the words of Thomas Jefferson, supposedly, when he was \nasking Washington about the role of the Senate in our form of \nGovernment, he called the Senate the cooling saucer. But the truth is, \nrather than a cooling saucer when it comes to judicial confirmation, \nthe Senate has become a stone wall, not a cooling saucer, particularly \nas it pertains to these nominees the minority Democrat leadership has \ndecided to obstruct and prevent from an up-or-down vote.\n  I realize they are grasping at straws, but somehow they have grasped \non to this notion that since they have not blocked 168 of President \nBush's nominees, they should be congratulated for blocking only 4. \nWell, we learned this morning in the Judiciary Committee that that four \nmay soon become five, and then possibly six.\n  My point is they simply cannot be congratulated for an \nunconstitutional, unprecedented filibuster and preventing up-or-down \nvotes, which is democracy in action.\n  There is another thing. For example, the Senator from New York, who \njust spoke a few moments ago, who also serves on the Judiciary \nCommittee, said something which I think bears some scrutiny. This \nmorning he repeated an allegation he and others have made that somehow \nPresident Bush has hijacked the judiciary by nominating a narrow band \nof people who he claims are ideologically driven to overturn the law \nand run roughshod once they get on the courts.\n  They really need to make a decision what they believe. They either \nbelieve President Bush's nominees are all ideologically driven and \ndetermined to reach a particular result regardless of what the Congress \nsays, regardless of their oath of office, where they put their hand on \nthe Bible and agreed to serve as a judge and interpret the law, not \nmake law, or this argument about being congratulated for somehow \nconfirming 168 of these people, which simply does not stand up.\n  They have to make a choice. The truth is, they want it both ways. \nThey really can't have it both ways.\n  Bill Pryor is simply an outstanding human being and a great attorney \ngeneral. I believe he will be an outstanding judge. He is a deeply \nreligious man. Some have criticized him for his deeply held beliefs. \nUnfortunately, sometimes in this debate, I worry that by criticizing \nsomebody for their deeply held beliefs, which happen to be founded in \ntheir religious beliefs, we are setting a bar or perhaps building a \nwall against the opportunity for these people to participate in our \ngovernment, particularly on the bench. That should not be the case. Our \nConstitution bars religious tests from service in public office.\n  General Pryor has demonstrated his ability to enforce the law as \nwritten, which is what he would do on the bench, interpret the law as \nwritten and not elevate his personal agenda or his personal beliefs \nabove what the law says. Time and time again, he has done so.\n  I worry about two things in this process. One is obstruction, \npreventing a bipartisan majority from voting, and destruction of good \nhuman beings and their reputations they have worked a lifetime to \nachieve. They come here, honored to receive the nomination of our \nPresident to serve in these positions of great honor, and then they are \nplaced in the dock where they become an accused and are expected to \ndefend themselves against unwarranted and unjustified charges.\n  I wish we could see a fresh start to a process that does not serve \neither the nominees or this body or the American people well. I do not \nbelieve anyone should be congratulated for an unconstitutional \nobstruction of the democratic process going forward, when a bipartisan \nmajority is ready to confirm these outstanding nominees, such as Bill \nPryor. But that is what we have seen, obstruction and destruction of \nthese fine individuals.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their excellent \nremarks for and on behalf of Attorney General Pryor who is one of the \nbest nominees I have seen in a long time, a person of great character.\n  Today we will again vote for cloture on the nomination of William \nPryor for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Denying undisputedly \nwell-qualified nominees the up or down vote they deserve does not \nfulfill our Senatorial duties--it abdicates them. This filibuster not \nonly damages our accountability to the people who elect us, but it \nerodes the credibility of the Senate itself.\n  Today, let me take a few moments to explain why every single Member \nof this body should vote to invoke cloture, and end debate, on the \nPryor nomination so that he is afforded the dignity of an up-or-down \nvote that is all we are asking for.\n  Not even those most vigorously opposed to Bill Pryor's nomination \ncontend that his record is insufficient. He has been a bold, vocal, and \nsuccessful advocate for his state as Attorney General, an elected \noffice in Alabama. Prior to and during his campaigns seeking re-\nelection to the attorney general position in 1998 and 2002, he made his \npositions on the contentious issues of the day crystal clear--and he \nwon his most recent election with almost 60 percent of the vote. Rarely \nhas the Judiciary Committee reviewed such a full and unmistakably clear \nrecord for an appellate nominee; rarely has a nominee at his hearing \nbeen so honest, intelligent and forthright in his answers to every \nSenator's questions, even though he surely knew that his legal and \npolicy positions on many, if not most, issues, clashed head-on with the \npositions of the liberal Democrats who questioned him.\n  The problem that those opposed to giving Bill Pryor an up-or-down \nvote in the Senate have is that they cannot credibly make any \nsubstantive arguments against him. So they oppose him based on what he \nhas stated he personally believes. They cannot cast aspersions on his \nlegal ability--the undisputed quality of his legal work as Attorney \nGeneral of Alabama is reflected in several major cases in which Supreme \nCourt majorities have agreed with his arguments. They cannot say he is \nonly a one-party horse because so many Democrats, and many prominent \nAfrican-American Democrats, in Alabama support him even though they \ndisagree with him politically. They cannot really find anything \nsubstantive that might reflect poorly on his qualifications to sit on \nthe federal bench.\n  Therefore, their accusations against General Pryor have relied on an \nall-too familiar script: he is a so-called states' rights fanatic; he \nis anti-environment; anti-disability rights; anti-women; opposes \nminority voting rights; and wants to turn America into a Christian \ntheocracy. These sound bites are easy to make, but General Pryor's \nrecord speaks with far more authority than the fulminations against \nhim. So his opponents attack his personal beliefs, even though in every \ninstance in which a conflict between those beliefs and the law has \narisen in Bill Pryor's career, he has unfailingly put the law first.\n  The most recent example is his response to Chief Justice Roy Moore's \nrefusal to comply with the Federal injunction ordering removal of the \nTen Commandments monument from the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S14099]]\n\nbuilding. General Pryor said, ``Although I believe the Ten Commandments \nare the cornerstone of our legal heritage and that they can be \ndisplayed constitutionally as they are in the U.S. Supreme Court \nbuilding, I will not violate nor assist any person in the violation of \nthis injunction. . . . We have a government of laws, not of men. I will \nexercise any authority provided to me, under Alabama law, to bring the \nState into compliance with the injunction of the federal court. . . .''\n  In fact, the committee received a letter from Justice Douglas \nJohnstone, the only Democrat on the Alabama Supreme Court, praising \nGeneral Pryor's actions during this high-profile dispute in Alabama. He \nwrites, ``General Pryor immediately offered us all appropriate support \nof his office and fostered public support by announcing publicly that \nthe injunction was due to be obeyed in the absence of a stay. . . . \nBefore the Monument crises, General Pryor's political prospects, \nirrespective of any federal appointment, were brighter than most I have \nobserved in my decades in politics. Now he is as full of political \nbullet holes as Fearless Fosdick. My personal acquaintance with him and \nobservation of him over his years in office satisfy me that he fully \nexpected the damage but did his duty, and is doing his duty and a \nsplendid job of it regardless of the consequences. I am endorsing \nGeneral Pryor because over the years he has proven his honesty and \nintelligence. I do not pretend to agree with him on all issues. I would \nrather have the honesty and intelligence than the agreement.''\n  On the issue of abortion, General Pryor's record provides another \nexample of his commitment to following the law even when it conflicts \nwith his deeply held personal beliefs. After the Alabama legislature \npassed a partial-birth abortion ban in 1997, General Pryor issued \nguidance to State law enforcement officials to ensure that the law was \nenforced consistent with the Supreme Court's 1992 decision in Planned \nParenthood v. Casey. Although there was considerable outcry against his \ndecision from the pro-life community, the ACLU praised General Pryor's \ndecision, emphasizing that his order had ``[s]everely [l]imited'' \nAlabama's ban. He issued similar guidance after the Supreme Court's \n2000 ruling in Stenberg v. Carhart, which struck down another State's \nban on partial-birth abortion. Again, the dictates of the law trumped \nhis personal beliefs. He stuck with the law even though he totally \ndisagreed with it.\n  The President has nominated a good and honest man with a sterling \nlegal career, a bipartisan reputation for enforcing the law impartially \nas attorney general, and an enviable record of success before the \nnation's highest Court. At General Pryor's inauguration as Attorney \nGeneral, he opened with the statement: ``Equal under law today, equal \nunder law tomorrow, equal under law forever.'' Despite the distortions, \nhalf-truths, and outright falsehoods we have heard about him, General \nPryor is a diligent, honorable man whose loyalty as a public servant \nhas been to the law and its impartial administration. He has told us \nunder oath that he will continue to follow the law, just as he has \ndemonstrated during his distinguished career in Alabama. Quoting again \nfrom Justice Johnstone's letter--Justice Johnstone is a Democrat--to \nour Committee: ``The crucial question in judging a judicial candidate \nor nominees is not what sides of legal issues he or she has advocated \nbut whether he or she has enough reverence for the rule of law, enough \nhumility, and enough self-control to follow the law whether he or she \nlikes it or not. My observation tells me General Pryor does.''\n  A minority of the Senate is again attempting to prevent us from \nvoting on Attorney General Pryor despite his outstanding record. Such \nan attempt is profoundly at odds with what the Constitution demands of \nus as Senators. The President and the American people have a right to \nan up or down vote on judicial nominees. Playing politics or political \ngames with judicial nominees must stop and we must do our duty and vote \non this excellent nominee, Bill Pryor.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues not to deny Bill Pryor the courtesy \nof an up or down vote on the Senate floor. He deserves better, the \nPresident deserves better, and the majority of the Senate that stands \nready to confirm him deserves better. Most importantly, the American \npeople deserve the opportunity to hold their Senators accountable for \nthe votes they cast on the President's judicial nominees. We must \ninvoke cloture on Bill Pryor's nomination.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the absence of the chairman, I will say a word or two \nabout the nomination.\n  At the outset, I will say this may be the toughest part of this job--\nstanding in judgment of other people. It is easy to deal with issues \nand abstractions and numbers and policy. But when you stand in judgment \nof another person, I think it is one of our most solemn \nresponsibilities, complicated even more by the fact that many of the \npeople who are in controversy here have very close friends in the \nSenate among my colleagues. In this case, my friend and colleague, \nSenator Sessions of Alabama, I believe counts William Pryor as one of \nhis close friends. They have worked together for many years.\n  I can tell you, from his statements in committee and on the floor, he \nis totally committed to him and believes he would be a fine circuit \ncourt judge. That is why opposition to his nomination is all that much \nmore difficult.\n  I come here today to oppose his nomination because, frankly, as I \nlistened carefully to Attorney General Pryor's positions on the issues \nin the Judiciary Committee, it struck me that on issue after issue he \nhas not only taken an extreme position but has been unashamed, \nunabashed, and unembarrassed to express it in some of the clearest \nlanguage we have had before us. You have to ask yourself, if he is that \nstrident, if he is that committed to these extreme positions, can he \npossibly perform his responsibilities as a member of the circuit court \nof appeals--a lifetime appointment--in the way that we expect?\n  We don't want judges to make laws but, rather, to interpret them. \nWhen somebody comes to this position with a long history and pedigree \nof taking these strongly held, extreme positions on the law, is it \nreasonable for us to believe they will cast them aside once taking the \noath of office and then be dispassionate in the way they rule? I think \nthat really strains credulity.\n  There are some who believe that if a nominee comes before us and \nsays, ``I will just apply the law,'' that is all we need to hear; that \nwe can ignore what they have done beforehand. You cannot do that. You \nhave to make an honest assessment.\n  We find time and again that nominees for the Federal circuit court--\nthe second level before the Supreme Court--are those nominees with the \nstrong ideological backgrounds. They are the ones who have run into \ncontroversy and trouble on the Senate floor.\n  I believe that this White House, if it wanted to, could focus more on \nfinding common ground between Republicans and Democrats. We expect to \nreceive conservative Republican nominees for all of these vacancies. \nThat is a reflection of the President's philosophy.\n  In the case of Attorney General William Pryor, this goes beyond \nmainstream conservatism. Some of the things he has said relative to \nissues relating to judicial activism and the like are difficult for us \nto reconcile with the person who we want to be fair and dispassionate \nin his rulings.\n  Mr. Pryor stated:\n\n       Our real last hope for federalism is the election of \n     Governor George W. Bush as President of the United States, \n     who has said his favorite justices are Antonin Scalia and \n     Clarence Thomas.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Although the ACLU would argue that it is unconstitutional \n     for me as a public official to do this in a Government \n     building, let alone a football game, I will end my prayer for \n     the next administration, ``Please, God, no more Souters.''\n\n  That is a reference to Supreme Court Justice Souter. These remarks \ndon't lend themselves to the argument that Attorney General Pryor is \ngoing to be\n\n[[Page S14100]]\n\nmeasured and moderate and fair if he is given this lifetime appointment \nto the circuit bench.\n  I have looked at his record on a variety of issues and I can tell you \nthat, time and time again, what I have seen is a position that is hard \nto reconcile with the standard we should set for all judges to this \nposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, much of the debate on this nomination \nhas focused on the views and qualifications of this nominee. I want to \ncall the attention of the Senate to the violation of the rules of the \nJudiciary Committee that occurred when Mr. Pryor was considered in the \ncommittee. I will vote no on cloture because I believe that the \ncommittee rules were violated in reporting the nomination to the floor \nand that, before the Senate acts on this nomination, more investigation \nis needed of Mr. Pryor's involvement with the Republican Attorneys \nGeneral Association and the truthfulness of his testimony on that \ntopic.\n  We faced a similar procedural problem early this year in the \ncommittee. I thought we had reached a resolution of that dispute. A \nnumber of us lifted our objection to proceeding with floor votes on \nJohn Roberts and Justice Deborah Cook after we received assurances that \nthe committee's rule IV would be reinstated and abided by from that \ntime forward. That agreement was put to the test during consideration \nof the Pryor nomination, and I'm sorry to say that the Committee failed \nthat test.\n  Just as we did in connection with the Roberts and Cook nominations in \nlate February, in July, Democrats on the committee invoked rule IV and \nasked that a vote on the Pryor nomination not be taken. But once again, \nthe rule was violated.\n  The interpretation of rule IV that the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee followed in connection with the Pryor nomination conflicts \nwith the text of the rule, the practice of the committee for 24 years \nunder five separate chairmen, and the history of the adoption of the \nrule. It was as wrong in July as it was in February when the chairman \nfirst expressed it. I won't repeat those arguments today, but I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of my statement in the Judiciary \nCommittee from March 27 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Senator Russ Feingold--Statement on Judiciary Rules\n\n       Mr. Chairman, last week we readopted the Committee's rules. \n     I had no problem with us taking that action, although as I \n     said at our meeting, I think we need to have an opportunity \n     to discuss that agenda item rather than acting off the floor \n     without anytime for consideration. But with the understanding \n     that we would have the opportunity to have a discussion and \n     debate, I was fine with readopting the rules for this \n     Congress.\n       As I understand it, the rules have been in effect \n     throughout the year. I have no problem readopting those \n     rules, which as I understand it, have been in effect this \n     year in the debates we have had so far. But having done that, \n     I want to make some comments on what happened in our meeting \n     on February 27. I believe that a clear violation of the \n     committee rules occurred on that day, and we really need to \n     discuss this as a committee before proceeding with further \n     business.\n       What happened on February 27 was a sad moment for our \n     Committee and does not bode well for the harmonious \n     functioning of the Committee this year. Indeed, since that \n     day we have been in a free fall it seems to me. \n     Communications have broken down among us and among our \n     staffs. On the Democratic side, we feel unfairly taken \n     advantage of, and I know there are bad feelings on your side \n     as well. I am very sorry about this because we have much work \n     to do for the country, and we can do that work much more \n     efficiently and much more successfully if we work together \n     with respect and good will than if we are constantly fighting \n     with each other.\n       Mr. Chairman, you have the votes in this Committee to do \n     pretty much whatever you want. But that does not mean that \n     you should ignore the rights of those who disagree with you. \n     That is what occurred at the February 27 meeting.\n       Let me quickly review the background of this dispute. The \n     Chairman sought to have votes on circuit court nominees \n     Justice Deborah Cook and Mr. John Roberts. A number of us on \n     the Democratic side believed that those votes should not \n     occur because those two nominees had not received an adequate \n     hearing in this Committee. I'm not going to take the time to \n     review our position on that score in any detail, but I do \n     want to point out that we have not engaged in a policy of \n     blanket obstruction of nominees in this Committee. We voted \n     on Miguel Estrada. We voted on Jeffrey Sutton. We voted on \n     Jay Bybee. We voted on Timothy Tymkovich. We will soon vote \n     on Priscilla Owen.\n       Many of us voted against some or all of those nominations, \n     but we agreed to have a vote because we thought that the \n     Committee's consideration of the nominees had been sufficient \n     for us to make up our minds. We have not sought to use Rule \n     IV to obstruct the functioning of the Committee.\n       In the case of Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts, however, we \n     had asked repeatedly for another hearing. We had asked, as an \n     alternative, for a public meeting with the nominees. Having \n     been rebuffed at every turn, we simply did not feel ready to \n     proceed with votes on their nominations. We did not believe \n     the Committee has been given adequate opportunity to assess \n     the qualifications and examine the record of Justice Cook and \n     Mr. Roberts.\n       But when we objected to a vote on February 27, the Chairman \n     overruled the objection and forced a vote, in clear violation \n     of Rule IV. This was an astonishing act in a body that \n     functions in large because all members respect the rules and \n     abide by them.\n       When an objection to proceeding to a vote was made, the \n     proper course under our Committee's longstanding Rule IV was \n     to hold a vote on a motion to end debate on the matter. The \n     Rule provides that debate will be ended if that motion \n     carries by a majority vote, including one member of the \n     minority. In this case, our side was united in opposing \n     ending debate, so the motion would have failed. It is, in \n     effect, as the Chairman himself recognized in 1997 when the \n     Rule was invoked in connection with the Bill Lann Lee \n     nomination, a kind of filibuster rule in the Committee. The \n     vote to end debate is like a cloture vote, and it cannot \n     succeed unless at least one member of the minority assents.\n       Now Mr. Chairman, I have read your letter to Senator \n     Daschle in which you attempt to justify your actions. With \n     respect, Mr. Chairman, your interpretation of the rule is \n     erroneous. In fact, it is clearly erroneous, and I don't use \n     that term lightly.\n       Your position is that the Chairman of this Committee has \n     unfettered power to call for a vote on a matter and that Rule \n     IV is only designed to allow a majority of the committee to \n     force what you call an ``obstreperous Chairman'' to hold a \n     vote on a matter on the agenda when he doesn't want to. That \n     interpretation conflicts with the text of the rule, the \n     practice of the Committee for 24 years under five separate \n     Chairmen, including the current Chairman, and with the \n     history of the rule itself.\n       I want to start with the history because I think it so \n     plainly shows what the rule is designed to do. The rule was \n     adopted in 1979 when Sen. Kennedy chaired the Committee. The \n     Committee at that time had 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. \n     You were on the Committee at the time, as was Senator \n     Leahy.\n       At that time, there was no way at all to end debate in \n     Committee if even one member wanted to continue debate. \n     Senator Thurmond, who was the ranking member at the time, \n     stated during the committee meeting: ``The present rule is \n     the Senator can talk as long as he wants to.''\n       Recent years had seen controversial matters such as the \n     Equal Rights Amendment stalled for long periods of time in \n     Committee. The Civil Rights era had seen the Committee headed \n     by a segregationist Chairman block civil rights legislation. \n     Chairman Kennedy sought a new committee rule to allow him to \n     bring a matter to a vote. His original proposal was simply to \n     let the Chairman call a vote when he believed there had been \n     sufficient debate. This is how the original proposal read, \n     from the transcript of the Committee's meeting on January 24, \n     1979: ``If the Chairman determines that a motion or amendment \n     has been adequately debated, he may call for a vote on such \n     motion or amendment, and the vote shall then be taken, unless \n     the Committee votes to continue debate on such motion or \n     amendment, as the case may be. The vote on a motion to \n     continue debate on any motion or amendment shall be taken \n     without debate.''\n       That was the original proposal to change the right of \n     unlimited debate. And if that rule had been adopted, and \n     remained in effect until the present, what happened on \n     February 27 would have been just fine because a majority of \n     the committee would not have supported our request to \n     continue debate.\n       But Chairman Kennedy's proposed rule was not adopted. Sen. \n     Thurmond noted that the minority on the committee were \n     opposed to the change. He stated: ``We feel it would be a \n     mistake, if there is going to be a change we do think there \n     ought to be some compromise between the unlimited debate \n     maybe and a majority. That is what I was discussing with \n     Senator DeConcini. I felt maybe 12 members could cut off \n     debate. Senator DeConcini suggested 11.''\n       Mr. Chairman, during this 1979 markup--and I have to say \n     that the transcript makes for fascinating reading--Democratic \n     members like Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, Sen. Kennedy, and even \n     Sen. Biden spoke about the need for the Committee to be able \n     to conduct business and not be thwarted by what Sen. \n     Metzenbaum called a ``talkathon.'' On the other hand, \n     Republican members of the Committee were wary of a rule \n     change. And Mr. Chairman, you spoke against the rule that \n     Sen. Kennedy proposed. You said the following: ``I would be \n     personally upset. There are not a lot of rights that each \n     individual Senator has, but at least two of them\n\n[[Page S14101]]\n\n     are that he can present any amendments which he wants and \n     receive a vote on it and number two, he can talk as long \n     as he wants to as long as he can stand, as long as he \n     feels strongly about an issue. I think these rights are \n     far superior to the right of this Committee to rubber \n     stamp legislation out on the floor.\n       Later you continued: I think it is a real mistake, Joe, and \n     Mr. Chairman. I see the advantages of being able to expedite \n     legislation and try to balance that. I think it is a real \n     mistake to take away these rights.\n       Senator Thad Cochran was then a member of the committee and \n     at the end of the meeting, he, echoing Sen. Thurmond, \n     suggested a compromise. He said: ``Mr. Chairman, I don't have \n     anything to add other than except I do support writing into \n     the rule the requirement that there be an extraordinary \n     majority to shut off debate in our Committee. I think we can \n     arrive at some number agreeable to everyone.\n       There was quite a lengthy discussion of the proposed rule \n     change. One particularly significant remark was made by \n     Senator Bob Dole, who was then on the Committee said: ``[A]t \n     least you could require the vote of one minority member to \n     terminate debate. I'm sure you could always secure one vote \n     over here.''\n       The next week, the Committee reached agreement and adopted \n     Rule IV, which has been in effect ever since. The transcript \n     of the Committee's meeting indicates only that the rule \n     change was acceptable to both sides. There is no further \n     discussion or debate.\n       The text of the rule takes up Sen. Dole's idea, requiring \n     at least one member of the minority to vote to end debate. \n     The compromise ended the ability of one or a few Senators to \n     tie up the Committee indefinitely. But it gave the majority \n     the power to end debate over an objection if it could \n     convince one member of the minority to agree. The Committee \n     didn't adopt Sen. Thurmond's or Sen. Cochran's suggestion \n     precisely, but it specified a super-majority to end debate, \n     10 out of the 17 member of the committee. Because ten of the \n     17 members of the Committee at the time were democrats, the \n     new rule made it even more difficult for the majority to end \n     debate by taking up Sen. Dole's suggestion and specifying \n     that at least one member of the minority had to agree. That \n     was the compromise reached, and that is the rule we have had \n     for over two decades.\n       Mr. Chairman, the argument that the rule places no limit on \n     the Chairman's ability to end debate is clearly answered by \n     this history. It is clearly wrong. The committee rule was \n     violated when Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts were reported over \n     the objection of some members without a vote in the Committee \n     to end the debate. There is simply no question about this.\n       You have mentioned a number of times that the \n     Parliamentarian agreed with your interpretation of the \n     Committee's rules. I do not believe that is accurate. What \n     the Parliamentarian has told us is that if a point of order \n     is made on the floor he would only look to make sure the \n     Senate rules were followed. Those rules simply require a \n     majority vote of the committee when a quorum is present. No \n     Senate rule was violated on February 27, but a Committee \n     rule, Rule IV, clearly was.\n       During the February 27 meeting, a new member of our \n     Committee, the Senator from South Carolina, stated that if \n     our intention of Rule IV prevailed, ``you could not ever do \n     any business, have any votes, unless the other side totally \n     agreed.'' I just want to point out that that is not the \n     result we seek at all. There is a big difference between the \n     other side ``totally agreeing'' and having one member of the \n     minority voting to end debate. The Senator from South \n     Carolina actually described the situation in this Committee \n     before Rule IV was adopted, but not after.\n       I do want to point out to my colleagues once again that it \n     is hardly the case that we on the Democratic side have tried \n     to block all action on judges using Rule IV. We voted on \n     Miguel Estrada. We voted on Jeffrey Sutton. We voted on Jay \n     Bybee. We voted on Timothy Tymkovich. We will vote on \n     Priscilla Owen. In the last Congress we approved 100 of \n     President Bush's nominees. I voted against a few of them, but \n     I never tried to hold up a vote.\n       We tried to invoke Rule IV on February 27 only because of \n     the special circumstances surrounding the Cook and Roberts \n     nominations. We felt, and we still feel, that the Committee's \n     consideration of these two nominees was inadequate. That's \n     why we objected to the votes.\n       Now Mr. Chairman, this might seem like a petty matter. But \n     is isn't. Honoring the rules of the Senate and the rules of \n     the committees gives credibility and legitimacy to the work \n     we do here. Rules that survive changing tides of political \n     power are the hallmark of a democracy. In may ways our \n     committee rules are analogous to the rule of law in our \n     society. We have to respect those rules or we have nothing \n     left.\n       Mr. Chairman, it is clear from the history of Rule IV that \n     it we insisted on in 1979 by Republican Senators then in the \n     minority to preserve their rights in Committee to debate \n     matters fully and not just, in your own words at that time, \n     ``rubber stamp legislation out to the floor.'' The \n     justification for ignoring the rule given in the letter to \n     Sen. Daschle simply doesn't hold water when you look at the \n     history and practice in this Committee. This kind of results-\n     oriented approach to the rules of the Committee does not \n     serve us well. The rules of this body, like the laws of this \n     country, protect all of us. We must stand up to efforts to \n     ignore them.\n       What happened in the Committee on February 27 with respect \n     to Rule IV did not reflect well on the Committee or the \n     Senate. I sincerely hope that these rulings will be \n     reconsidered. The Committee must enforce its rules, not run \n     roughshod over them. And if that means that we consider and \n     discuss certain nominations a little longer before reporting \n     them to the floor, so be it. That is what happens in a \n     deliberative body governed by rules not fiat.\n       Thank you Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to emphasize that we have never sought to use \nrule IV to indefinitely delay a nomination in committee. With respect \nto Mr. Roberts and Justice Cook, we only wanted adequate hearings so \nthat we could properly exercise our constitutional responsibility to \nadvise and consent on the nomination. With respect to Mr. Pryor, we \nonly wanted to complete an investigation that was well underway \nalready. We have never tried to kill a nomination in committee by never \nvoting on it, even though that was done dozens of times to President \nClinton's nominees. But we should not be forced to vote on a nomination \nbefore we have all of the information that we feel is needed to make an \ninformed recommendation to our colleagues in the full Senate.\n  We needed more time to investigate the issues raised by records from \nthe Republican Attorneys General Association, RAGA, that the committee \nreceived. The documents raise what seem to me to be serious questions \nabout the accuracy of Mr. Pryor's testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee and the answers he provided to written questions. We needed \nmore time to contact the people who know about Mr. Pryor's activities \nas the Treasurer of RAGA and ask them questions. And we should have \ncalled Mr. Pryor back to ask him further questions in person and under \noath. I don't know where this investigation might have led, but I do \nknow that it was not nearly completed when the committee voted in July.\n  It was the committee's duty and responsibility to provide the full \nSenate with a complete record about a nominee. But, as we expected, \nonce the committee voted, the investigation stopped. So there are still \nmany unanswered questions.\n  Let me just cite a few examples of the questions that the RAGA \ndocuments raise. In answer to one of my written questions about who \nadministered RAGA and who might have records of its activities, Mr. \nPryor stated that RAGA was administered by the RNC and that to his \nknowledge all records were maintained by the RNC. He also stated that \nall solicitations for membership in RAGA were made by the staff of the \nRNC or the 5 State attorneys general who served on RAGA's executive \ncommittee. He failed to identify a single individual who worked for \nRAGA or raised money for RAGA.\n  The documents we received indicate that RAGA was administered for \nover a year by an individual who had previously been Mr. Pryor's \ncampaign manager. She served as RAGA's finance director. That person \ndid not work for the RNC. They also identify an RNC employee who \npreviously had worked for Mr. Pryor on his campaign. Both of these \nindividuals maintained records of RAGA at some point. But Mr. Pryor did \nnot identify these individuals, even though our questions clearly \nsought that information.\n  The documents also show that solicitations were made by a finance \ncommittee of lobbyists and political fundraisers, in addition to RNC \nand RAGA staff and the attorneys general. The documents seem to \nindicate that Mr. Pryor was familiar with the finance committee and \neven participated in conference calls with them. Yet he failed to \ndiscuss the finance committee in his answers, even though, again, the \nquestions specifically sought that information.\n  The documents also suggest that Mr. Pryor received reports specifying \nthe companies that had contributed to RAGA. This is inconsistent with \nMr. Pryor's testimony that he received only e-mail and oral reports of \noverall fundraising totals.\n  These are just a few examples. There may be good explanations for Mr. \nPryor's testimony and answers, but we don't have them yet. And we \nshould get\n\n[[Page S14102]]\n\nthem before we vote on the nomination. I will therefore vote no on \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Republican side, 7 minutes 41 seconds \nremain. Five minutes two seconds remain on the other side.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, there has been a repeated suggestion \nthat somehow Alabama's brilliant, principled, courageous attorney \ngeneral, who has stood firm time and again in serious types of disputes \nwithin the State legally, is extreme or radical or out of the \nmainstream. When you ask why and say show me something he has done that \nindicates that, they say, well, he struck down the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  As I explained earlier, he appealed a portion of that act that dealt \nwith 4 percent of the cases, cases against States; and the Supreme \nCourt agreed with him and struck down that small portion of the act.\n  He was not against the disabled. He has great compassion for the \ndisabled. It was a legal action taken by this Congress that upset and \nstruck down legitimate States rights issues, and the Supreme Court, \nwhen reviewing it, agreed with Attorney General Pryor.\n  This is the kind of argument that has been raised. There is no basis \nto say this man is extreme. He stood firm on a matter of \nreapportionment in Alabama, which benefited the Democrats. He took \ncomplaints from the Republicans. He declared that the State \nreapportionment plan dictated by the Democratic majority that favored \nthe Democrats was legally done and he defended it. He lost it in the \ncourt of appeals and he won it on behalf of the Democrats in the \nSupreme Court. At least their provision prevailed.\n  What Bill Pryor said and what he believed was it was his duty to \ndefend Alabama law if it was constitutional. He found that it was, so \nhe defended it, even though he personally would not have agreed with \nit.\n  In one of the affidavits that Senator Leahy quoted Bob James III is \ncomplaining about Attorney General Pryor. In his affidavit, he said:\n\n       The last conversation I recall with Bill Pryor occurred \n     late in Governor James' last term after the Governor signed \n     Alabama's ``partial-birth'' abortion law. When the law \n     passed, Mr. Pryor instructed Alabama district attorneys not \n     to enforce the law as to previable fetuses. In my review, \n     this gutted the law and defeated its very purpose. An \n     equivalent to Pryor's action would be for Attorney General \n     Ashcroft to instruct U.S. attorneys not to enforce an act \n     of Congress.\n  Everybody knows Bill Pryor is pro-life. Everybody knows Bill Pryor \npersonally abhors partial-birth abortion. Why did he do this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Because he was following the law.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The assistant Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask permission of the distinguished \nmanager of this matter, Senator Leahy, if I may direct some questions \nto him.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand I still have almost 5 \nminutes left. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, is this the same William Pryor the Senate \nspent a great deal of time on previously and there was an attempt by \nthe majority to invoke cloture and that failed? Is this the same \nperson?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I answer the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Nevada by saying, yes, it is. I answer further, although he didn't \nask this question, I am not aware of any votes that have changed since \nthat time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I direct a further question to my friend. \nIs he telling me then, in the waning days of this legislative session \nof the National Legislature that we are spending time on a vote that \nhas already been taken--there will not be a single vote changed--when \nwe have appropriations bills to complete, we have Internet taxation, \nand many other items we are trying to complete in a matter of days; \nthat we are, for lack of a better description, wasting the Senate's \ntime on a nomination that has already been rejected by the Senate?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the senior Senator from Nevada is \nabsolutely right. In fact, of those appropriations, we have held up the \nappropriations for our veterans, and we can't find time to vote on the \nfloor. Appropriations for our law enforcement people are being held up \nand we can't find time to vote on the floor. Appropriations for the \nFederal judiciary, for the State Department, for housing, and a number \nof others are being held up, and we can't seem to find time to vote on \nthe floor. But we are doing this revote when everybody knows the result \nwill be precisely what it was the last time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I further direct the Senator's attention \nto an article--I am not confident he has had time to read it because it \nis from a western newspaper, the L.A. Times. Is it true the vacancy \nrate on the Federal bench is at a 13-year low, as indicated in the \nheadlines of today's L.A. Times?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator is absolutely right. The \nvacancy rate in the judiciary is at a 13-year low. It was at a high at \nthe end of President Clinton's term because the Republican majority in \nthe Senate had blocked over 60 of President Clinton's nominees, usually \nby either threatening filibusters or not even allowing them to have a \nvote.\n  In the 17 months that the Democrats were in charge of the Senate, we \nconfirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees, which brought down that \nrate. In the 17 months the Republicans have been in charge, they have \nconfirmed another 68. So the vacancy rate is at a 13-year low. In fact, \nI say to my friend from Nevada, President Bush, in less than 3 years, \nhas seen more of his nominees confirmed than President Reagan did in \nhis first 4 years, with a Republican majority in those 4 years, and he \nwas the all-time champ.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I further direct a question to my friend, \nit is true, then, that this article written by David Savage states that \nexperts who track Federal judgeships say Republican complaints about a \nDemocratic filibuster has skewed the larger picture. The article \nfurther goes on to say, and I ask the Senator if he is aware of this, \nthat 168 Federal judges have been approved and 4 turned down--168 to 4; \nis that the record as the Senator understands it?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is. As a good friend of mine in the \nRepublican Party said the other day: Pat, I know this whole argument is \nbogus. I guess we are making it for fundraising letters. But I do know \nPresident Bush has had far more of his nominees confirmed with both \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Senate than anybody has in decades.\n  Yes, it is true, and I do agree with my Republican friend that the \nargument is bogus. But the only objection I have to the bogus argument \nbeing made is that we should be voting on the money for our veterans. \nWe should be voting on the money for our law enforcement. We should be \nvoting on the money for housing. And, we should be passing those bills \nthat, by law, we were supposed to have passed way back in September.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire L.A. Times article that has \nbeen referred to by the distinguished Senator from Nevada be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 6, 2003]\n\n           Vacancy Rate on Federal Bench Is at a 13-Year Low\n\n                          (By David G. Savage)\n\n       Washington.--The vacancy rate on the federal bench is at is \n     lowest point in 13 years, because of a recent surge of judges \n     nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate.\n       The intense partisan battle over a handful of judges aside, \n     Bush has already won approval of 168 judges, more than \n     President Reagan achieved in his first term in the White \n     House. And with 68 of his nominees winning confirmation in \n     2003 as of Wednesday, President Bush has had a better record \n     this year than President Clinton achieved in seven of his \n     eight year in office.\n\n[[Page S14103]]\n\n       Experts who track federal judgeships say Republican \n     complaints about Democratic filibuster of four judges have \n     obscured the larger picture.\n       ``The Bush administration has been spectacularly successful \n     in getting the overwhelming proportion of its judicial \n     nominations confirmed,'' said political scientist Sheldon \n     Goldman at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ``There \n     are only a relative handful being filibustered and held up. \n     And this contrasts with the dozens of Clinton nominees who \n     were held up by the Republicans in the last six years of the \n     Clinton administration. The truth is the Republicans have had \n     an outstanding record so far.''\n       The Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee lists \n     39 vacancies among the 859 seats on the U.S. district courts \n     and the U.S. courts of appeal--a 4.5% vacancy rate.\n       This is the fewest number of vacancies since 1990. During \n     Clinton's term in office, the number of vacancies on the \n     federal bench was never fewer than 50, according to the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n       Today, the Senate committee is set to vote on four more \n     judicial nominees, including California Supreme Court Justice \n     Janice Rogers Brown. She is likely to be opposed by almost \n     all of the panel's Democrats, one of whom called her a \n     ``right-wing judicial activist'' during a hearing two weeks \n     ago.\n       If confirmed by the full Senate, Brown would fill a seat on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia that is \n     vacant in part because Republicans blocked two candidates \n     that Clinton nominated in 1999.\n       Washington lawyer Allen Snyder, a former clerk to U.S. \n     Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, had a \n     hearing in the committee, but despite a lack of opposition, \n     he failed to gain a confirmation vote in the Senate. White \n     House lawyer Elena Kagan was denied even a hearing in the \n     GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee. She has since become a \n     dean of Harvard Law School.\n       Upon taking office, President Bush named Washington lawyers \n     John Roberts and Miguel A. Estrada to the same appeals court. \n     Roberts, also a former clerk to Rehnquist, won confirmation \n     this year and is now the junior judge on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia. Democrats filibustered \n     and blocked a final vote on Estrada, who subsequently \n     withdrew.\n       In July, President Bush chose Brown to fill the vacancy.\n       Even if she wins a narrow approval today, the minority \n     Democrats may block her from a final vote in the Senate. \n     Besides Estrada, they have blocked votes on Mississippi Judge \n     Charles W. Pickering Sr., Texas Supreme Court Justice \n     Priscilla R. Owen and Alabama Atty. Gen. William H. Pryor Jr. \n     Also waiting a final confirmation vote is Los Angeles \n     Superior Court Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl, Bush's nominee to the \n     U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Administration officials concede that most of Bush's judges \n     are being approved, but they point to the blocking of the \n     appeals court nominees as extraordinary.\n       The vacancy rate ``has been getting lower, but the real \n     problem is the showdown at the circuit courts. We have seen \n     an unprecedented obstruction campaign against the president's \n     nominees for the circuit courts,'' said John Nowacki, a \n     Justice Department spokesman. The department's Web site says \n     there are 41 vacancies on the federal bench, if the U.S. \n     Court of Claims and the International Trade Court are \n     included in the total.\n       The administration says Bush has made 46 nominations to the \n     appeals court, but only 29 have won confirmation. ``That's a \n     63% confirmation rate.\n        Clinton had an 80 percent confirmation rate at the same \n     time,'' Nowacki said. ``There is something different going on \n     here. It's an obstruction at entirely different level.''\n        Goldman, the University of Massachusetts professor, said \n     both parties have blocked prospective judges they viewed as \n     extreme, but they have done it in different ways.\n        ``The Republicans obstructed quietly in the committee,'' \n     Goldman said. ``If they didn't want to approve you, you just \n     didn't get a hearing. The Democrats have obstructed through \n     the use of the filibuster, which is very open and visible.''\n        During Clinton's final six years in office, Republicans \n     controlled the Senate, and they refused to confirm more than \n     60 of his judicial nominees.\n\n\n                             Bench strength\n\n        Here's how President bush's confirmed nominations to \n     Federal judgeships compares with his three predecessors:\n        President George W. Bush: 2003: 68; 2002: 72; and 2001: \n     28**.\n        President Bill Clinton: 2000: 40*; 1999: 33*; 1998: 65*; \n     1997: 36*; 1996: 20*; 1995; 55*; 1994: 101; 1993: 28; and \n     1992: 66*.\n        President George H. W. Bush: 1991: 56*; 1990: 55*; and \n     1989: 15*.\n        President Ronald Reagan: 1988: 41*; 1987: 43*; 1986: 44; \n     1985: 84; 1984: 43; 1983: 32; 1982: 47; and 1981: 41.\n\n        * Senate controlled by opposition.\n        ** Senate evenly divided until Sen. James M. Jeffords of \n     Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent.\n\n        Sources: Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield back my 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to respond to some comments \nthat were just made. The distinguished assistant Democratic leader \nasserts Mr. Pryor has been rejected before. He has not been rejected \nbefore. He has not been given an up-or-down vote. He has not been given \na vote. We have a majority of Senators who supported him previously. A \nmajority will support him, and it is absolutely wrong to say he has \nbeen rejected. He has not been given a vote.\n  For the first time in the history of this country, we are facing a \nfilibuster of judges, and it is not right. It is time to deal with this \nsituation. I hope our colleagues on the other side will yield. If not, \nI hope they hear from the American people.\n  I yield time back to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I couldn't agree more with the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama. What is happening here is a very \nfine man, an excellent lawyer, an excellent attorney general in this \ncountry, one who has always stood for upholding the law even when he \ndisagreed with it, which is the ultimate in judicial nominees, is being \ndeprived of the dignity of an up-or-down vote, which has never been \ndone before, other than in these four filibusters that the Democrats \nhave waged in this body.\n  This is dangerous stuff. I admit during the Clinton years there were \na few of our Republicans who wanted to filibuster some of their liberal \njudges, and we stopped it. Senator Lott and I made it very clear that \nwas not going to happen because not only is that a dangerous situation, \npolitically it is a terrible situation, and it is something that should \nnot happen in this body.\n  One of the Democrats' favorite tactics, which they used again before \nlast week's failed cloture vote on Judge Pickering's nomination, is to \ntry to excuse their indefensible treatment of the President's nominee \nby citing the raw number of President Bush's nominees confirmed by the \nSenate. That number now stands at 168. They trumpet this number, and \nthen note they have blocked only 4. We know it will be a lot more than \nthat. We already know the future nominations they are going to block, \nbut the Democrats believe this sounds reasonable to the American people \nwho hear it.\n  The more the real story gets out, the less acceptable it is to the \nAmerican people. First, there are more Federal appellate vacancies \ntoday, 18, during President Bush's third year in office than there were \nat the end of President Clinton's second year in office, 15. Over half \nof President Bush's appeals court nominees have not been confirmed. \nThere are 41 total vacancies on the Federal district and appellate \nbenches, 22 of which are classified as judicial emergencies by the \nnonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. A staggering 67 \npercent of the vacant appeals court slots are judicial emergencies.\n  Here is the point. No raw number of confirmations means anything in \nand of itself, while there are not one but three filibusters--exemplary \nnominees going on now. We just voted out Janice Rogers Brown from the \ncommittee on a straight party-line vote, and it is clear they are going \nto filibuster this fine African-American justice who wrote the most \nmajority decisions issued by the California Supreme Court last year. \nTheir argument is: She is outside the mainstream. That is always the \nargument they bring up because she does not conform to the liberal \nideology they demand.\n  Just think, one nominee, Miguel Estrada, has withdrawn after more \nthan 2 years of a filibuster against him.\n  The Democrats are virtually certain to filibuster Justice Janice \nRogers Brown, another DC Circuit nominee; and emergency vacancies \ncontinue to exist on our Federal courts.\n  Are we supposed to be grateful that only a small handful of President \nBush's nominees are being filibustered? Is there an acceptable \nfilibuster percentage the Democratic leadership has in mind? The mere \nfact that we have to ask these questions makes it crystal\n\n[[Page S14104]]\n\nclear we have a broken process. Even one filibuster of a judicial \nnominee is one too many, and we are now up to four, and I might add \nthere are others they have made very clear they are going to \nfilibuster. These are appellate nominees. For the first time in \nhistory, these filibusters are occurring. I think it is shameful.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds to implement and administer Team Nutrition \n                       programs, with an offset)\n\n       On page 5, line 1, strike ``$188,022,000'' and insert \n     ``$183,022,000''.\n       On page 48, line 24, strike ``$11,418,441,000'' and insert \n     ``$11,423,441,000''.\n       On page 48, line 26, strike ``$6,718,780,000'' and insert \n     ``$6,723,780,000''.\n       On page 49, line 7, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That not less than \n     $15,025,000 shall be available to implement and administer \n     Team Nutrition programs of the Department of Agriculture''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. \nIt would provide $5 million in additional funding to the nutrition \neducation and training section of the School Lunch Program. The funds \nwould serve to develop new programs and to implement existing programs \nin the Department of Agriculture Team Nutrition Program. Nutrition \neducation programs are being chronically underfunded and have been for \na great many years.\n  We have authorized in current law--the law about to expire, as I \nunderstand it--50 cents to be spent for every public school student to \nbe served in this country. That is 50 cents per year. This is not 50 \ncents per day; this is 50 cents per year.\n  I was speaking to Senator Byrd from West Virginia and he said for \nnutrition education we ought to at least give them as much money as it \ncosts to buy a candy bar. That is not an unreasonable goal to set for \nthis great country. Last year, we did not begin to reach the 50 cents \nper student per year. Last year, we provided $10 million.\n  This chart shows the funding level beginning in 1996. In 1996, we \nprovided $23.5 million. This is for the combined funding of the \nnutrition education training and the team nutrition. As I understand, \nthis nutrition education training is essentially money that goes as \ngrants to the States to help them provide some kind of nutrition \ninstruction in their schools. We provided $23.5 million in 1996, $14.25 \nmillion in 1997, $11.75 million in 1998, and down to $10 million in \n1999.\n  We are again, in the current fiscal year, being presented with an \nappropriations bill that calls for $10 million.\n\n[[Page S14105]]\n\nMy amendment would increase that by another $5 million.\n  This team nutrition component in this Department of Agriculture \neffort is an integrated behavior-based comprehensive plan for promoting \nnutritional health among our Nation's schoolchildren. We have over 47 \nmillion children in school in this country--that is kindergarten \nthrough 12th grade--47 million in the public school system.\n  There are three behavior-oriented strategies the Department of \nAgriculture has tried to pursue. One is to provide trading and \ntechnical assistance for child nutrition food service professionals; \nthat is, the people who provide lunches and breakfasts and serve meals \nso that the meals being served meet certain nutritional standards.\n  The second strategy is to provide multifaceted, integrated \nnutritional education for children and their parents. This tries to \nbuild some kind of motivation on the part of young people to remain \nhealthy, to be healthy, to maintain some type of healthy lifestyle.\n  The third strategy is to provide support for healthy eating and \nphysical activity by involving school administrators and other school \nand community partners.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill proposes $10 million for this \nyear's funding. In my view, that is woefully inadequate. It is \ninadequate because without additional funds, many States are not able \nto provide any nutrition instruction.\n  Why is it important at this point in our Nation's history to concern \nourselves with nutrition instruction? It is important because over the \nlast two decades obesity rates have more than doubled among children \nand they have more than tripled among adolescent children in our \nsociety. Today, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes are \nresponsible for two-thirds of the deaths in this country. The major \nrisk factors for these diseases and conditions are established in \nchildhood through unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, \nobesity, and tobacco use. Those are the main causes that lead to the \nproblem of obesity that leads to the other problems I have recounted.\n  Today, one in seven young people are considered obese; one in three \nare overweight. This is a crisis. It is a crisis for the future and a \ncrisis for our health system.\n  The Surgeon General estimates that at the minimum we spend each year \n$100 billion dealing in our health care system--this is taxpayer \ndollars--$100 billion in our health care system, through Medicare and \nMedicaid, and other health programs, on diseases that are directly \nattributable to obesity. That is a rough figure, obviously. But they \nthink that is a modest or conservative figure.\n\n  You compare that $100 billion to $10 million and you have a very \ninteresting comparison: $10 million is not 1 percent of $100 billion, \nit is not one-tenth of 1 percent of $100 billion; it is one one-\nhundredth of 1 percent of $100 billion. We have all heard, all our \nlives, the expression an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. \nWe are not asking for anything like that ratio. If we were doing that, \nwe would say we should provide one-sixteenth as much. Instead, we are \nproviding one one-hundredth of 1 percent as much on nutrition education \nas we are spending to deal with the problems that could be avoided.\n  Obese children are twice as likely as nonobese children to become \nobese adults. The overweight problem results in all sorts of physical \ndiseases: heart disease, diabetes, cancer, depression, decreased self-\nesteem, and discrimination. They face discrimination throughout their \nlives as a result of this problem.\n  There are only 2 percent of children who currently consume a diet \nthat meets the five main recommendations for a healthy diet the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture food guide calls for, so the Department of \nAgriculture is in the business of trying to give young people and \nadults throughout our society advice. They do issue a food guide, the \nfood guide pyramid, they call it. But, unfortunately, there is no \nfollowthrough instruction in our schools to try to really assist in \ngetting this information to young people at a time when it can \ndramatically affect their habits for the rest of their lives.\n  I believe nutrition education is vital to growing a generation of \nhealthy adults in this country. This amendment would be a very modest \nstep toward getting some additional funds for this purpose. It would \nprovide funding at the State level for implementation and \nadministration of nutrition education training.\n  This is a program that has existed on the statutes for years. \nUnfortunately, it has not been funded. It is time to begin getting \nthese figures up to a more reasonable level.\n  As I say, Senator Byrd from West Virginia made a suggestion which I \nthink would be a good goal for us to set. He said we should at least \nprovide as much funding per student per year as it would cost each of \nthem to buy a candy bar. That is not unreasonable. I hope we can take \nthis modest step and move ahead.\n  Let me cite a little bit more information because there was a good \nhearing on this subject that occurred earlier this year. I want to cite \nthe testimony of the Department of Agriculture on the very issue I am \ntalking about. This was a hearing on the reauthorization of the \nauthorizing legislation here, and the Department of Agriculture \nrepresentative at that hearing testified about their position. This is \ntestimony from Eric Bost, who is the Under Secretary for Food, \nNutrition, and Consumer Services, testifying before the Agriculture \nCommittee in the Senate. He said in that testimony that the \nadministration supports:\n\n     healthy school environments to address the epidemic of \n     overweight and obesity among our children by providing \n     financial incentives to schools that meet the dietary \n     guidelines. . . .\n\n  He said:\n\n       The immediate reasons for overweight among our children are \n     clear and uncomplicated. . . .\n\n  Then he goes through a list, of which one of the items in the list \nis:\n\n     the lack of strong program of nutrition education and \n     physical education in many schools. . . .\n\n  That is exactly what I am talking about. We have no strong program. \nYou cannot have a strong program when you are spending $10 million in a \nnation of 280 million people, with 47 million young people in our \nelementary schools and our high schools.\n  He goes on, in that same testimony, to state, unequivocally:\n\n       We support expanded funding to support the delivery of \n     education messages and materials in schools.\n\n  When you look at this chart, it is obvious we have not been expanding \nthe funding. Funding has been stagnant for most of a decade. In fact, \nit has dropped from where it was in 1996, very substantially.\n  The reasons for my amendment are very clear. The justification for it \nis overwhelming. In a wealthy nation like this, we can do better. We \ncannot afford to do as little in this area as we have traditionally \ndone. The new crisis we face with obesity among children is a strong \nwake-up call to all of us that we need to begin doing something \nsignificant in nutrition education.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I was hoping to get a resolution of my \namendment before we switch to another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator objecting to setting aside his \namendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I do object at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am thinking we should not plan on any \nvotes until maybe 2 or 2:30. I understand there are some conflicts \ngoing on on both sides of the aisle. I would say to the Senator, if he \nis going to insist on a rollcall vote, we should stack it at that time.\n  I have a problem with the Senator's amendment in that the offset he \ncites is from buildings and facilities at the Department of \nAgriculture. One can say, well, you can always find an extra\n\n[[Page S14106]]\n\n$5 million, but that is an account that is committed to lease payments \nand other contracts that have been established for a while. It is $5 \nmillion, which in the scheme of things is not all that much money, but \nthe offset is a bit problematical. We did fund this program at the \nrequested level of $10 million, so it is going above the level.\n  These are the only comments I have on the amendment. I say to the \nSenator, if he insists on a rollcall vote, we possibly could set a time \nsome time after 2 or 2:30 where the votes might occur, and I would hope \nto stack some votes at that time on amendments.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I just ask the manager a question \nthrough the Chair.\n  I would be interested--obviously, my purpose is to get more resources \nfor this activity. If the manager and the ranking member think they \nwould be able to find a better offset, or find some other way to \nprovide some resources for this or think that is a possibility, then I \nwould be glad to defer to them. I picked this offset because I could \nnot get any suggestion from anyone at the staff level, at least, of a \nbetter way to do this. If you think there may be a way to do this, I \nwould be anxious to hear about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to make the comment that \nSenator Bingaman has brought a very important and relevant issue to the \nfloor. I agree with him that the funding level is inadequate, but I \nagree with Senator Bennett that finding an offset is not yet something \nwe have been able to do.\n  I personally, if Senator Bennett feels the same way, would be willing \nto work with Senator Bingaman to see if we can't find some way to \nprovide a satisfactory offset and, at any rate, to do everything we can \nto improve the funding level for this important service, if not this \nyear, in future years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my ranking member for his \nthoughtful analysis of this and concur. We will be happy to look \nthrough the bill and see if we can find an offset and, as he said, if \nnot this year, then in future years, because I do think the issue the \nSenator from New Mexico has raised is a legitimate one.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2115 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, with that assurance, I will not go ahead \nand push this to a vote at this point. Let me thank my colleagues for \ntheir assurance and urge, if it is possible before we complete action \non this appropriations bill, before it goes to the President for \nsignature, that we find some additional funds this year. That would be \nmost appreciated.\n  I will be glad to work with them with regard to next year as well. \nThis obviously needs to be a multiyear effort, if we are going to get \nfunding for nutrition education up to a level that actually has an \nimpact. That would be my hope.\n  With that understanding, I withdraw the amendment and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn. No objection being \nheard to waiving the amendment before the Senate, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2116\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2116.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the importation of \n             cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__. SENSE OF SENATE ON IMPORTATION OF CATTLE WITH \n                   BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States beef industry is the single largest \n     segment of United States agriculture;\n       (2) the United States has never allowed the importation of \n     live cattle from a country that has been found to have bovine \n     spongiform encephalopathy (referred to in this section as \n     ``BSE'');\n       (3) the importation of live cattle known to have BSE could \n     put the entire United States cattle industry at unnecessary \n     risk;\n       (4) food safety is a top priority for the people of the \n     United States; and\n       (5) the importation of beef and beef products from a \n     country known to have BSE could undermine consumer confidence \n     in the integrity of the food supply and present a possible \n     danger to human health.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Secretary of Agriculture--\n       (1) should not allow the importation of live cattle from \n     any country known to have BSE unless the country complies \n     with the animal health guidelines established by the World \n     Organization for Animal Health; and\n       (2) should abide by international standards for the \n     continued health and safety of the United States livestock \n     industry.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have to chair a Democratic Policy \nluncheon in a few moments. I say to the manager and ranking member, I \nhave two amendments to this bill. This is one. I will come back \nposthaste following the luncheon and offer the other. I don't want to \nhold up this bill. I want to have both amendments considered. I know \nyou want to complete work on this important appropriations bill.\n  Let me describe the amendment that I have now offered dealing with \nsomething I think is very important.\n  We have in this country a livestock industry that is $175 billion. It \nis a very large industry, an important industry. In North Dakota, it is \nroughly $500 million, and it is important to our State. Ranching and \nfarming, of course, represent the bread and butter of our economy in \nNorth Dakota.\n  Let me talk about some of the difficulties we face in the beef and \nlivestock industry. We have had in some recent years outbreaks of \nsomething called BSE or more commonly referred to as mad cow disease. \nIt is devastating. It is heartbreaking to see the consequences of an \noutbreak of mad cow disease on producers in a country where it occurs.\n  I hold up a chart that shows a pretty graphic picture of piles and \npiles of dead cattle with a fellow up here who is looking at all these \ncattle that have been slaughtered as a result of mad cow disease. This \nwas in March 1997. The costs to that industry in England were \ndevastating.\n  Our neighbor to the north, Canada, had one animal diagnosed with mad \ncow disease, an animal that appeared sick when it was slaughtered in \nJanuary. They apparently severed the head and put it in a cooler, and \nsome 4 months later they tested it and discovered that the animal, \nslaughtered in January, had mad cow disease or BSE.\n  As a result, we closed our border to the live import of cattle from \nCanada. It has been a devastating time for Canadian producers. Our \nhearts go out to them. It is a difficult situation for them. But what \nis important for us is to protect our industry, our beef industry, our \nlivestock industry.\n  Last week the Secretary of Agriculture indicated that she is moving \nnow toward putting Canada to a ``minimal risk'' status with respect to \nthe import of cattle which would set up the capability of importing \nlive cattle from Canada. We are not now importing them. We import some \nslaughtered beef products but not live cattle.\n  The amendment I offer is rather simple. The United States, with most \nother countries, belongs to the World Organization for Animal Health. \nThat organization has protocols, describing the timeline for when you \nmight allow imports into your country from a country that has mad cow \ndisease or BSE.\n  Let me read the sense of the Senate: It is the sense of the Senate \nthat the Secretary of Agriculture should not allow the importation of \nlive cattle from any country known to have BSE, better known as mad cow \ndisease, unless the country complies with the animal health guidelines \nestablished by the World Organization for Animal Health, and, No. 2, \nshould abide by the international standards for continued health and \nsafety of the U.S. livestock industry.\n  What are those guidelines? The guidelines may be changed. I am told \nthere are discussions to do so. I am not necessarily opposed to \nchanging them. But whatever the guidelines are, they are. At the moment \nthose guidelines talk about a country or zone with minimal BSE risk:\n\n       The cattle population of a country or zone may be \n     considered as presenting a minimal BSE risk should the \n     country or zone comply with the following requirements:\n\n[[Page S14107]]\n\n       The last indigenous case of BSE was reported more than \n     seven years ago.\n\n  There is another category more than 4 years ago.\n  In this case, the case of mad cow disease occurring in Canada, it was \nsome 10 months ago, and it was disclosed only 6 months ago. We are \ntalking now about opening the border to imports of cattle from Canada.\n  That could be a devastating risk to our livestock industry. We have a \nlot of ranchers trying to make a living. We ought to care about the \nrisk posed to them if we import cattle from a country that had a case \nof BSE within recent months.\n  We have a lot to lose. Let me describe a circumstance, for example, \nwith Japan. In the year 2000, beef consumption in Japan was at 1.577 \nmillion tons carcass weight equivalent. BSE was discovered in Japan in \nSeptember 2001. That beef consumption dropped by 16 percent in 1 year. \nCompounding those problems, Japan just announced its second case of BSE \nin an animal less than 30 months of age. The most recent case is a cow \n21 months of age. USDA is proposing a rule that would allow cattle 30 \nmonths or younger to be imported to the U.S.\n  We have organizations that say, well, it is not going to be a big \nproblem. In fact, a Harvard risk assessment on BSE and its effects came \nto the conclusion: Even if infected animals entered into the U.S. \nanimal agricultural system from Canada, the risk of it spreading \nextensively within the U.S. herd was low.\n  I am sorry. If we have a case of BSE, mad cow disease, in this \ncountry, the risk is dramatic for our beef industry, just as it was for \nJapan--a 16-percent reduction in beef consumption. It is a devastating \nblow to our industry if it occurs.\n  I believe at this point we ought to proceed with caution. We are not \ntalking about 4 years or 7 years, which represents the guideline of the \nInternational Organization for Animal Health. We are talking just a \nmatter of months past the time when a case of BSE was disclosed by our \nneighbors to the north. I regret that has happened to them. I know it \nis heartbreaking for them. I know they would like to move cattle into \nour marketplace as early as possible, but the fact is, our obligation \nis to try to find every way possible to prevent an outbreak of mad cow \ndisease in this country because it would be devastating to a \nsignificant, vibrant industry, devastating to a lot of ranchers out \nthere trying to make a living today.\n  We ought not have USDA move as quickly as they want to move. First, \nit is an abrogation of the guidelines we signed up for. The guidelines \nof the International Code of Animal Health don't describe a \ncircumstance in which you change the rules and allow the importation of \nlive cattle from a country which has had an experience with mad cow \ndisease in just a matter of recent months.\n  The World Organization for Animal Health is made up of 164 nations, \nour Nation included, and Canada. One of the missions is to develop \nguidelines that relate to the rules that member nations use to protect \nthemselves against diseases without setting up unjustifiable sanitary \nbarriers. I agree with all that. But I am saying that the guidelines in \nthis organization of which we are a member and to which we are a party \nare explicit. They do not include a circumstance in which we decide, \nsome 6 months after the disclosure of mad cow disease, that we will \ntake live cattle imported from that country into our marketplace. That \nposes significant risks to our producers.\n  The National Cattleman's Beef Association, NCBA, supports the \namendment. The R-CALF organization supports this amendment. These are \nthe two largest beef organizations in the United States. I offer it \ntoday hopeful for its consideration. It is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  As I indicated when I started, I have to chair a Democratic Policy \nCommittee lunch in about 1 minute.\n  So what I would like to do is have this amendment be pending, and it \nwould be preferable, if you want, to set it aside and take other \namendments while I am at lunch. I will come back to the floor at 2 \no'clock and say a few more words and perhaps I can get the ranking \nmember and manager to agree to accept this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If the Senator will stay on the floor for a moment \nlonger. If he doesn't talk when he comes back at 2 o'clock, we will \naccept the amendment now, at 1 o'clock; is that acceptable?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is an offer I cannot refuse, although the not-\ntalking proviso will not relate to my second amendment. I will come \nback--actually for the courtesy of the manager and ranking member, as I \nknow they want to move the bill--and offer my second amendment. I am \nhappy to do that if he is willing to take the amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am always happy to engage in a little humor with my \nfriend. We served together as chairman and ranking member on another \nsubcommittee. I assure him I am always happy to hear him at any time on \nany subject.\n  To move the bill forward, I have checked with Senator Kohl and he is \nfully in support of the Dorgan amendment. I have no objection to it. I \nask unanimous consent that it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). If there is no further debate, \nwithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2116) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I see the senior Senator from Delaware \nhere. I don't think he will talk about mad cow disease. I am happy to \nyield what time he might require for his statement. I ask him in \nadvance if he will tell us how much time he will use.\n  I send the message out to those enjoying lunch, or those who are at \nthe White House, or wherever, that we intend to finish this bill today. \nThe assistant Democratic leader has told me that it is his desire from \nthe other side that we finish this bill today. So I hope Senators who \nhave amendments will come to the floor in a timely fashion. We will do \nthe best we can to deal with the amendments in a timely fashion so we \ncan finish the bill and get it on its way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                          u.s. policy in iraq\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the chairman is correct. I don't plan on \nspeaking on mad cow disease. I will speak for approximately 20 minutes. \nIf anybody comes in with a relevant amendment, I will yield the floor. \nI am going to talk on the subject of Iraq.\n  Two days ago, the Congress completed action on the President's \nrequest for $87 billion. In fact, I think later today there is going to \nbe a signing down at the White House for military operations \nreconstruction money for Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, that relates to \nthat $87 billion request.\n  The debate we had in the Congress over that issue reflected more than \nour concern about the amount of money. I think it reflected more than \nthe sticker shock that the American people felt when they heard the $87 \nbillion number. I think it reflected the fact that there is a crisis in \nconfidence in the President's leadership in Iraq. To put it more \nstraightforward, there is a grave doubt about the policy we are \nengaging in now and its prospects for success.\n  The American people not only have those doubts, but I know, and we \nall know on the floor, that a number of Members on both sides of this \naisle have doubts about the policy. I voted for the $87 billion, and I \nbelieve we needed to do that. But we cannot afford to fail in Iraq, and \nthere was no option but the one before us.\n  It seems to me that we are going to have great difficulty succeeding \nin Iraq unless we act more wisely, and I want to discuss that very \nbriefly today. I will be coming to the floor next week with a much more \nexpanded speech on this subject. In order for us to succeed, I think we \nhave to simply change our policy. We have to change the policy we are \npursuing now in several very important ways.\n  First, in order to determine whether or not we think this policy is \nworking, it seems we have to understand the situation on the ground in \nIraq. There are two realities in Iraq right now. One is that there is \nsome real progress being made: Schools are being opened; hospitals are \nopen; there is a number of reconstruction projects underway; the \nsetting up of local councils is occurring\n\n[[Page S14108]]\n\nand other things that are good. But all of that progress is being \nundermined by the other reality on the ground: our failure so far to \nget security, especially in the Sunni Triangle in Baghdad.\n  The failure to secure that area has undermined not only the progress \nwe are making but, in my view, has created a circumstance where it \nbecomes incredibly more difficult each day to get the kind of help we \nneed to ultimately succeed. That is to the degree to which other \nnations, and to the degree to which Iraq is, and the degree to which \nthe American people believe we are not making significant progress is \nthe degree to which they withdraw their support or fail to offer \nsupport.\n  We need international support, we need the continued support of the \nIraqi people, and we need the American people prepared to stay the \ncourse by spending billions of more dollars in order to get this done \nand, even more importantly, risking and losing American lives.\n  I am worried we are going to soon lose the support of the Iraqi \npeople and the vast majority of the American people. The Iraqi people, \nto make it clear, are happy Saddam Hussein is no longer around. They \nvery much want to build a better future. But the fact is, there has \nnever been a government in Iraq that has been a democracy. In fact, as \nwe all know, Iraq was a nation built and carved out of a colonial \ncircumstance back at the end of the World War I, and it is very \ndifficult, at best, to figure out how to put it together in any form of \nrepresentative government. It is going to take some time.\n\n  So the job, No. 1, here for us, it seems to me, is getting the \nsecurity right, controlling the streets, securing the weapons depots, \ngetting much better intelligence. But that has always been the No. 1 \njob we have had, and all other success depends upon that occurring--\nbetter security. It has always been the administration's \nresponsibility, not the Congress's responsibility, to figure out how to \nget the security on the ground correct.\n  For some time, I have refrained from any prescriptive outline as to \nwhat I think should be done because we cannot dictate that kind of \npolicy in the Senate. That is a matter for Presidents to determine, \nadministrations to lead. But I am very concerned that we are on a \ndownward spiral in terms of the prospects of getting it right in Iraq.\n  Now, it seems to me, right now, we are not getting the job done. It \nis not because of the lack of bravery and commitment and steadfastness \nof American troops or American personnel. These are serious people. \nThese are brave young women and men. It seems to me they have been put \nin a circumstance that makes it very difficult for them to succeed.\n  Let me lay out very briefly now, and in greater detail next week, \nwhat I believe we need to do to succeed.\n  The bottom line is pretty simple. Three groups can provide security \nin Iraq: First, the Iraqis themselves; second, our U.S. troops and the \nfew coalition partners we have with us there; and third, there is the \npossibility of a real international coalition of military forces.\n  Over the long term, obviously, the single best way to get security \nright in Iraq is for the Iraqis to provide that security through \nindigenous police forces and an indigenous army. That is our goal. \nEveryone agrees upon that goal. And it is their responsibility, \nultimately. They can tell the good guys from the bad guys better than \nwe can. But here is the rub: It takes time to build an effective--an \neffective--indigenous police force or military force.\n  When I was in Iraq in June, I was told by our experts there on the \nground that it would take 5 years to recruit and train the 75,000 Iraqi \npolice force that was needed. I was told it would take 3 years to \nrecruit and train just 40,000 persons for the Army of Iraq--5 years for \nthe police force and 3 years just to train 40,000 Iraqi soldiers.\n  We can and we are putting that effort into overdrive. Let's \nunderstand the risks that go into putting it into overdrive. The faster \nwe go on our training, the poorer the training and less legitimate the \npolice and army will be. Putting them in charge prematurely is a recipe \nfor failure. They will lose the confidence of the Iraqi people, and we \nwill lose the ability to recruit them to participate in the police \nforce and/or in the military force.\n  Although it makes sense for us to try to speed up as rapidly as we \ncan the training and the deployment of Iraqis, it is going to take time \nfor it to work. Even on steroids, we are going to need a year at least \nbefore we can hand over the keys of security to the Iraqi people, the \nIraqi military, and the Iraqi police.\n  The real question is, What do we do in the meantime? The reason I am \nso concerned about the meantime is that within a year, before we are \neven able, under this extended and intensive effort, to speed up the \ntraining and turn over the responsibility to the Iraqis, if we continue \nto have the attitude that pervades in Iraq today, or is beginning to \npervade and is beginning to pervade in the United States that this is a \ndifficult, if not hopeless, task, we are unlikely to accomplish the \ncircumstance of being able to put the Iraqis in a position even a year \nfrom now. We have to do something now to make things better on the \nground.\n  That brings us to option No. 2, and that is flood the zone with more \nU.S. troops. Putting in more troops now will allow us to get them out a \nlot faster. We especially need MPs, special forces, and civil affairs \nexperts.\n  I listened to my friend John McCain--he and I have been on the same \npage on this issue for the last 5 months--I listened to him yesterday \nmake a very compelling speech about the need to immediately increase, \nnot decrease, the number of American forces. We understand--John McCain \nand I and others--that is not a very popular thing to say.\n  Guys like me who thought the administration went about this war \nwrongly in the first place are in the dubious position of being in the \nChamber suggesting to the Americans who don't like the war that we \nshould put more forces in Iraq immediately in order to take them out \ntotally sooner while the administration announces that in the rotation \nof American forces through next spring, we are going to rotate troops, \nbut we are also going to draw down the total number of American troops. \nIt is somewhat perverse. Here are Biden and McCain talking about \nputting in more troops, and the administration is talking about taking \nout more troops.\n\n  The irony here is, we do not have control of the security on the \nground. To the extent we don't, for every Chinook that is shot down, \nfor every American who is killed, every Iraqi who is blown up, every \nIraqi policeman who goes to a barracks now and is blown up, every Red \nCross depot that is exploded--every one of those events undermines the \nwillingness of the United States, the Iraqis, and the world to stay the \ncourse and do the job in Iraq.\n  I might note parenthetically, my real problem is the President has \nyet to tell the American people why this is so important. He keeps \ntalking about and using the phrase, which is very catchy and very \ncompelling--I am paraphrasing--if we don't fight the terrorists in \nBaghdad, we will fight them in New York, Washington, Seattle, or \nwherever. There is some truth to that.\n  The American people are a lot smarter. If you ask the American people \nif they think if we succeed in Baghdad or if we succeed in Iraq that is \ngoing to end terrorism in the United States, or conversely, whether or \nnot that is the source of terrorism and the threat to the United \nStates, about 60 percent of the American people will say no, they don't \nthink that is it. They understand it. They understand the next \nterrorist attack, God forbid, in the United States is more likely to \ncome from Somalia, Philippines, Iran, or any number of other countries, \nthan it is going to be from something that has been planned in Baghdad.\n  That is not to suggest there is not terror in Baghdad; there is. But \nthere are the beginnings of a classic counterinsurgency in Baghdad, \naided and abetted by international terrorist operations that are \nbeginning to mobilize in that area.\n  The real reason we have to succeed in Iraq and the real reason we had \nbetter get it straight pretty quickly before we lose the support of the \nAmerican people is that if we fail to secure the peace in Baghdad and \nin Iraq, we are going to see a significantly emboldened and radicalized \nIran with over 70 million people. We are going to see the prospect of--\nthat fancy word we use in foreign policy circles--modernity in the \nMiddle East evaporate. The idea that\n\n[[Page S14109]]\n\nthere are going to be more modern democratic states is going to \ndiminish, not increase. We are going to see, I predict, a \nreconsideration of the attitude about whether to look East or West in \nTurkey from Ankara from an Islamic government. We are going to see the \ncircumstances in Pakistan deteriorate because, sure as the devil, if \nthings deteriorate in Iraq and we lose the peace there, we are going to \nlose it in Afghanistan as well. We will have two failed states.\n  It is absolutely essential that we succeed, even though most of us--I \nshouldn't say most; I speak for myself--even though I did not agree \nwith the way the President went about the conduct of this war. The \nfacts are, we are there and we must succeed.\n  What do we do? We need more civil affairs officers, we need more \nspecial forces, and we need more MPs. But this is hard stuff. Our \nforces are stretched way thin in Iraq already and in Afghanistan. We \nwould have to bring folks back to Iraq for second or third tours, and \nthat is a decision no one wants to make. We have to at least consider \nit if it would make our troops safer now, increase the chances of \nsuccess and security in the triangle now being more likely than not \nbecause otherwise we just dribble this away.\n  Short of bringing in more U.S. troops, there are things we can do \nwith our forces to get a better grip on security in the region. We have \nto deal with those ammo depots. There are more than 600,000 tons of \nordnance in Iraq. That is one-third of all the munitions the United \nStates of America possesses. Of that, less than 100,000 tons have been \ndestroyed. There are also thousands of shoulder-fired missiles on the \nloose in Iraq, one of which probably brought down the helicopter last \nweek. We are offering to buy those missiles back at 500 bucks a pop.\n\n  A recent Newsweek or Time Magazine article this week pointed out a \nyoung Iraqi came up to an American military person and said: Do you \nwant to buy one of these missiles?\n  He said: Can you get more of them?\n  He said: Yes, I can get more of them.\n  He got a whole truckload of them and brought them back. I think he \ngot paid $40,000 for them. He said he would have brought back more \nexcept the truck was not big enough.\n  We have tens, hundreds, if not thousands, of these shoulder-held \nmissiles on the loose in Iraq. We are paying $500 for the retrieval of \neach one, and more than 350 have been turned in. The black market price \nfor purchasing those shoulder-held missile launchers is $5,000 a \nmissile. That is kind of hard to compete with.\n  If we had more forces in place, we could do a better job of guarding \nthose depots, but even without those forces we should be getting Iraqis \nto fence off the depots, put sensors on the gates, put more UAVs in the \nair to patrol them.\n  We have to destroy the weapons faster. Let me acknowledge this is not \na simple task. There are hundreds of depots, many of them used, and we \nhave to be very careful in destroying them. We need to protect civilian \npopulations, and we lack enough demolition experts who know how to \ndestroy this stuff without starting a California-size blaze. The \nadministration has to make securing these weapons a top priority. We \nneed to have better intelligence on the ground. It is really hard for \nour folks to tell the good guys from the bad guys and that is where \nintelligence comes in.\n  The Army itself is finding that our intelligence specialists and the \nreserves trained in civilian affairs and psychological operations do \nnot get the training they need before they are sent to Iraq, so they \nare not producing very good intelligence.\n  We do not have enough competent interpreters. We have to get help to \nrebuild Iraq from their own intelligence network. Here, too, we need a \nmuch greater sense of urgency.\n  The second way to do this is for the United States to do it itself, \nbut it is going to take more personnel and a different kind of \npersonnel to do that. The President has made clear he is not going to \ndo that.\n  There is another way to buy time until the Iraqis can fend for \nthemselves, and that is to make Iraq the world's responsibility, not \njust our own. We had that opportunity before the war, and we blew it. \nWe had that opportunity after the war, and we blew it. At the end of \nthe summer, when it became clear the security situation was not getting \nbetter, the administration decided it had to reach out, but it did not \ndo it very well. The President's speech to the United Nations was not \nvery well received, so for a third time the administration squandered \nthe opportunity to get international support in significant ways.\n  This is not totally our problem, but for the most part only Americans \nare being killed. I am convinced we have one last shot to bring the \nworld in to Iraq, and we must do everything in our power to seize that \nopportunity. This is the meat of what I have to say. I would like to \nsee President Bush not figuratively but literally go to Europe, call a \nsummit and ask for help. We will have to give up more authority in \norder to get that help, but as I keep saying, and I have been saying \nfor the last 6 months, we should stop treating Iraq as if it is some \nsort of prize we won. It is not authority I am looking to possess. We \nwould be giving up nothing as it relates to our security interests.\n\n  There are three things we can and should do to get more countries \ninvested in Iraq with troops, police, and resources. The first is we \nshould make Iraq a NATO mission. The model we should be using is not \nAfghanistan but Bosnia, Kosovo. There is a NATO general in charge of \nall the troops there. It happens to be an American most of the time \nbecause America runs NATO; America commands NATO. So it should be a \nNATO operation.\n  We are not getting other NATO forces in because they do not want to \nwork alongside of and/or under the command of a totally US-led \noperation that is not a NATO operation. So we should make Iraq a NATO \nmission.\n  General Abizaid would be put in charge of the new NATO command \nbecause the way it always works with NATO, as it does with the U.N., \nwhoever is putting up most of the responsibility, putting up most of \nthe money, most of the troops, gets to be the one in charge. So this \nshould be a NATO operation.\n  Secondly, we should create a high commissioner for Iraq who reports \nnot just to President Bush or the Secretary of Defense, but who reports \nto an international board of directors, reports to the NATO countries, \nreports to those countries that are participating. That is what we did \nin Kosovo. We never lost control of Kosovo, but there was a high \ncommissioner. The high commissioner was not an American. The first one \nhappened to be a Frenchman. The second one was a Dutchman. They \nreported to all of the capitals that were participating in the \nreconstruction of Kosovo.\n  We have a long way to go in Kosovo and a long way to go in Bosnia, \nbut thank God, knock on wood, there are no American casualties. There \nhave not been American casualties as a consequence of hostile fire. \nPeople are not killing one another in those two countries. A lot more \nhas to be done. There is no pure democracy there, but there are not a \nmillion people in the mountains about to freeze, there are not 250,000 \ndead, and Americans are not being shot. The place is secure, and we are \nonly paying 15 percent of the price in terms of money and troops. If we \nwant to get the rest of the world into this deal, because--and people \nsay, well, Joe, why would they even contemplate coming in? They are \nkind of happy to see us bog down.\n  The reason they would be happy to come in if they had the right \nenvironment is because they have as much at stake in a failed state of \nIraq as we do. For the Europeans, Iraq is their front yard. It is our \nbackyard. We have to create the environment in which they are willing \nto participate. So instead of having Mr. Bremer running the operation--\nand maybe Mr. Bremer should be the high commissioner. The phrase for \nthat is ``double hatted.'' There has to be a much larger investment by \nother countries. In return, they have to have much greater \nparticipation.\n  As much as people will not like hearing me say this, the second thing \nwe have to do is change Bremer's function into that of a high \ncommissioner reporting to Washington, London, Berlin, Paris, et cetera. \nOtherwise, we will not get the kind of participation we need.\n  Thirdly, we should transform the Iraqi Governing Council into a \nprovisional government with greater sovereign powers. Putting NATO in \ncharge\n\n[[Page S14110]]\n\nof security in Iraq offers the possibility of building a truly \nmultilateral force, with far more participation from Europeans, Asians, \nand neighboring countries. More countries will take part because they \nwould be reporting to the North Atlantic Council, not to the Pentagon.\n  We are the North Atlantic Council as well. It is a model, as I said, \nthat worked in the Balkans and now is beginning to work in Afghanistan. \nIn the Balkans, for example, many non-NATO countries, including Russia \nand some Arab states, joined the effort because they were not joining \nthe U.S. effort; they were joining a NATO effort.\n  The United States, in all of these models I am suggesting--and they \nare relatively drastic changes--would retain operational control on the \nground with General Abizaid as head of this new NATO command. And we \nretain effective control in NATO, where the United States is the lead \nplayer.\n\n  Creating an International High Commissioner for Iraq and putting him \nor her in charge of reconstruction would also attract far more \ninternational participation. The recent donors conference in Madrid was \na painful example of the price we pay for doing everything ourselves.\n  When you go into a country unilaterally, you get to handle the peace \nunilaterally. One we didn't need, the other we do.\n  Typically, as in the Balkans, the United States covers reconstruction \nefforts--pays for about 25 percent of the reconstruction costs after a \nmajor conflict. By that ratio, the $20 billion, or $18-point-something \nbillion Congress just approved for Iraq reconstruction should have \ngenerated, in Madrid, about $60 billion from the rest of the world. \nInstead, we got $13 billion, of which $9 billion was loans.\n  As long as the CPA is the sole deciding authority on how Iraq will be \nrebuilt, other countries will be reluctant to fork over real money. \nThey want a real say in how the money is spent.\n  Again, look at the model in the Balkans. Look at the model in gulf \nwar No. 1, George the first, the first gulf war. We paid only about 20 \npercent of the total cost. The rest of the world came in and made up \nthe remainder of that $60 billion.\n  What are we doing now? Again, in my view, the model we are operating \nunder is broken. We should fix it. Otherwise, we own it all. This is \nnot something we want to own alone.\n  If we go the route I am suggesting of a special representative who \nreports to the U.N. Security Council, of which we are a member--either \nway, that could be Bremer. Bremer could be double-hatted.\n  In Bosnia, the High Commissioner reports to a special steering \ncommittee led by the United States and the EEU. In Kosovo, the \nSecretary General of the United Nations designated a Special \nRepresentative who reports to the U.N. Security Council.\n  I ask a rhetorical question to any Americans who may be listening. \nWould it offend you that a high commissioner reporting to the U.N. \nSecurity Council was the model we were using? Would you be angry that \nwe didn't own it all, that we weren't the one having to put up all the \nmoney, making all the decisions, and taking all the casualties? What is \nour reluctance?\n  I said, either way, in a de facto sense, we remain in charge.\n  Finally, it seems to me we should turn the Iraqi Governing Council \ninto a true provisional government with more sovereign powers. This \ntransfer of sovereignty should not be held hostage to the very \nimportant but very complicated and time-consuming process of writing a \nnew constitution.\n  I happened to hear General Clark this morning on one of the morning \nnews shows. He pointed this out. I thought it was a great example. He \nsaid: It took us 7 years to write our Constitution. Actually, it took a \nlittle longer. How would we have felt had the French said: We helped \nliberate you from the British; we are going to stay here as the \nregional power while you write your Constitution? I am not so sure we \nwould have greeted that with a warm embrace.\n  So in order for this Iraqi Governing Council, which has not been all \nthat responsible up to now in my view, to be able to function, it seems \nto me there has to be a transfer of authority that, in fact, should not \nbe held hostage to the constitution having to be written first. It may \nrequire some changes in this provisional government to make it more \nrepresentative, but that is what we should get on with now. Nothing \nwould send a clearer message to the Iraqi people that the future is \ntheirs to build and to inherit, and nothing would make it clearer to \nthem that the enemies of that future are Saddam loyalists and \ninternational terrorists who are killing our troops, other than having \nsovereignty transferred to the Governing Council.\n  In conclusion, I am suggesting that the model we are operating under \nbe changed.\n  No. 1, sovereignty, even requiring, if need be, more representation \non the Governing Council, but more sovereignty transferred to the \nGoverning Council.\n  No. 2, a high commissioner, in place of the system we have now, on \nthe Bosnian model, reporting to more than one world capital--that may \nbe Bremer being double-hatted, but it would be a high commissioner--and \nthat to bring in the rest of the world to participate.\n  No. 3, that the military operation should be under NATO command and \nNATO responsibility.\n  I think by doing those things, we communicate several very important, \npractical, and substantive messages:\n  No. 1, we, the United States, have no designs on Iraq. We know we \ndon't, but I am not sure the Iraqi people know we don't.\n  No. 2, it communicates the notion that we are not the sole \ndetermining power in that country, that it is not solely our problem, \nit is the world's problem.\n  No. 3, that the military operation is not a U.S. operation, it is a \nNATO operation.\n  All of those things, I believe, would significantly improve the \nprospects of success and significantly diminish the prospect that we \nwill carry the entire load for as long as it takes.\n  I will elaborate on those points in more detail next week. But it \nseems to me we have to change the model now and begin the process. I \nthank the chairman for allowing me to speak and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment that I \nthink is coming up this afternoon. The reason I would like to have \npermission of the Senate to speak about it now is that I will not be \nable to be in the Chamber because of the Medicare conference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2078\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am speaking on the issue of the sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution by Senators Daschle, Enzi, Johnson, and Thomas \non the legislation that is now on the books called country-of-origin \nlabeling.\n  I believe the American consumer has a right to know the country of \norigin of the meat they are purchasing, just as consumers know the \norigin of their clothes, their cars, and their cameras. Even the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture cites in its rule that recently came out that \nthe survey findings show that country-of-origin labeling is of interest \nto the majority of consumers.\n  I said even the U.S. Department of Agriculture has said this because \nI happen to believe, in observing the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nover the last 12 months, that it has worked against the country-of-\norigin labeling legislation ever since it passed into law as part of \nthe 2002 farm bill.\n  The initial cost estimates of the U.S. Department of Agriculture were \noutlandish, and thankfully the General Accounting Office called the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture on the basis of its claims. The U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture then revised its cost estimates by lowering \nthe potential cost of the program. This newly revised figure allowed \nfor an overall cost range of between $582 million and $3.9 billion in \nthe first years.\n  Upon closer examination, even the revised cost estimates of the \nDepartment of Agriculture appear to consistently overestimate the costs \ninvolved in implementing the country-of-origin labeling law due to the \nestimate's reliance upon industry-provided sources of material--not \nindependent but from industry.\n  Clearly, the industry which is vehemently opposed to this \nlegislation, it\n\n[[Page S14111]]\n\nseems to me, would provide information which is self-serving. For that \nreason, I have a hard time accepting even the newest range of cost \nestimates even though it is far less than what came out last spring.\n  I am not here to say that everything the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has done on this legislation is bad. The recently published \nproposed rules allow for the potential use of self-certification \nthrough affidavits to transfer original origin information from one \nlevel of the supply chain to the next. That leniency on self-\ncertification is a good decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nAlso, the Department estimates producers will have the least \nrecordkeeping burden, with estimates that range between $180 to $443 \nper facility.\n  The reason I am giving U.S. Department of Agriculture credit for in \npart doing the right thing is that I want this process to continue. \nClearly, I don't agree with every aspect of the recently published \nmandatory country-of-origin labeling law proposed rule, but at least \nthe Department of Agriculture has given us something on which to chew. \nIt is a decent start. We now have a 60-day comment period to improve \nthe proposed rule.\n  I intend to not only do that myself but I intend to also let the \nDepartment know my views on it, and I am inviting Iowans--or let us say \ncitizens from any State--to send in their information to the Department \nof Agriculture. They ought to even let their Congressmen and Senators \nknow what they have told the Department about their view of this rule. \nThis gives all of us a chance to get it even closer to the intent of \nthe authors of the original legislation and to ensure that these rules \nand regulations aren't overly burdensome to the family farmer.\n  I believe we need to let the process go forward. The only way to do \nit is to protect funding for the mandatory country-of-origin labeling. \nThat funding is in dispute because of action taken by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I hope through this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we send a clear \nsignal to the conferees that we should fund this program; in other \nwords, funds going forward and the enforcement of the law that this \nCongress adopted in 2002 on the labeling of meat products.\n  It will be an awfully serious situation if we don't fund these rules \nand move forward with the enforcement of this law. People who don't \nwant to fund it do not like the law, but it puts our entire food chain \ninto jeopardy, on the one hand having to meet a law that went into \neffect in September 2002, and then in the next 12 months not having \nmoney to provide for the regulations to be carried out and make sure \neverybody knows exactly how this law is going to be enforced.\n  People who are opposed to this legislation ought to, if they do not \nlike the law--obviously, I do like the law, and that is why I am for \ntheir sense-of-the-Senate resolution--introduce legislation and have it \ndebated to see if they can repeal the old law. But they should not put \nthe farmers, the processors, the wholesalers, the retailers, and \neventually our consumers in jeopardy because of not having the money to \nmove forward.\n  Not funding this is--as the other body has not funded it--subterfuge \nfor the legislation not moving forward. Yet everybody is going to be \ninvolved with having a law on the books that is going into effect next \nyear. The law is still the law. It is our job, if we put a law on the \nbooks, to make sure that it is enforced. If we don't want to enforce \nthat law, we ought to repeal the law.\n\n  This issue of self-certification is very important. Originally, the \nidea from some people in the Department or the industry was that there \nought to be third-party verification of the origin of the meat that the \nconsumer is going to eat. Did it come from another country or did it \ncome from America? Was it raised and processed here?\n  If you have third-party verification, you can understand why it costs \nthe economy billions and billions of dollars. But that isn't how the \nFederal Government deals with the family farmers of America.\n  For all of the decades of farm programs we have had, the Federal \nGovernment has always dealt with the individual family farmer as an \nhonest person. They would ask for certification from the farmer's point \nof view as to the law as he farmed, as he raised his crops, as he \nqualified for whatever help that might be involved from the Federal \nTreasury, and that the farmer was abiding by that law. There were \nalways periodic and random audits that a farmer, including this farmer, \nwould have to comply with, just as there might be a random audit of \nyour income tax by the IRS. But the Federal Government has always \nassumed the farmer was honest when he certified something.\n  If that principle has been good for farm programs for the last 60 or \n70 years, why isn't it good enough for a farmer claiming that livestock \nwas raised in America and processed in America or whether it came \nacross the line from some other country?\n  The last point I make is for the consumers of America and for the \nretailers of America.\n  For all of the years I have been in Congress, I have never heard from \nMontgomery Ward, Sears & Roebuck, Kohl Department Stores, or from Wal-\nMart--I have never heard from anybody in America who processes or sells \nretail products--saying that products which come into this country from \nsome other country shouldn't be labeled. I have never heard those \nbusiness people complain about that. But all of a sudden, there is \nsomething to protect food for the consumer--just as we do with the \nconsumer and any other retail product, not just to protect the consumer \nbut to inform the consumer. Where does this product come from? T-shirts \nfrom Taiwan, South Korea, and China--you know it; it is on the label.\n  I have never heard any retailer or any wholesaler complain about \nthat. But now that we are going to give the consumer the same knowledge \nabout where their food comes from--from America or from some other \ncountry--somehow this is a big problem. You hear it from the packers, \nyou hear it from the processors, and you hear it from the wholesaler \nand the retailer. For some ungodly reason, I am even hearing it from \nthe national pork producers. I do not hear it from the Iowa pork \nproducers. Are the national pork producers in bed with the big packers, \nthe big processors, and the big retailers of America? Should the \nconsumers of America not know whether that hog came from Canada or from \na family farm in America?\n  The consumers are entitled to the same knowledge about the origin of \nthe products they eat as what they wear on their body or what they use \nfor a tool in their workplace. I think we need to move ahead with this \ncountry-of-origin labeling. That is why I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this sense-of-the-Senate resolution for a law that is on the \nbooks--a law that is going to go into effect in September of next year.\n  Why don't the people in the Congress of the United States who do not \nlike that law and the interest groups outside that do not like that law \nhave guts enough to come forward and repeal the law and have a clear-\ncut victory or a clear-cut defeat? Let us move on. Let us not have the \nsubterfuge of not funding it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the Senator from \nIowa for his statement. I support the amendment that will be offered by \nthe Democratic leader in a short time. It is important the American \npublic recognizes speaking on behalf of the American consumer is a \nfarmer, a Senator, but his first vocation is that as a farmer. We are \nso proud. I very much appreciate the strong, articulate statement of \nthe Senator from Iowa on this most important subject. It affects my \nfamily, my children, my grandchildren. As the Senator said, if we buy a \npair of pajamas, we know where they are made. When we buy a peach or \nbeef steak, we should know where that comes from, also. I appreciate \nthe statement.\n  I say through the Chair, to the chairman of the subcommittee, on our \nside, it appears we have about five more amendments. We have the Dorgan \namendment, which we have heard about. We heard Senator Leahy will offer \nan amendment on conservation technical assistance. Senator Daschle will \noffer a country-of-origin amendment. Senator Feingold will offer a Buy \nAmerica amendment. Senator Jeffords may offer an amendment on historic \nbonds. We are moving down the road with this legislation.\n\n[[Page S14112]]\n\n  Mr. President, as I have already indicated, I rise in support of the \nDaschle amendment, which will be offered in the next little bit, and to \nexpress strong support of the Senate for the country-of-origin labeling \nrequirements of the 2002 farm bill. I have a letter from agricultural \nand consumer groups across the country that support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record. It is \ndated October 9 and is signed by 170 different organizations from all \nover America. These are organizations that cover the width and breadth \nof this land, including Oregon Cranberry Farmers' Association, \nSustainable Earth, Texas Farmers Union, Montana Cattlemen's \nAssociation, Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Georgia Peanut Commission, \nFlorida Fruit and Vegetable Association, American Meat Goat \nAssociation, Arkansas Farmers Union, American Corn Growers Association. \nIt is important we recognize this is representative of groups all over \nAmerica that support this amendment. This list could be multiplied by \n10 if these organizations were given a little more time to gather \nsignatures.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 9, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing in representation of millions \n     of consumers and producers across America to express our \n     strong support for full funding in the fiscal year 2004 \n     agriculture appropriations bill for implementation of \n     country-of-origin labeling (COOL).\n       Senator Daschle, Senator Enzi and Senator Johnson are \n     prepared to offer a Sense of the Senate amendment instructing \n     the agriculture appropriations conferees to remove language \n     inserted into the House of Representatives spending bill, \n     which prohibits the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n     from spending funds to implement COOL. We strongly urge you \n     to support the efforts of Senators Daschle, Enzi and Johnson \n     when the amendment is introduced.\n       A report recently released by the General Accounting Office \n     (GAO) refutes the number one argument of opponents of COOL by \n     clearly stating the $2 billion price tag attached by USDA was \n     based on arbitrary assumptions and not well supported. Given \n     this recent report and the fact that USDA has yet to release \n     the preliminary rules of implementation, it is simply the \n     right thing to do to maintain implementation funding and keep \n     COOL.\n       Country-of-origin labeling is designed to provided \n     information to consumers and help U.S. producers promote \n     their own products in the marketplace. It does not need to be \n     burdensome or expensive to producers. We believe that, given \n     a choice, consumers will choose to purchase U.S.-produced \n     products. COOL does not violate any of our trade agreements. \n     In fact, the GAO report cited 48 of our 57 trading partners \n     that require country-of-origin labeling on one or more of the \n     covered commodities included in the U.S. law. Without \n     mandatory COOL, consumers in the United States will be denied \n     the ability to differentiate between U.S. and imported \n     products, while consumers in our trading partners' countries \n     maintain that right.\n       Please vote in support of the Daschle-Enzi-Johnson Sense of \n     the Senate to maintain funding of COOL.\n           Sincerely,\n         National Farmers Union; American Farm Bureau Federation; \n           R-CALF United Stockgrowers of America; Consumer \n           Federation of America; Alabama Farmers Federation; \n           Alabama Farmers Federation; Alabama Peanut Producers; \n           American Agriculture Movement of Arkansas; American \n           Agriculture Movement of Missouri; American Agriculture \n           Movement of Oklahoma; American Agriculture Movement, \n           Inc.; American Corn Growers Assoc. of Nebraska; \n           American Corn Growers Association; American Meat Goat \n           Association.\n         Arkansas Farmers Union; Beartooth Stockgrowers \n           Association; Burleigh County Farm Bureau (ND); C.A.S.A. \n           del Llano (TX); Calaveras County Cattlemen's \n           Association; California Farmers Union; Cape Code \n           Cranberry Growers' Association; Center for Rural \n           Affairs (NE); Churches' Center for Land and People \n           (WI); Citizens Organized Acting Together; Cochise-\n     Graham Cattle Growers Assoc.

The reason the organizations signed up for this is because \nthey support the right of American consumers to know the origin of the \nfood we eat. In Nevada, the Cattleman's Association and Nevada \nLivestock Association strongly support this legislation.\n  We ask, after having heard the strong statement of the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, who opposes this? That is \ninteresting. It is the House of Representatives. It is the law that \nthere be country-of-origin labeling.\n  The House of Representatives, in their version of this appropriations \nbill, wants to prevent any moneys going forward from the Federal \nGovernment to enforce the country-of-origin labeling. That is unfair.\n  Who does not support it? The House of Representatives. As I \nindicated, in their appropriations bill dealing with agriculture, they \ninserted a little provision that would not allow us to implement \ncountry-of-origin labeling. This amendment would silence our effort to \ninform consumers about the food they eat by telling them where their \nmeat, lamb, fish, and vegetables originate.\n  I was happy for my wife to buy me a pair of shoes. This pair of \nshoes, by the\n\n[[Page S14113]]\n\nway, is very comfortable. I stand a lot. These shoes are made in \nAmerica. Allen Emmonds is the brand name. I had a choice. There was a \nBrazilian brand made for people who stand a lot like I do. There was a \nFrench brand. I bought American. I had a choice. The choice was very \neasy. I was happy to have that choice.\n  If I can go to a store and find out where the shoe is made, shouldn't \nI be able to go to a grocery store and find out where the steak I am \ngoing to buy comes from or the roast or the potatoes or the \ncauliflower, whatever the case might be. If you can do it for shoes, \ncertainly it would seem you can do it for food.\n  This amendment in the House version of the bill would silence our \neffort to inform consumers about the food they eat. That is wrong. I \ncannot imagine anyone who would not want consumers to know what they \nare eating and from where it comes.\n  Who could be behind the position of the House? Is it just a bunch of \nvery educated, in the way of farm products, Members of the House of \nRepresentatives? Is it just a group of enlightened staff people who \nsuddenly said, we do not want them to enforce that law; it is not good \npolitics; it is not good public policy for people to know where their \nfood comes from.\n  In fact, why don't we just have Americans continue labeling this \nstuff ``American'' when it is not. That is what is happening now. That \nis a reason we need to stop this.\n  Why, then, is the House of Representatives so involved in this issue? \nIt is quite clear. The authors of this House provision are people who \nhave had looking over their shoulder people from the four major \nmeatpackers in this country that oppose this labeling. This legislation \ncomes from those packers. These packers, while they may not have a \nmonopoly, have about as close as you can come to a monopoly. The \npackers control about 80 percent of the beef in the U.S. market.\n  If you think they had some hand in the House of Representatives \nputting this provision in the legislation, of course they did. The \npackers do not like the country-of-origin labeling because they want to \ncontinue to sell imported beef, in effect, made in the USA. They want \nto trick, to deceive, American consumers into believing they are buying \nfood that is grown and made in America because it gives them an \nadvantage to do so, just like my shoes, just like my American shoes.\n  Nope, this suit I am wearing is not made in America; most of my suits \nare. When I have a choice, I want to buy ``Made in America.'' I want to \ndo the same with my food--or at least have the knowledge of where my \nfood comes from. As I said, most of the suits I wear are made in \nAmerica. Hickey Freeman, made in America.\n  I am looking forward to an amendment that will be offered, as I \nindicated, by my friend from Wisconsin about buying American.\n  That is what is behind the House of Representatives' provision in the \nbill. They simply have been overwhelmed by the four meatpackers in this \ncountry that control 80 percent of the beef in our market. Of course, \nthat is not what the critics of the country of origin say to the \npublic, but the public arguments are not better. Critics of the program \nclaim it is too expensive to put into effect. With a multitrillion-\ndollar budget, it is not too expensive. The General Accounting Office \nrecently found that the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate was \narbitrary and not well supported. Most cost estimates place the costs \nmuch lower than the Department of Agriculture. The Department of \nAgriculture has made other mistakes.\n  Some argue that the country-of-origin label violates trade \nagreements. That is a specious argument because 48 of our 57 trading \npartners already require country-of-origin labeling for their \ncommodities.\n\n  This allows foreign consumers to choose whether they want to support \ntheir own farmers and ranchers. American consumers deserve the same \nchoice. The House of Representatives, with its country-of-origin rider, \nwould deny that right for American consumers.\n  I believe, as some of my colleagues have said and will say, that U.S. \nfarmers and ranchers produce the highest, best quality food in the \nworld. I also believe that if American consumers are given the power of \ninformation, and the right to know, they will choose to buy American \nfood products.\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, we had a full and extensive \ndebate about country-of-origin labeling during the consideration of the \nfarm bill. It was one of the most hotly debated provisions during the \nHouse and Senate conference on the bill, again, because of the power of \nthe four meatpackers in this country. The outcome of all that debate--a \ncounty-of-origin labeling requirement--was a victory for American \nconsumers and American farmers and ranchers.\n  The House, with its anticonsumer, antifarmer, antirancher rider, is \ntrying to sneak a provision through the back door that they could not \nprevail on in open debate. We know what the rules are on appropriations \nbills. It is very difficult to strike things out of bills.\n  Americans have a right to know what they are eating. This harmful \nHouse rider would deny them that right.\n  When the opportunity comes, I will support, with a ``yea'' vote, the \nDaschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise also to talk a little bit about \ncountry-of-origin labeling. I guess I ought to tell the Senate, first, \nwhy I am inflicting my opinions on this subject on the Senate.\n  I have the honor of chairing the Subcommittee on Marketing, \nInspection, and Product Promotion of the Agriculture Committee. I was \nnot told, when I was given that assignment, that it included \nsupervising the implementation of the country-of-origin labeling law, a \nlaw the Congress passed before I was here and on which I did not have \nan opportunity to express my opinion.\n  I know feelings run high regarding that law. I have had the \nopportunity to study the issue, and I have tried, from the beginning, \nto be an honest broker in this whole process, just to try to see that \nthis law--which was passed before I got here and which is part of the \nlaw now--is implemented in a way that accomplishes what it was \noriginally intended to accomplish.\n  In the course of doing that, I have, of course, read that statute. I \nhave had a chance to talk to several of the Senators who were \ninstrumental in writing it. It is pretty clear, from the statute, the \ngist of what the Congress intended. It is like reading an essay \nquickly; you sort of get the gist of it.\n  The problem I will get to in a minute is, when you go into the \ndetails of it, a lot of it is rather vague. That is going to raise \nproblems in the implementation unless we do something. But I think the \ngist of it is pretty clear. I am going to restrict my remarks to beef \neven though, of course, the bill covers a whole wide range of different \nproducts. But for simplicity's sake, I will talk about beef.\n\n  From the bill, it is pretty clearly the intention is that all beef be \nlabeled, that there be specific labels for American beef, that we begin \nto control what people are calling American beef.\n  The legislation references and, in some respects, in some sense, \nseems to want to be modeled on some existing labeling programs. But, as \nI will say in a minute, it does not make clear exactly what the \nlegislation is. It puts the burden of compliance on the retailers, \nwhich is very significant in getting us where we are now with the \nimplementation of it.\n  The legislation seems to contemplate that it be enforceable by the \nDepartment with some kind of a grace period. There is a section in the \nlegislation relating to the grace period.\n  So if you read the legislation, it seems to me the gist of it, of \nwhat it intended, is pretty clear. I think what I have said is \nconsistent with the conversations I have had with Senators who were \nvery responsible and have acted in good faith from the beginning in \nwriting this legislation and are now interested in its implementation.\n  The problem is, the legislation is vague in a lot of respects. It \nimposes a very serious potential liability on people, but in certain \ncrucial aspects--in fact, in a lot of crucial aspects--it is really not \nclear exactly what they have to do to avoid that liability.\n  It is not that anybody intended the vagueness. I know what it is like \nwhen you are in the middle of a conference committee and trying to come \nup with legislation under all the pressures of time and the need to \ncompromise and\n\n[[Page S14114]]\n\nto check with a bunch of different people. It is hard to do something \nthat has 100 percent precision under those circumstances.\n  Let me go through some of the respects in which I think the \nlegislation is a little difficult to understand.\n  As I said before, the statute lists certain model programs, and \nreferences them, such as the Florida labeling statute. It does not make \nclear, however, whether those programs are safe harbors--in other \nwords, whether the people who are supposed to comply with this and who \ndo it in a way that those programs operate, are safe from liability.\n  As a matter of fact, the suggestion in the legislation is it is \nreasonably clear they are probably not safe because the legislation \nseems to require things that are not in some of these model programs. \nBut if those models are not safe harbors, then what are they? What \npurpose do they really have? It is just not clear from the statute.\n  The statute makes clear, it seems to me, that you can only call \nsomething American beef if that beef was born, raised, and processed in \nthe United States. I think it is pretty clear that was one of the major \npurposes of the statute. But it does not say what the label ought to \nsay, and it really addresses in no respect whatsoever what you should \nput on the label for beef that you do not want to claim was born, \nraised, and processed in the United States. It requires that foreign \nbeef, within the meaning of the statute, be labeled, but it gives no \nclue whatsoever as to what that label ought to say--again, even given \nthe fact that the statute does assign substantial liability if you get \nit wrong.\n  So the intent is pretty clear, with regard to American beef, that it \nhas to be born, raised, and processed in the United States if you want \nto call it American beef. It does not say exactly what that label \nshould say and is very unclear and supplies really no guidance as to \nwhat the label should say if you do not want to call it American beef.\n\n  The statute prohibits a mandatory tracing system in order to \ndetermine whether a label is correct. It says you cannot have a \nmandatory tracing system, but at the same time it requires that there \nbe some kind of verification system. It certainly is not clear, I \nthink, to anybody how we can have a mandatory verification system that \ndoes not include a mandatory tracing system. Now, I am not saying it is \nimpossible; I am saying it is not clear.\n  Again, there are very substantial liabilities for people who make the \nbest guess they can from the statute and then get it wrong. The statute \nsays the Department of Agriculture can enforce it at up to about \n$10,000, potentially, per violation. It does not say whether that is \nthe exclusive means of enforcement.\n  The statute is not clear whether there is some private cause of \naction, whether a class action in State or Federal court could be \nbrought against a retailer that does have the burden of compliance that \nfails in some respect to comply with the statute.\n  The statute does not say how this statute, the country-of-origin \nlabeling law, relates to other labeling statutes. So it is not clear \nwhether a violation of the country-of-origin labeling law is also a \nviolation, for example, of the food safety laws or the other labeling \nlaws or consumer protection laws or how that is going to relate to \nState consumer protection laws.\n  I do not raise these issues as if this were some kind of a law school \nexam. I raise them because it is very important to understand this is a \nstatute that people are going to have to follow regardless of what the \nregulations say, at least within limits.\n  Let me go on to the next point because I think it is essential we \nmake it in order to focus exactly on where we are now. We can concede, \nagain, the good faith of both sides on this. We certainly can concede \nthe good faith and intentions of the Senators who drafted this bill and \nthe Congress that passed it.\n  What we know is that the statute unquestionably does this. It imposes \na labeling requirement with substantial liability for retailers, the \nlast business organization to handle the food before consumers get it, \nif they violate that labeling requirement.\n  What I want to suggest to the Senate is that what the regulations \nsay, while, of course, it is important because it bears on how the \nstatute might be interpreted, is a lot less important in determining \nhow this is practically going to be construed and implemented than what \nthe companies, the chief retailers in the country think, as their \nlawyers examine this law. How this law is implemented is going to \ndepend on the advice the general counsel for Wal-Mart and Safeway and \nGiant give their executives as they consider how to implement this law.\n  I have the documents. I have talked to people in this position. Given \nthe vagueness in the law and the potential liability in the law, they \nare advising their clients to take the most conservative position \npossible in order to protect themselves against the worst case scenario \nfor liability. They are not going to take a risk of some big class \naction lawsuit against them or some huge investigation by the \nDepartment of Agriculture with all the attendant negative publicity \nbecause they have taken a chance and interpreted this law as requiring \nless than perhaps it would require.\n  This is why we are hearing back--all of us who have farm State \nconstituents, and many who don't--from people in the production chain, \nin the distribution chain of food who are saying: This law is going to \nrequire us to do this and this and impose this cost and take that \nmeasure, not necessarily because of what was originally intended, but \nbecause the confusing aspects of the statute give rise to vagueness \nthat creates the potential for liability that these companies are \nsimply not going to risk. They are going to do what they have to do to \nprotect themselves. Whatever it costs, they are going to do it and pass \nit down the production chain. That is my concern, that we end up, as a \nresult of unintended vagueness in the law--I will concede to the \nSenate--passing these costs of production down where eventually they \nwill settle on the weakest competitors in the food chain, which is, of \ncourse, the producers.\n  So my cattlemen and yours may end up having to bear all these extra \ncosts that are generated because of these concerns, and we end up \nhurting the very people, along with consumers, we are trying to help in \npassing this law.\n  What are some of the things the retailers may do? We have been \ncollecting a lot of information. I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               IBP, Inc.\n\n       Dear Producer: As you know, federal law requires that \n     country of origin labeling appear on all retail meats sold in \n     the U.S. by September 30, 2004. The labels must state where \n     the livestock was born, raised and slaughtered. USDA has \n     stated self-certification will not be allowed, nor will the \n     government step in to certify where livestock were born or \n     raised. Retailers have also stated they will require \n     verifiable records, and they do not plan to accept self-\n     certification. Thus the responsibility for accurate \n     documentation of these required facts rests exclusively on \n     the livestock, meat and retail industries.\n       IBP, Inc's (part of the Tyson Foods family) major retail \n     customers are already notifying us that we--and our \n     suppliers--must have the recordkeeping systems in place this \n     year to be able to comply with next year's mandate. Here is \n     what our retail customers want us to do:\n       1. Sticker all covered commodities with country of origin \n     information that complies with the law and USDA regulations. \n     Provide enough signage to ensure one sign for each retail \n     display in every shipment of product that cannot bear a \n     label.\n       2. Contract to maintain records and a verifiable audit \n     trail to establish the accuracy of the country of origin \n     information that retailers receive from packers for covered \n     commodities.\n       3. Indemnify retailers for any fines or other costs they \n     incur as a result of the country of origin information that \n     packers provide or fail to provide.\n       4. Segregate all covered commodities by country of origin \n     throughout the production chain until they are delivered to \n     the retailer, and maintain documentation verifying the \n     efficacy of the packer's segregation plan.\n       5. Audits. Provide retailers with the results of an audit \n     conducted by USDA or another certified independent third \n     party to establish that packers have the systems in place to \n     ensure the accuracy of the country of origin information that \n     they provide retailers.\n       In order to meet these customer requirements, it will be \n     necessary for you to provide IBP with verifiable information \n     on the place of birth and every location where livestock was \n     raised for each animal marketed. IBP,\n\n[[Page S14115]]\n\n     Inc. will require you, as our suppliers, to provide us \n     evidence of your recordkeeping program for gathering and \n     maintaining this information. Only you can document and \n     verify the born-in, raised-in components of the law. The \n     documentation costs--as well as the independent, third-party, \n     verification costs--will also be your responsibility. \n     Specifically, we will require you to:\n       1. Provide third-party verified documentation of where the \n     livestock we purchase from you were born and raised.\n       2. Provide a signed legal affidavit with each load of \n     livestock we purchase from you stating that there is a third-\n     party verified audit trail in place that identifies where the \n     livestock in each load were born and raised.\n       3. Provide IBP, Inc. access to your records so that we can \n     perform random producer audits as necessary to satisfy our \n     customers, verifying that an accurate audit trail is in place \n     and that it is being verified by an acceptable third party.\n       4. Indemnify us for liability we incur that is a result of \n     producer noncompliance.\n       For those of you raising market cattle or hogs you intend \n     to sell to a packer after September 30, 2004, you should \n     begin your documentation on all calves immediately and on all \n     hogs no later than November 2003.\n       Many in the retail, meat and producer communities are \n     concerned about the costs, benefits, legal and logistical \n     challenges posed by this new law. As a result, there is a \n     united industry effort to either repeal mandatory country of \n     origin labeling for meat altogether or to convert it to a \n     permanent, voluntary program. Either way, we need the \n     producer community's help. If you share these concerns, we \n     urge you to contact your Senators or Member of Congress, as \n     well as your trade associations, and express your opinion.\n       Furthermore, we urge you to share your thoughts with your \n     fellow producers and USDA by attending one of the USDA \n     ``listening sessions'' on this issue, expected to occur this \n     coming spring. USDA is charged with writing the regulations \n     for the final, mandatory country of origin labeling law, and \n     they need to hear from all affected parties. If you share our \n     concerns, we hope you will attend any meeting in your area \n     and speak out.\n       We will attempt to contact you within the next few months \n     to learn about your proposed recordkeeping plans. In the \n     meantime, if you have questions, please feel free to contact \n     one of us and we will try to help you. If we are not \n     available, you may ask for Bob Hansen in Hog Procurement, \n     John Gerber in Cattle Procurement or John DeWitt in Cattle \n     Procurement.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bruce Bass,\n       Senior Vice President, Cattle Procurement.\n     Gary Machan,\n       Vice President, Hog Procurement.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. This is from IBP. They are packers. They are reporting \nwhat their major retail customers are notifying them that they have to \ndo. Here is what the retail customers want us to do. I quote:\n\n       Stick all covered commodities with country of origin \n     information that complies with the law and USDA regulations. \n     Provide enough signage to ensure one sign for each retail \n     display in every shipment of product that cannot bear a \n     label.\n       Contract to maintain records and a verifiable audit trail \n     to establish the accuracy of the country of origin \n     information that retailers receive from packers for covered \n     commodities.\n\n  I will not read the whole letter. But suffice it to say, the major \nretailers are going to reorganize their inventory and distribution \nlines so they can keep separate these different kinds of beef. That is \ngoing to generate cost. They are going to require that as much beef as \npossible be prepackaged. This is interesting. It may result, \nunfortunately, in their laying off some meat cutters and people on the \npremises of the store who have been cutting meat fresh there. They are \ngoing to get it prepackaged because then they have to do as little as \npossible at the store. That may tend to encourage vertical integration \nin the production chain, which is the opposite of what we want.\n  They are going to set up an audit system and require packers to have \nsoftware and other kinds of records that will network into the \nretailers systems so they can trace back. And with every piece of meat \nthey have in the counter, they are going to want to be able to trace \nthat back to a particular cow so they can protect themselves in the \nevent they are audited.\n  Then, of course, this will domino down the line of production. The \npackers are going to have to have this software. They are going to \nreorganize some of their warehousing and inventory facilities. The \nauction barns and feedlots are going to have to have software which is \ncompliant with this whole system. I visited auction barns, and they \nshowed me how they are going to have to change where the cows are. They \nare going to tell the producers that they are going to have to be able \nto be compliant and network into their systems of verification and \ntracing when they bring cows to the auction barns to sell.\n  I don't think we intended any of this. As I read the statute, I can't \neven stand here and tell you that the statute suggests that is \nabsolutely the intention. But that is a possible, plausible \ninterpretation of it. Even if the regulation said something entirely \ndifferent, I don't think it would make any difference.\n  The statute is what imposes the liability. The statute is supreme \nover the regulation. And the lawyers for these various retailers who \nare interpreting this are going to look first and foremost at the \nstatute. They are going to act in a manner that protects their clients \nfrom the downside risk of substantial liability that arises because of \ncertain unintended but, I think, nevertheless very real vagaries and \nvagueness in the law.\n  What are we left with? We can allow this process to play itself out, \nbasically not do anything as the effective date of the act approaches, \nwhich is October of next year. It is already having an impact because \npeople are raising cattle right now that they are going to sell after \nOctober of next year and that they are going to have to be able to \ntrace back. That is the reason we are beginning to hear the lead edges \nof the concerns about this because they don't know what they are \nsupposed to do to comply with the law. They are concerned they may have \nto do all these things I have talked about.\n\n  We can allow it to play itself out, kind of like a tragic play that \nyou watch and just hope for a surprise good ending, and maybe we will \nget one. Maybe all this will sort itself out.\n  We can repeal the law and replace it with something that is \nvoluntary. I know that is what a lot of people want to do. That is \nprobably what a lot of people in the House want to do. I am going to \nsay in candor to the Senate that my evaluation of the risk here is such \nthat I would prefer at this stage, if the only two choices are no \nmandatory law or the law we have now with the downside risks we have \nnow, I would rather have no mandatory law.\n  But there is a third alternative. We can fix the law. We don't have \nto end it. We can mend it. We can go in and in the same good faith in \nwhich this law was passed and the same good faith in which Senators \nhave spoken on the floor today, and look at the areas that have given \nrise to uncertainty within the retailing community and the whole rest \nof the chain of production of this food, all the way down to the \nproducers we are trying to help, and we can say: We can make our \nintention clear; we can give you the level of certainty you need to be \nable to implement this law and comply with this law in the manner that \nwe all are saying now we originally intended.\n  The law we passed in the farm bill doesn't have to be our final \nstatement on the matter. We don't have to be getting into these kinds \nof arguments. That is a third alternative in which I would be very \nhappy to participate.\n  I will say, I don't intend to support this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution--not because I don't understand the frustration that has led \nup to it; not because I necessarily disagree with what I have heard on \nthe Senate floor about the motives that may have been working in the \nHouse; not because I am against, personally, a mandatory country-of-\norigin labeling law; not because, as the Senator from Nevada said, I am \nagainst what he was saying about consumers knowing where their food \ncomes from. Maybe there is a good niche market available. Maybe if we \ncan do this in a way that works, consumers will look at this and they \nwill want to buy that American beef and it will help our producers. \nThat would be great.\n  But it does seem to me now that nobody is really satisfied with these \nregulations. Some people believe the regulations are an accurate \nreflection of the law, and they are not satisfied with the law. But \nthey don't like the fact that the regulations are the way they are.\n  Then there are people who think the regulations are not an accurate \nreflection of the law, and they don't like the regulations the way they \nare. So it does seem to me that maybe the House\n\n[[Page S14116]]\n\nhas done the right thing--albeit, perhaps, for the wrong reason--in \nsaying: Let's not implement the regulations.\n  I will say, if the House feels that not implementing the regulations \nmeans the law isn't going to go into effect, they need to consult some \ndifferent lawyers. That law reads that the effective date is in October \nof next year. Whether there are regulations or not, that liability is \ngoing into effect then. If we have a level of discomfort, as I do at \nthis stage, with how the statute reads, we better do something about it \nin time so the people we are trying to help will enjoy the benefits of \nthe law we passed 2 years ago.\n  Mr. President, it has been an experience for me to investigate and \noversee this implementation. At this point I will say I stand ready to \nwork with anybody on either side in trying to make certain we get a \nresult that is at least acceptable and, I hope, is good for our \nproducers. In my discussions with Senators, I have come to have a great \ndeal of respect for their sincerity and passion on this issue. I don't \nsee, given that, why we cannot come up with something that will work \nbetter for everybody than what we have now.\n  With that, I will yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. TALENT. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In fairness, I have supported this policy. When I return \nhome and meet with people in grocery store chains that serve his State \nand mine, they have raised some legitimate questions, as far as I am \nconcerned, about how much is required. It seems to me to be not a great \nburden to ask them to put some notice, for example, that the bananas \nare from Costa Rica or from some other country. Most of their concerns \nseem to be directed toward meat and whether or not they can \nlegitimately trace the meat, and through all the requirements of the \nlegislation and how much time is involved. I come to this issue \nrealizing that whenever regulation is proposed, it is usually the first \ndefense of the opponents to say it is going to cost 10 times as much as \nyou would imagine to implement it.\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri--and this is an honest question, and \nI have no predisposition on his position on this issue--can he say, as \nhe is standing there in opposition to this, that the cost estimates \ncoming out are reasonable, in light of what is being asked of these \ngrocery chains?\n  Mr. TALENT. I appreciate the Senator's question. I am happy to answer \nhim in complete candor. I have not had the capacity in my subcommittee \nand in my office to be able to quantify what the costs are. I do know \nthat actors in the chain of production, who I don't think have a big ax \nto grind--I am not talking about the packers here--have told me they \nare very concerned with what they are going to have to do to comply \nwith this. It is chiefly the retailers, but not just them; also auction \nbarns, and I have had producer organizations come; and I think their \nsense is that the thing that we are basically intending--as the Senator \nis saying, let consumers know where the beef comes from--is something \nwe probably could handle at an affordable level.\n  But there is enough uncertainty in this, which they are not willing \nto risk, and the Senator can understand that they don't want to face--\nor be the ones at risk of facing a huge liability if they get it wrong. \nSo it is reasonable to believe that the potential cost of this is very \nsubstantial. I can say that to the Senator. I cannot say it is $2 \nbillion or half a billion. I just cannot tell the Senator that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to raise another issue. Really, I didn't \nthink about it until August. I heard from two different grocery \nchains--one based in Chicago and one in St. Louis--about this \nlegislation, and it goes as follows: If you establish a burden on a \ngrocery store or a chain to follow these regulations, it necessarily \ninvolves manpower. People will have to keep records and label products, \nand all of that is part of it.\n\n  How much? As the Senator said, and I agree, I cannot quantify it. I \ndon't know how much that is. The point made to me is that the Wal-Marts \nof the world, which pay rock-bottom wages, with no health benefits, \nwill be able to come up with the manpower at a much lower cost than \nsome of the major grocery store chains, some of which are union-\norganized, that pay a living wage and health benefits. They say to us, \nyou are once again giving a competitive advantage to the Wal-Marts of \nthe world that pay these low wages, with no benefits, to the \ndisadvantage of grocery store companies who are trying to be good \nneighbors and good corporate citizens and provide decent wages and \nbenefits.\n  Has the Senator heard this observation?\n  Mr. TALENT. I have. I have heard a number of things from retailers. \nOne chain told me they are probably going to have to end up laying off \nmany meatcutters because more of it will be prepackaged. I mentioned \nthat in my remarks. I have retailers telling me they are going to \nadvertise less for beef.\n  One fellow said: I don't want a lot of beef if I have this potential \nliability. I will simply advertise more for chicken. It will hurt the \nsmaller stores in the more rural areas, and the bigger unionized stores \nto some extent. In fairness to the Senators who supported this, and in \ngood faith still support it, I want to say a lot depends on how exactly \nthese companies interpret the law and what risk level they are willing \nto go to.\n  My concern as a lawyer--and I think the Senator would probably \nagree--is that their general counselors are going to say: We are not \ngoing to take a chance. Tell everybody all up and down the production \nchain, this is what we want from them, and they are going to have to \nbear the cost.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. TALENT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from South Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am a bit confounded. I have to admit \nthat some of the great concerns expressed about country-of-origin \nlabeling for meat are being raised at a time when USDA has not yet \nissued a final statement about what the regulations are even going to \nbe.\n  The USDA has considerable discretion, based on the legislation that \npassed this body and is now part of the farm bill. So a lot of this \nfrenzy going on is about final regulations that are not yet in place.\n  Let me add that we are soon going to see Senator Daschle offer an \namendment, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, relative to country-of-\norigin labeling that the Senate conferees sought to stay with the \nSenate approach and reject the House approach to delay implementation. \nThat effort on the part of Senator Daschle, joined by our Republican \ncolleague, Senator Enzi of Wyoming, and myself, is supported by some \n135 agricultural organizations, as Senator Reid has noted, including, I \nsay to my friend and colleague from Missouri, Missouri Farmers Union, \nMissouri National Farmers Organization, Missouri Rural Crisis Center, \nand the Missouri Stockgrowers Association, not to mention the American \nFarm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union.\n  So from the left to the right, across the entire spectrum of \nagricultural and rural organizations, there is overwhelming support \ntranscending party-line differences in support of this amendment that \nis going to be offered by Senator Daschle.\n  The amendment directs the Senate conferees to insist that the final \nAgriculture appropriations bill should not restrict or delay the \nimplementation of country-of-origin labeling for meat.\n  Mr. President, there are interests in this country that have \nconvinced the House to include language in its version of this year's \nAgriculture appropriations bill to interfere with the USDA rulemaking \nprocess by delaying for up to 1 full year implementation of country-of-\norigin labeling for meat and meat products only. The law in the current \nfarm bill provides for country-of-origin labeling for fruit, \nvegetables, and for meat. But it is only meat that has been singled out \nfor this delay, keeping in mind, of course, that the farm bill already \nprovided for 2 years of delay in the implementation of a mandatory \nprogram as it is.\n\n  This interruption is simply not justified, and it serves to placate \nonly those special interests who profit from the status quo by, \nfrankly, camouflaging foreign meat products.\n  I understand there are certain interests that have foreign meat that \ncomes\n\n[[Page S14117]]\n\ninto the country, and this is not a trade barrier. We are suggesting \nthere be no trade barrier. If people want to eat Argentine beef or \nMexican meat, they are certainly entitled to make that choice, but it \nought to be a knowing choice. That is all we are suggesting, that \npeople get to know the origin of their shoes, shirts, and auto parts.\n  Why should the United States be among the last of the industrialized \ndemocracies in the world to allow our consumers to know the origin of \nthe meat products they feed their families? It is a very simple \nquestion. It would strike most people as common sense that in this day \nand age, people ought to have the opportunity to know the origin of the \nproducts they are buying, especially products they are feeding their \nfamilies.\n  The farm bill already included a very lengthy 2-year implementation \nprocess for country-of-origin labeling, and USDA is now just half way \nthrough the rulemaking procedure. To prematurely disconnect country-of-\norigin labeling for meat from this process is unfair and will harm U.S. \nlivestock producers and American consumers alike who stand to benefit \nfrom a country-of-origin labeling program.\n  We need to allow USDA to continue with the process of allowing the \npublic, both those opposed and those supportive of country-of-origin \nlabeling, to interact with USDA in their responsibility to implement \nthis law for the fall of 2004.\n  There has been submitted for the Record a letter signed by 135 farm, \nranch, and consumer organizations supportive of our bipartisan sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. President, these organizations represent more than 50 million \nAmericans. Additionally, the most important and influential farm and \nconsumer groups in the Nation support country-of-origin labeling, \nincluding the National Farm Bureau, the National Farmers Union, and the \nConsumer Federation of America. I think it can be fairly said this is \nas much, even more so, a consumer issue as it is a livestock producer \nissue.\n  It is now the job of the Senate to stand up for the majority of U.S. \ncitizens and fix what special interests have convinced the House to do. \nA delay in implementation of country-of-origin labeling for meat is a \nseriously misguided effort because country-of-origin labeling is the \nonly method we have now to differentiate and identify meat that comes \nfrom our country as opposed to meat that comes from other countries; \nfor instance, meat that may come from a BSE-infected, mad-cow-infected \ncountry. We don't claim country-of-origin labeling is, per se, a food \nsafety issue, but it certainly is a consumer confidence issue at a time \nwhen meat may very soon be coming into the United States from Canada, a \ncountry where BSE was recently identified. Now USDA is talking about \nallowing these younger cattle to come into the country from Canada, \nwhile at the same time our Japanese friends are telling us that BSE is, \nindeed, possible in these younger livestock.\n  If we are going to preserve confidence in the high quality product \nUnited States livestock producers have available, have created for the \nAmerican consumer, then consumers need to be able to make a knowing \nchoice. You can argue for them, these are decisions other people can \nmake for you, that you ought to simply take on blind faith the food \ninspection and safety of the meat that is served in America, that is \nsold in America. Why shouldn't the United States be among the few \nindustrialized democracies in the world that says: No, we will not \nallow you to make that choice; this is information you don't need, and \nwe'll decide for you that you don't need this information?\n  Last week, USDA announced a plan to open the U.S. border to imports \nof Canadian live cattle, a plan that could be implemented in the first \nquarter of the 2004 calendar year. I am disappointed USDA appears more \nserious to opening our border to Canadian cattle than they are to \nimplementing country-of-origin labeling. If they open floodgates to \nnearly 1 million head of Canadian cattle early in 2004, and if Congress \nsimultaneously postpones the implementation of country-of-origin \nlabeling for meat, the American consumers will have no way to determine \nwhether they are buying Canadian or U.S. beef.\n  Again, if their choice is to buy Canadian beef, they certainly have \nthe legal right to do so, but they ought to have an opportunity to \nknow. They ought to have an opportunity to make that choice, and it \nought to be a knowing choice. That is what makes the market forces in \nAmerica work so well; the sales are transparent. People get to know the \nquality and origins and the value of the products they buy, and they \nlet the best product win.\n  To camouflage origins of meat is contrary to those free market \ndecisionmaking processes. It is no secret, country-of-origin delay, \nmatched with the deluge of Canadian cattle imports, recklessly places \nconsumer confidence at risk and could lead to serious economic harm for \nUnited States cattle ranchers.\n  Furthermore, postponing implementation of country-of-origin labeling \nfor meat neglects demands of our most important and valuable export \nmarkets. Japan and South Korea have written to the Department of \nAgriculture seeking our assurances to provide country-of-origin \nlabeling for all U.S. beef exports to those countries because those \ncountries do not want Canadian beef to be commingled with our exports.\n  The same day USDA announced their plan to allow Canadian cattle into \nthe U.S., it was reiterated by Japan that the U.S. ought to guarantee \nno beef from Canadian-born cattle is exported to Japan. The only method \nto certify origin of beef exports to Japan and our other important \ntrade partners is to implement country-of-origin labeling.\n  A delay of country-of-origin labeling seriously jeopardizes our most \nimportant exports of beef, which will certainly lead to economic injury \nto America's cattle men and women.\n  We face a simultaneous problem: One, that our own consumers are being \ndenied the information they need to have confidence, to make knowing \nchoices about the meat they serve their families and, at the same time, \nwe are putting in great jeopardy the export market.\n  Japan is the largest buyer of American beef in the world, and they \nare saying: Look, we don't want to buy your beef if you can't certify \nto us this is, in fact, American beef you are selling us, We can't do \nthat right now because we don't have a country-of-origin system in \nplace. So we find ourselves not only doing a disservice to American \nconsumers and American families, but we also are setting ourselves up \nin a circumstance where we can take a catastrophic hit to our export \nmarkets at the same time.\n  Eighty-four percent of our major trade partners already have country-\nof-origin labeling for food products, including meat--84 percent. That \nmeans 48 of our 57 major trade partners already have country-of-origin \nlabeling. Clearly this is not rocket science. It does not have to be \ncostly. In fact, in the United States, we already have country-of-\norigin labeling in some niche areas. It is required that meat that goes \ninto the School Lunch Program be American meat. It is self-certified. \nIt seems to work. We have a Black Angus Program, and we have other \nprograms that already work. They are not costly. It is not that \nexpensive.\n  This notion that somehow country-of-origin labeling has to be some \nimmensely expensive and complicated process is foolishness. If all we \ndid was keep track of the meat that comes into the United States, that \nalone would be enough to be able to certify everything else is American \nwithout requiring anything in particular of American livestock \nproducers.\n  Well, the packers and retailers would like us to think that country-\nof-origin labeling is some enormously expensive and burdensome program, \nand they have been working very hard at trying to frighten both \nproducers and consumers to think just that. There have been letters \nthat have gone out and there has been a lot of scare talk that has been \ngoing on, and there is no doubt they enjoy taking the profits of \nmingling foreign meat with U.S. meat, selling it all off as a premium \nproduct, without allowing consumers to make a knowing choice. I \nappreciate there are those from certain parts of the United States who \nenjoy the benefit of bringing in Mexican feeder calves, fattening them \nand then selling them as an American product. They are able to\n\n[[Page S14118]]\n\nprofit at a higher level than they would otherwise by not allowing \nAmerican consumers to know what in fact it is they are buying.\n  We are not suggesting one cannot bring in feeder calves from anywhere \none wants, one cannot bring in meat from anywhere one wants. We are \nsuggesting consumers ought to know the difference.\n  Nearly a year ago, USDA said country-of-origin labeling would cost $2 \nbillion. Then Senator Daschle and I asked the Government Accounting \nOffice, the GAO, to assess whether USDA's cost was accurate. GAO said \nthe Department of Agriculture's initial recordkeeping cost was \n``questionable and not well supported.''\n  Now USDA has reduced their recordkeeping cost estimate by $1.5 \nbillion of that $2 billion. Furthermore, country-of-origin labeling is \nnot going to result in a mountain of red tape as some of the critics \nsuggest. In fact, USDA's proposed rule states most livestock producers \nalready maintain the types of records--birth, health, and so on--that \nwould be relied upon to verify the origin of animals under country-of-\norigin labeling. People simply need to do what they are already doing.\n  Even if individuals have questions or concerns about country-of-\norigin labeling, the best way to ensure those questions and concerns \nare addressed is to allow USDA to continue forward with its very \nlengthy rulemaking process. It is through this process only that all \nparties can submit questions and develop alternatives to ensure \nimplementation of country-of-origin labeling does not lead to red tape \nand overwhelming costs. We can move away from some of the scare talk \nand from some of the reckless rhetoric and in fact allow USDA to \nevaluate whatever issues are raised in a thoughtful, deliberative \nfashion, as they have the opportunity currently to do.\n  Every stakeholder group has 60 days to submit written comments to \nUSDA with respect to their proposed rule to implement country-of-origin \nlabeling. Then USDA will incorporate those comments into the final \nrule, which is not even going to be written until well into the year \n2004.\n  USDA's proposed rule is far from perfect--I would be the first to say \nthat--but compared to what it looked like nearly a year ago, USDA has \nbeen making improvements and has been making progress. With balanced \npublic input and assurance that the implementation process will not be \ninterrupted, maybe then those with questions and concerns can work with \nUSDA in the coming year to help make the law and address the concerns \nthey raise.\n  I commend Senator Daschle, Senator Enzi, and others in a bipartisan \nspirit, who have offered support for this amendment. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it. All this simply does is to say a law which is \nalready law, which has been signed by the President, is part of the \nfarm bill, is in the midst of the rulemaking process now, be allowed to \ngo forward. Allow USDA to take the comments from the public, allow USDA \nto evaluate all of that, perhaps make still further changes on their \nway to a final regulation, and then we will see where we are.\n\n  To stop the process midway through the regulation listening process \ncannot possibly serve the American public, the American consumers, the \nAmerican agricultural economy well.\n  Again, I thank Senator Daschle for his extraordinary leadership on \nthis issue, and what he is trying to do to bring some sense to our \ndeliberations on this Agriculture appropriations bill and to send some \ndirection to the conferees to not prematurely pull the plug on the \nrulemaking process USDA is in the midst of now.\n  I urge my colleagues to be supportive of this sense-of-the-Senate \namendment Senator Daschle is shortly going to formally introduce.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2078\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself, \n     Mr. Enzi, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Grassley, \n     Mr. Burns, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, \n     and Mr. Kerry proposes an amendment numbered 2078.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding country of \n                     origin labeling requirements)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the conferees on the \n     part of the Senate on this bill shall insist that no limits \n     on the use of funds to enforce country of origin labeling \n     requirements for meat or meat products be included in the \n     conference report accompanying the bill.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent if I might find my \nway into the order so I might also offer an amendment. I see the \nSenator from Wyoming, who I expect is wanting to speak, and because we \nwill probably go back and forth, I wonder if I might get unanimous \nconsent to be recognized following the presentation from the Senator \nfrom Wyoming. I know the Senator from South Dakota has now offered an \namendment. My expectation would be the Senator from Wyoming will speak \nnext, but might I receive consent to be recognized following the \npresentation from the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to begin by complimenting the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota for his remarkable statement. I \nam not sure anything is left to be said. I think he covered it so well \nand so eloquently.\n  He, as I think all of our colleagues recall, is the true author, the \nfounder, the initiator of this issue during our deliberation on the \nfarm bill itself. It is with great wisdom he spoke today and I think \nwith great persuasion. We ought to listen to the Senator from South \nDakota. Again, I thank him for all he has done to get us to this point \nand the efforts he has made to ensure we understand the consequences of \nour actions today.\n  Let me also thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, \nfor all of his work and help in making this amendment a bipartisan \neffort, to ensure that we, as colleagues interested in agriculture, a \nstrong economy, and rural America, do the right thing with regard to \nthis particular question involving better information and better choice \nfor all consumers and an effort to help producers as well.\n  There are others also who have played a very significant role; my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan; Senator Grassley, who gave \na passionate speech earlier today on this amendment, Senator Burns, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Baucus, Senator Conrad, Senator Harkin, \nSenator Thomas; a number of Senators have expressed themselves and have \nbeen the driving force from the very beginning as we have urged careful \nthought about how the Congress ought to proceed with regard to this \nquestion.\n  The Senator from South Dakota made several important points, but if \nthere is one that is most important it is simply we are now in a very \ndelicate, deliberate rulemaking stage. What our colleagues in the House \nhave chosen to do is to say, we want that stage to end; we want to \nterminate rulemaking before we even see what the rule is; we want to \nmake a decision about the decision prior to the time the decision has \neven been made.\n  For us through legislation to interject our own voice, without \nallowing the Department of Agriculture to respond, as they are required \nto do in the farm bill itself, passed last year, I think is terrible \npolicy but also premature.\n  What we said in the farm bill, and what my colleague from South \nDakota\n\n[[Page S14119]]\n\nsaid so well this afternoon, is we ought to bring agriculture, consumer \nprotection, and information into the modern era. As he noted, 48 other \ncountries, 84 percent of our trading partners, already do that. They \nhave already recognized the importance of good consumer information.\n  I find it ironic we can tell people where bananas come from, where \nlettuce comes from, where our clothing comes from, where just about \neverything else comes from, but we have those who say it is impossible \nfor us to tell people from where our meat comes. When it comes to meat, \nwe can tell people whether it is choice or whether it is prime, but we \njust cannot tell people from where it is imported. I do not think \nanybody can accept that logic.\n  If we can decide the difference between choice and prime, we can \ndecide the difference between Mexico and the United States. That is all \nwe are talking about, a recognition that consumers have just as much \nright to know where their meat comes from as they have a right to know \nhow good the quality. When we passed the legislation, frankly on a \noverwhelming bipartisan basis, we said yes; we said the consumers ought \nto have that right.\n  That is what we are trying to do today: First, to allow the \nrulemaking process to go forward. But, second, to come down to a pretty \nfundamental question. It is pretty fundamental. Should consumers have \nthe right to know? I believe the answer to that question is yes. I \nbelieve it is in keeping with a long tradition of legislation passed in \nthis body, in both Republican and Democratic majorities.\n  I recall 13 years ago, so vividly, Congress passing legislation back \nthen that we were told was impossible to enforce, impossible to \nadminister. It was legislation that required nutrition labeling. Howard \nMetzenbaum, that Senator from Ohio who was a passionate advocate for \nconsumers in so many ways, was the author of that legislation. I can \nrecall at the time opponents of his bill said: We are going to see \ncosts soar just as soon as this legislation is implemented; it is \nimpractical to talk about how many calories, or what the nutrition \nbalance is going to be, with every single product in the market. But \nCongress passed it anyway and, in fact, now the labeling law has become \nwhat is widely described as the most successful consumer information \ntool in all of history and now we consider it almost daily as a matter \nof course as we look at the labels when we buy the products, the \npackages.\n  There are those, in packing in particular, who have attempted to say \nfor a lot of reasons that this legislation could carry that same \nominous effect on the market once more. Four meatpackers control 80 \npercent of the meat market. They operate multibillion-dollar empires. \nWe know how powerful they are and we know when they speak there are a \nlot of people who listen. But I believe we ought to go beyond what \nspecial interest concerns there are. We ought to have a right to know. \nWhen there is mad cow disease, as we have seen in Canada, if we are \ngoing to import meat from Canada, we ought to know those circumstances \nexist. And before we buy, if we have a choice between American beef and \nimported beef, whether it is Canada or Mexico or anyplace else, \nconsumers ought to know. Consumers ought to have the right to make that \nchoice for themselves.\n  I believe this may be one of the single most important consumer bills \nthat our Congress is going to take up in this session of this Congress. \nWe are told by the packers especially that this is too expensive, that \nwe simply can't afford to implement the plan. Estimates rose as high as \n$2 billion. In fact, even USDA expressed real concern about the cost, \nadvocating a review of the costs.\n  We did just that. We asked the General Accounting Office, as my \ncolleague from South Dakota said, to look at the facts. Forget all the \nassertions; forget all the hyperbole. Let's really look at what the \ncost will be. They did that. They reported back not long ago and they \nsaid the cost is not $2 billion; it isn't even half of the $2 billion \nthat was originally alleged to be the cost of the implementation of \nthis rule. In fact they said the cost in the first year would be less \nthan $600 million--about $582 million. I believe the USDA cost \nestimates are still too high because they don't take into account the \nextraordinary economic benefits that could be derived with this \ninformation.\n\n  Studies have shown that if we have this kind of information the \nactual sales of U.S. meat could increase anywhere from 1 percent to 5 \npercent, and that isn't taking into account bringing down the per-\nproduct cost. So, clearly, it is a fraction of the cost that was \noriginally attributed to this rule.\n  The second problem we have with regard to the rule and the effort to \nthwart the rule is the packers are simply requiring too much paperwork \nand recordkeeping from the rule itself. We have to fix that. We have to \nensure that we make this a practical application. I believe we can do \nthat as well. I believe we can create the kind of opportunity for \npractical application of common sense just as we have shown in so many \nother instances--as we have shown with meat labeling, as we have shown \nwith grading, as we have shown with consumer information provided \nroutinely now throughout the marketplace.\n  I believe what we ought to do, in short, is give USDA the authority \nand the opportunity to work their will, to do what we hired them to do, \nto give us the rule, to allow us to analyze it. If we have problems at \nsome point down the road, we can change it. We can ask the \nadministration to work with us to come up with something better. But at \nleast let's give them that opportunity to produce what they are \nrequired to produce under law.\n  I believe that is the right course of action. That is what this \namendment says. It simply says, with a bipartisan voice, that we \nbelieve we are on the right track. We believe producers would benefit \nif consumers knew they could buy products made, produced, and marketed \nin this country. That is what the amendment says, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join the chorus of support for \nthis amendment and to thank Senator Daschle for all his efforts on its \nbehalf. Since I got to the Senate, Senator Daschle and I have been \nworking on something I call the packer concentration. It is big \nbusiness in this country that takes on the small producers of this \ncountry and beats them to a pulp.\n  When I first got here, I was a little leery about whether that \nhappened. I am now firmly convinced and know it happens because of the \nway the lobbyists come in and grind on any of these bills we pass.\n  We did pass in the Senate country-of-origin labeling. It is part of \nthe law right now. The USDA is supposed to be working toward putting \nthat into place. But the packer concentration has worked on their \nfriends in the USDA and said we have to make this so tough that nobody \nwill want to do it. It will run up the costs so much that nobody will \nwant to pay for it. That is kind of the status we were in for a while.\n  We have been making a little progress on it as it got closer to \nhaving a rule published. Now we have the chance to send the \ninstructions, it is a sense of the Senate, to send the instructions to \nthe conference committee to say that what we did before ought to move \non. We are not changing the law. We are suggesting that it ought to \ncontinue so we can get a clearer definition of what is really happening \nso we can make sure that country-of-origin labeling happens for our \nproducers and our consumers and to make sure it does not run up high \ncosts.\n  At present, the Senate bill on appropriations is silent on country-\nof-origin labeling, effectively allowing it to be implemented as the \nlaw intended by September 2004.\n  The position of the House on this issue is much different, however. \nThe House has stripped funding for the implementation of country-of-\norigin labeling for meat and meat products in their version of this \nlegislation. The action of the House cannot go unchallenged by the \nSenate, which is why Senators Daschle and Thomas and Johnson and I are \nintroducing this amendment today.\n  I have discussed this matter with my colleagues and it has become \nclear that there is need for education regarding country-of-origin \nlabeling. Many of them were not here for the farm bill debate. For \nthose who were, the issue\n\n[[Page S14120]]\n\nof country-of-origin labeling may not be familiar because it was not \ndebated on the Senate floor. Country-of-origin labeling was included in \nthe bill by way of an Agriculture Committee vote, and the final details \nof the law were worked out during a conference with the House.\n  Country of origin labeling is relevant for agricultural producers and \nconsumers alike. In fact, the country of origin labeling law is based \non the Consumer Right-to-Know Act of 2001, which I cosponsored. The law \nrequires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to put in place a system \nfor U.S. retailers to inform their customers when they buy beef, lamb, \npork or other perishable agricultural commodities as to what country \nthat product originated.\n  Food labeling can help increase consumer confidence by assuring \nconsumers they are making informed and knowledgeable decisions about \nthe products they buy. Consumers should know if the meat they are \nbringing home to feed their families has been produced here, or if it \nwas imported from a country that may have fewer environmental, health \nand safety regulations on livestock production. The Consumer Federation \nof America and the National Consumers League advocate country of origin \nlabeling and demonstrate consumer support for the program.\n  Producers support country of origin labeling too. On October 9, 132 \nproducer and consumer groups from across the nation sent a letter to \nSenators indicating their support for country of origin labeling \nfunding and my amendment. The letter was signed by groups such as the \nNational Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the Wyoming Stockgrowers \nAssociation. They know that country of origin labeling will be a shot \nin the arm for agricultural producers because it will add value to \nAmerican-grown food.\n  In the case of meat, the law intends for retailers to designate a \nproduct as having a U.S. country of origin only if the meat is from an \nanimal that was born, raised and slaughtered in the United States. For \nbeef alone, a recent study by the University of Florida indicated that \na consumer's willingness to pay additional money for labeled beef is \nestimated to be worth $3.5 billion.\n  That is $3.5 billion of additional sales. Right now a lot of people \nthink that a USDA stamp means the beef was grown in the United States--\nnot true. Opponents claim that today's beef prices are higher than they \nhave been in recent memory. True. They claim the country-of-origin \nlabeling is unnecessary. Wrong. I hate to break it to them, but prices \nare high because the Canadian border is closed. Packers have been \nforced to rely more heavily on U.S. products. Without country-of-origin \nlabeling, the packers will switch to the flood of Canadian beef that \nwill pass through our border as soon as it opens. If country-of-origin \nlabeling is implemented, consumers will know if packers have chosen to \npass up U.S. beef for Canadian beef.\n  Opponents refuse to recognize the benefits country-of-origin labeling \nhas for both producers and consumers. That is how we have reached our \ncurrent position and seen funding for the implementation of country-of-\norigin labeling stripped from the House bill.\n  Those who perpetrated this action in the House claim that they need \nmore time to consider the ramifications of country-of-origin labeling. \nTime is one thing that the debate surrounding country-of-origin \nlabeling has had. This issue was debated in the years before its \ninclusion in the farm bill. Since the law was passed, 2 years were \ngranted for rulemaking to ensure its thorough implementation. During \nthat time, opponents of country-of-origin labeling have waged a \ncampaign to frighten and bully those who stand to benefit from its \nproper implementation. Livestock producers have been told that they \nwill be saddled with tremendous burdens that aren't even mandated by \nthe law.\n  The move to strip funding in the House bill did not arise as a noble \ngesture to protect producers by giving more time and thought to \nimplementation, it is a covert attempt to gut and rescind country of \norigin labeling. Removing funding for implementation did not improve \nthe process, it stopped the process cold. For those who have genuine \nconcerns regarding the implementation of country of origin labeling, \nthe answer is not to put off implementing the law, but to implement it \nproperly.\n  Our conferees should not accept the House position. Instead, we \nshould continue to fund the program. As we continue to receive genuine \nconcerns, we should fund implementation and allow those concerns to be \nbrought to the USDA where they will be addressed. We have a process for \nstopping the whole thing if it is not addressed. This is the legitimate \nway to solve problems, as opposed to avoiding them. In fact, this \napproach has already been successful.\n  On Monday, the USDA released their proposed rule for the mandatory \ncountry-of-origin label program. The process is working. The rule is \nnot what it should be. It is time for people of this country to comment \non that rule. I am sure you will hear comments about how difficult the \nrule is. But that is why we have a rulemaking process--so people can \ngive their input. Then we can see if the Department of Agriculture \nfollows that input. If they don't, we, in oversight, can stop the \nprocess. We shouldn't stop the process before it gets started. The \nprocess is working.\n  Since coming out with the voluntary rule, the USDA has responded to \nthe concerns of industry and produced a better product than they were \ntalking about originally. It is important to keep the regulations \nsimple for producers and retailers. In the case of livestock producers, \nthey do not even produce a product that is covered by the law.\n  Muscle cuts and ground meat products are covered but live animals are \nnot. In addition, regulations should be simple for the retailer because \nthey are the only recipient of information from the supplier. They \ndon't produce the information.\n  The proposed rule addresses some of the liability concerns raised by \nretailers by clarifying that retailers will not be liable for the \naccuracy of information provided to them by suppliers. That is where \nthey get their meat. In addition, rather than requiring stores to \nmaintain the records they used to establish country of origin for 2 \nyears, local grocery stores only have to maintain those records for 7 \ndays after the product's sale. There are still areas of concern that \nneed to be addressed, but the 60 day comment period before the final \nrule gives everyone an opportunity to improve it. That is what we ought \nto be doing.\n  The USDA included a cost benefit analysis in the proposed rule. \nWithin that analysis is a breakdown their expected impacts to specific \nportions of the production chain. I was encouraged to see that the \nrelative impact for producers was minimal. Even the USDA acknowledged \nthat the cost for producers will be modest and primarily for \nrecordkeeping. The USDA estimates that the cost per producer will be \nbetween $180 and $443. Unfortunately, the information is meaningless \nbecause it is based on an average per producer. Producers range largely \nin the size of their operations. The information that will assist \nproducers understand the potential impact of the rule is the cost per \nproduct, or per head in my State. It is clear that the cost would be \nlower than $180 for someone with only a few head of cattle. The USDA \ndid indicate that the rule should not have a disproportionate or larger \nimpact on smaller producers.\n  I was pleased to see that the USDA had shifted down from their \noriginal $2 billion estimate for record keeping costs to $582 million. \nAlthough still high, this shift agrees with what I have been saying all \nalong. The USDA's original cost estimate for record keeping was \ninflated and unsupported. The outrageous cost was based on an \nassumption that the an hour of recordkeeping for the producer was worth \n$25. My producers would love to have that cost for their recordkeeping \ntime. It also assumed that an hour spent by retailers on recordkeeping \nwas worth $50. Again, retailers would like to get $50 on that. I am \nsure that some ranchers and grocery store owners in Wyoming would love \nto be paid what the USDA thought 1 hour of recordkeeping was worth. In \ntheir proposed rule, the USDA admits that these are unsupported numbers \nand significantly scaled down the total recordkeeping costs. I think \nthey will be scaled down considerably.\n\n[[Page S14121]]\n\n  However, the USDA indicates that the total cost for implementation \ncould range from $582 million to $3.9 billion. I am concerned with the \n$3.3 billion gap in these numbers. I think that takes away from the \ncredibility. This is a proposed rule and the ultimate cost will depend \nentirely on its implementation. If the USDA takes comments of industry \nand producer into account, the implementation costs will be on the \nlower end of the estimate, or lower than the estimate, just like the \ncase of the recordkeeping costs.\n\n  Finally, the USDA reports a potential for staggering costs but fails \nto recognize the benefits and potential for increased sales in their \nanalysis. As I said earlier, a study has indicated that labeling beef \nas to its country of origin will increase consumer eagerness to pay for \na product they prefer by a total of as much as $3.5 billion. The USDA \ndid not accept this and other studies on the benefits of country-of-\norigin labeling and they did not conduct their own benefit analysis. \nThey were unable to quantify the benefit using their own information so \nthey did not include any benefit in their study. However, failure to \nstudy something does not mean it does not exist.\n  Even allowing for no benefit, the USDA stated a 1 to 5 percent \nincrease in consumer demand would offset the costs to the economy of \ncountry-of-origin labeling. That is a powerful statement. Even a \nminimal increase in market share will cover the cost of the program.\n  Again, the key to the success of this program is how it is \nimplemented. We are at the stage of the rules being published, the 60 \ndays of comment. We still have a chance to make a difference on the \nrules and bring the costs down and simplify them for the producer and \nretailer. It is for this reason my colleagues and I are proposing the \namendment today.\n  The Senate supports country-of-origin labeling. For those Senators \nwho have concern with country-of-origin labeling, defunding the program \nis not an effective way to deal with those concerns. Our amendment \nstates it is the sense of the Senate that conferees on the part of the \nSenate on this bill shall insist that no limits on the use of funds to \nenforce country-of-origin labeling for meat or meat products be \nincluded in the conference report. If my colleagues support country-of-\norigin labeling, they should vote for this amendment. If some of my \ncolleagues have concerns about the implementation of country-of-origin \nlabeling, they should vote for my amendment and ensure that USDA has \nthe funding available to improve the rule. We passed the law and now we \nmust remain vigilant to be sure it is implemented properly.\n  As I mentioned, even if your State is not a producer of meat and meat \nproducts, worry about your consumers so that they know from where their \nmeat product came. I urge my colleagues to help me do that by passing \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from South Dakota, Mr. \nDaschle, has proposed his amendment. I would like to speak in support \nof that amendment. Other colleagues have already spoken. This is an \nimportant amendment to consider.\n  Let me talk about the issue. We call it, this debate in the Congress, \ncountry-of-origin labeling: COOL. That does not mean anything to \nanybody. The question with this amendment and this issue is, Should the \nAmerican people be able to determine where the meat they are purchasing \nat the meat counter comes from? Should they be able to know where this \nproduct comes from?\n  We have a roomful of people wearing neckties in this Chamber. If \nanyone looks at their necktie, they can find from the label where that \nnecktie comes from. The same is true with shirts and shoes and \ntrousers. The same is true with much of what we use in our daily lives. \nWe require labeling. We demand it. Why? Because the consumer is \nadvantaged by having it. Except meat and meat products. Go to the \ngrocery store; take a look at the grocery store shelf and evaluate the \nmeat. Consumers do not have the foggiest idea where the products came \nfrom--none.\n  Why is it important to be able to identify the origin of meat or meat \nproducts you purchase in this country? For a number of reasons. We \nproduce the highest quality food in the world by far. Why? Because we \nhave the highest standards, and we demand conformance to those \nstandards. The American people, if they want to choose U.S.-grown beef, \nU.S.-produced beef or beef products or meat or meat products, at this \npoint they cannot do it because the labeling does not exist.\n  Now, the labeling of meat and meat products has been done routinely \nin many other areas of the world. Other countries do it. It is not \nimpossible. It is not even prohibitively expensive. It is just if you \nhave the will to do it, you do it. In our country, at this point, we \nhave not had the will.\n  Finally, the Congress passed a piece of legislation saying you must. \nWe have a requirement that there be country-of-origin labeling, meat \nand meat products be labeled as to their origin, where they were \nproduced.\n  Now the House of Representatives has passed an amendment that says \nthey are going to shut off funding for that at a time when the \nDepartment of Agriculture has already dragged its feet in implementing \nit because they do not want to implement it.\n  Let me describe where this is important. Let me describe a May 1999 \ninspection in Hermosillo, Mexico, when inspectors went into a plant in \nthis little town in Mexico. I will tell you what they found. U.S. \ninspectors paid a rare visit, we are told, to the plant in May 1999 and \nwere greeted by filth and flies. They cut off trade at once--or at \nleast they thought they did.\n  From the U.S. Department of Agriculture:\n\n       Shanks and briskets [were] contaminated with feces . . . . \n     In the refrigerator . . . . A disease-condemned carcass was \n     observed ready for boning and distribution in commerce.\n\n  Even before the inspectors left Mexico, Mexican officials were at \nwork to restore this plant's right to sell meat to Americans. Over the \nfollowing months, this plant regained its export license, switched \nowners, changed names, and yet the USDA has never returned.\n\n  So an American consumer buying meat from this plant, can they know \nit? Will they know it? Will they have information that tells them this \nis where the meat comes from? The answer at this point, regrettably, \nis, no, they will not know whether that meat comes from the most \nregulated laboratory or most inspected plant in the United States or \nfrom this plant in Mexico where inspectors were greeted by filth and \nflies and a disease-condemned carcass ready for boning and distribution \nin commerce.\n  Is it important for the American people to distinguish between cuts \nof meat that come from an inspected facility in this country that meets \nrigorous standards and a facility as described in this article that \ncomes from that community in Mexico?\n  What about the issue of BSE or mad cow disease? We now hear this week \nwe have another case of mad cow disease in Japan; a 21-month-old bull \nis the country's ninth known case. It is devastating for the Japanese, \nI know, to have cases of mad cow disease or BSE. We know our neighbors \nto the north have had a case of mad cow disease. In January, a sick \ncow, staggering in a lot, was nonetheless slaughtered with other cows. \nThey severed the head and put the head on a shelf, and that head sat on \nthe shelf for 4 months. Finally, they sent it away for testing, to \ndiscover that the cow they slaughtered in January, in May was \ndetermined to have had mad cow disease.\n  As a result, the Secretary of Agriculture cut off shipments of live \ncattle from Canada into this country. Why is that important? Because \nour beef herd is free of mad cow disease and has always been free of \nit. It is devastating to a beef industry, an industry in just North \nDakota worth $500 million--half a billion. It is devastating to that \nindustry to have an outbreak of mad cow disease. We want to protect our \nindustry. That is why I offered the amendment earlier this afternoon \nthat has been accepted. But we had USDA moving quickly last week to \ncreate what is called minimum risk for classification for Canada so \nyounger animals from Canada can move into this marketplace. Should the \nAmerican people, can\n\n[[Page S14122]]\n\nthe American people, determine where their meat comes from--Canada, \nMexico, Japan, or the U.S.?\n\n  The answer, for those of us who strongly support country-of-origin \nlabeling laws, is the American people deserve that opportunity and need \nthe right to know where their meat and meat products come from; they \nneed to be able to make selections as consumers in a thoughtful, \nintelligent way.\n  Regrettably, that is not now the case. That is why the Congress \npreviously passed legislation. Regrettably, the Department of \nAgriculture is dragging its feet, and the House of Representatives, in \nmy judgment, has caved in to the big economic interests that want to \nscuttle this all together. They don't want to have anything to do with \nmeat labeling. They say it costs too much.\n  Only in this town would we not laugh out loud at the cost estimates \nthat come from the USDA. They are a joke. Only in this town would it \nbecome part of legitimate debate and thoughtful discussion about how \nmany billions--yes, billions--of dollars this would cost, they claim, \nto administer. That is complete, sheer, utter nonsense and USDA knows \nit.\n  The question for this Congress is, Will it stand behind its previous \ndecision and its previous judgment to require country-of-origin \nlabeling on behalf of the American consumer? Will it stand behind that? \nI hope the answer is yes. If that answer is yes, then we need to \nsupport this bipartisan amendment that is offered by my colleague from \nSouth Dakota.\n  One final point. In the haste to try to discredit the country-of-\norigin labeling, the Department of Agriculture put out a notice that \nthis would cost billions of dollars and they also indicated that it \nwould have zero benefits. Does anyone really believe an estimate of the \ncost of the implementation of this law would provide no benefits--no \nbenefits--to this country and the consumers of this country?\n  That is why this attack on the country-of-origin labeling is a joke. \nIt is why we must adopt this amendment. We must stand for the American \nconsumer. I know big economic interests swing big clubs in this area. I \nhave been in conference committees where we thought we had this done \nbefore long ago and we had folks from the meat industry out in the \nhalls buttonholing people. The fact is, we need to get this done, and \nit needs to be done now. That is why I support the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from South Dakota.\n  While I have the floor, might I also indicate that the amendment I \nindicated to the Senator from Utah that I intended to offer is ready. I \ncan offer it at the pleasure of the Senator from Utah and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin. Senator Burns from Montana and I are both in the \nChamber, and both of us would like to speak in support of our \namendment. We very much hope the manager and the ranking member will be \ntaking the amendment. But if not, of course, we will want a record \nvote.\n  I will certainly offer the amendment on behalf of myself and Senator \nBurns at your pleasure. So I would be happy to hear what the Senator \nfrom Utah would like to have happen with respect to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in an effort to establish a glidepath for \nus to bring this particular airplane in for a landing, in consultation \nwith the assistant Democratic leader, I intend to offer a unanimous \nconsent request that would set a time agreement for the debate on the \ncountry-of-origin labeling amendment. It would be my intention, once \nthat time has expired, that we would turn to the amendment the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and the Senator from Montana wish to offer. At that \ntime, I would be prepared to attach a time agreement to their offering \nof that amendment, as well as offering a time agreement to attach to \nthe amendment to be offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy. As \nfar as I know, those are the only three amendments remaining that would \nrequire a rollcall vote.\n  So I say to the Senator from North Dakota, I would ask him to support \nmy unanimous consent request that I will now propound, with the \ncommitment on my part that as soon as the time has expired on the \ncountry-of-origin labeling amendment, we would then go to his \namendment. I think the appropriate thing would be for him to offer his \namendment at that time and then go directly into debate of that \namendment.\n  With that explanation, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time until 4:30 this afternoon be equally divided for debate on the \nDaschle amendment No. 2078; provided, that at 4:30 the amendment be \ntemporarily set aside and a vote occur in relation to the amendment at \na time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with \nthe Democratic leader; provided further, that no amendments be in order \nto the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the managers of the bill and indicated to \nthem that Senator Harkin cannot be here until 4 o'clock, so I would ask \nunanimous consent that the request be modified to allow Senator Harkin \n15 minutes, beginning at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, am I to \nassume by that addition to the unanimous consent request that we are \nnow looking at an hour and 15 minutes of additional debate or just 15 \nof your 30 minutes locked in for Senator Harkin?\n  Mr. REID. Just 15 of the 30 minutes for Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All right. Am I also to assume we would move to other \namendments and we would see a series of stacked votes on this amendment \nand others?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding--if this unanimous consent \nrequest is agreed to--that debate on the Daschle amendment will cease \nat 4:30; we will then address the other amendments--only two of which I \nknow of would require a rollcall vote--and if the majority leader and \nthe Democratic leader so determine, we would then have a series of \nstacked votes on those three amendments.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Now, if other amendments arise, we can deal with them, \nbut at the moment this is what we believe we have before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond briefly to my friend from \nUtah and all the Senate--staff and other Senators listening--if there \nare other amendments in addition to the Dorgan and Leahy amendments, \nthe two managers should be advised forthwith because we would expect \nthis bill to be completed and the voting to start at 5:30 today.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the assistant Democratic leader and repeat his \nplea to Senators on our side of the aisle. If there are additional \namendments, the time to call them to our attention is rapidly running \nout.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask how much time would the Senator \nlike?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho in opposition to the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \noppose the Daschle amendment but with some degree of reluctance. I say \nthat because in the 106th and the 107th Congresses I have been an \noutspoken advocate of country-of-origin labeling.\n  I agree with a fair amount of the argument that has already been made \ntoday, that there is a clear consumer right to know, that there ought \nto be an identification trail or process by which we do, in effect, \nidentify cuts of meat for the consumer.\n  I am a firm believer that, as a U.S. consumer, I have a right to know \nwhat I am eating and from where it comes. I think it is a little \nfoolish to compare it\n\n[[Page S14123]]\n\nwith a silk tie or a piece of clothing. You do not just run cattle out \nof a factory. If you know the livestock process, you do not just label \nthem at the time of birth. Maybe we will be. Maybe we will be putting a \ncomputer chip in the ear of every calf born and establish an \nidentification trail from birth through to slaughter. I do not know. \nThat may well be in the future of the livestock industry of this \ncountry. That might be a part of a process of national identification \nthat the national cattle industry is talking about now as an important \npart of a trail.\n  What I spent time doing the last week is reading the new regulations \nthat are being proposed by USDA. While the Senator from North Dakota \nstood on the floor and said, you just cannot believe those cost \nestimates, everybody out there in farmland believes them. Every cow and \ncalf producer and every hog producer suggests that $10 a head in real \ncosts to comply is probably fairly realistic and that if you fail to \ncomply or if you break the chain of compliance, you are up for a \n$10,000 fine. That is something I don't think I want to put my \nproducers into at this moment, especially when they don't understand \nthe regulations and I can't understand the regulations.\n\n  There is a joke moving around out in cattle country today. If you go \nout and buy a truckload of cattle, you better take a trailer along to \npull the paperwork with you because this is going to become a very \ncomplicated process.\n  I talked to a sale ring operator about an hour ago. We don't have \nmany livestock auctions left in our country today, but there are a few \noperating in Idaho. He is trying to figure out, when 75 or 100 small \nfarm, ranch producers come with their cattle to his sale ring--and I am \ntalking about an area where you have a lot of small herds of 100 or \nless, not large herds, as we think about them today out West or \nanywhere else in the country--how do you identify all of these cattle \nand put them together? Are they all going to be ear tagged? Do they \nhave to be? Is that going to be a requirement? We don't know.\n  More importantly, if you run those animals on public land and they \nare not in that nice, controlled, fenced, irrigated pasture--and almost \nall of my livestock run on public land during some time in the year, \nand I am talking about mountains and canyons and valleys and brush \ncountry--the ear tag that gets put in the ear as calves probably isn't \nthere when they come home in the fall because they tore it off going \nthrough a brush thicket. That is the character of the industry.\n  No, it isn't a controlled and simple industry. We have thousands of \nproducers out there today. Most everybody thinks there is the big \nrancher out there with thousands of head of cows. Not true. Well over \n80 percent of the livestock is produced in herds of 50 or less. That is \njust the reality of the industry. Large feedlot operators put all of \nthose cattle together, bring them to their feedlots. How does that \npaper trail exist? That is really the issue at hand.\n  I am a believer in country-of-origin labeling. I do believe the cost \nwe are talking about here, as projected by USDA, has reality to it. \nRecordkeeping for development and operation, first year: $582 million; \n$458 million in the outyears to maintain and operate; direct cost, $582 \nmillion to $3.9 billion. Well, they back that off a little bit, but in \nreality we are still looking at direct cost to an industry that is \nstruggling now to get back on its feet of about $1.7 billion.\n  Is there a cry and a demand to know? I am not sure there is. But I \nwant to know. I do want a reasonable and realistic approach to \naccomplishing this. Go read the new proposed regulations that are out \nfor comment today. Try to tell me how you create and follow an ID trail \nthrough that maze, and the two or three or four times a feeder animal \nmight change ownership from the time they are birthed on the ranch \nuntil they are a nice cut of beef on a supermarket shelf. That we are \nnot confident of.\n  You can darn well bet the processor and the retailer are going to try \nto pass that cost on, and they can at the consumer shelf. But I know \nthe producer can't. The producer can't say to the feedlot operator or \nto the slaughterhouse: Well, because of this new regulation, you are \ngoing to have to pay me another $1 or $1.50 or $3 or $4, whatever it \ncosts. That simply doesn't happen at that level of production, and it \nnever has.\n\n  To liken this to a tie or to liken this to one or two products that \nmay be produced by one or two producers around the country and \ntherefore very easy to label and very easy to know where from whence it \ncomes, when you are talking about thousands of producers, large and \nsmall, aggregate numbers being put together for purposes of feeding and \nfinishing--and what about commingling on the slaughterhouse floor? How \ndo you manage that kind of situation?\n  By the way, I don't think the Senator from Wyoming or the Senator \nfrom South Dakota mentioned, if you are selling a hamburger at \nMcDonald's, you don't have to worry about it because you don't qualify. \nThese regulations don't address you. Fifty percent of the industry's \nmeat today is sold through fast foods, and they don't have to play the \ngame. If you are a poultry raiser, do you have to play the game? No; \nyou are exempt.\n  Why are we looking at this in a rather sporadic pattern? If we are \ngoing to develop uniformity, if we are truly going to search for the \nright to know and a label that deals with country of origin, should not \nall meat products be labeled in a way that the consumer knows from \nwhence they come? I think that is the right and the appropriate thing \nto do. We ought not handicap the producer.\n  My livestock farmers and ranchers are split, to my knowledge, right \ndown the middle. My Idaho cattle association opposes the regulation. I \nhave the farm bureau who supports the regulation. I have the farmers \nunion who I think continues to support it. I have our calf folks who \nstrongly support it. Yet what I feel I am doing, if I vote to advance \nthis rule into a fixed regulation, is putting some of those small \nproducers out of business. I don't want to do that. There ought to be a \nsimple way to do it, and yet what we have seen is a very complicated \nprocess. With that process, with those costs, I do believe it is \nreasonable for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to argue there may \nnot be a benefit to it in relation to the cost.\n  The national livestock industry is working at this moment to \nvoluntarily put a national identification program together. We ought to \nbe able to track our livestock. We should be able to know. When it \ncomes to mad cow disease, you darn bet we ought to be able to track it \nand to assure that we keep our livestock herds safe and clean, and we \nhave to date. We are not Johnny-come-latelies to this. We have had \nstrict protocol for a decade or more to make sure we are not a Japan \nand that we are not a Canada, nor are we a Great Britain. And we are \nnot because our livestock herds are clean, well managed, and USDA has \ndone its homework. They deserve credit for it. You don't need to add a \nnew paper trail to it just to assure there is safety.\n  But I am still going to say we ought to try. I don't know that this \nis the way to do it. I don't know that you shove this out over the \nindustry and force it down on them from the top down. There is a \nvoluntary effort today to try to get this in place. If this were a \npilot program or if we weren't going to implement it for a year but \nmake sure we vetted it appropriately and established a pilot program in \ndifferent livestock areas of the country--the western public land \ngrazing industry is a good deal different from that in the South or \nthat in the Midwest where herds are controlled and fenced and somewhat \nconfined in the ability to shape herds and keep them, yet these rules \nand regulations are not reflective of those differences, and they are \ndifferences of real importance.\n  I don't know how we get there. At least I do believe that what we are \nproposing--and I should not say ``we,'' USDA, and they have already \nbacked off some of their numbers and come with different ones--is maybe \nnot the way to go. As someone who voted for country-of-origin labeling, \nI did it with S. 544 in the 106th and S. 617. In 1998, we did it again. \nSenator Burns of Montana and I looked at the grading system to try to \nfind a way to get where we all want to get. Now we are saying: OK, we \nhave a freight train on the track. She is building up speed. It is just \na regulatory process. We are only into the comment period. Let that \ntrain roll\n\n[[Page S14124]]\n\ndown the track. Let's start implementing it.\n  By the way, if you get caught up in it and you get fined $10,000 \nbecause you couldn't comply, you didn't comply, it was impossible to \ncomply, and you broke the paper trail or the chain of identification, \nso be it.\n  I can't do that to my farmers and ranchers. I won't do that if it is \nmy vote that does it. I am still going to insist we ought to try to \ncomply in different ways to maintain a chain of understanding, a chain \nof information and knowledge and identification as to a point of origin \nwhere that meat came from. But remember, half of the meat you will \nconsume after this becomes law will not be regulated by this law. So is \nthere a blanket protection? No. Is there a consumer right to know? \nWell, 50 percent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was interested to have one of the \nSenators point out that most Senators don't know anything about this \nbecause it was done in conference committee, and I certainly qualify as \none who didn't know anything about it at the time the conference \ncommittee came to the floor. I have had a crash course in country of \norigin labeling since I became chairman.\n  I have come to several conclusions, which I will share with the \nSenate. No. 1, the bill was very badly written. I don't think there is \nany question about that. The idea of having consumer information with \nrespect to food is a perfectly legitimate idea. It does indeed fit the \npattern of consumers, and I have no problem with it. But it is clear, \nas we get into the details of this, that the bill that originally \nrequired it is very badly written. It uses the phrase, for example, \n``born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States.''\n  I ask this question: What if you only get two out of three of those? \nWhat does that do to you with respect to the piece of beef you are \ntalking about? Suppose it was born in one country, fed in another, and \nslaughtered in a third? That is not likely, but it is entirely \npossible. And from which country does it come?\n  You can say it is clearly not American beef if it was born in Canada, \nfed at feedlots in the U.S, and for some purpose, shipped to Mexico to \nbe slaughtered, packed, and sent back. But what country is its country \nof origin? If you say it was born in Canada, it is Canadian.\n  Why does the law say ``born, raised, and slaughtered''--those three \ncategories--if only one matters?\n  This is an interesting challenge because we have critters walking \naround on the range right now that were born somewhere prior to the \npassage of this law, and on which there are no records, which are going \nto end up in the food supply as hamburger or pot roast. Who is going to \ncertify where they came from, with no records having been kept? That \ncould be an argument for delaying the implementation of this \nlegislation.\n  Ultimately, I say with some facetiousness but some seriousness, we \nare talking about a situation where, in order to comply with the law, \nevery animal has to have a birth certificate and a passport. The \npassport has to be stamped every time it crosses State lines. Someone \ncalled me and said: Bob, we have to pass this because there are all \nkinds of piglets being born in Canada and then being shipped to the \nUnited States. I find that they are shipped to the United States within \ndays after their birth. They are born in Canada, but they are shipped \nhere, truly as piglets, almost within days or weeks after birth, and \nthen the entire processing takes place in the United States. These are \nAmerican jobs, American facilities that are handling them.\n  Do we say, because of their birth, they are Canadian, but because \nthey are raised and slaughtered in the United States, does that make \nthem naturalized American citizens or American pork, if you will? The \nlaw is badly written, and it clearly needs work or we would not be \nhaving this argument. Everyone I hear who opposes the Daschle amendment \nbegins his statement by saying: I am in favor of country-of-origin \nlabeling. But they are opposed to this particular legislation as it \nstands.\n\n  One of the other things that is wrong with it, in my view, is the \n$10,000-per-violation provision. If I am running a supermarket, and \nsomeone says, here is some American beef, and I am potentially liable \nfor a $10,000 violation for every single one of those hamburger patties \nbecause each sale is a separate circumstance, I am going to say to the \nproducer: I will not take your beef unless you are prepared to \nindemnity me against any lawsuits that might come from the Trial \nLawyers Association if some consumer activist comes in here and can \nprove that particular hamburger pattie originated in Canada. I am not \ngoing to run that risk.\n  I think the Senator from Missouri was exactly right when he said the \nlawyers will be telling their corporate boards: Assume the worst and be \nas careful as you possibly can. Again, we have critters out there on \nthe range that were born before the law was passed that are going to \nend up in the meat locker, and how are they going to be labeled? If \nthey are mislabeled, there is a $10,000 fine for every pot roast that \ncomes from those particular cows.\n  I am not sure the House solution is the right solution. I am not \nprepared to go to conference saying I will stand with the House \nlanguage, because I think there is an alternative that might well be \nworked out, and should be worked out in conference, to say this is how \nwe buy a little more time to deal with the uncertainties we have here, \nand we hope give the authorizing committee the opportunity to take \nanother bite at the apple and see if they cannot write a country-of-\norigin labeling law that makes more sense than the present one.\n  But the Daschle amendment, by its nature, and by the debate and \nlegislative history that is being laid down, is saying you enforce the \nlaw exactly as it stands, no changes. For that reason, I intend to vote \nagainst the Daschle amendment because I think there needs to be \nchanges, and I think the debate demonstrates there needs to be changes. \nI hope the Daschle amendment is defeated.\n  When we get to conference, I hope the House language is modified and \nwe use the vehicle of the conference to try to prod the authorizing \ncommittee in the direction of rewriting the basic bill so it can become \nworkable.\n  One final example of how the statute is written that is unworkable, \nin my opinion, is that it prohibits the use of an identification \nmechanism to verify origin of the covered commodity. The Senator talked \nabout putting an ear tag on the cow. That is illegal under this law. He \nis talking about the expense of it. It is the commonsense way to tag \ncattle. It is illegal, the way this thing is written.\n  So, as I say, as I have become acquainted with the whole matter, \ncoming to it completely fresh and completely uneducated as to the \nissues before I had to look at it, I find myself in favor of the \nargument that consumers should know from which country the food comes. \nI have no problem with that at all, but I am convinced the law, as \npresently written, was so hastily put together that it has serious \nproblems that cannot be fixed by regulations from USDA. I think they \nare acting in good faith in the regulations they drafted.\n  The question came up in the hearing when Secretary Veneman was asked: \nWhy are you proposing such a cumbersome regulation?\n  She said: Because we believe it complies with the law.\n  She was asked: Whose interpretation tells you this complies with the \nlaw?\n  She said: The United States Department of Justice. The lawyers in the \nJustice Department looked at the law and said you have to have these \nburdensome regulations.\n  So I think there is a solution to this. I think we can work our way \nthrough it in time. There is time between now and November for us not \nto argue about should we implement the law as it stands, or should we \nprevent the law from going forward as it stands, but do what I think is \nthe commonsense thing, which is simply rewrite the law.\n  Based on all of the research and evidence that has gone into the \ndrawing of the regulation, we can now do it with a\n\n[[Page S14125]]\n\nlittle more leisure and more intelligence than was done the first time \naround.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the \ntime will be taken equally from both sides.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to state my support for \ncountry-of-origin labeling. Manufactured goods sold in the United \nStates have carried mandatory country-of-origin labels since the 1930s. \nMost of our major trading partners, including Europe and Japan, already \nrequire American producers to provide this information on our \nagricultural exports. Today as the landscape of international trade \ncontinues to change and expand, our Nation's fruits, vegetables and \nmeats need to carry the same important information.\n  Country-of-origin labeling will have two primary benefits. First, it \nwill add value to our domestic commodities. American agriculture \nproduces the highest quality products in the world, and they should be \nrewarded for that. Second, it will enable consumers to be knowledgeable \nabout their purchases at the grocery store.\n  I am very concerned that the House eliminated funding for the \nimplementation of country-of-origin labeling in their version of the \n2004 Agriculture appropriations bill. It is important that the Senate \nconferees insist that no limits on the use of funds to enforce country-\nof-origin labeling requirements be included in the conference report. I \nurge my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I understand that there are concerns about the implementation of \ncountry-of-origin labeling. I think country-of-origin labeling can and \nshould be done in a way that does not overburden the retailer, the \npacker, or the producer.\n  And although the USDA's proposed rules for the implementation of \ncountry-of-origin labeling are an improvement over the previously \nproposed guidelines, I still believe that the proposed rules make \ncountry-of-origin more burdensome than it needs to be.\n  We need to let this implementation to go through so we can all work \ntogether to create a program that is simple, cost-efficient, and does \nnot overburden the parties involved.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in reference to the Senator's \nsense-of-the-Senate. Obviously, there are strong emotions on this \nissue. One of the problems with this program is the ambiguous nature by \nwhich Congress authorized it. In particular, I would call my \ncolleagues' attention to the most recent regulation proposed by USDA.\n  During consideration of the 2002 farm bill, Congress wisely exempted \nprocessed foods from country of origin labeling requirements. The \ncomplex nature of such labeling would have discouraged the use of U.S. \ngrown products as ingredients and thus would have harmed, not helped, \nAmerican agriculture. Yet there is tremendous confusion in the food \nindustry and at USDA, I might add, on what constitutes a processed \nproduct as it relates to country-of-origin labeling.\n  I also would like to remind my colleagues that many of these \nprocessed products, for example, frozen produce, are already required \nto be labeled. Frozen processed products of foreign origin are required \nto be labeled for country-of-origin under section 304 of the Tariff Act \nand have been so required since the Tariff Act was passed in 1930. I \ncertainly do not believe it was the intention of Congress to create a \ncostly, duplicative program that provides absolutely no benefit to \nAmerican growers, consumers, or producers.\n  Some canned products would be covered by the program while others \nwould not be covered. USDA's determination that frozen breaded shrimp \nis covered by the legislation is another example. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, USDA is using the Perishable Agricultural \nCommodities Act, PACA, as a blueprint for implementation of the \nCountry-of-Origin Labeling program. Yet, at time of passage, breading \nis the type of process that would disqualify produce from getting a \ndesignation under PACA. It seems to me we are going to great lengths \nand undoubtedly expending great resources to mandate marking on \nprocessed products that it was no one's intention to cover.\n  It is just this type of confusion that USDA references in its cost-\nbenefit analysis. We should not be concerned about whether or not we \nagree with the accuracy of the estimated costs. The fact is that the \nagricultural economy can not afford any of them. We ought to be clear \nthat to the extent this program has support by producers, no one \nadvocating extending its reach to processed foods. I reiterate my \nunderstanding that when the processed food exemption was included, \nCongress sought to avoid this excessive cost and the resulting \nconfusion.\n  In fact, after reviewing USDA's proposed rule as mandated by the law, \nJohn Graham, administrator of OMB's Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs, OIRA, sent a letter to USDA's undersecretary for \nMarketing and Regulatory programs, Bill Hawks, which stated ``These \nfigures indicate that this is one of the most burdensome rules to be \nreviewed by this administration.''\n  USDA's cost-benefit analysis raised several disturbing points. First, \nthe USDA has said that ``Current evidence on country-of-origin \nlabeling, however, does not suggest that U.S. producers will receive \nsufficiently higher farm prices for U.S.-labeled products to cover the \ncosts of labeling. Moreover, it is even possible that producers could \nface lower farm prices as a result of labeling costs being passed back \nfrom retailers and processors.''\n  The USDA has also said that ``Annual costs to the U.S. economy in \nterms of reduced purchasing power resulting from a loss in productivity \nafter a 10-year period of adjustment are estimated to range from $138 \nmillion to $596 million.''\n  I do not believe that when adopting Country-of-Origin Labeling \nlegislation Congress intended to create such an expensive program that \nis detrimental to American agriculture, nor do I believe it was the \nintention to include processed products, including frozen produce. I \nhope we can work together to clarify the intention and the breadth of \nimpact of this legislation and minimize the costs of its \nimplementation. However, I do not believe that such a sufficient \nclarification can be achieved by simply defunding one portion of the \nprogram.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I would like \nalso to say a few words about an amendment the Senate will be debating \nlater today. The amendment will be offered by Senator Daschle and \nrelates to country-of-origin labeling of meat and produce.\n  I have long supported mandatory labeling of country of origin and was \npleased this provision was included in the farm bill the President \nsigned into law last year. New Mexico Cattle Growers and the New Mexico \nFarm Bureau strongly endorsed this legislation.\n  I do believe consumers have a right to know where there food is \ncoming from. I am disappointed that there are some in the meat packing \nindustry and the administration that are trying to block implementation \nof this important legislation. Grudingly, the administration last month \nreleased a proposed rule for mandatory labeling.\n  I believe the administration's proposed rules are far more \ncomplicated than they need to be. However, I hope Congress will allow \nthe comment period and rule making to continue to give both proponents \nand opponents of labeling a fair opportunity to weigh in on this issue.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor the Daschle amendment and hope that it \npasses.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to implementing \nthe mandatory country-of-origin labeling, also known as COOL.\n  This Legisition would devastate the U.S. meat industry, cost \nthousands of American jobs and raise food prices for the customers the \nlaw purports to benefit.\n  The USDA recently found the U.S. livestock industry would incur \nsignificannt costs and virtually no benefits from mandatory COOL. It \nconcluded there was little evidence that mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling would lead to an increase in demand for commodities bearing \nthe U.S. label, nor would it result in increased food safety. Rather, \nit found that COOL would impose up to $4 billion on ag industries in \nthe first year and up to $600 million annually after the program had \nbeen in place for a decade. Inevitably,\n\n[[Page S14126]]\n\nthese costs would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher \nprices at the supermarket.\n  A recent Texas A University study estimated that changes brought \nabout by mandatory country-of-origin labeling would cost nearly 2,000 \njobs in south Texas alone. Mandatory COOL would force many small \nproducers with fewer and than 50 head of cattle out of business \nentirely. This would be a devastating blow just when our economy is \nbeginning to show signs of recovery.\n  In addition to the impact on consumers and the American meat \nindustry, the imposition of COOL raises serious trade ramifications \nthat could invite retaliation from important trade partners. In the \nmidst of negotiating free and fair trade agreements with nations around \nthe globe, imposing severe restrictions such as COOL hamper our efforts \nto break down trade barriers and grow the global economy.\n  No one disputes that food safety is critical. But both supporters and \nopponents of COOL have stated this is a marketing issue and not one of \nfood safety. When questioned by Congressman Charles Stenholm of Texas \nin a recent House Agriculture hearing on this issue, every witness, \nincluding supporters such as the American Farm Bureau Federation and \nthe National Farmers Union agreed COOL should not be associated with \nfood safety, but with the marketing of agriculture products.\n  U.S. agricultural industries provide the highest quality products in \nthe world. Congressional actions should help, not hinder, their \nefforts. Imposing severe, costly restrictions that amount to nothing \nmore than a marketing ploy is not the way to proceed.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment and commit to a thoughtful and thorough debate on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on country-of-origin myths \nversus facts.\n  No. 1, Myth: U.S. consumers do not care about country-of-origin \nlabeling.\n  Facts: That is not what people in Wyoming and national surveys \nindicate. Consumers overwhelmingly support labeling because it provides \nproduct information, increased consumer choice and the chance to \nsupport American agriculture.\n  Two, of the largest consumer groups in the United States, Consumer \nFederation of America and the National Consumers League, strongly \nsupport mandatory COOL.\n  No. 2, Myth: Country-of-origin labeling violates our international \ntrade agreement commitments.\n  Facts: Country-of-origin labeling law does not violate international \ntrading agreements.\n  Marking products is allowed by international trading rules. Under \nArticle IX of GATT, countries can require marks of origin on imported \nproducts. Many nations already require country-of-origin labeling on a \nvariety of food products. A recent GAO study found that 48 of our 57 \ntop trading partners require labeling for at least one of the \ncommodities covered by COOL and 41 require labeling of meat at retail.\n  No. 3, Myth: The cost of compliance with the country-of-origin \nlabeling law will be extravagant in the first year and will increase \nconsumer food costs.\n  Facts: The USDA incorrectly assumed that new record keeping system \nrequirements would meet to be established and implemented. The Majority \nof producers already keep records that can provide the required \ninformation.\n  GAO reports that USDA exaggerated its initial cost project. The $1.9 \nbillion estimate was found to be ``questionable and not well \nsupported.''\n  USDA current estimates are equally flawed. Consumer organizations \nestimate the average cost to individual consumers will only be about 13 \ncents per week.\n  Also, consumer surveys support COOL.\n  Fresh Trends, a 2002 survey, found that 86 percent of consumer \nrespondents favor country-of-origin labeling. Of the 86 percent of \nconsumers favoring COOL, 78 percent prefer mandatory labeling over \nvoluntary labeling. And 60 percent of those questioned have been \nproduce items in U.S. supermarkets that were grown in other countries. \nAlso, 48 percent of the people identified South America as a source of \nproduce, 33 percent Mexico, 12 percent Central America.\n  North Carolina State University, in February 2003, found that 74 \npercent of consumers believe the U.S. shouldn't buy all its food from \nother countries even if it is cheaper than food produced and sold here. \nFour out of 5 U.S. consumers believe that U.S.-grown food is fresher \nand safer. And 92 percent prefer to eat meat produced in the United \nStates. Those surveyed were undecided about the safety of meat from \noutside the United States. Only 5 percent questioned are uncertain \nabout U.S. produced meats. And two-thirds of consumers would pay more \nfor food grown in the U.S. rather than abroad.\n  Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services found that 37 \npercent of consumers would pay between 10 and 20 percent more for U.S. \nfruits and vegetables. More than two-thirds of consumers note the \ncountry where fresh produce is grown. Also, 56 percent of consumers \nbelieve that U.S. produce is safer than imported produce. And 62 \npercent of consumers would purchase U.S. produce if it had a COOL \nlabel. If price and appearance were equal, 61 percent of consumers \nwould select U.S.-grown produce.\n  Colorado State University, in March 2003, found that 75 percent of \nconsumers prefer to buy beef with country-of-origin labeling. And 73 \npercent of consumers would be willing to pay more for beef with \ncountry-of-origin labeling. Also, 69 percent of consumers are willing \nto pay more for steaks labeled, ``USA Guaranteed: Born and Raised in \nthe United States'' than for those with no origin label. And 56 percent \nof that 69 percent were wiling to pay premiums.\n  Tarrance Group and Northern Illinois University, in June 2001, found \nthat 81 percent of those surveyed want their food to come from the \nUnited States.\n  I urge passage of COOL.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nLeahy, in offering an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture \nappropriations bill that would preserve funding for our Nation's \nworking lands conservation programs. This amendment parallels \nlegislation I have cosponsored along with the Senator from Vermont. It \nwould prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, from diverting \nfunding from key working lands programs, such as the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, EQIP, and the Farm and Ranchland Protection \nProgram, FRPP, to pay for technical assistance.\n  The 2002 farm bill made it clear that the USDA should expand the \nopportunities for farmers across the country to participate in \nvoluntary conservation programs that balance stewardship goals with on-\nfarm production. This has not happened though.\n  In fiscal year 2003, the USDA transferred over $90 million away from \nworking lands conservation programs to pay for technical assistance of \nthe Conservation Reserve Program, CRP. This diversion of funds \nprevented countless numbers of farmers from signing up for working \nlands incentive programs. Unless this problem is corrected, the \nDepartment estimates that at least $77 million will be diverted in the \ncoming fiscal year.\n  For many States, including my own, conservation programs are a \ncritical source of Federal assistance and are a valuable tool for \nhelping small and specialty crop growers enhance their production while \ncaring for the land. Funds from these programs reach an array of \nproducers, including fruit and vegetable farmers, dairy farmers, and \nranchers. The amendment being introduced today ensures that \nconservation payments would reach a broad range of farmers.\n  Our amendment does not set new policy, rather, it reinforces the \nmandates Congress made in the 2002 farm bill. Congress recognized the \nimportance of conservation in agriculture by significantly increasing \nfunding for the working lands conservation programs. With the \nadditional resources provided by the farm bill, Congress intended the \nUSDA to expand the opportunity for farmers to practice farm and \nranchland stewardship. Congress also anticipated the need to fund \ntechnical assistance for CRP and provided specific language in the 2002 \nfarm bill directing the Department to use mandatory funding to pay for \nCRP technical assistance.\n  Unfortunately, the USDA has not followed through on congressional \nintent. Over the past year, the USDA has diverted over $90 million from \nworking\n\n[[Page S14127]]\n\nlands incentive programs. Without corrective action, farmers' \nconservation options will be curtailed even more severely as the USDA \ntransfers funding away from working lands incentive programs to pay for \ntechnical assistance for other programs in the Department.\n  The amendment simply, but explicitly, states that the USDA may not \ntake funding from working lands conservation programs to pay for CRP \ntechnical assistance. This clarification will allow our working lands \nprograms to retain the funding that Congress provides. It does not add \nor subtract funding, rather it makes sure that the funds are used by \nthe program for which Congress intended.\n  Let me also emphasize that the amendment does not require USDA to \nshut down CRP in fiscal year 2004. It continues to allow the USDA to \nexercise its authority to provide CRP technical assistance through \nmandatory funding, exactly as Congress originally directed in the 2002 \nfarm bill.\n  In closing, I join my distinguished colleagues today because I \nbelieve it is time that Congress step in and protect our working lands \nprograms from being raided by the USDA. Until we can reach a broader \nagreement on implementation of the 2002 farm bill provision on \nconservation technical assistance, it is imperative that we hold our \nworking lands conservation programs harmless. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate what my colleagues are trying \nto do. Clearly there is a problem.\n  When we passed the farm bill, we made an unprecedented investment in \nconservation.\n  First as chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover conservation, then as the ranking member of the subcommittee, I \nworked closely with my colleagues on both sides to increase funding for \nEQIP and WHIP and the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program and to \ncreate the Grasslands Reserve Program and increase the acreage for CRP \nand WRP.\n  Unfortunately, I am unable to support this amendment, because while \nit attempts to correct an injustice, it does not fix the problem.\n  This amendment, if enacted into law, would stop the CRP program in \nits tracks.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program is one of the most successful \nconservation programs in agriculture. It is a win-win for agriculture \nand the environment. It benefits landowners and wildlife. In fact, it \nhas been proved to be the most effective federal program for production \nof waterfowl in the United States.\n  In Idaho, we had more than 55,000 acres recently accepted into the \nprogram. If this amendment were enacted, those acres could not be \nenrolled because of lack of technical assistance funding.\n  Likewise, I have been a strong proponent for the Continuous CRP \nprogram. This important program provides tremendous benefits for the \nenvironment and maintains working lands. I have continually encouraged \nUSDA to enroll more CRP acreage in this important part of the CRP \nprogram. However, this program would come to a screeching halt without \ntechnical assistance funding.\n  I share my colleagues' concerns and interest in finding a solution, \nbut this is not a full solution. I cannot support an amendment that \nwould have such a disastrous effect on the CRP program.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee, I am committed to working with \nAgriculture Committee Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Harkin and \nother interested members to find a solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to seek a workable solution that protects all of \nour conservation programs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment, \nalong with my colleagues Senators Leahy and Snowe. This amendment will \nprotect the funding for important working lands conservation programs, \nthe Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, the Farm and \nRanchland Protection Program, FRPP, the Wildlife Habitat Improvement \nProgram, WHIP, and the Grassland Reserve Program, GRP. It will do so by \nprohibiting the U.S. Department of Agriculture from diverting funds \nfrom these working lands conservation programs in order to fund the \ntechnical assistance costs of another conservation program, the \nConservation Reserve Program, CRP.\n  Working lands conservation programs provide vital assistance to a \nlarge number of farmers, but they are especially critical to small and \nspecialty crop growers, such as the potato and blueberry growers in my \nState of Maine. These programs help farmers manage their land in ways \nthat improve production while, at the same time, protecting the \nenvironment, reducing agricultural runoff, and enhancing wildlife \nhabitat.\n  Unfortunately, despite the large increase in funding for these \nprograms contained in the Farm Bill of 2002, a significant number of \nfamily farmers who wish to participate in these programs--who seek \nassistance in their efforts to change their farming practices in order \nto improve water quality and availability in their communities, or to \nrestore wetlands--have been turned away.\n  They have been turned away because the U.S. Department of Agriculture \ndecided to divert funds from these working lands conservation programs \nin order to pay for technical assistance for the Conservation Reserve \nProgram. Although the Conservation Reserve Program is itself a worthy \nprogram, it serves a different purpose than the working land \nconservation programs. The most significant of the differences between \nthese programs is that the Conservation Reserve Program provides \npayments to farmers who take farmland out of production, while the \nworking land conservation programs provide assistance to farmers who \nwant to keep farming their land--but to do so in a way that helps the \nenvironment.\n  When we enacted the farm bill of 2002, we recognized the value of \nboth of these types of programs, the Conservation Reserve Program and \nthe working lands conservation programs, and provided significant \nfunding for both types of programs. The Department of Agriculture's \ndecision to divert funds from the working lands conservation programs \nin order to pay for technical assistance for the Conservation Reserve \nProgram is not consistent with the carefully crafted balance reached in \nthe farm bill. It is also inconsistent with the commitment made by \nCongress and the administration to America's farmers and ranchers--a \ncommitment to provide assistance to those who wish to participate in \nvoluntary conservation programs while keeping their land in \nagricultural production.\n  This amendment closes the loophole that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has used to divert funds from these working lands \nconservation programs in order to pay for other priorities that the \nDepartment deems more important. With this amendment, we keep the \ncommitment made to our farmers and ranchers in the farm bill of 2002--a \ncommitment to support and assist them as they work to enhance their \nstewardship of the land. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nrequest that the time for the quorum call be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Further, I ask unanimous consent that the time running \non the Daschle amendment be set aside and reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. And that we now allow the Senator from North Dakota to \nproceed with his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, this would not \nprohibit Senator Harkin from coming later and speaking if desires.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It would be my intention, when Senator Harkin arrives to \nspeak on the Daschle amendment, to ask that the Senator from North \nDakota summarize his remarks to allow the Senator from Iowa to speak. I \nask if the Senator from North Dakota would agree to do that.\n\n[[Page S14128]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I missed the comment by the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. When Senator Harkin arrives--we have been saving time \nfor him--I ask if the Senator from North Dakota would summarize his \nstatement at that point and allow Senator Harkin to make his comments \non the Daschle amendment, after which we could then return to the \nDorgan amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If Senator Harkin arrives on the floor, I will begin \nslowing down, if that is the question, and come to a complete stop at \nan appropriate moment.\n  I do not intend to speak at great length on this amendment. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Burns, also wishes to speak, as well as my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, wishes to speak. My expectation is that the \npresentations will all be relatively brief, but I certainly would \nrespect the interests of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Could we enter into an agreement that the total time \nconsumed on the Dorgan amendment, without allocation to one side or the \nother, would be 30 minutes under the control of Senator Dorgan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me understand, the 30 minutes would be \nunder my control?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct, so that anyone who wished to speak \nwould have to get the permission of Senator Dorgan, and that 30 minutes \nmight be interrupted by Senator Harkin's presentation, but the full 30 \nwould be under the control of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2117\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I can send the amendment to the desk if we \nwish to consider it now. My thought was it would be accepted and \nprobably be put in a managers' amendment. I send the amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Burns, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2117.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for guaranteed broadband loans, with an \n                                offset)\n\n       On page 47, line 13, strike ``$335,963,000'' and insert \n     ``$647,000,000''.\n       On page 48, line 2, strike ``$9,116,000'' and insert \n     ``$15,116,000''.\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__. REDUCTION IN TRAVEL AMOUNTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, each \n     amount provided by this Act for travel expenses is reduced by \n     the pro rata percentage required to reduce the total amount \n     provided by this Act for such expenses by $6,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might describe this amendment--and I \nwill do so rather briefly because I spoke about it yesterday--I think \nwe are on the road perhaps to having this amendment accepted, in which \ncase we would not need a recorded vote. As I indicated, I offer this \namendment with my colleagues, Senator Burns of Montana and Senator \nConrad of North Dakota. This amendment deals with a provision we put in \nthe farm bill having the rural utility services create a broadband loan \nprogram.\n  During consideration of the farm bill, which we enacted in the \nCongress, we provided a very important provision that will provide for \nloans for the build-out of broadband capability throughout rural areas \nof our country.\n  The build-out was part of $100 million in direct spending to \nsubsidize $3.5 billion of loan funds at good interest rates that would \nentice those who are interested in building out the infrastructure of \nbroadband capability to rural areas to begin doing so.\n  Now, why is that important? It is important because if someone is on \nthe wrong side of the digital divide and they do not have broadband \ncapability in rural areas, their opportunity for economic development \nis gone. So we have been trying to find ways to help develop the build-\nout of the infrastructure for broadband capability in all areas of the \ncountry, especially and including rural areas.\n  The $100 million in that bill was going to provide an opportunity for \n$3.5 billion in broadband loans over the 6 years, as I indicated.\n  The Rural Utility Service announced they were going to combine $40 \nmillion in the farm bill for the first 2 years and package that up. \nThey said they would make $1.4 billion in loans available for broadband \nbuildout. As a result of that, they would provide not only loans but \n$80 million in loan guarantees, and so they would have $1.295 billion \nof loans at the Treasury rate of interest.\n  This is easily the biggest broadband loan program in the history of \nthis country. Why is it important? Let me give an example, going back \nto the 1930s. In the 1930s, very few farms and rural areas were wired \nfor electricity, so we created the Rural Electrification Act, the REA \nProgram, and began stringing lines to the rural reaches of America. \nThat program was remarkably successful in providing to small towns and \nfamily farms in this country the capability of using electricity to \nenhance their productivity. When we electrified rural America, we \ndramatically increased the productivity of America's family farms.\n  We now are in a circumstance where we talk about the information \nrevolution and the new technology and information and something called \nbroadband. Broadband simply describes the diameter of the pipes through \nwhich information flows. If you have dial-up connections, you have a \ncomputer, and you know there is a certain timeframe moving around your \ncomputer and moving around the Internet. If you have broadband or \nadvanced communications services, it is a bigger pipe and you can move \nvast amounts of data very quickly.\n  The opportunity to do that is critically important to small areas, \nrural areas of the country in order for them to attract economic \nopportunity and economic development. Without it, they are consigned to \na future without that kind of economic opportunity. That is why we are \ntrying to provide it here, just as we did in the underlying 1996 act \nwhich I helped write. We talked about advanced services then, \ncomparable services at comparable rates. You have broadband in most big \ncities now. The question is, will rural areas have the same \nopportunities?\n  What happened was RUS put this money together and they were going to \nput out nearly $1.3 billion of loans at 4.9 percent. Again, easily the \nmost significant program of building out information infrastructure. \nWhat happened was they set a July 31 deadline for applications. They \nreceived applications for $1 billion in loans. That means there are \npeople out there very anxious to move this capability out to rural \nareas. That is a big deal. This is not just some theoretical argument. \nThis is talking about whether, in the rural reaches of America, you \nwill have economic opportunity and jobs and growth again.\n  We have $1 billion in loan applications. Now the language that has \nbeen included in the Agriculture appropriations bill essentially \neliminates the broadband section of the farm bill. It will put some \nmoney into loans, yes, but does so without the mandatory spending for \nit and would essentially cut in half the loan levels.\n  That is particularly bothersome because what is going to happen is \nthey are going to have to start over down at USDA with a much smaller \namount of money and much less impact on broadband capability.\n  The proposal I offer with my colleagues would provide an additional \n$6 million. This does not make us whole, but instead of going from $20 \nmillion down to $9 million, roughly we go back up to $15 million. It is \nnot the full money we need, but it would increase the $9.1 million to \n$15.1 million. This is not a massive amount of money, given the bill we \nare talking about. It just is not. But it is very important for us to \npass this amendment because otherwise we will have had a significant \nstart, with great promise, and will have brought this to a grinding \nhalt, and we will have the promise of broadband buildout all across \nrural America only to find out Congress put the brakes on it. That is \nnot something we want to do.\n\n[[Page S14129]]\n\n  I mentioned yesterday, recently when I was in my hometown of 300 \npeople, a small community in northwestern North Dakota, I walked into \nwhat used to be my old boyhood home. I asked the folks if I could just \nstop in and see it. I hadn't been there for many years. The young woman \nwho now lives there with her husband and children said she was happy to \nshow me my old home. I looked around. In her kitchen--I hope she won't \nmind me saying this--on the shelf she had a piece of equipment. I \ncouldn't recognize it at first, but it had a camera attached to it, and \nthe camera was taking a picture of something on a spool, hanging on a \nmetal spool. It was a bracelet. She said: I am taking a picture of this \nbracelet. Then I scan it and put it on the Internet, on eBay, because I \nsell things on eBay.\n\n  Here is a woman in a very small community in western North Dakota who \nis a merchant selling products on eBay. It shows that all over this \ncountry people have enterprising hopes about what they want to do, what \nkind of business they want to be engaged in. But if we do not have the \ncapability to build out broadband services to rural areas, we will \nforever consign them to a dismal economic future.\n  Let me make one final point. That little town I grew up in, Regent, \nND, a wonderful community, is part of Headinger County. My home county \nis larger than the State of Rhode Island. When I left it, there were \n5,000 people living there. There are now 2,800 citizens living in \nHeadinger County. The State demographer says in the year 2020 they \nexpect it to be 1,800 people; 5,000 to 1,800 in a county the size of \nRhode Island, slightly larger.\n  Those people want opportunity. They want to build and grow. They want \nsome hope for the future. That woman, in that little home selling on \neBay, represents that spark of enterprise, that hope that maybe things \ncan be better. Maybe you can build businesses in those rural areas. But \nyou simply cannot do it if you don't move ahead with this program we \nput in the farm bill.\n  I introduced legislation about 3 years ago. Much of it was put in the \nfarm bill to create these loan funds. I was astounded to learn this \nappropriations bill effectively emasculates the funding that would have \nbeen automatic for the 6-year period, that would have created this \naggressive broadband buildout. That is why we have to restore some of \nthis funding. It is important.\n  People say it is a little issue. It is not a little issue to people \nin my hometown or other hometowns all across this country, living in \nrural areas, who want to make a living and want to have some hope for \nthe future. That is what this is about.\n  We have already had a pattern and a template for how this works. It \nis the old REA Program. It worked in a wonderful way to electrify rural \nAmerica and offer people light and hope. This is the same proposition. \nLet's not miss this opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I indicated Senator Burns, Senator Conrad, Senator \nClinton, and Senator Leahy are cosponsors. I ask unanimous consent they \nbe added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield some time to the Senator from Montana, followed \nby time to my colleague from North Dakota. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Montana and if he wishes more, there is certainly more \navailable.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, if anyone in this body said the Government could \ninvest $40 million and, in less than a year, generate commitments to \ninvest or leverage $1.2 billion in job-creating, productivity-enhancing \nand life-improving infrastructure in some of America's most rural and \nremote areas, I would suspect the Members of this body and the public \nat large would judge that to be a successful and exciting economic \ndevelopment strategy. That is exactly what has happened.\n  This broadband loan program is administered by the Rural Utility \nService of the United States Department of Agriculture. In 10 short \nmonths the RUS broadband loan program has generated about $1 billion in \napplications, primarily in Treasury rate-of-interest loans that contain \nat least 20 percent equity leverage. That is a pretty good return.\n  Let me build on what my friend from North Dakota said. I was pretty \nsmall when the debate on REA started, the Rural Electrification \nAdministration. There is not one Senator in this body who has not gone \nto an annual meeting of an REA. My first line is always: If it had not \nbeen for REA, in the country areas we would be watching television by \ncandlelight. That is a truism. Now we are in a different era. We are in \nan era when there is an infrastructure of the deployment of broadband. \nBroadband expanded services is as important to downtown America as it \nis to rural areas because of their ability to communicate instantly and \nto move massive amounts of information instantly.\n\n  We have heard of the digital divide. This is a just one small step \nthat closes that gap or that divide. It is working. Figures back it up. \nI was as surprised as anyone when this funding was taken out of the \nbill because it was not working. That wasn't the reason at all. \nBroadband technologies, whether delivered by fiber, licensed or \nunlicensed spectrum, or satellite, have the power to transform \ncommunities.\n  High-speed access to the Internet is becoming as important to the \nrural economic development as good roads or good sewers or even \nelectricity itself. It opens worlds of opportunities for rural \nbusinesses, farmers, and ranchers and provides up-to-the-minute market \ninformation; and rural schools for distance learning.\n  We still have a boarding school in my State of Montana. You take your \nhigh school students to school on Monday morning and you do not see \nthem until Friday night. That is remote. That is frontier.\n  This technology is also a way to expand curriculum and allow those \nyoung people to have the same educational opportunities as young people \nin the more urban areas.\n  Think about what it does to the rural areas as far as telemedicine. \nWe know we have an aging population in rural areas. I have 14 counties \nthat have no doctors at all. The delivery of health care is completely \ndifferent than it was years ago.\n  We have as much obligation to make sure there is a buildup of \nbroadband as we had with electricity after World War II. I know what \nwas in our house. Our house didn't have electricity until about 1949-\n1950. I know that it transformed rural America. This provides the same \npossibility.\n  With this amendment, we have restored a tool which investors can use \nto build up this important piece of infrastructure which will become \nvery important to rural America.\n   If the Federal Government could invest $40 million and in less than \na year generate commitments to invest about $1.2 billion in job \ncreating, productivity enhancing, life improving infrastructure in some \nof America's most rural and emote areas, I suspect most members of the \nbody and the public at large would judge that to be a successful and \nexciting economic development strategy.\n   That is exactly what has happened in the broadband loan program \nadministered by the Rural Utilities Service RUS, of the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture. In ten short months, the RUS broadband loan \nprogram has generated about a billion in applications primarily for \ntreasury rate of interest loans that contain at least 20 percent equity \nleverage.\n   Broadband technologies whether delivered by fiber, licensed or \nunlicensed spectrum or satellite have the power to transform \ncommunities. High-speed access to the Internet is becoming as important \nto rural economic development as good roads and sewers. It opens worlds \nof opportunity for rural business, offers farmers up to the minute \nmarket information, rural schools the chance to offer advanced \nplacement courses and rural health care facilities access to the finest \nmedical advice and services available.\n   While many areas served by companies and cooperatives in the RUS \ntelecommunications program had modern advanced services, too many rural \ncommunities were far outside the service territory of these broadband \npioneers. The RUS broadband loan program offered an exciting \nopportunity to close this digital divide.\n   As one of the co-authors of the broadband loan provisions contained \nin the farm bill, I strongly believe that\n\n[[Page S14130]]\n\nthe Senate must keep faith with the carriers, cooperatives, communities \nand consumers who have been inspired to launch plans to bring broadband \nservices to hometown America.\n   The broadband loan program builds on a proven sixty-eight year model \nwhich has brought modern telephone, electric and water infrastructure \nto rural areas. The farm bill added a new broadband title to the Rural \nElectrification Act. It also created a reliable, predictable multi-year \nstream of mandatory funding to instill confidence that sufficient funds \nwould be available until expended to encourage investment.\n   Unfortunately, the funding for this program which is so vital to the \neconomic health of rural America has been severely cut. We should be \ndoing everything possible to incentivize broadband buildout in rural \nAmerica rather than targeting this creative program which promises to \nbring huge benefits to vast areas of the country. I call on my \ncolleagues to support the Dorgan-Burns amendment to restore funding to \nthis critical program. It is very important.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Conrad from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for \nproposing this amendment and our friend and neighbor, Senator Burns \nfrom Montana, for cosponsoring it. This is an important amendment. I \nwas among the handful of negotiators of the farm bill representing the \nSenate as we negotiated with the House on the final provisions. These \nprovisions were especially important to those of us who represent the \nmost rural areas in the country. If you do not have broadband access in \nthe modern world, you are left out and left behind, and your economic \nprospects are badly diminished.\n  On the other hand, if you are part of this extraordinary development, \nall of a sudden distance and the barriers of distance fall away.\n  We know the greatest difficulty for our State has been our distance \nfrom markets. That is what has disadvantaged the economic opportunity \nfor people from North Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota. I see the \nSenator from Idaho--his State as well, and Wyoming, and so many other \nStates in the heartland of America.\n  The provisions that were put into the farm bill were designed to give \nus a chance to open new opportunities and to reduce the barriers of \ndistance. Twenty million dollars is a modest amount of money. But in \nthe appropriations bill they cut it by more than 50 percent--to $9.1 \nmillion. We all know that amount of money in and of itself is not going \nto make an extraordinary difference. But that is not how it works. That \nsmall amount of money leverages much larger amounts of loans. It is \nmore than 30 to 1. On a $6 million amount, you would increase, by at \nleast $180 million, loans that are available across the country. I have \nbeen told it may be more than $300 million because what you are doing \nwith a small amount of money is leveraging a large amount of lending to \nbuild broadband in the rural parts of this country.\n  This is a matter of fairness. It is a matter of economic development. \nIt is a matter of keeping the promise that was made in the farm bill. \nNothing could be more clear. Nothing could be more important in terms \nof economic opportunity in the rural parts of the country than to make \nsure they are part of this developing technology.\n  In the 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower recognized the importance of having a \nnation connected by an interstate highway system. He proposed the \nlegislation that provided for Federal funding.\n  That is precisely what this does with the new technology--to provide \nbroadband that ties America together that provides opportunity.\n  Every year, I put on an event in North Dakota which we call \n``Marketplace for Entrepreneurs.'' Last year, there were 8,000 people \nin attendance. We have hundreds of classes. Some of them are on how you \nwrite a business plan or how to use the Internet or how to use \nbroadband to develop your business, to expand your business, to create \na business.\n  There is nothing more hopeful in terms of opportunity in rural areas \nthan to have this new technology available.\n  Congress ought not to turn its back on a promise just made and cut \nthe funding.\n  I am told now this $6 million will provide an additional loan amount \nof over $275 million--$6 million becomes $275 million in loans all \nacross the rural part of the country. Why? How can that be? How can $6 \nmillion turn into $275 million? It is because you need just a little \nbit of a guarantee to get over the hump to cause lenders to make these \nloans. It gives some additional assurance that it is going to be \nrepaid. It is very interesting. History shows that in fact the money is \nrepaid. It works.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take one final minute, and I think \nwe are finished speaking on this side. And I will yield back the \nremainder of my time when we are finished.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish this discussion by adding another point. \nThere is a book titled ``Distance is Dead.'' The book describes the \ninformation revolution. From almost anyplace you are a click away from \nanywhere. In North Dakota, we are a click away from the Hudson River. \nWe are as close to Manhattan as the Hudson River with telecommunication \nand new technologies. But that is only the case if you have the \nbuildout of broadband, if you have the capability to allow people to \nuse this Internet in the way that most urban areas are able to do it.\n  We have in rural areas--I have mentioned my hometown--much that \nothers aspire to recreate in our country: strong schools, good \nneighbors, great places to raise kids. We have a lot of things that \nmake these small towns in rural areas wonderful places to live. But we \nneed jobs there. We need economic opportunity development there.\n  If distance is dead, then opportunity is born in rural areas with \ninformation technology. If we are a click away from anywhere, if we are \na nanosecond away by clicking a mouse and providing information \nanywhere, any time, then we have opportunities to attract businesses \nand create jobs in these wonderful areas of America's heartland. But if \nwe do not have the buildout of the infrastructure, if you do not have \nsimilar opportunities with broadband development in rural areas, then \nyou have what is called a digital divide.\n  If you are on the wrong side of that digital divide, if you live on \nthe wrong side of that digital divide, you are in big trouble; your \ncommunity is going nowhere. That is why this is an important issue. It \nis why we have been working on it for some long while and why this \namendment deserves to be approved.\n  We have no further speakers. I know Senator Bennett has other things \nhe wishes to do with the bill. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. There has been no objection to this amendment raised on \nthis side. I ask now for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The amendment (No. 2117) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand now that Senator Leahy has \nan amendment that he would like to offer and debate. I ask the Senator \nif he would agree to a half an hour time limit on his amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is the Senator from Utah suggesting a half \nhour evenly divided?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, half an hour evenly divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think that would be enough, but just to be on the safe \nside,\n\n[[Page S14131]]\n\nI will check with a couple of Members. Could we say 40 minutes evenly \ndivided? I assume I will be able to yield some of that back.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am happy to propound a unanimous \nconsent agreement that there be 40 minutes equally divided devoted to \nthe Leahy amendment with no second-degree amendments allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2119\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senator Snowe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Collins, Senator \nReed of Rhode Island, and Senator Clinton. I ask, first, that the \npending amendment be laid aside and that I send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reed and Mrs. Clinton, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2119.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To restrict the use of funds for certain conservation \n                               programs)\n\n       On page 79, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__. USE OF FUNDING FOR CERTAIN CONSERVATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     pay the salaries or expenses of employees of the Department \n     of Agriculture to carry out the conservation reserve program \n     established under subchapter B of chapter 1 of subtitle D of \n     title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831 et \n     seq.) using funds made available under paragraphs (4) through \n     (7) of section 1241(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 \n     U.S.C. 3841(a)).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment is quite straightforward. We \noffered it to restore the conservation funding commitment Congress and \nthe administration made to farmers and ranchers in the 2002 farm bill. \nI was one of the conferees in that farm bill. I remember we went all \nnight long. We went weekend after weekend. The final bill was a very \ndelicately put together compromise between Republicans and Democrats in \nboth bodies and the administration, between those in the East, those in \nthe West, those in the Midwest. It was a very delicate balance because \nof the amount of money involved and how it would be allocated.\n  It was especially important because in this bill there was concern \nwhen it was passed whether those in the East would vote for the bill. \nOur amendment addressed the problem that Senators, if not all Senators, \nhave been hearing about.\n  Despite the historic conservation funding levels of the 2002 farm \nbill, the family farmers and ranchers trying to restore wetlands are \noffering to change the way they farm to improve air and water quality \nare rejected when they seek USDA help. Producers are turning away \nbecause of a Department of Agriculture decision earlier this year to \ndivert $158.7 million from working lands conservation programs, to pay \nfor the conservation reserve and wetlands reserve. It goes directly \nagainst the clear directive in the 2002 farm bill. That directed the \nUSDA use mandatory funds for the Commodity Credit Corporation to pay \nfor CRP and WRP technical assistance.\n  This may sound technical, but the fact is, by not following what the \nCongress voted for, Republicans and Democrats alike, we end up having \nthe administration raid the farm bill, raid working lands programs.\n  This chart shows what happens: $57 million diverted from EQIP, the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program; $18 million diverted from the \nFarmland and Rangeland Protection Program; $9.6 million diverted from \nthe Grasslands Reserve Program; and $5.6 million from the WHIP, \nWildlife Habitat Incentives Program, to pay for technical assistance.\n  All these are included for different reasons. The Wildlife Habitat \nIncentives Program helps those who fish and hunt. They were part of the \noverall compromise. Their money is gone.\n  The language of the statute, a relevant colloquy, supports this \ninterpretation, and the General Accounting Office concurred in a recent \nmemo that we settled a very clear intent of the Congress how that money \nbe spent. I ask unanimous consent that memo be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     United States\n\n\n                                    General accounting Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2002.\n     Hon.

Henry Bonilla,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA \n         & Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n         Representatives.\n       Funding for Technical Assistance for Conservation Programs \n     Enumerated in Section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill\n       This responds to your letters of August 30, 2002 (from \n     Chairman Bonilla) and September 16, 2002 (from Chairman Kohl \n     and Ranking Minority Member Cochran) requesting our opinion \n     on several issues relating to funding technical assistance \n     for the wetlands reserve program (WRP) and the farmland \n     protection program (FPP). You asked for our views on the \n     following issues:\n       (1) Does the annual limit on fund transfers imposed by 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 714i (known as the section 11 cap) apply to \n     Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds used for technical \n     assistance provided the WRP and FPP as authorized by the Farm \n     Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill).\n       (2) Is the Department of Agriculture's Conservation \n     Operations appropriation available for technical assistance \n     for the WRP and the FPP? and\n       (3) Did the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) July \n     18, 2002, decision not to apportion funds for technical \n     assistance for the WRP and the FPP violate the Impoundment \n     Control Act.\\1\\\n       For the reasons given below, we conclude that:\n       (1) the section 11 cap does not apply to funds for \n     technical assistance provided for the conservation programs \n     enumerated in section 3841, title 16, U.S.C., as amended by \n     section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill;\n       (2) the Conservation Operations appropriation is not an \n     available funding source for the WRP and the FPP operations \n     and associated technical assistance; and\n       (3) OMB's failure to initially apportion WRP and FPP funds \n     was a programmatic delay and did not constitute an \n     impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. Further, since \n     OMB has approved recently submitted apportionments for these \n     two programs, and since budget authority for both the WRP and \n     the FPP was made available for obligation, there was no \n     impoundment of funds in fiscal year 2002.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill, Pub. L. No. 107-171, \n     116 Stat. 278, 279 (enacted on May 13, 2002) (codified at 16 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3841 and 3842) amended section 1241 of the \n     Food Security Act of 1985, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841, to provide \n     that the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) shall use the \n     funds of the CCC to carry out seven conservation programs, \n     including the provision of technical assistance to, or on \n     behalf of, producers. The WRP and the FPP are among the \n     conservation programs named in the 2002 Farm Bill that are to \n     be funded with CCC funds.\n       In its June 19, 2002, apportionment request, the Department \n     of Agriculture (Agriculture) asked OMB to apportion a total \n     of $587,905,000 in CCC funds to the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service (NRCS) for both financial and technical \n     assistance related to section 3841 conservation programs. SF \n     132, Apportionment and Reapportionment Schedule for Farms \n     Security and Rural Investment Programs, Account No. 1221004, \n     July 18, 2002. Of the amount requested, Agriculture \n     designated $68.7 million for technical assistance to be \n     provided under the conservation programs. In its July 18, \n     2002, apportionment, OMB apportioned all of the funds for \n     financial and technical assistance requested for the \n     conservation programs, except $22.7 million designated for \n     WRP and FPP technical assistance. Id. OMB reports that it \n     did not apportion funds for WRP and FPP technical \n     assistance at that time, because OMB believed that the \n     section 11 cap, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 714i, limited the amount of \n     funds that could be transferred from CCC to other \n     government agencies for technical assistance associated \n     with the section 3841 conservation programs, and that CCC \n     funding of WRP and FPP technical assistance would exceed \n     the section 11 cap. Letter from Philip J. Perry, General \n     Counsel, OMB, to Susan A. Poling, Managing Associate \n     General Counsel, GAO, September 16, 2002. In discussions \n     with Agriculture regarding the use of CCC funds in excess \n     of the section 11 cap for section 3841 technical \n     assistance, OMB indicated to Agriculture that either CCC \n     funds subject to the section 11 cap or Agriculture's \n     Conservation Operations appropriation could be used to \n     fund this technical assistance, Id.\n       OMB reports that Agriculture recently submitted a new \n     apportionment request for $5.95 million for WRP technical \n     assistance (as well as the Conservation Reserve Program) \n     which OMB approved on September 3,\n\n[[Page S14132]]\n\n     2002. Id. OMB also reports that Agriculture submitted a new \n     apportionment request for an additional $2 million in FPP \n     financial assistance, which OMB approved on September 11, \n     2002, bringing the total apportionment for the FPP to the $50 \n     million authorized by section 3841. Id.\n\n\n                               discussion\n\n     1. Section 11 Cap\n       The question whether the section 11 cap (15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 714i) applies to technical assistance provided through \n     the conservation programs authorized by 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 3481, 3482, is one of statutory construction. It is \n     a well-established rule of statutory construction that \n     statutes should be construed harmoniously so as to give \n     maximum effect to both whenever possible. B-259975, Sept. 18, \n     1995, 96-1 CPD Sec. 124; B-258163, Sept. 29, 1994. Based upon \n     the language of the relevant statutes, we can read the \n     statutes in a harmonious manner, and, in doing so, we \n     conclude that the section 11 cap does not apply to technical \n     assistance provided under the section 3841 conservation \n     programs.\n       The section 11 cap is set fort in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 714i, \n     which states, in pertinent part:\n       ``The Corporation may, with the consent of the agency \n     concerned, accept and utilize, on a compensated or \n     uncompensated basis, the officers, employees, services, \n     facilities, and information of any agency of the Federal \n     Government, including any bureau, office, administration, or \n     other agency of the Department of Agriculture . . . . The \n     Corporation may allot to any bureau, office, administration, \n     or other agency of the Department of Agriculture or transfer \n     to such other agencies as it may request to assist it in the \n     conduct of its business any of the funds available to it for \n     administrative expenses  . . . After September 30, 1996, the \n     total amount of all allotments and fund transfers from the \n     Corporation under this section (including allotments and \n     transfers for automated data processing or information \n     resource management activities) for a fiscal year may not \n     exceed the total amount of the allotments and transfers made \n     under this section in fiscal year 1995.''\n\n     (Emphasis added.) We note that the section 11 funding \n     limitation applies only to funds transferred by the CCC to \n     other agencies under the authority of section 11.\n       The 2002 Farm Bill, which amended subsection (a) of section \n     3841, directs the Secretary to use CCC funds to carry out the \n     WRP and the FPP and five other conservation programs, \n     including the provision of technical assistance as part of \n     these programs. As amended, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841 provides, in \n     pertinent part, as follows:\n       ``For each of fiscal years 2002 through 2007, the Secretary \n     shall use the funds, facilities, and authorities of the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out the following \n     programs under subtitle D (including the provision of \n     technical assistance):\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (2) The wetlands reserve program under subchapter C of \n     chapter 1.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (4) The farmland protection program under subchapter B of \n     chapter 2, using, to the maximum extent practicable--(A) \n     $50,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 * * *''\n\n     16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a) (emphasis added). Section 3841 \n     provides independent authority for the provision of technical \n     services to these programs.\n       The 2002 Farm Bill also added a new subsection (b) to \n     section 3841. It is this provision that has generated the \n     current dilemma: ``Nothing in this section affects the limit \n     on expenditures for technical assistance imposed by section \n     11 of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. \n     714i).'' 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(b). When read in the context of \n     section 11, section 3841(b) makes clear that the section 11 \n     cap applies only to funds transferred under section 11. \n     Section 11 specifically imposes the cap on ``fund transfers . \n     . . under this section.'' Section 11 by its terms  clearly \n     does not apply to amounts transferred under other \n     authority, such as section 3841(a). And we read section \n     3841(b) to make plain that, while the section 11 cap \n     continues to apply to amounts transferred under section \n     11, it does not apply to amounts transferred by section \n     3841(a).\n        Accordingly, reading the above provisions harmoniously, we \n     conclude that: (1) the section 11 cap by its own terms \n     applies only to CCC funds transferred to other agencies under \n     section 11; (2) 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a) provides independent \n     authority for the Secretary to fund the seven conservation \n     programs named in that section out of CCC funds; and (3) 16 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3841(b) makes it clear that, while the section 11 \n     cap still applies to funds transferred by the CCC to other \n     government agencies for work performed pursuant to the \n     authority of section 11, the section 11 cap does not apply to \n     the seven conservation programs that are funded with CCC \n     funds under the authority of 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a).\n        Our conclusion that the section 11 cap does not apply to \n     the seven conservation programs of section 3841(a) is \n     confirmed by a review of the legislative history of the 2002 \n     Farm Bill, which shows that the Congress was attempting to \n     make clear that section 3841 technical assistance was not \n     affected by the section 11 cap. The legislative history to \n     the 2002 Farm bill unambiguously supports the view that the \n     Congress did not intend the section 11 cap to limit the \n     funding for technical assistance provided under the section \n     3841 conservation programs. In discussing the cap, the \n     Conference Committee stated: ``The Managers understand the \n     critical nature of providing adequate funding for technical \n     assistance. For that reason, technical assistance should come \n     from individual program funds.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 107-424 \n     at 497 (May 1, 2002) (emphasis added). In discussing \n     administration and funding of these conservation programs, \n     the Conference Committee further explained that:\n        ``The Managers provide that funds for technical assistance \n     shall come directly from the mandatory money provided for \n     conservation programs under Subtitle D, (Section 2701).\n        In order to ensure implementation, the Managers believe \n     that technical assistance must be an integral part of all \n     conservation programs authorized for mandatory funding. \n     Accordingly, the Managers have provided for the payment of \n     technical assistance from program accounts. The Managers \n     expect technical assistance for all conservation programs to \n     follow the model currently used for the EQIP whereby the \n     Secretary determines, on an annual basis, the amount of \n     funding for technical assistance. Furthermore, the Managers \n     intend that the funding will cover costs associated with \n     technical assistance, such as administrative and overhead \n     costs.''\n\n     H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 107-424 at 498-499 (2002) (Emphasis \n     added).\n        The ``EQIP model'' that the conferees referred to was \n     established in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform \n     Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-127, Subtitle E, 341, 110 Stat. \n     888, 1007 (1996) (1996 Farm Bill). For fiscal years 1996 \n     through 2002, the Secretary was to use CCC funds to carry out \n     the CRP, WRP and the Environmental Quality Incentives \n     programs (EQIP). (Former 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841 (a)). More \n     specifically, the 1996 Farm bill authorized the Secretary to \n     use CCC funds for technical assistance (as well as cost-share \n     payments, incentive payments, and education) under the EQIP \n     program. 16 U.S.C. 3841(b). While the 1996 Farm Bill \n     authorized the use of CCC funds to carry out the CRP and WRP \n     programs, it did not specifically authorize the funding of \n     technical assistance out of program funds as it did for EQIP.\n        Importantly, five days before enactment of the 2002 Farm \n     Bill when the Senate was considering the Conference Report on \n     the Farm Bill, a colloquy among Senators Harkin, Chairman, \n     Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Lugar, \n     its Ranking Republican Member, and Cochran, an Agriculture \n     Committee member, makes it unmistakably clear that the \n     section 11 cap was not meant to apply to the provision of \n     technical assistance with respect to any of the conservation \n     programs named in 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a):\n        ``Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy \n     with the distinguished Senators from Iowa and Mississippi. \n     Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill contained a provision which \n     led to serious disruption in the delivery of conservation \n     programs. Specifically, the 1996 act placed a cap on the \n     transfers of Commodity Credit Corporation funds to other \n     government entities. Is the distinguished Senator from Iowa \n     aware of the so-called ``section 11 cap?''\n        Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Indiana for raising \n     this issue, because it is an important one. The Section 11 \n     cap prohibited expenditures by the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation beyond the Fiscal Year 1995 level to reimburse \n     other government entities for services. Unfortunately, in \n     the 1996 farm bill, many conservation programs were \n     unintentionally caught under the section 11 cap. As a \n     result, during the past 6 years, conservation programs \n     have had serious shortfalls in technical assistance. There \n     was at least one stoppage of work on the Conservation \n     Reserve Program. The Appropriations Committees have had to \n     respond to the problem ad hoc by redirecting resources and \n     providing emergency spending to deal with the problem. \n     This has been a problem not just in my state of Iowa or in \n     your states of Indiana and Mississippi; it has been a \n     nationwide constraint on conservation.\n       Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chairman for the clarification, \n     and I would inquire whether the legislation under \n     consideration here today will fix the problem of the section \n     11 cap for conservation programs.\n       Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his \n     attention to this important issue. Section 2701 [16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3841] of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n     2002 recognizes that technical assistance is an integral part \n     of each conservation program. Therefore, technical assistance \n     will be funded through the mandatory funding for each program \n     provided by the bill. As a result, for directly funded \n     programs, such as the Conservation Security Program (CSP) and \n     the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), funding \n     for technical assistance will come from the borrowing \n     authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation, and will no \n     longer be affected by section 11 of the CCC Charter Act.\n       For those programs such as the CRP, WRP, and the Grasslands \n     Reserve Program (GRP), which involve enrollment based on \n     acreage, the technical assistance funding will come from the \n     annual program outlays apportioned by OMB-again, from the \n     borrowing authority of the CCC. These programs, to will no \n     longer be affected by section 11 of the CCC Charter Act. This \n     legislation will provide the level of funding necessary to \n     cover all technical assistance costs, including training; \n     equipment; travel; education, evaluation and assessment, and \n     whatever else is necessary to get the programs implemented.\n\n[[Page S14133]]\n\n       Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chairman for that clarification. \n     With the level of new resources and new workload that we are \n     requiring from the Department, and specifically the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service, I hear concerns back in my \n     state that program delivery should not be disrupted, and the \n     gentleman has reassured me that it will not.''\n\n     148 Cong. Rec. S3979, 4020 (daily ed. May 8, 2002) (emphasis \n     added).\n       In our view, the Congress intended all funding for the \n     seven conservation programs authorized in section 3841 \n     (Sec. 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill), including funding for \n     technical assistance, to be mandatory funding drawn from \n     individual program funds, rather than from CCC's \n     administrative funds that are subject to the section 11 cap. \n     Accordingly, based on the language of 3841, we conclude that \n     the section 11 cap does not apply to funds for technical \n     assistance provided under the conservation programs \n     enumerated in section 3841.\n     2. Availability of the Conservation Operations Appropriation\n       The next issue is whether the Department of Agriculture's \n     Conservation Operations appropriation is available for \n     technical assistance for the WRP and the FPP. As noted above, \n     this issue arose when OMB advised Agriculture that its \n     Conservation Operations appropriation could be used to fund \n     this technical assistance. For the reasons that follow, we \n     conclude that Agriculture may not use its Conservation \n     Operations appropriation to fund the WRP and FPP.\n       The fiscal year 2002 Appropriation for the Conservation \n     Operations account provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n     natural resources conservation service conservation operations\n\n       ``For necessary expenses for carrying out the provisions of \n     the Act of April 27, 1935, (16 U.S.C. 590a-f), including \n     preparation of conservation plans and establishment of \n     measures to conserve soil and water (including farm \n     irrigation and land drainage and such special measures for \n     soil and water management as may be necessary to prevent \n     floods and the siltation of reservoirs and to control \n     agriculture related pollutants); operation of conservation \n     plant materials centers; classification and mapping of soil; \n     dissemination of information; acquisition of lands, water, \n     and interests therein for use in the plant materials program \n     by donation, exchange, or purchase . . . .''\n       Pub. L. No. 107-76, 115 Stat. 704 at 717, 718 (2001). In \n     addition to its availability to carry out the provisions of \n     the Act of April 27, 1935 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 590a-f), the fiscal \n     year 2002 Conservation Operations appropriation is also \n     available to carry out a variety of other specified programs \n     such as those authorized by 7 U.S.C. Sec. 428a, 7 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2209b, 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2250a, Sec. 202(c) of title II \n     of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 \n     (43 U.S.C. Sec. 1592(c)): section 706(a) of the Organic \n     Act of 1944 (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2225), for employment under 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3109 and 16 U.S.C. Sec. 590e-2. OMB asserts \n     that the language of the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation and the Act of April 27, 1935 cited therein \n     are broad enough to encompass the technical assistance \n     that Agriculture will provide under the WRP, the FPP and \n     the other section 3841 conservation programs. Since the \n     technical services provided by Agriculture under the WRP \n     and the FPP (and other section 3841 conservation programs) \n     fall within the general purposes articulated in the fiscal \n     year 2002 Conservation Operations appropriation, OMB \n     considers the Conservation Operations appropriation as an \n     additional available source of funding for technical \n     assistance provided as part of the section 3841 \n     conservation programs. In other words, the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation is available to continue \n     financing for the FPP and the WRP, when, in OMB's view, \n     the section 11 cap limits the availability of CCC funds \n     for those programs. We do not agree.\n       First, the Conservation Operations appropriation identifies \n     specific programs that it is available to fund, including the \n     authority to carry out the provisions of the Act of April 27, \n     1935 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 590a-f) cited by OMB above. However, \n     none of the specific statutory programs identified in the \n     Conservation Operations appropriation include the FPP or the \n     WRP found in 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3838h-3838i and 3837-3737f, \n     respectively. The FPP and the WRP were authorized by Title \n     XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, and the \n     provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 are not among the \n     statute listed in the Conservation Operations appropriation \n     as an object of that appropriation. Thus, the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation by its own terms does not finance \n     Agriculture programs and activities under the Food Security \n     Act.\\67\\\n       Second, even if the language of the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation could reasonably be read to include the WRP and \n     the FPP, section 3841, as amended by the 2002 Farm Bill, very \n     specifically requires that funding for technical assistance \n     will come from the ``funds, facilities, and authorities'' of \n     the CCC. Indeed, the statute is unequivocal--the Secretary \n     ``shall use the funds'' of the CCC to carry out the seven \n     conservation programs, including associated technical \n     assistance. It is well settled that even an expenditure that \n     may be reasonably related to a general appropriation may not \n     be paid out of that appropriation where the expenditure falls \n     specifically within the scope of another appropriation. 63 \n     Comp. Gen. 433, 427-428, 432 (1984); B-290005, July 1, \n     2002.\\8\\\n       Third, this view is supported by the Senate colloquy on the \n     2002 Farm Bill Conference report:\n       ``Mr. COCHRAN. It is then my understanding that, under the \n     provisions of this bill, the technical assistance necessary \n     to implement the conservation programs will not come at the \n     expense of the good work already going on in the countryside \n     in conservation planning, assistance to grazing lands, and \n     other activities supported within the NRCS conservation \n     operations account. And, further, this action will relieve \n     the appropriators of an often reoccurring problems.\n       Mr. HARKIN. Both gentlemen are correct. The programs \n     directly funded by the CCC-EQIP, FPP, WHIP, and the CSP--as \n     well as the acreage programs--CRP, WRP, and the GRP--include \n     funding for technical assistance that comes out of the \n     program funds. And this mandatory funding in no way affects \n     the ongoing work of the NRCS Conservation Operations \n     Program.''\n\n     148 Cong. Rec. S3979, 4020 (daily ed. May 8, 2002) (emphasis \n     added).\n       This colloquy underscores the understanding that the 2002 \n     Farm Bill specifically requires that funding for technical \n     assistance will come from the borrowing authority of the CCC \n     and will not interfere with other activities supported by the \n     Conservation Operations appropriation.\n       Furthermore, before passage of the 1996 Farm Bill, which \n     made a number of conservation programs, including the WRP, \n     mandatory spending programs, the WRP received a separate \n     appropriation for that purpose. In other words, before the \n     1996 farm bill provided CCC funding to run the program, the \n     WRP was not funded out of the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation. Pub. L. No. 103-330, 108 Stat. 2453 (1994); \n     Pub. L. No. 102-142, 105 Stat. 897 (1991). Moreover, \n     Agriculture has previously concluded that the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation is not available to fund \n     technical assistance with respect to programs authorized \n     under provisions of the Food Security Act. Their reasoning \n     tracks ours--the provisions of the Food Security Act are \n     not among the statutes cited in the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation. Memorandum from Stuart Shelton, \n     Natural Resources Division to Larry E. Clark, Deputy Chief \n     for Programs, Natural Resources Conservation Service and \n     P. Dwight Holman, Deputy Chief for Management, Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service, October 7, 1998 \n     (Conservation Operations appropriation is not available to \n     fund technical assistance for the Conservation Research \n     Program); GAO/RCED-99-247R, Conservation Reserve Program \n     Technical Assistance, at 9 (Aug. 5, 1999).\n       Thus, the Conservation Operations appropriation is not an \n     available funding source for WRP and FPP operations and \n     associated technical assistance. To the extent that \n     Agriculture might have used the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation for WRP, Agriculture would need to adjust its \n     accounts accordingly, deobligating amounts it had charged to \n     the Conservation Operations appropriation and charging those \n     amounts to the CCC funds. We note that in this event OMB \n     would need to apportion additional amounts from CCC funds to \n     cover such obligations.\n     3. Impoundment Control Act\n       The last question is whether OMB's July 18, 2002, decision \n     not to apportion funds for technical assistance for the WRP \n     and the FPP constitutes an impoundment under the Impoundment \n     Control Act of 1974. Based upon the most recent information \n     provided by OMB, to the extent OMB did not initially \n     apportion funds for the FPP or the WRP, the deal was \n     programmatic and did not constitute an impoundment of funds. \n     Also, based on information recently provided by OMB, no \n     impoundment of funds is occurring with respect to the FPP or \n     the WRP.\n       We generally define an impoundment as any action or \n     inaction by the President, the Director of OMB or any federal \n     agency that delays the obligation or expenditure of budget \n     authority provided in law. Glossary of Terms Used in the \n     Federal Budget Process, Exposure Draft, GAO/AFMD-2.1.1, Page \n     52 (1993). However, our decisions distinguish between \n     programmatic withholdings outside the reach of the \n     Impoundment Control Act and withholdings of budget authority \n     that qualify as impoundments subject to the Act's \n     requirements. B-290659, July 24, 2002. Sometimes delays are \n     due to legitimate program reasons. Programmatic delays \n     typically occur when an agency is taking necessary steps to \n     implement a program even if funds temporarily go unobligated. \n     Id. Such delays do not constitute impoundments, and do not \n     require the sending of a special message to the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 684(a). \n     Id.\n       Here, OMB initially did not apportion funds for WRP and FPP \n     technical assistance because it believed the section 11 cap \n     was applicable and would be exceeded. OMB's General Counsel \n     states that OMB reserved apportioning budget authority to \n     discuss its funding concerns with Agriculture. These funding \n     concerns generated a ``vigorous and healthy internal legal \n     discussion'' between the Department of Agriculture and OMB. \n     Letter from Nancy Bryson, General Counsel, Department of \n     Agriculture to the Honorable Tom Harkin, Chairman, Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, September \n     24, 2002. Since OMB delayed apportionment of technical \n     assistance funds because of uncertainty concerning the \n     applicability of statutory restrictions and since\n\n[[Page S14134]]\n\n     OMB approved Agriculture's subsequent apportionment requests, \n     we conclude that OMB did not impound funds under the \n     Impoundment Control Act. See B-290659, July 24, 2002 (delay \n     in obligating funds because of uncertainty whether statutory \n     conditions were met did not constitute an impoundment).\n       As noted above, according to OMB, Agriculture recently \n     submitted revised apportionment requests for technical \n     assistance for both the FPP and the WRP, and OMB has approved \n     the revised apportionments. For the FPP, Agriculture \n     requested an additional apportionment for financial \n     assistance of $2 million, bringing the total amount available \n     for obligation to $50 million. Thus, the entire $50 million \n     in FPP funds authorized by section 3841 have been \n     apportioned. Since OMB advises that it has apportioned the \n     full funding amount and that is available for obligation, \n     these funds were not impounded for the FPP.\n       As for the WRP funding, as noted above, on June 19, 2002, \n     Agriculture asked OMB to apportion a total of $20,655,000 for \n     WRP technical assistance. OMB did not apportion this amount. \n     SF 132, Apportionment and Reapportionment Schedule for Farms \n     Security and Rural Investment Programs, Account No. 1221004, \n     July 18, 2002. On August 30, 2002, Agriculture requested an \n     apportionment of WRP (and CRP) technical assistance for \n     totaling $5,950,000. SF 132, Apportionment and \n     Reapportionment Schedule for Commodity Credit Corporation \n     Reimbursable Agreements and Transfers to State and Federal \n     Agencies, Account No. 12X4336. On September 3, 2002, OMB \n     approved this request and apportioned $5,950,00. Id. Since \n     OMB apportioned the budget authority for the WRP and it was \n     made available for obligation, there was no impoundment of \n     funds in fiscal year 2002.\n       While the present record does not establish an impoundment \n     of the fiscal year 2002 funds appropriated for the WRP and \n     the FPP, we will continue to monitor this situation to ensure \n     that any impoundment that might occur in fiscal year 2003 for \n     conservation programs is timely reported.\n       We hope you find this information useful.

We are sending copies of this \n     letter to the Secretary of Agriculture, Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, the Chairmen and Ranking \n     Minority Members of the House and Senate Agriculture \n     Committees and other interested Congressional committees. \n     This letter will also be available on GAO's home page at \n     http//www.gao.gov.\n                                                Anthony H. Gamboa,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This bipartisan amendment simply overrides the USDA \ndecision and prevents funds from the Working Lands Incentive Programs \nsuch as EQIP, FRPP, GRP, and WHIP from being diverted. We are simply \nsaying USDA should follow the law as any other Department has to follow \nthe law.\n  I have been in the Senate a long time. I have been a member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee for nearly 30 years. I am a former \nchairman of that committee. I have long been an advocate for the CRP \nprogram. Some of my colleagues may be concerned how this impacts CRP.\n  I assure everyone the amendment is a first step toward solving the \ndilemma the administration put us in by ignoring the 2002 farm bill. We \nneed to solve the problem this year. Supporting the amendment assures \nit will be raised during conference.\n  We cannot allow this or any other administration, but especially one \nthat has demonstrated total disregard for the environment, to pick \nwinners and losers among the conservation programs. If we do not \naddress this, we will continue to rob Peter to pay Paul and it defies \nthe direct will of the Congress--again, the direct will in an agreement \nthat was negotiated between Republicans, Democrats, House, Senate, and \nthe administration. We have tried to hold our end of the deal. The \nadministration has not.\n\n  We provided $6.5 billion for working lands programs in the 2002 farm \nbill. We want farmers to manage working lands to produce our food and \nfiber but also to enhance water quality and to enhance wildlife \nhabitat. We are trying to put together a win-win situation: We enhance \nour water, improve wildlife habitat, and we still raise our food and \nfiber.\n  For example, EQIP helps share the cost of a whole lot of land \nmanagement practices that help the environment, including more \nefficient use of fertilizers and pesticides, and greater use of \ninnovative technologies to handle animal waste. It gives farmers the \ntools they need.\n  Every farmer and rancher I have heard from wants the money there. \nEvery farmer and rancher I have heard from says: How come we are not \nfollowing what the law requires?\n  If we continue to divert money, we are going to see programs such as \nEQIP, WHIP, and FRPP continue to face significant backlogs.\n  Let me show you this chart. This gives you an example of the unfunded \napplications.\n  In fiscal year 2002, USDA reported a $500 million backlog in the \nState of Texas, as I look at this chart. The national total is almost \n$1.5 billion--$1,486,000,944. There is a $17 million backlog in \nArkansas, a $20 million backlog in California, a $36 million backlog in \nFlorida, a $66 million backlog in Kansas, a $200 million backlog in \nMissouri, a $106 million backlog in Nebraska and, as I said, a $500 \nmillion backlog in Texas.\n  My little State of Vermont has a $7 million backlog. But look how \nmuch bigger it is in the rest of these States. So we have to go back. \nWe know 70 percent of the American landscape is private land. We know \nfarming dramatically affects the health of America's rivers, lakes, and \nbays. We have to go back to what we agreed when we passed the farm \nbill.\n  When farmers and ranchers take steps to improve air and water quality \nor assist rare species, they face new costs, new risks, or a loss of \nincome. These conservation programs help share these costs, underwrite \nthese risks, or offset these losses of income.\n  It helps our farmers and ranchers. They want it. They thought we \nagreed on it. We thought we had agreed on it. We should go back to what \nwe agreed to.\n  My amendment, a bipartisan amendment, does that. It tells the \nadministration to honor the 2002 farm bill by fully funding working \nlands conservation programs. The failure to adequately fund these \nworking lands conservation programs is having a dramatic impact on both \nfarmers and the farm economy.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the senior Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I submit into the Record a \nstatement regarding my position on an amendment offered by Senators \nLeahy and Snowe to the agriculture appropriations bill. Their \nbipartisan amendment was aimed at preventing the USDA from using funds \nfrom working lands incentive programs to pay for the technical \nassistance costs of the Conservation Reserve Program. Although I \nsupported the amendment from Senators Leahy and Snowe, I believe it \nunderscores the urgent need to prioritize conservation funding and \nensure that all conservation programs authorized in the 2002 farm bill, \nfrom the Grassland Reserve Program to the Conservation Reserve Program, \nreceive full funding. Robbing one important program to pay for another \ndoes not help us achieve our collective goal of improving conservation \non farmlands and in rural communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the intent of the amendment \nmy colleague from Vermont is offering. It is an attempt to ensure USDA \nwill carry out mandatory conservation programs as Congress intended in \nthe farm bill, as he has explained.\n  However, the effect of the Leahy amendment would be to freeze the \nlargest conservation program, the Conservation Reserve Program, until a \npermanent fix for the problem the Senator has outlined has been found.\n  I am not a member of the authorizing committee, but I am told by many \nwho are this was not the intent of Congress, that they are not anxious \nto have the Conservation Reserve Program frozen for any reason, for any \npurpose, so the Leahy amendment is opposed by many members of the \nauthorizing committee, including its chairman, Senator Cochran.\n  I asked Senator Cochran if he would be interested in speaking on this \namendment, and he smiled and very graciously delegated that \nresponsibility to me. I am grateful for the confidence, but I feel less \nequipped perhaps than the chairman himself might be.\n\n[[Page S14135]]\n\n  Nonetheless, the effect of the Leahy amendment would mean money would \nflow out of EQIP, WHIP, FRPP, and other programs to pay for the \ntechnical assistance for the Wetlands Reserve Program. Many members of \nthe authorizing committee, along with conservation groups and farm \ngroups, agree there is a problem, but not that there is a consensus as \nto how to solve the problem.\n  The Senator from Vermont has offered one proposal. But as yet, within \nthe authorizing committee, there is not a great deal of support for \nthat proposal that I am aware of.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. During the debate on the farm bill, there was a colloquy. \nThe distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, asked \nthe then-chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee ``whether the \nlegislation under consideration here today will fix the problem of the \nsection 11 cap for conservation programs.''\n  The Senator from Iowa responded it would, and he said:\n\n       As a result, for directly funded programs, such as the \n     Conservation Security Program and the Environmental Quality \n     Incentives Program, funding for technical assistance will \n     come from the borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation. . . .\n       For programs such as the CRP, WRP, and the Grasslands \n     Reserve Program . . . funding will come from the annual \n     program outlays . . . from the borrowing authority of the \n     CCC.\n\n  This was all carefully worked out. This GAO report shows it was the \nintent of Congress to do it the way we are funding. Unfortunately, \nthere are those at the Department of Agriculture who will admit that \nprivately but will not admit it publicly.\n  We are just trying to put the money back where it was. We are not \ntrying to rob any of the others. I am saying they should get the money \nit was said they would get.\n  As we showed, in Texas alone, we have a $500 million deficit they \nassumed had been promised to them. But now, because the reallocation is \nnot going there, hunters, those who fish, farmers, ranchers--they all \nagree they ought to get the money they asked for. They are good \nstewards of their land, but a lot of the applications to make sure they \nare good stewards of the land came about because we promised them the \nmoney, and now we are pulling it back. That is my concern. The GAO \nstudy makes it very clear it was intended this way.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me to point that out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am not arguing, and I do not know \nanyone who is arguing, that we do not have a problem, nor am I arguing \nthe Congress ought to ignore it or put it off. However, I do believe it \nis a fix that ought to be crafted in the Senate authorizing committee, \nthe committee which the Senator from Vermont chaired at one point, the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The chairman of that \ncommittee has also expressed his opposition to this amendment.\n  Because I am not a member of the committee, I am not equipped to get \ninto all of the details pro and con, other than to stand here as a \nsurrogate for the chairman and say I believe this belongs in the \nauthorizing committee and not on this appropriations bill. For that \nreason, I intend to vote against it. I understand a large number of \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee also intend to vote against it.\n  I do not have an argument, as I say, with the substance of the \nproblem. The Senator from Vermont is correct when he talks about the \nfact that we have a problem or the problem needs to be addressed. I am \nsimply opposing the amendment on the grounds this is not the vehicle \nwith which to do it, and the particular approach he has adopted does \nnot enjoy a consensus that would justify us going forward at this \nparticular time.\n  I would hope he would be able to craft a solution that would enjoy \nthat kind of consensus, and that we could return to this issue as a \nSenate and get it resolved at some point in the future.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from Utah has \nsaid. He is a dear friend of mine. I try to emulate him so much, I even \ngo to the same barber as he does. But in his State, Utah, they are \n$4.753 million behind what they thought they had been promised.\n  I couldn't agree more. I have been on the Appropriations Committee \nfor more than a quarter of a century. I don't like to see problems \nfixed in the Appropriations Committee that could have been fixed in the \nauthorizing committee. But we did fix it in the authorizing committee. \nWe did put in a GAO study. A colloquy between Senator Cochran and \nSenator Harkin and others makes it very clear we fixed it there. It is \nUSDA that is not following the law.\n  That is why Texas is behind $500 million in this area, Nebraska is \nbehind $106 million, and Missouri is behind $200 million. I will just \nread some of these figures. I hope people understand this is not an \nattack on the CRP program. I support CRP. I voted many times for the \nCRP in 29 years. What this amendment does is prevent the administration \nfrom raiding other conservation programs. Unfortunately, the \nadministration pits conservation programs against one another. What \nthey should do is take it out of the CCC account, as we said in the \nlaw.\n  But I hope when Senators vote, they realize, if they are from \nArizona, they have $30 million in their State's EQIP unfunded \napplication. If you are from Arizona, you have $30 million that your \nfarmers are looking for. If you are from Alabama, you have $10 million \nthey are looking for. If you are from Colorado, you have $36 million \nyou are looking for; Florida, $36 million; if you are from Iowa, you \nhave $30 million you are looking for but have not received. If you are \nfrom Kansas, you have backlogs of $66 million; Louisiana, $11 million; \nMissouri, $200 million; Nebraska, $106 million; Montana, $52 million; \nOklahoma, nearly $25 million; Tennessee, $21 million; West Virginia, \n$15 million.\n  Obviously, every Senator can vote any way he or she wants, but I \ndon't know, if I were from a State that had a backlog of $10 million, \nas Alabama does, or $30 million, as Arizona does, or $17 million, as \nArkansas does, or $35 million, as Colorado does, or $36 million, as \nFlorida does, or $30 million, as Iowa does, or $66 million, as Kansas \ndoes, or $12 million, as Louisiana does, or $200 million, as Missouri \ndoes, or $51 million, as Montana does, $106 million, as Nebraska does, \n$500 million, as Texas does, or $25 million, as Oklahoma does, or $8 \nmillion, as Pennsylvania does, I think I might want to vote for this \nand not go back and tell my State, ``Sorry.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the fiscal year 2002 \nEQIP unfunded applications that we now face.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   FY-2002 EQIP UNFUNDED

Mr. President, the Senator from Utah is back. If he would\n\n[[Page S14136]]\n\nlike, I would be prepared to yield back all time. I do ask for the yeas \nand nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be and there is.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. One thing I want to bring to the attention of the Senate \nnow: In today's Congress Daily PM--meaning the afternoon edition--the \nsecond paragraph communicates:\n\n       Democrats block consideration late Wednesday of fiscal year \n     2004 military construction conference report.\n\n  I want the record to be spread that that simply is not true. Whoever \ngave this reporter this information was either trying to mislead the \nreporter or simply didn't know what they were talking about. There was \nnever any effort made last night to move the military construction bill \nin any way. We are ready to move this at any time. We believe the \nconference reports which have been completed--Military Construction, \nEnergy and Water; those are the two I know of--should be completed \nimmediately.\n  I want everyone to understand, not last night nor any other time have \nwe ever blocked consideration of the fiscal year 2004 Military \nConstruction appropriations conference report. In fact, not only did we \nnot block it, no one asked us to participate in anything dealing with \nthat conference report. I wish they had. I hope maybe tonight we can do \nsomething about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are currently drawing up a unanimous \nconsent request that would lock down the time. Does the Senator from \nVermont yield back the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator from Utah intends to, yes, I will.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Utah is willing to yield back the \nremainder of the time in opposition to the Senator's amendment. We have \nan amendment that will be offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania on \nwhich it is my intention to have a voice vote and accept. We are \ngetting the exact language, but it is my intention that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania be given 15 minutes.\n  I would ask if Senator Harkin is still planning to come over to take \nhis 15 minutes of debate on the Daschle amendment. If he is, that would \nmean we could vote on the Leahy amendment and the Daschle amendment and \nthen on final passage around 5:30.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to my friend, Senator Harkin originally \nwanted to take 15 minutes on the Daschle amendment. But now what he \nwould like to do is take 5 minutes on the Leahy amendment and 5 minutes \non the Daschle amendment. So we actually save 5 minutes in the process. \nI hope that we can agree at this stage that Senator Harkin be \nrecognized to speak for 5 minutes on the Leahy amendment and 5 minutes \non the Daschle amendment. It is my understanding Senator Daschle wishes \nto speak prior to the vote on his amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that he does as well. We are \nworking all of that out.\n  Mr. REID. He wanted 10 minutes on that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. We will work that out in a way that will protect every \nSenator's rights. But to move us along now, time having been yielded \nback on the Leahy amendment, I would ask that the Chair recognize the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for 15 minutes to lay down his amendment. \nDuring that 15-minute period, we will codify all of these various \nagreements and bring that unanimous consent request forward.\n  Mr. REID. It seems we should get this tied down very quickly. I don't \nsee why we can't do that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my intention.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we do it right now. It is my understanding we are \ngoing to vote on Daschle, Leahy, and final passage; is that correct?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It was my intention to vote on Leahy first.\n  Mr. REID. Leahy, Daschle, and then you have some amendments you need \nto clear.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Then I have some perfecting amendments and then final \npassage.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter be \nrecognized to speak for 15 minutes on his amendment and that that be \ndetermined by a voice vote, as approved by the two managers; that \nfollowing that, Senator Harkin be recognized to speak for 5 minutes for \nthe Leahy amendment and 5 minutes for Senator Daschle's amendment, and \nSenator Daschle be recognized for 10 minutes; and following that, there \nbe votes on or in relation to both amendments, Leahy being first; and \nthat there be no second-degree amendments in order to either amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator has summarized the situation very well, as \nhe always does. I hope the Senate will agree to that unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I was \ntrying to hear that. I ask for at least 10 minutes on the Leahy \namendment and 10 minutes on the Daschle amendment. I may not take it \nall.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I so modify my request to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask a further modification: That I be \ngiven an additional 5 minutes, if necessary, for a response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, further, following the cleared amendments, \nall Members can be ready for a vote on final passage because I also ask \nunanimous consent that there be no further amendments in order other \nthan those mentioned, including the amendments cleared by the two \nmanagers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2080\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we now \nconsider my amendment No. 2080, which is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this amendment provides that none of \nthe funds made available by this act may be used to pay the salaries or \nexpenses of employees of the Department of Agriculture to allocate the \nrate of price support in a manner that does not support the price of \nmilk in accordance with section 1501(b) of the Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002.\n  That bill provides, in unequivocal terms, that the price of milk \nshall be supported at the rate equal to $9.90 per hundredweight for \nmilk containing 3.67 percent butterfat.\n  On July 8, 20 Senators wrote to the Secretary of Agriculture calling \non the Secretary to observe the law with respect to that pricing. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Ann Veneman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture, Department of Agriculture, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Veneman: We are writing in support of the \n     National Milk Producer Federation's request for immediate \n     action concerning the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, \n     purchase prices for dairy products. Since the current prices \n     reflect only those costs incurred for commercial sales, the \n     market price for individual products has fallen below support \n     levels, thus allowing the price of milk used to produce them \n     to fall below the statutory support level for milk of $9.90 \n     per hundredweight. Accordingly, it is imperative that action \n     be taken to adjust the support program purchase price levels \n     for cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk to reflect the \n     significant additional costs manufacturers face when selling \n     products to CCC.\n       Class III milk prices have fallen below the milk price \n     support level, and cheese prices have fallen below their \n     respective CCC purchase price levels, because the CCC dairy \n     commodity purchase prices do not compensate for the \n     significant additional costs manufacturers face when they \n     sell products to the CCC. As a result, manufacturers often \n     sell dairy commodities to commercial customers at prices well \n     below the CCC support purchase prices. During the months for \n     which the Class III prices have fallen below support, market \n     prices for cheddar block and barrel cheese have been several \n     cents below their respective support purchase prices.\n\n[[Page S14137]]\n\n       Without question, our dairy farmers are suffering and need \n     our help. Congress has done its part through enactment of the \n     Farm Bill. It is now time for your Department to follow \n     through and ensure that the price support program operates as \n     we intended. The adjustments outlined above can move us a \n     long way toward accomplishing this vital goal.\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. We \n     look forward to a timely response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Arlen Spector; Jack Reed; Barbara A. Mikulski; Max \n           Baucus; Russel D. Feingold; Paul Sarbanes; Frank \n           Lautenberg; Jim Jeffords; Patty Murray; Ted Kennedy; \n           Patrick Leahy;\n         Charles Schumer; Mark Dayton; Tim Johnson; Susan Collins; \n           Olympia Snowe; Joe Biden; John F. Kerry; Hillary Rodman \n           Clinton; Herb Kohl; Norman Coleman.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I was lead signatory of the letter. No \nSenator had received a reply, until today, when we were given a copy of \na letter dated August 13, 2003--that is a date stamp, not the date of \nthe letter, which purports to respond to that letter.\n  In effect, the letter from J.B. Penn, Under Secretary, Farm and \nForeign Agriculture Services, concedes that the law was not being \nfollowed. The relevant portion reads, in part:\n\n       [W]e appreciate your concern that many dairy sector \n     representatives believe that cheese manufacturers are \n     reluctant to sell to CCC, which, in turn, causes monthly \n     Class III milk prices (milk use for cheese) to fall below the \n     $9.90 per hundredweight price support level.\n\n  Omitting some language not directly relevant, the concluding sentence \nof the paragraph is:\n\n       The perception is that these additional requirements and \n     the requisite costs lead to the reluctance.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     United States\n\n\n                                    Department of Agriculture,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of Secretary Veneman, thank \n     you for your letter of July 8, 2003, jointly signed by your \n     colleagues, regarding the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) \n     dairy product purchase prices.\n       We appreciate your concern that many dairy sector \n     representatives believe that cheese manufacturers are \n     reluctant to sell to CCC, which, in turn, causes monthly \n     Class III milk prices (milk used for cheese) to fall below \n     the $9.90 per hundredweight price support level. As you know, \n     CCC has requirements in addition to those of commercial \n     sales, primarily for packaging materials, additional storage, \n     additional financing, and Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n     grading. The perception is that these additional requirements \n     and requisite costs lead to the reluctance.\n       Cheese prices have increased in recent weeks to $1.59 per \n     pound. This is 46 cents per pound above the CCC purchase \n     price and will result in a July Class III milk price above \n     $9.90. Cheese prices have increased because May and June milk \n     production was below a year ago, and there is concern in the \n     market that cheese stocks are inadequate.\n       We concur that there are extra costs to sell cheese to CCC \n     when compared to the commercial market. However, the fact is, \n     even under current conditions and prices, CCC purchased an \n     average of 1.4 million pounds of cheese per week in January \n     through June. To address industry's concerns, USDA officials \n     have met with representatives of the National Milk Producers \n     Federation and the International Dairy Food Association to \n     discuss the issue. USDA continues to evaluate the situation \n     to determine if any action is required under USDA's milk \n     price support program. Your comments will be taken into \n     consideration as we consider these choices.\n       Again, thank you for your letter. A similar letter is being \n     sent to your colleagues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        J.B. Penn,\n          Under Secretary, Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the consequence has been that the class \nIII price of milk used to make cheese has been below the $9.90 support \nprice 17 times since January 2000 and has been as low as $8.57 in \nNovember 2000 and $9.11 in February 2003.\n  The Secretary might make an argument that the average price isn't at \n$9.90, but factually that argument could not be made. What we are doing \nessentially is asking the Secretary of Agriculture to observe the law. \nIt doesn't seem to me that that is too much to ask. We are not trying \nto rewrite the substantive law on milk pricing because it was enacted \nin 2002. But we are utilizing this appropriations bill to require that \nthe Secretary observe the law, with the interdiction that she cannot \nspend any money under this bill unless she does observe the law with \nrespect to this milk price.\n  We have had a considerable discussion back and forth as to whether \nthe amendment would be accepted. I am prepared to vote on it, but I \ndon't want to burden the record with a vote. I say to the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee of the distinguished Appropriations \nCommittee, where I have served with the Senator from Utah for the past \n13 years, in the absence of a recorded vote, which I think would be \noverwhelming, I am prepared to accept a voice vote. But I would like \nassurances that the manager will fight to keep this in conference.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I will respond to the Senator by \ntelling him I am in favor of his amendment and will carry that attitude \ninto conference and do the best I can to see to it that it survives.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This may be risky, but I direct the same question to the \ndistinguished ranking member, the Senator from Wisconsin, my \nlongstanding friend, Mr. Kohl.\n  Mr. KOHL. I feel as does Senator Bennett. I will do my best to see \nthat it stays in conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is very assuring. I am delighted to proceed, as I \nhave discussed with the managers, to have a voice vote and have the \namendment in effect accepted, if that is still agreeable to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I believe that, \nin the interest of time, a voice vote would be sufficient. I think we \nshould have a voice vote rather than just accept the amendment by \nunanimous consent, so that the record does show that a formal vote took \nplace.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the voice vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2080) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Chair and the Senator from \nUtah and the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand I am allowed 10 minutes to speak on the \nLeahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, first, I commend the Senator from \nVermont for raising the issue of funding for technical assistance for \nfarm bill conservation programs. The technical assistance, as provided \nby the staff of the Natural Resource Conservation Service and other \nqualified providers such as engineers or agronomists, includes \nplanning, designing, construction and implementation of conservation \npractices on agricultural land--this assistance is essential to allow \nfarmers, ranchers, and landowners to carry out conservation practices.\n  This amendment, as I understand it, would cut off funding for \ntechnical assistance for the Conservation Reserve Program. For that \nreason, I cannot support the amendment.\n  Cutting off technical assistance would effectively preclude new \nenrollments in the CRP program, including the continuous CRP and the \nConservation Reserve Enhancement Program, otherwise known as CREP, thus \nhurting the environment, wildlife, and land owners.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, will the Senator yield on that point just \nfor 20 seconds?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I only have 10 minutes. I will have to ask for more time \nif I can.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wanted to point out this amendment doesn't take it out \nof the CRP. As the Senator knows--he serves on the Agriculture \nCommittee--I have been a strong supporter of CRP straight through. It \nis just that the original farm bill took it out of CCC.\n  What is happening now is the administration is playing one off \nagainst the\n\n[[Page S14138]]\n\nother with these various conservation programs instead of going to CCC \nlike they are supposed to. All my amendment says is not to take it out \nof CRP--I am a strong supporter of CRP--but allow the Farm Bill to \nstand and take it out of CCC as they were supposed to in the first \nplace.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the explanation of the Senator from Vermont. \nAs I understand it, I ask the Senator from Vermont, does this not \nprevent the transfer of money from donor programs?\n  Mr. LEAHY. This amendment simply follows the farm bill, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa was the chairman of that conference for \nthe Senate. It was the farm bill on which we agreed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I could be wrong. I want to understand, if I can make a \nfew more comments, and let the Senator from Vermont see if this is a \ncorrect interpretation. Prior to the passage of the farm bill in 2002, \nthere was a shortage of technical assistance funding because the 1996 \nfarm bill limited technical assistance funding to that amount available \nunder section 11 of the CCC. That was $56 million a year. This became \nknown as the section 11 cap.\n  The 2002 farm bill corrected this problem by providing an alternative \nsource for technical assistance funds. What we did was we included a \nprovision in the conservation title of the farm bill that technical \nassistance funding would come directly from the funds provided for each \nconservation program.\n  This approach was not novel or untested. Congress relied on similar \nlanguage in the 1996 farm bill providing funding for technical \nassistance for the EQIP program, the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, directly from EQIP funds and outside the section 11 cap. We \nadopted this approach for all environmental programs to ensure there \nwould be adequate funding for technical assistance. We all agreed on \nthat approach. That is in the 2002 farm bill.\n  Soon after the passage of the farm bill, we got a big shock from the \nBush administration because they announced that the section 11 cap \nstill applied, despite the language we had put in the farm bill.\n  Despite the opinion of Nancy Bryson, General Counsel at USDA, and \ndespite the opinion of the GAO, the General Accounting Office, that the \n2002 farm bill provided new authority for funding technical assistance, \nnot subject to the section 11 cap, the White House, through OMB and \nthen the Department of Justice, decided that the farm bill's \nconservation program funds could not be used for technical assistance \nbecause they were limited to the section 11 cap, thereby, largely \nblocking implementation of the conservation programs.\n  We attempted to fix this in the fiscal year 2003 omnibus \nappropriations bill. As a result, funds from the dollar-limited \nconservation programs are now used to pay for technical assistance for \nall the conservation programs, including the Conservation Reserve \nProgram and the Wetlands Reserve Program, which are acreage limited \nprograms.\n  Senator Leahy, I believe, is correct that we now have a situation in \nwhich money that the farm bill provided for some conservation programs \nis being diverted to pay for technical assistance for others. Because \nof this problem, there is less conservation money going to producers \nand landowners than was intended or provided in the farm bill.\n\n  In fiscal year 2003, almost $91 million in conservation funds were \nlost because that amount of money was taken from some programs and used \nto provide technical assistance for other programs. If the White House \nhad implemented the farm bill as intended and as we got the opinion \nfrom the general counsel at USDA, this would not have happened.\n  However, two wrongs don't make a right, and my problem, as I \nunderstand it, with the Leahy amendment--and I stand to be corrected by \nthe author of the amendment--is that what would happen under this \namendment is it would effectively mean that under the Conservation \nReserve Program, we would not be able to enroll any new land. We would \nnot be able to continue the continuous sign-up in the CRP program. We \nwould not be able to continue the agreements we have in the CREP, the \nConservation Reserve Enhancement Program.\n  That is why, as I understand the Senator's amendment, it says that \nthe donor programs are not available for technical assistance funds for \nCRP, but doesn't provide an alternative source.\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, does his amendment take away the \nsection 11 cap? If we do away with the section 11 cap unequivocally and \nwe go back to what we provided in the 2002 farm bill, then maybe the \nSenator's amendment is fine. That is not the way I read it.\n  I yield to the Senator to correct me if I am wrong.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator who helped put together that \nfarm bill knows the farm bill itself took away the section 11 caps. My \namendment in no way takes money from CRP or anything else. It simply \nbuilds a firewall around EQIP, FRPP, GRP and WHIP, which is what we all \nagreed to at the time when the chairmen of the House and Senate \nAgriculture Committees and others were trying to make sure they had \nvotes to pass the farm bill. These programs were essential to get the \nsupport from the East where most of the tax dollars come to pay for \nthis farm bill.\n  This amendment does not take from CRP. We are simply telling USDA to \ntake it from the CCC. It tells the USDA to go back to the farm bill, \nwhich spoke of taking this money from the CCC. It just builds a \nfirewall. That is all; nothing more, nothing less. The reason I care \nthis much about it is that it was pointed out during the farm bill \ndebate that the bulk of the money was going to the Midwest, yet the tax \ndollars were coming from much more populous States, mostly through the \nNortheast, to pay for it. Almost all the money was going to the Midwest \nand other farm areas, but this is the one area that we got anything.\n  EQIP is the only area where the Northeast States get some \nassistance--so it doesn't sound parochial, the backlog in my State is \nless than $8 million. The backlog in Iowa is about $29 million. We just \nwant to build the firewall. That is all.\n  When the Congress, in a bill that had been debated for weeks and \nnegotiated for weeks, tells the Department of Agriculture to do \nsomething, I like to think they are going to do something. GAO says \nthey are not following our clear intent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator that USDA should have followed \nthe farm bill and the White House simply choose not to do so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What we are saying is just build the firewall, not rob \nPeter to pay Paul from these conservation programs, especially CRP, \nwhich I support. CRP is used in the Senator's State of Iowa a great \ndeal. I have always supported the other Senators.\n  All I am saying is go back to CCC where this is supposed to be. That \nis all.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Vermont that \nwe go back to CCC, but the section 11 cap still applies and there would \nbe no funding technical assistance for CRP. The Senator has to know \nthat under the Senator's amendment, new enrollments for CRP will \neffectively come to an end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask for at least 5 more minutes, after \nyielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I understand what the Senator is doing, \nbut two wrongs do not make a right. Now, if the Senator wants to have \nan amendment that would lift the section 11 cap, or that would clearly \nspell out that the farm bill once again in 2002--what we did--bypassed \nthe section 11 cap, that is fine.\n  As I understand it, as I read his amendment, as my staff has informed \nme, as I have looked at it, that is not what the amendment does. The \namendment simply, as the Senator said, builds firewalls. By building \nfirewalls, that goes against what we did in the 2003 omnibus bill, \nbecause in the omnibus bill we provided for a mechanism that said we \ncould then use these funds for technical assistance, and that is \nexactly what we are doing.\n  Again, I say that the Senator from Vermont is correct in that we have \na\n\n[[Page S14139]]\n\nsituation in which money that the farm bill provided for some \nconservation programs is being diverted to pay for technical assistance \nfor others. I am all for changing that but not in the way the Senator \nwants, because the way the Senator wants effectively cuts off signing \nup for the CRP program.\n  I am a big supporter of the EQIP program, and FPP and WHIP and GRP. \nThat is fine, and they should be fully funded, as they were in our farm \nbill, but we cannot abandon the CRP program. That is exactly what the \neffect of this amendment would do.\n  Those of us from those States in which we have the CRP program or the \nCRP program in which we have continuous signup, this would take money \naway from this very effective program. Almost all states have land \nenrolled in CRP and there are 23 states that have CREPs--new \nenrollments in those and continuous CRP would come to a halt.\n  We could solve this problem of TA funding for CRP and WRP for, \naccording to estimates from USDA, $100 million a year or for $300 \nmillion from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2006. Three hundred \nmillion dollars would take care of the whole thing. Yet the \nadministration will not provide this money at all.\n  The President requested nearly $900 million this year for Iraq to \nhave funds for irrigation equipment and the protection of marshlands in \nthe Supplemental. So we have $900 million to go to Iraq for irrigation \nequipment and protection of marshlands, and $300 million would take \ncare of our entire country in terms of the Conservation Reserve Program \nand the Wetlands Reserve Program for three years.\n  There are ways of fixing this, I say to my friend from Vermont, and \nways that we agreed upon in the farm bill. The Senator from Vermont and \nI were together on the farm bill. We agreed on how to do this, but this \nis not the way to do it now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, I thought in the unanimous \nconsent request we divided the 5 minutes. I am told we did not so it is \nstill the time of the Senator, but I would say all I want to do is what \nwe did in the bill. I want the USDA to follow the bill, and I would \nread a colloquy. It says:\n\n     . . . funding for technical assistance will come from the \n     borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation, and \n     will no longer be affected by section 11 of the CCC Charter \n     Act. For those programs such as the CRP, WRP, and the \n     Grasslands Reserves Program, which involve enrollment based \n     on acreage, the technical assistance funding will come from \n     the annual program outlays apportioned by OMB--again, from \n     the borrowing authority of the CCC. These programs, too, will \n     no longer be affected by section 11 of the CCC Charter Act.\n\n  That was on the floor from the statement of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa as the manager of that bill.\n  I do not know how much clearer I can say it. We are trying to get the \nDepartment of Agriculture to follow the law.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa has been a supporter of all of these \nprograms, as I have of the programs that affect his State, not those of \nus in the East. I am just saying I want the Department of Agriculture \nto stick to the agreement they made with the conferees at the time we \npassed the bill, and the only way it seems we can get them to do that \nis to restate it in this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would join with the Senator in any kind of an amendment \nto get rid of the section 11 cap. That is the answer right there, get \nrid of the section 11 cap.\n  We effectively did that in the farm bill. The administration says no. \nWell, an amendment to that line would do that.\n  In closing, the major wildlife groups in this country, from Ducks \nUnlimited, Izaak Walton League of America, National Audubon Society, \nPheasants Forever, the Wildlife Society, and Wildlife Management \nInstitute do not support this amendment. They sent a letter to both \nChairman Bennett and Ranking Member Kohl that said they can't support \nthis amendment if it would have a chilling effect on CRP.\n  Again, I find myself in a strange position because in many ways I \nagree with the Senator from Vermont. He is right in what he is trying \nto do in terms of saying that we have to have more funding for \ntechnical assistance, but not in this manner because it would \neffectively stop the CRP program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on the Leahy amendment has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. As I understand it, Senator Harkin still has 10 minutes \nto speak on the Daschle amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry. I did not realize the parliamentary \nsituation. Are these two votes going to be lumped together?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, the two votes will be stacked. We have reserved 10 \nminutes for the Senator from Iowa to speak on the Leahy amendment and \n10 minutes for him to speak on the Daschle amendment. If he wishes to \nyield back his 10 minutes on the Daschle amendment, there will be no \nobjection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2078\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the 2002 farm bill included an important \nprogram, known as country-of-origin labeling, that adds value to farm \nproducts and gives consumers more information about the origin of foods \nthey buy for their families. Opponents of the law have used scare \ntactics and false information in an attempt to water down or overturn \nthis important program.\n  Unfortunately, the opponents of the law persuaded the House \nAppropriations agricultural subcommittee to cancel funding to carry out \nthis program as it applies to labeling for meat. This is the wrong \ncourse. USDA needs the funding to continue the rule making process so \nthe program is workable as it was intended by the farm bill.\n  A large number of other countries have country-of-origin labeling. \nThe General Accounting Office has found that of the 57 U.S. trading \npartners, 48 require country-of-origin labeling for one or more of the \ncommodities covered by our country-of-origin labeling law.\n  In this country, over 135 organizations, from the American Farm \nBureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, and the Consumer \nFederation of America--broad support--support country-of-origin \nlabeling for meat. These organizations represent the will of producers \nand consumers across our country.\n  Several academic studies in the last year have examined the benefits \nof country-of-origin labeling for meat. For example, the International \nAgricultural Trade and Policy Center at the University of Florida found \nthat the benefits of labeling beef clearly outweighed the costs. \nResearch by Colorado State University found that consumers were willing \nto pay an 11-percent premium on steak and a 24-percent premium for \ncountry-of-origin labeling on hamburger.\n  This research reflects the desire for country-of-origin labeling of \nmeat. Country-of-origin labeling for meat is law. It is law right now. \nIt became law when President Bush signed the 2002 farm bill. Whether or \nnot the Agriculture appropriations bill funds the program, the law \nstill requires meat to be labeled. Removing funding essentially creates \na situation where retailers will still be legally required to label \nmeat but USDA will have no funding to provide oversight and work out in \na meaningful manner any problems that exist within the meat-labeling \nregulations.\n  Then again next year the same debate will come before Congress, \nasking us to remove funding, asking us to delay country-of-origin \nlabeling for meat for another year. This is just a 1-year bill. The law \nis already there on the books. Removing funding as the House \nAppropriations Committee did does not solve any problems. It only \ncreates more problems down the road for the program that is already in \nthe law and that would provide consumers the information they want.\n  Madam President, it was interesting that in the House appropriations \nbill, they cut out funding for country-of-origin labeling for meat but, \nguess what, they left the money in there for country-of-origin labeling \nfor peanuts. They\n\n[[Page S14140]]\n\nleft the money in there for country-of-origin labeling for fish. They \nleft the money for country-of-origin labeling in there for vegetables. \nThey left the money for country-of-origin labeling in there for fruit. \nBut not meat.\n  Right away you have to ask yourself a question: What is this all \nabout? Why would they say consumers ought to have the right to know \nwhere their fish comes from, but not their meat? Why would they say \nconsumers ought to have the right to know where their peanuts come \nfrom, but not their meat?\n  The fact is, a few in this country--a few, and I mean a few--are \ntrying to overcome in the appropriations process what they could not \nsucceed in doing when we passed the farm bill. They were there. They \ntestified. They had their proposals. They didn't want country-of-origin \nlabeling. We voted on it and it was passed in the House, it was passed \nin the Senate, it was kept in conference, and the President signed it. \nNow they are attempting to undo that through the appropriations \nprocess. That is why we have to speak loudly and clearly that we want \nto make sure the law is carried forward.\n  As I pointed out, even if you don't fund it, retailers will still \nhave to abide by the law. They will still have to give us country-of-\norigin labeling on meat. It just means the Department of Agriculture \nwill not be able to help them clear up any confusion that may arise. \nThat is the worst possible position in which we could put our \nretailers. We ought to give them the assistance, the help, the support, \nthe advice, the consultation the Department of Agriculture should do to \nimplement this law.\n  Before I close, I want to take a moment to say I am pleased the \nSenate supported the amendment by Senators Dorgan and Burns, which I \ncosponsored, to increase the funding level of the Rural Broadband Loan \nProgram. I worked to include the loan program in the 2002 farm bill to \nhelp bring high-speed Internet to rural farm communities across the \ncountry.\n  Since its launch, there have been more than $1 billion in loan \napplications to build the broadband infrastructure. This extra funding \nwill go a long way to ensure this program remains strong and can \nprovide the resources needed to ensure rural America keeps faith with \nits urban neighbors in the 21st century.\n  In closing, I don't know if I will have time to speak again on the \nbill. I think we are coming close to voting. First, let me commend the \nchairman and ranking member for putting together a great Agriculture \nappropriations bill. I thank them for accepting the rural broadband \nprovisions, as well as many other very good provisions. If we can past \nthe amendment that was just offered here, I think we will have a \ntremendous Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I commend the chairman and commend the ranking member for the \nexcellent job they have done on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his courtesy and kind words. I \nmust now confess error. When we entered into the unanimous consent \nagreement, we inadvertently left off an opportunity for the chairman of \nthe Agriculture Committee to offer an amendment. I apologize to Senator \nCochran for that oversight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an additional 10 minutes be set aside, \nequally divided, between Senator Cochran and any opponents to his \namendment, to be taken care of before we proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum to \nallow Senator Cochran to come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Senator Cochran is in the cloakroom and will be coming \non to the floor momentarily. I simply want to once again apologize to \nhim for our inadvertence in leaving his amendment off the list. I \nappreciate the indulgence of Senators to have this additional 5 to 10 \nminutes for the opportunity to dispose of this particular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2120\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk under \nthe unanimous consent request and ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments will \nbe laid aside and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2120.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To provide plant variety protection)\n\n       On page 19, line 26, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That, in the case of the \n     term of protection for the variety for which certificate \n     number 8200179 was issued, on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall issue a new \n     certificate for a term of protection of 10 years for the \n     variety, except that the Secretary may terminate the \n     certificate (at the end of any calendar year that is more \n     than 5 years after the date of issuance of the certificate) \n     if the Secretary determines that a new variety of seed (that \n     is substantially based on the genetics of the variety for \n     which the certificate was issued) is commercially viable and \n     available in sufficient quantities to meet market demands''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the Plant Variety Protection Act \ncodifies our international commitments under treaties for protection of \nplant varieties. The law gives plant varieties 20 years of protection, \nsimilar to a patent, in order to preserve the quality of the variety. \nThe law currently does not provide any mechanism to provide for periods \nof additional protection for varieties that are still commercially \nvaluable.\n  The original PVPA certificate for Marshall ryegrass was issued prior \nto the adoption of the latest changes pursuant to international \nnegotiations and, as a result, were protected for less than the current \n20-year period. My amendment would provide an additional period of PVPA \nprotection of up to 10 years for one of the most if not the most \nheavily used varieties of ryegrass used by livestock producers around \nthe country.\n  The Secretary would be authorized to cancel this protection as soon \nas a new variety of this valuable feed grass is developed.\n  There are letters which I will send to the desk for inclusion in the \nRecord in support of this amendment. One is from OreGro Seeds \nIncorporated in Oregon; another is from a second company, Smith Seed \nServices in Oregon; another from Plantbreeding Seed Production, Seed \nTrade, member of an organization called the Barenbrug Group.\n  I ask unanimous consent all of these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Oregro Seed, Inc.,\n\n                                         Shedd, OR, July 11, 2003.\n     Re plant variety protection for Marshall Ryegrass.\n\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith, We understand that Senator Cochran is \n     introducing legislation that will extend the PVP for Marshall \n     Ryegrass. This legislation is of critical importance to the \n     Oregon grass seed industry, and we urge you to give this \n     measure your strongest support.\n       Your strong support for the Oregon seed industry is greatly \n     appreciated, and we also urge you to contact Senator \n     Cochran's office to express your support for this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Herb.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Smith Seed Services,\n\n                                        Halsay, OR, July 11, 2003.\n     Re legislation from Senator Cochran.\n\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith, Senator Cochran is introducing \n     legislation to extend the PVP production for Marshall annual \n     ryegrass. This legislation is critically important to the \n     Oregon grass seed industry. I strongly urge your support for \n     this legislation.\n       Smith Seed is one of the largest producer and shipper of \n     forage and turf grass seed in\n\n[[Page S14141]]\n\n     Oregon. We have about 100 to 120 employees and represent a \n     grower base of over 300 independent grass seed farmer \n     producers. We ship in excess of 160 million pounds of seed \n     annually to domestic and international accounts.\n       Your strong support for this important legislation for the \n     Oregon seed industry is greatly appreciated, and I also ask \n     that you contact Senator Cochran's office to express your \n     support.\n       Thank you for your service and support of the Oregon seed \n     industry.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Zehr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Barenbrug USA,\n\n                                       Tangent, OR, July 11, 2003.\n     Re legislation from Senator Cochran.\n\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: We are aware that Senator Cochran, \n     (Miss R) is introducing legislation in the upcoming Senate \n     Agricultural Committee in DC next week, to extend the Plant \n     Variety Protection (PVP) for Marshall annual ryegrass. This \n     legislation is of vital importance to the long term viability \n     of the US and Oregon grass seed industry, and in the \n     strongest possible way, we ask for your support of this \n     important measure.\n       Barenbrug USA is an Oregon based grass seed breeding, \n     production and wholesale marketing company. We employ more \n     than 150 workers, and buy seed from family farmers on over \n     40,000 acres in Oregon and the Northwest. We consider \n     ourselves to be one of the leaders in this industry, and one \n     of the largest grass seed companies in the world.\n       By extending the PVP on this variety, the value level of \n     grass seed sales in the US South and South East will be \n     maintained. By not extending the PVP, there is a significant \n     chance that named ryegrass varieties will again be seen as \n     commodities and no longer be sold at price levels which \n     assure returns for the entire seed value chain, including the \n     seed growers. All seed of ryegrass varieties is produced in \n     Oregon, hence our interest in this discussion and our request \n     to you.\n       We sincerely appreciate your support during session for \n     this legislation that is critical to the US and Oregon grass \n     seed industry, and also ask that you contact Senator \n     Cochran's office to voice your strong support.\n       Thank you for your record of dedicated service and support \n     of our industry. Please advise if you have any questions or \n     comments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Marc W. Cool, M.Sc.\n                                               Vice President/COO.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I also have a letter from the Livestock \nProducers Association and a letter from the State of Mississippi's \nDepartment of Agriculture and Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Livestock Producers Association,\n\n                                     Tylertown, MS, April 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: I am writing to ask for your help in getting the \n     Plant Variety Protection (PVP) certification extended for \n     Marshall Ryegrass.\n       Marshall Ryegrass has been an integral part of many \n     Mississippi cattle operations for many years and without the \n     assurance of PVP, there is great concern that the integrity \n     of the variety would be compromised.\n       Grass varieties often lose their identity quickly after PVP \n     expires and in light of the fact that there is not a clearly \n     superior product for winter forage production, I feel that \n     maintaining the genuine Marshall strain is very important to \n     the cattle producers of our state.\n       We need Marshall, not an inferior substitute.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mike Pigott,\n     Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Mississippi, Department of Agriculture and \n           Commerce,\n                                   Jackson, MS, February 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senator, Mississippi,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: This letter is written in concern for \n     the protection of Marshall Ryegrass under the Plant Variety \n     Protection Act (PVPA). The patent on this grass has expired, \n     and I--as well as others--would like to have the patent \n     extended on this variety of grass.\n       Marshall Ryegrass is extremely popular among Mississippi \n     farmers who plant winter grazing crops. The loss of the \n     patent protection can and will lead to widespread deception \n     and mislabeling of poor quality grazing grasses. Due to this \n     concern, it is my request that Congress enact legislation \n     that will restore the PVPA protection for the Marshall \n     Ryegrass variety.\n       Any assistance you can provide will be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Lester Spell, Jr.,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield our time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Chairman Bennett and Ranking \nMember Kohl for their leadership in crafting the Senate's version of \nthe 2004 Agriculture appropriations bill. I appreciate their \nwillingness to work with me to include $2 million in funding for the \nHistoric Barn Preservation Program. This program was authorized in the \n2002 farm bill, but until now has not received any funding.\n  Our Nation's aging barns are important symbols of our agricultural \nheritage, and we must see that they remain a part of our landscapes. \nThis program was established to preserve barns that are in danger of \nfalling beyond repair due to decades of deferred maintenance. To \nqualify, a barn must be at least 50 years old. Preservationists are \nespecially concerned with the oldest barns, many are more than 200 \nyears old and some date back as far as 1790.\n  Before this program can be successfully implemented. Congress must \ngive it adequate funding. My amendment, which would provide $2 million \nin funding for the barn preservation program, will address the growing \ndemand for historic preservation in our rural communities by \ndocumenting and researching appropriate techniques and best practices \nfor protecting these treasures.\n  I am not alone in urging funding for the barn preservation program. \nLast June, I led a bipartisan group of 24 Senators who sent a letter to \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and \nRelated Agencies urging that $10 million be included for this program.\n  The Historic Barn Preservation Program also enjoys support from the \npreservation community. The National Trust for Historic Preservation \nhas endorsed this program as well as numerous State preservation groups \nfrom\n\n[[Page S14144]]\n\nacross the country. We all recognize that preservation of these barns \nwill not only ensure their survival for generations to come, it will \nprovide practical benefits to the farmers that own them and the \ncommunities and economies that surround them.\n  Clearly, working structures such as these barns have as much to offer \nto our understanding of U.S. history as the birthplaces of our leaders \nor battlefields where our soldiers fought and died. These barns have \nserved various functions, whether as military hospitals, refuges for \nslaves making their way along the Underground Railroad, local school \nbuildings or temporary shelters for families moving west as our \ncountry's border expanded to the Pacific Coast.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the State Historic Preservation Office \ncurrently administers a small grant program for barn preservation that \nhas been funded by the Vermont Legislature since 1993. While this \nprogram has been very successful, applications continue to \nsignificantly outnumber the grants made through this program. For \nexample, out of 60 annual requests, the program only has the resources \nto fund 15 to 20 of those requests.\n  Federal funding through the new national Historic Barn Preservation \nProgram will help address the growing backlog of requests for barn \npreservation grants in Vermont and across the country.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the two managers of this bill and urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2130\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment to \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill that will mean healthier food for \nschool kids in New York and across the country.\n  The amendment prohibits the use of funds from this bill for the \npurchase of chickens or products of chickens, unless the supplier \nprovides certification that the supplier does not feed or administer \nfluoroquinolone to chickens produced by that supplier.\n  This is a modest step forward in dealing with the growing problem of \nantibiotic resistance.\n  The antibiotics we are dealing with in this amendment are called \nfluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics that include \nCipro, are the first choice in treating severe food poisoning and other \ndiseases in humans.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has determined that the use of \nfluoroquinolones in poultry contributes to increasing numbers of people \nbecoming infected with antibiotic resistant Campylobacter, which causes \nsevere abdominal pains, fever, and diarrhea. In essence, by using \nfluoroquinolones in our food, we are ensuring that more and more people \nwill become resistant to certain infections, meaning more and more sick \npeople.\n  Corporate America is already responding to this pressing issue. The \nfast food chains McDonald's, Wendy's, and others have pledged not to \nuse chicken that has been treated with fluoroquinolones in an effort to \nprotect their customers.\n  But the USDA continues to purchase chicken for the National School \nLunch Program that has been treated with fluoroquinolones despite \nwarnings about health risks and the availability of chickens that have \nnot been treated with fluoroquinolones, and so do the schools that \nreceive USDA money through the lunch program. The New York City Board \nof Education, for example, does not have a policy in place to ensure \nthat chickens that New York City school kids eat have not been fed \nfluoroquinolones. And there are approximately 820,000 New York City \nschool students and 1.4 million students across New York State that are \nin the School Lunch Program.\n  Tyson, Gold Kist, and Purdue are all leading chicken producers that \nhave committed to stop using fluoroquinolones in their chickens. The \nUSDA and schools across the country could purchase chicken from these \nproducers and others that do not use fluoroquinolones, without \nexperiencing a negative economic impact.\n  So this amendment says that no School Lunch Program funds can be used \nby the USDA or the schools to purchase chickens from suppliers that \nhave not provided certification to the Secretary that they do not feed \nor administer fluoroquinolone to the chickens they produce.\n  It is so important that we take this step. Children are at a greater \nrisk to suffer from food borne illness and infections from antibiotic-\nresistant bacteria. Data from the Centers for Disease Control show that \nbetween 1990 and 1999 the number of food-borne illness outbreaks in \nschools rose 10 percent per year. Over this time period, 16,000 \nchildren have gotten sick from school outbreaks.\n  All this amendment says is that children eating chicken provided by \nthe School Lunch Program should be protected as much as customers at \nMcDonald's and Wendy's.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is taking a first step today to protect \nour school children from possible resistant infections by approving \nthis amendment. I thank Senators Bennett and Kohl for their support, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this \nprovision is retained in conference.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, at the request of the majority leader, I \nwould like to have Senator Domenici recognized for a short colloquy and \nSenator Warner recognized for a short announcement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                          Mental Health Parity\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there have been a lot of questions as to \nthe status of the mental parity bill and where we are going and what \nour plans are from those who have been working on it for a long time. I \nremind everyone that this bill has been supported by large numbers of \nSenators.\n  We have had our difficulties the last year. Without going into \ndetail, we have had difficulties trying to get this worked out for \nhearings in the House. We are in a position where we cannot get that \ndone.\n  Now we are in a position where we can tell the Senators that the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, under the leadership of Judd Gregg, is \nlooking at a substitute which seems acceptable to the community that \nhelped us on the bill and that the chairman indicates will have a high \npriority in his committee the early part of next year. That means we \nshould be passing mental parity in the first couple of months of the \nnext session.\n  I note the presence on the floor of my principal cosponsor, since the \ndemise of Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy. We have discussed this at \nlength. I believe he concurs that this is the best approach. Our \nmajority leader agrees. The minority leader agrees, as does the \nchairman of the committee of jurisdiction.\n  I would be pleased if Senator Kennedy will comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are talking about the Wellstone Mental \nHealth Act. Senator Domenici and Paul Wellstone worked in this area and \nwere leaders in mental health parity. There are now 67 cosponsors of \nthis legislation. For a number of reasons, we have not been able to get \nthis matter either scheduled or considered.\n  As I understand what Senator Domenici is now saying, from his \nconversations with the Republican leader, we will have some assurance \nthat we will have this matter before the Senate.\n  I just talked with the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Gregg, \nwho said he would make this a first order, a priority in the next \nsession.\n  I think what the community is looking for is assurance there would be \nSenate action. I understand from Senator Domenici he is fully committed \nto work and make sure the Senate is going to have an opportunity to \naddress this issue in the early weeks of this next session. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely. There is no diminution of interest on my \npart. I started this many years ago. We did pass it. Now we have to \npass it on a full scale, and we will. We have to wait now for reasons \nout of our control, but it will get done early next year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with the assurances of the Senator from \nNew Mexico as a senior member of this body and one all of us know, I \nhave great confidence in him and know of his strong passion in this \narea. I think it is enormously important for our communities across \nthis country, and I certainly welcome those assurances.\n\n[[Page S14145]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge as well the efforts \nthe Senator from New Mexico has made to get us to this point. Many of \nus had hoped we could complete our work on the bill in the Senate this \nyear. I know it is a disappointment to him we have not been able to do \nthat, but with the assurances he has given us tonight, working with the \nchairman, the ranking member, and certainly the majority leader, it \nwould be my hope the very first legislation we take up in the second \nsession will be this legislation. We will work with him, and I hope we \ncould have that commitment from people on both sides of the aisle. I \nappreciate his efforts tonight to bring us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to address the members of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee on both sides of the aisle. The House \nof Representatives is remaining in session until the wee hours of the \nnight in the hopes they can receive from the Senate a conference report \nwith sufficient signatures on it by which we can get the bill passed \nearly next week. I am working with my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Levin, and others. To those who can sign it at this point in \ntime, I would greatly appreciate it.\n  I ask Senator Levin be given a chance to reply.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I did not hear the beginning of that \nstatement, but we are awaiting the document so we can read it. We would \nbe happy to give an answer as promptly as we can, after the document is \ncompleted, but I understand there is some unfinished business and \nuncertainty that needs to be looked at.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. Given that this could well mean \nmany Senators will leave, I just wish to put them on notice we have \nthis one shot to get it done so we can have it on the calendar next \nweek.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think we all hope it gets finished, but it is not \nfinished yet.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2135\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], for Mrs. Hutchison, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2135.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. . TEXAS RICE SAFEGUARD INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to provide a safeguard against \n     the further decline of the rice industry and wildlife habitat \n     in Texas, and to provide information to the congress in \n     anticipation of and preparation for the 2007 bill, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct the initiative \n     required under this section.\n       (b) Administrative Improvements.--As an integral part of \n     the safeguard initiative--the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     review the administration and enhance the enforcement of \n     section 1105(a)(1)(E) of Public Law 107-171 as it relates to \n     and is applied to the control of noxious weeds and the proper \n     application and implementation of the conserving use \n     requirements on rice base acreage in Texas.\n       (c) Reports to Congress.--The Secretary shall review and \n     evaluate the costs, benefits and effects of the safeguard \n     initiative on rice producers, including tenant rice \n     producers, the rice milling and processing industry, wildlife \n     habitat, and the economies of rice farming areas in Texas, \n     detailed by each of these affected interests and by the \n     program variables involved in the safeguard initiative under \n     subsections (b) and (c), including whether or not producers \n     on a farm have qualified plantings. The Secretary shall \n     provide to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture of \n     the House of Representatives an annual report detailing the \n     progress and findings of the initiative not later than \n     February 1 of each of the years 2005 through 2007.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. The amendment has been cleared on both sides. It was \ninadvertently left out of the other stack of amendments that were \nsubmitted. I ask that the amendment pass on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2135) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have come to final passage. May I take \nthe opportunity once again to thank Senator Kohl and his staff for the \ncooperative way in which they have worked to get us to this point. I \nappreciate very much the support of all Senators.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2084, Vitiated\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nadoption of amendment No. 2084.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2073\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to adopt the \npending Kohl amendment, No. 2073.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2073) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe vote on final passage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request \na conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate so we can \nunderstand what the Senator is saying.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will come \nto order.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that following the vote on final \npassage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with \nthe House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part \nof the Senate to consist of the members of the subcommittee and \nSenators Stevens and Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent to reconsider the votes of all \nthe amendments that have been sent forward and for that motion to be \nlaid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have nothing further to say.\n\n\n           Initiative For Future Agriculture and Food Systems\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized and increased funding for \nthe Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, IFAFS, \ncompetitive grants program, a program originally authorized as section \n401 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act \nof 1998. The Initiative supports outcome-oriented, integrated research, \nextension, and education competitive grants to address critical \nemerging agricultural and rural issues related to four key areas: \nfuture food production, environmental quality and natural resource \nmanagement, farm income, and rural economic and business and community \ndevelopment.\n  The farm bill provides $140 million in mandatory funds from the \nCommodity Credit Corporation for IFAFS in fiscal year 2004. The \nappropriations bill before us contains a provision which prohibits the \nDepartment from implementing IFAFS in fiscal year 2004. However, the \nbill also allows the Department to use 20 percent of funding \nappropriated for the National Research Initiative, NRI, to carry out a \ncompetitive grants program under the same terms and conditions as those \nprovided in the farm bill for IFAFS. The bill as amended also requires \nthe Department,\n\n[[Page S14146]]\n\nin implementing this provision, to request grant proposals, among the \nfour critical emerging issues required by law, for which the Department \nhas not issued requests for proposals for grants in fiscal year 2002 or \n2003.\n  I ask the distinguished chairman and ranking member if it is their \nunderstanding that in requiring this funding set-aside to be carried \nout under the same ``terms and conditions'' as the IFAFS program that \nthe Senate bill intends for the Department to ensure that over time, \nall four statutorily-designated purposes for IFAFS spending are \nsubjects for requests for proposals and reflected in the overall \nresearch portfolio of this portion of the NRI?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree that the Department should fulfill their \nresponsibility to give effect to all the provisions of the IFAFS \nprogram.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is it further the understanding of the Senator that the \nlanguage added by amendment today requires the Department to request \nproposals that specifically enhance farm income and rural economic, \nbusiness, and community development?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes. It is my understanding that these two critical \nemerging issues have not been funded in the previous two fiscal years.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would also concur, and would add that it would be my hope \nthe Department would give particular consideration to farm income-\nenhancing projects that advance the statutory priority mission area \nrelated to small and medium-size farm viability and competitiveness.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member. I \nwould also point out to my colleagues that the 2002 farm bill provided \nspecific direction for the Department to pursue grant making for \nintegrated research, education, and extension in key areas related to \nrural and agriculturally-based development and farm profitability and \nrural entrepreneurship. I would inform my colleagues that it is my \nintent to ensure the Department solicits proposals in at least some of \nthese critical areas during fiscal year 2004.\n\n\n               conservation technical assistance program\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Utah, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, for his leadership in bringing this important spending \nbill to the floor. Wyoming is greatly impacted by this bill, and \nSenator Bennett's leadership is very much appreciated. Because of this \ntremendous impact on Wyoming, I would like to ask my colleague if he \nwould join me in a colloquy to discuss one of the programs that is \nfunded in his bill. Specifically, I would like to discuss the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Conservation Technical Assistance Program \nthat is administered through the Natural Resources Conservation Service \nand its potential impact on land management planning on private lands \nwithin the U.S. Forest Service's Thunder Basin National Grasslands.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be glad to join my colleague from Wyoming in a \ndiscussion and I agree with him that this is an important program for \nthe West, and, if it is implemented properly, it should help States \nsuch as Wyoming and Utah, maximize local conservation efforts by \nallowing them to target dollars where they are needed most.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to share one example of an effort in Wyoming \nthat has already benefited from this program and which I feel could \ngreatly benefit in the future from its continued participation. Three \nyears ago I met with officials from the Thunder Basin Prairie Ecosystem \nAssociation, the Department of Interior and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to discuss the role that private landowners could play in \ndeveloping land management plans on Western National Grasslands. The \nLandowners Association presented a revolutionary proposal to combine \nthe talent and resources of all local landowners to develop an \nEcosystem Assessment and to enter into a series of Ecosystem Management \nStrategy and Conservation Agreements with the Forest Service and the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that would integrate a comprehensive, \nmultispecies land management proposal for more than 260,000 acres of \nFederal and private lands within the U.S. Forest Service's Thunder \nBasin National Grasslands.\n  Their proposal was to first establish a scientific baseline where \nthey cataloged what was on the land and what species existed. Then they \nproposed to use that baseline to make ecosystem-wide management \ndecisions that would make the land as a whole more vibrant and more \nsustainable for a number of species, including the black-tailed prairie \ndog, the black footed ferret and the sage grouse. What they would not \ndo was make management plans based on the presence or absence of any \none specific species or to pit different species' habitat requirements \nagainst each other. Their goal was to make the land healthier as a \nwhole so that all species would be better off.\n  As a result of their efforts the Department of Interior was able to \nprovide an initial grant to the Association through the Landowner's \nIncentive Program of $150,000 that allowed them to assemble an advisory \ncommittee made up of national grasslands experts that has helped them \ndevelop scientific research and monitoring protocols that are now being \nused to establish baseline information on area wildlife and ecosystem \nconcerns. In fiscal year 2003, we funded this program at $175,000 which \nallowed the association to continue its monitoring efforts and to host \na symposium in Wyoming on cooperative land use efforts. These funds, \nhowever, fell short of what the association was hoping to accomplish \nand their 5-year goals have been pushed back due to this lack of \nfunding.\n  I would like to see this group funded again in fiscal year 2004 to \nensure that their efforts have not been wasted. It would be most \neffective, however, if the association was funded at $582,000 out of \nthe Conservation Technical Assistance at NRCS so the group could get \nback on track and complete its planning process on schedule.\n  I ask my colleague if he has any thoughts on whether or not we could \nrecommend funding this program through the NRCS?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree with my colleague that this appears to be a \nworthy project whose goals of habitat protection and species \nrestoration are consistent with the expressed goals of the Conservation \nTechnical Assistance Program. I believe this innovative effort should \nbe considered for funding by the Department of Agriculture, and I \nencourage them to work with the association to make these funds \navailable.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my colleague for his thoughts and once again \nexpress my appreciation for his leadership in these important issues. I \nthank the chair for the opportunity to discuss this program.\n\n\n               control of geese in the state of new york\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nSenator Kohl for his generosity in including the increase of $200,000 \nfor the control of the numerous species of birds that cause hardship \nthroughout New York. When making the request, I meant for the money to \nbe increased specifically to address needs of the Hudson Valley and \nparts on Long Island to control their populations of geese and ask that \nthe report specifically refer to ``an increase of $200,000 for the \ncontrol of geese in the State of New York.''\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for bringing this to our attention. We \nwill do what we can.\n\n\n                   projects of interest in louisiana\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nof the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for the \nopportunity to address several issues as the Agricultural \nAppropriations Bill for fiscal year 2004 is considered on the floor of \nthe Senate as well as in a conference with House Agricultural \nAppropriations Bill for fiscal year 2004. It is my intention in this \nstatement to express positions with respect to several areas of \nparticular importance to me and my State of Louisiana that the chairman \nand ranking member will take during conference with the House. I would \nalso like to thank both the chairman and ranking member for the number \nof my requests that were addressed in S. Rept. 108-107.\n  There are several instances in the report where the committee \nexpresses its\n\n[[Page S14147]]\n\ndesire that the agency give consideration to projects of interest and \nconcern to entities in Louisiana. This reflects the committee's finding \nthat these projects are worthy and deserve consideration by the agency. \nTherefore, I urge you and the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture, Senator Bennett, to join me in further \nannouncing our desire that the Secretary of Agriculture give \nconsideration to the following projects when granting any available \nfunds through programs for which these projects may be eligible.\n  First, the Union-Lincoln Parish Water Supply Initiative is a crucial \nproject which has focused on the depletion of the Sparta Aquifer, a \nnatural aquifer which is the primary source of drinking water for North \nLouisiana and Southern Arkansas. The Sparta Groundwater Conservation \nDistrict recently released initial information from its analysis of the \nSparta formation indicating that demand must be cut from a projected 72 \nmillion gallons per day to 54 million gallons per day over the next 10 \nyears. To offset this gap between demand and available supply, \nalternative sources including river water, reservoir water, as well as \npossible other aquifers must be examined. The committee recognized this \nneed on page 112 of S. Rept. 108-107.\n  Second, the Bawcomville Flood Control Pumps, originally constructed \nin 1955, protect two residential communities against flooding from the \nOuachita River. Additional pumping capacity is required to reduce \ninterior flooding and accommodate urbanization. The committee \nrecognized this need on p. 110 of S. Rept. 108-107.\n  Third, the Southern Training and Social Service Complex is of vital \nimportance to the communities and economy of central Louisiana. This \nfacility will provide a sports program and after-school juvenile \nprogram for at-risk youths in the central Louisiana area. The committee \nrecognized this need on p. 111 of S. Rept. 108-107.\n  Fourth, the Town of Golden Meadow, LA, requires improvements to the \ndrainage infrastructure on one of its main thoroughfares, Jefferson \nStreet. The committee recognized this need on p. 110 of S. 108-107.\n  Fifth, the Town of Golden Meadow, LA, requires a multi-purpose \nbuilding that would serve as the center for emergency response during \nhurricanes and other catastrophic times. The committee recognized this \nneed on p. 110 of S. 108-107.\n  Sixth, Continental Structural Plastics in Spring Hill, LA, requires \nplastic extruding equipment to manufacture plastic railroad ties for \nthe proposed new railroad line that would bring needed economic \ndevelopment in the area. The committee recognized this need on p. 111 \nof S. 108-107.\n  Lastly, the Greater Ouachita Port Commission seeks to establish a \nfacility that will provide for the operation of a river port and \ncommercial park, comprehensively connecting Ouachita Parish and the \nsurrounding area to international trade and commerce. The committee \nrecognized this need on p. 111 of S. Rept. 108-107.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would be pleased to assist you in any way with these \nworthy projects. Additionally, I will entertain the possibility of \njoining you in addressing the Secretary of Agriculture by way of a \nletter regarding these specific projects and, if appropriate, will \nencourage our colleague, Chairman Bennet, to participate as well.\n\n\n                             agro-terrorism\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is widely felt that we need to do more \nto protect field crops, farm animals and food processing and \ndistribution of food from terrorist acts. I understand that is the view \nof the Departments of Agriculture and Homeland Security. State and \nlocal governments and the private sector all play an integral role in \ndetecting, deterring, and responding to acts of agro-terrorism.\n  We need coordination among the States in regard to subjects like \nlaboratory capacity and testing protocols; training and education \nprotocols; the tracking of animal and food product movements; and post-\nincident actions such as rapid response teams, common incident command \nstructures, quarantine procedures, public information management \nstrategies, and coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and State and local public health authorities.\n  I believe that the Department of Agriculture needs to be as \nsupportive as possible of such efforts.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa raises a good point. \nAlthough funds are tight, we should work to determine how we can \nimprove our Federal agro-terrorism defenses and work to help the States \nimprove their efforts as well. The potential economic loss from such an \nevent is huge. The danger to human lives could be dramatic. I would \nlike to work with the Senator from Iowa to see what we can do to \nimprove our efforts in this area in conference.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senators from Iowa and Wisconsin \nraise a very important issue. We all hope that we will never have to \nfind out how good the systems designed to block or mitigate against \nagro-terrorism are because of an actual attack. But, unfortunately we \nlive in a world where we must prepare for such threats to the maximum \nextent feasible within our available resources. This is an area where \nthe conference committee should explore the options that are before us \nto improve our Nation's defensive systems against threats to our \nagriculture and food systems.\n\n\n                                ginseng\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have long advocated for the honest and accurate \nlabeling of ginseng products. Some products previously claimed to \ninclude a product known as `Siberian Ginseng,' a bush that is \ndistinctly different from ginseng root. I was pleased when portions of \nthe Ginseng Truth in Labeling Act, a bill I introduced in the 107th \nCongress, were included in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002. These provisions promote fair trade practices and accurate \nlabeling of ginseng products sold in the United States.\n  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a direct final rule \nregarding the labeling of dietary supplements containing ginseng (68 \nFed. Reg. 167, August 28, 2003), and indicated that the industry must \ncurrently be in compliance with this labeling law. However, FDA has \nnoted in correspondence that it had a number of other priorities that:\n\n     . . . required the use of many of the Agency's limited \n     resources, including enforcement resources, which would \n     otherwise have been available for other important FDA \n     programs and activities.\n\n  I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for their work on determining \nfunding priorities for FDA. I ask if the ranking member would \nparticipate with me in a brief colloquy on this subject.\n  Mr. KOHL. On behalf of our home State of Wisconsin, where 97 percent \nof the U.S. ginseng crop is produced, 85 percent of the country's \nginseng being grown in Marathon County alone, I will happily engage in \na colloquy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Now that we have this ginseng labeling law on the \nbooks, enforcement action is needed. Many of my constituents are \nconcerned that some domestic and foreign companies continue to label \nand market certain products as ginseng when they are in fact a \ndistinctly different product. We must give ginseng growers the support \nthey deserve by enforcing this law that also helps consumers make \ninformed choices about the ginseng that they consume.\n  The FDA Foods program has the primary responsibility for assuring \nthat dietary supplements in this country are safe, sanitary, \nnutritious, wholesome, and honestly labeled. Is it your understanding \nthat this bill contains the resources for FDA to carry out such \nenforcement action?\n  Mr. KOHL. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my friend, Mr. Kohl, the Senior Senator from \nWisconsin.\n\n\n            USDA Efforts to Eradicate the Emerald Ash Borer\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that S. 1427 acknowledges the \nproblem posed by the emerald ash borer. To date, tens of thousands of \nAsh trees in my home State of Michigan have died due ``to infestations \nof the emerald ash borer,'' and I am glad that this bill provides $1 \nmillion for efforts to remove Ash trees that have been claimed by this \ninvasive species.\n  I appreciate the efforts made by the Agricultural Appropriations \nSubcommittee to acknowledge and address\n\n[[Page S14148]]\n\nthe devastation caused by the emerald ash borer in Michigan, Ohio and \nOntario, Canada, and which is threatening to spread.\n  The provision of funds contained in this legislation will assist \nlocal communities in removing trees that have been killed by this \ninvasive species. It is also my understanding that USDA's Animal Plant \nHealth Inspection Service--APHIS--provided $14.8 million in fiscal year \n2003 funds to assist with efforts to contain and eradicate the emerald \nash borer.\n  Michigan's Governor, Jennifer Granholm, has requested that USDA \nprovide $33 million in fiscal year 2004 funds for further efforts to \ncombat this pest. These funds are vitally needed; however, efforts to \ncombat the emerald ash borer should not be dependent upon the provision \nof emergency funds each new fiscal year. USDA must develop a multi-year \nplan for eradicating the ash borer.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree. The continued presence of the emerald ash borer \nthreatens the ash tree population not only in Michigan, but across our \nnation. USDA should develop a clear plan for eradicating the ash borer. \nThe committee shares your concerns about the presence of the emerald \nash borer in Michigan and other states and asks that APHIS provide \nCongress with a report on the plan and estimated cost of eradicating \nthe pest.\n\n\n                  wine grape foundation block funding\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Senator Kohl, in fiscal year 2003, Congress provided \n$150,000 to the Agriculture Research Service in Prosser, WA, to help \nwith the development of a foundation block of certified ``clean'' \nrootstock.\n  The rapid expansion of the Washington wine industry has raised \nconcerns that new vineyards will use non-certified, diseased rootstock \nthat could economically devastate the Washington wine industry.\n  I recently learned that ARS did not dedicate all of the fiscal year \n2003 funding to this project, but other research projects as well.\n  The fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill provides \n$150,000 to ARS to continue this project. The intent of this project is \nclear and not subject to interpretation by ARS. I ask that the record \nreflect that this funding is to develop a wine grape foundation block. \nIn addition, I ask that the conference report accompanying the \nagriculture bill include language directing ARS to allocate this \nfunding in a manner consistent with congressional intent.\n  Senator Kohl, do you agree with the intent of this project?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes, Senator Murray, I agree. Thank you for bringing this \nissue to my attention. I will work in conference to do what I can to \nsupport your request and to include language in the final statement of \nmanagers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you Senator Kohl for your support on this issue. \nThis project is critical to the long-term health and viability of my \nState's wine grape growers and vintners.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Resource conservation is an essential element \nof our nation's agriculture programs that has proven to be very popular \nwith farmers and ranchers. The incentives incorporated in programs such \nas the Farmland Protection Program, the Conservation Reserve Program, \nand the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, have not only \nheightened the awareness and value of good conservation practices, but \nthey have made it possible for families to constitute limited \nproduction and be compensated for protecting fragile resources. The \nsuccess of these programs is that family farms can retain their \neconomic viability and continue to contribute to the stability of \ncommunities throughout the nation.\n  Conservation programs have touched on many fragile resources, but \nhave not sufficiently encouraged the protection of the historic \nheritage that is embodied in historic buildings, structures, objects, \nand archaeological sites on farmland. Congress has declared that the \nspirit and direction of the nation is reflected in its historic \nheritage, and that the preservation of this heritage is in the public \ninterest. Therefore, I believe we must work together to protect our \ncommon heritage embedded on these private lands.\n  Senator Kohl, today I am requesting a report to the U.S. Congress \nfrom the United States Department of Agriculture evaluating their \nconservation programs under the Natural Resources Conservation Service \nand all other USDA county-based farm agencies with the objective of \ndetermining what affirmative and programmatic actions are being taken \nto conserve and protect archaeological and historical resources on \nagricultural lands. Furthermore, this report should also provide or \nsuggest new methods or program modifications to the conservation \nprograms which will increase the protection of historical and \narchaeological resources on agricultural lands and help determine the \nmanner in which these type of lands can be included within the overall \ngoal of natural resources protection.\n  Finally, I am requesting that this report be completed within 120 \ndays of enactment of the Fiscal Year 2004 Agriculture appropriations \nbill.\n  Senator Kohl, will you support this request and work towards its \ninclusion in the final conference report of the fiscal year 2004 \nAgriculture appropriations bill?\n  Mr. KOHL. Senator Nelson, I appreciate you bringing this matter to my \nattention. I will work to include this provision during conference \nnegotiations of this bill.\n\n\n                 chino basin manure management project\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a colloquy?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am pleased to do so.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my distinguished colleague and the chairman \nof the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee. As the committee \ncompletes its work on the floor and heads to conference to finalize \nthis important bill, I want to call the committee's attention to a \nunique project in California that has national implications.\n  I want to call the committee's attention to the Chino Basin Manure \nManagement Project in Southern California. This project is funded \nthrough the National Resources Conservation Service of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  In fiscal year 2002, this committee provided $10 million for the \nChino Basin project. Half of the money was spent for regional flood \ncontrol, and the other half went to the development and construction of \nan anaerobic digester facility.\n  The Manure Management Project is cosponsored by the Inland Empire \nUtilities Agency and the Milk Producers Council, both in San Bernardino \nCounty. The purpose of this project was to explore an innovative and \neffective solution to the problems associated with vast quantities of \nanimal pollution which naturally results from large-scale dairy \noperations.\n  This project collects manure from several thousand local dairy cows, \ntransporting it to a local facility equipped with an industrial size \nanaerobic digester. The animal waste is placed in a closed, sealed vat, \nwhere it is then simultaneously starved of oxygen and heated for \nseveral days.\n  Under normal circumstances, we would typically think of manure as \nboth a cost and a pollutant. However, the end result of this project is \nthe development of two marketable products: methane gas and organic \nfertilizer. The methane is used in the production of electricity, and \nthe project's proponents are currently in the process of developing a \nmarket for the resulting fertilizer.\n  In addition to creating marketable methane and fertilizer, this \nproject also produces an impressively long list of additional benefits, \nincluding improved air quality, reduced groundwater contamination, and \neven improved health of the cows at the dairy.\n  A recent estimate indicates that if all the manure in the Chino area \nwas processed in anaerobic digesters this would eventually produce \napproximately 50 megawatts of renewable electric power per year. Even \nmore significantly, it will also remove significant amounts of air \npollutants. For example, the current operational digester removes \n15,000 tons of carbon dioxide or its equivalent from the atmosphere per \nyear. The next anaerobic digester built because of its larger capacity \nwill likely triple that amount to about 45,000 tons of CO2 \nor its equivalent per year.\n  The Inland Empire Utility Agency and the Milk Producers Council are \nseeking funding to expand and refine the application of this and \nsimilar technologies. The cost of a second digester is approximately $9 \nmillion dollars, and they have already received a\n\n[[Page S14149]]\n\ncommitment from the California Energy Commission for the balance of the \nnecessary funds.\n  The Inland Empire Utility Agency and the Milk Producers Council are \nrequesting that a $5 million grant be inserted into this appropriations \nbill.\n  The first plant--a demonstration of this technology--was built on \ntime and on budget, and is successfully operating today. Although the \nnext phase of this project was contemplated as part of their original \nprogram, the National Resources Conservation Service has informed \nInland Empire and the Milk Producers Council that funds are unavailable \nat this time.\n  The National Resources Conservation Service highlights and salutes \nthis project nationally, as this project has become a de facto \n``national demonstration project.'' Communities, water districts, \ndairymen, and even Indian tribes from across the Nation have gone to \nChino to examine this unique partnership between the Chino Basin dairy \nindustry and the local water agency.\n  The Inland Empire Utilities Agency and Milk Producers Council's \nrequest deserves consideration by this committee in the pending \nappropriations bill. I ask the subcommittee chairman to consider this \nproject as the appropriations bill is finalized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for calling this to the committee's \nattention.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I hasten to point out another \nattribute of this project. As the water quality problems on the Santa \nAna River are gradually resolved--and this project certainly \ncontributes to resolving some of those problems--the supply of clean, \nusable water in Southern California is expanded. It is yet another way \nto ensure that the Quantification Settlement Agreement on the Colorado \nRiver is implemented in a timely and meaningful manner. Utah and the \nrest of the Colorado Basin States should welcome these types of \ninvestment in Southern California.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Again, I thank the Senator for bringing this issue to my \nattention. I look forward to working with my colleague on this issue in \nconference.\n\n\n               minority farmers and civil rights at usda\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about \nthe status of minority farmers in the United States and to indicate my \nhope to the chairman and the ranking member that the final Agriculture \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2004 will include meaningful \nincreases in programs that are priorities to the minority farm \ncommunity.\n  It is no secret that minority farmers in the United States are an \nendangered species. In the early 1920s, African Americans owned between \n16 million and 19 million acres of land, most of it in the rural South, \nwhich includes my home State of Arkansas. At that time, there were over \n920,000 farms operated by African Americans in the United States.\n  However, by the end of the 20th century, African Americans owned only \na quarter of the land that they had held a century prior, and the \nnumber of African American farmers in the United States had fallen from \na peak of almost 1 million to only about 20,000. Scholars estimate \nthat, between 1920 and 1940, African Americans were losing land at a \nrate of 350,000 acres annually.\n  Sadly, USDA has done little to address this issue. In fact, many \npeople believe, and I am inclined to agree with them that, if anything, \nUSDA has contributed to the problem. Black farmers have long alleged \ndiscrimination at the hands of the Department of Agriculture. Because \nof this discrimination, thousands of farmers were denied access to USDA \nloans and other programs and many lost their farms because of the \ncompetitive disadvantage at which this placed them.\n  In the 1990s, these farmers filed a class action suit against USDA \nseeking redress for this discrimination. As a result of this suit, USDA \nand the claimants entered into a consent decree. Under that agreement, \nhundreds of millions of dollars have been paid to African American \nfarmers who were discriminated against by the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  While this case was a start, it can never fully compensate black \nfarmers for their losses. In addition, it did little to address the \nneeds of minority farmers--African Americans, Hispanics, and others, \nwho continue to seek to farm today. We can't just look back. We must \nlook forward to keep minorities in farming and to encourage others to \nbegin farming. We can start with the appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2004. Comparing the bill before us today with the bill passed by \nthe House of Representatives, I must say that the House-passed bill is \nbetter for minority farmers. Recognizing that money is tight and that \nthe chair and ranking member have worked arduously to craft a \nbipartisan bill, I have decided not to offer an amendment to this bill \nto increase funding for programs that affect minority farmers, such as \nthe Office of Civil Rights and the 2501 Outreach Program for Socially \nDisadvantaged Farmers. However, it is my sincere hope that as this bill \ngoes to conference committee, the chair and the ranking member will \nwork with their counterparts in the House of Representatives to craft a \nfinal bill that closely resembles the House bill with regards to \nminority farmers and civil rights at the Department of Agriculture.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks made by the \nSenator from Arkansas and also express my support for increased funding \nfor civil rights and for minority farmers at the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  In the most recent farm bill, the Committee on Agriculture once again \ntook up the issue of civil rights at USDA. Dismayed by continued \ncomplaints from both clients and employees about the inhospitable \natmosphere towards minorities at USDA, the farm bill created, for the \nfirst time, the position of Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. That \nposition has been filled for several months now, and I am hopeful that \nthe Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights will be able to create \npositive movement in this regard. It is past time for USDA to shed the \nshameful nickname, ``The Last Plantation,'' that many have given it due \nto its civil rights atmosphere.\n  The House recognized the necessity of doing more for socially \ndisadvantaged farmers and USDA employees earlier this year when it \npassed by voice vote an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations \nbill that increased funding for several important civil rights \nfunctions. First, it increased funding for the Office of Civil Rights \nby several million dollars. These additional funds will enable the \nDepartment to clear out its backlog of hundreds of civil rights \ncomplaints, many of which stagnate for months and months. We need to \nwipe the slate clean. As long as USDA is unable to deal with this \nbacklog it will be difficult for it to concentrate on its primary task; \npreventing such complaints from arising in the first place and making \nthe Department of Agriculture hospitable to all farmers regardless of \nrace, sex, or creed.\n  The House-passed amendment also increased funding for the section \n2501 Program for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers. Despite being the \nprimary program by which to make USDA programs available to minority \nfarmers, the section 2501 program has been flat-funded for several \nyears. The Senate bill before us today provides a little over $3 \nmillion for the section 2501 program. This modest increase over last \nyear's funding is a commendable start, but it is not nearly enough. The \nHouse bill, on the other hand, increased funding by $5 million to a \ntotal of over $8 million. The level provided in the House bill is \nclearly more consistent with the need to reach out to minority and \nsocially-disadvantaged farmers. I hope that the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee will agree to the House funding levels for this \nprogram in the conference committee.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The concerns that my colleagues have raised in this \nregard are important ones and ones that I share. I will do all that I \ncan to address their concerns about minority farmers and civil rights \nat USDA as we reconcile the Senate and House bills in conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I concur with the comments of my colleagues and pledge to \nwork in conference to address their concerns relating to increased \nfunding for the Office of Civil Rights and for the section 2501 Program \nfor Socially Disadvantaged Farmers to the levels agreed to in the \nHouse-passed bill.\n\n[[Page S14150]]\n\n                         McGovern-Dole Food Aid\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Senate Agriculture appropriations \nbill only includes $25 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food \nfor Education and Child Nutrition Program. The Bush administration has \nsaid that $25 million is not a level adequate to achieve the objectives \nof this important program. I agree with the administration that $25 \nmillion is woefully inadequate and would like to see the Senate fund \nthis program at the $300 million level for which it was originally \nauthorized. However, at a minimum, I contend that the Senate should \naccept the $56.8 million currently in the House bill.\n  McGovern-Dole food aid is vitally important because it: one, provides \nhumanitarian assistance by reducing incidence of hunger among the \nnearly 300 million chronically hungry school-age children and also \npromotes maternal, infant, and child nutrition programs for pregnant \nwomen, nursing mothers, infants and children five years old and under, \ntwo, enhances literacy and primary education by increasing school \nattendance of those 120 million school-age children who currently do \nnot attend school--sixty percent of which are girls, and three, reduces \nterrorism by fostering goodwill toward the United States.\n  I would like to know the chairman's position on funding for McGovern-\nDole food aid.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate my colleague bringing this matter to my \nattention. I agree with my colleague that this is a vital international \nfood aid program that provides much needed humanitarian assistance and \nincreases school enrollment. Thus, I pledge to the Senator from Kansas \nthat I will work in conference to secure the House level of $56.8 \nmillion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the distinguished chairman and look forward to \nworking with him on this matter.\n\n\n                 conservation cropping systems project\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of the \nAppropriations Committee, and particularly Subcommittee Chairman \nBennett and Senator Kohl for their work on this bill. I wanted to bring \nto the subcommittee's attention the lack of information on conservation \ncropping techniques in transitional climate areas.\n  Conservation cropping systems have proven very effective in reducing \nsoil erosion, saving moisture and increasing yields in arid regions of \nthe country. Unfortunately, the adoption of this type of system has \nbeen difficult in climate transition areas where precipitation is more \nabundant and predictable because there was little or no immediate \neconomic advantage to doing so. Efforts are getting underway to study \nthe use of conservation cropping techniques in southeastern North \nDakota, northeastern South Dakota and western Minnesota, a transition \narea between subhumid and semiarid climates. The goal of the study \nwould be to identify conservation rotations, cover crops, seeding \ntechniques, and residue management practices that would make \nconservation tillage acceptable and profitable in these climate \ntransition areas. It is my hope that in conference a small Federal \ninvestment could be directed to this important study.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The southeast region of North Dakota is very unique. It \nhas one of the largest concentrations of wetlands. As a result, most of \nthe research that has been conducted on conservation cropping systems \ndoes not adapt well to this region. Crops in this region can range from \nflax to alfalfa to edible peas to corn to wheat. Further, previous \nstudies have not included many of the crops that can be grown in this \nregion or shown how different cropping systems can be made profitable. \nWith the high cost of crop inputs and low commodity prices, producers \nare looking for ways to make a profit. This study will provide \nproducers with a very good tool to measure one crop rotation against \nanother, thereby increasing their profitability.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleagues from North Dakota for bringing this \nissue to our attention. I agree that such a study on conservation \ncropping systems in transitional climate areas would be very \nbeneficial, particularly for farmers, and I would be happy to try to \nassist you in conference.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2088\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to Senators Akaka and Kohl, I would \nlike to clarify a specific matter related to amendment no. 2088 to S. \n1427 concerning the protection of downed animals. First of all, I \napplaud their efforts to protect this Nation's food supply and minimize \nthe suffering of nonambulatory animals. The clarification I have \nconcerns animals raised by farmers and then custom processed so that \nall of the meat and meat products from that animal will be for the \nfarmer's personal use. I understand that this amendment does not affect \na Federally inspected facility's ability to engage in this type of \nprocessing. Am I correct that consistent with 21 U.S.C. 623(a), this \nsection does not affect the ability of establishments at which \ninspection occurs under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. 601, \nto slaughter animals or prepare meat or meat food products on a custom \nbasis where the animal is raised by the person and the meat and meat \nproducts are for the exclusive use of the person and the person's \nhousehold, nonpaying guests, and employees?\n  Mr. AKAKA. That my understanding.\n  Mr. KOHL. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you for that clarification.\n\n\n                        asian long-horned beetle\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Michigan and the distinguished \nranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. As the \nranking member knows, on September 4, 2003, the Asian long-horned \nbeetle was discovered in Woodbridge, Ontario, and the area is under \nquarantine as the Canadians try to eradicate the infestations. Despite \nthe quarantine in Ontario, the Asian long-horned beetle presents a real \nthreat to Michigan. Currently, there are 180 trash trucks from Ontario \nthat are sent to Michigan's landfills every day. Despite the fact that \nit is illegal to dump yard waste in Michigan's landfills, these trash \ntrucks have been found to contain this illegal waste. According to a \nSeptember 22, 2003 report by the Michigan Department of Environmental \nQuality, MDEQ, entitled, ``Report on Waste Inspections at Michigan \nLandfills,'' more than 25 percent of the Ontario waste inspected \ncontained yard waste. Waste originating in Ontario had the highest \npercentage of loads containing yard waste of all out-of-state waste \nthat comes into Michigan, despite Michigan's prohibition. Our Michigan \ncommunities are extremely concerned that APHIS has not thoroughly \nexamined the potential threat of infestation that these Canadian trash \ntrucks present.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join the junior Senator from Michigan in \nher concern for this potentially devastating problem. The Canadian yard \nwaste, which includes tree branches and trimmings, poses a serious \nthreat of spreading the Asian long-horned beetle to Michigan. According \nto the USDA, these beetles lay their eggs in grooves that they chew \ninto the tree's branches and trunk. The beetle requires 1 to 2 years to \ncompletely develop from an egg to an adult and feeds on the host tree \nduring that time. Branches and tree scraps brought into Michigan as \nyard waste could contain beetle eggs and larvae that are embedded in \nthe bark. The Asian long-horned beetle is extremely destructive to \nhardwood trees, particularly maple, poplar and willow trees. Michigan's \ntree population has already been severely damaged by the spread of the \nemerald ash borer beetle, which has killed over 6 million trees in \nSoutheast Michigan and caused over $162 million in damage. The USDA \nmust act immediately to prevent another devastating infestation, the \nAsian long-horned beetle, from spreading into Michigan.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from \nMichigan and concur with them that this is a problem that must be \nimmediately addressed. I will work in conference to include in the \nstatement of managers language requiring APHIS to do a comprehensive \nreview of their procedures and regulations, and report to Congress by \nJanuary 1, 2004, on whether or not these regulations and procedures are \nadequate to prevent the Asian long-horned beetle from entering into \nMichigan in Canadian trash trucks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n\n[[Page S14151]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n\n\n                         phytophthora root rot\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Michigan and the ranking member of \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. As the ranking member \nknows, phytophthora root rot is destroying crops and ravaging soil \nthroughout the State of Michigan. Many growers are reporting major \nlosses, despite following recommended control strategies, and it is \ndevastating our cucumber, pole bean and soybean crops. Michigan State \nUniversity is examining ways to contain and eradicate root rot and they \nneed $184,000 to conduct this critical research. Would the \ndistinguished ranking member work with us in conference to obtain this \ncritical funding?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Michigan in asking \nthe distinguished ranking member to give this important project \nconsideration in conference. Phytophthora root rot is a fungus that is \ndestroying crops and once the soil is infested, it must be taken out of \nproduction for 10 years. Currently, methyl bromide, which has been used \nby fresh market growers to control the disease, is scheduled to be \nphased out in 2005. New research is needed to develop tools that can \neffectively contain and eradicate this devastating disease.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from \nMichigan, and I will be happy to work with them in conference to obtain \nfunding for this critical phytophthora root rot research at Michigan \nState University.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask my colleagues from Utah and \nWisconsin if they are aware of the great need to control erosion and \nsediment in the Great Lakes region.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am told that approximately 63 million tons of topsoil \nerodes from cropland in the Great Lakes basin each year, reducing \nagricultural productivity. I am willing to address this problem.\n  Mr. DeWINE. In the past, this subcommittee has been very supportive \nof the Great Lakes Basin Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Program. The \nGreat Lakes Basin program is a federal--state partnership, and its goal \nis to protect and improve Great Lakes water quality by controlling \nerosion and sedimentation; limiting the input of associated nutrients \nand toxic contaminants; and minimizing off-site sources of damages to \nharbors, streams, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational facilities \nand the basin's system of public works.\n  Mr. KOHL. The chairman and I understand the importance of this \nprogram to the Great Lakes region, and we will do what we can to \nsupport the House funding allocation for this program in conference.\n\n\n       grape genomics research center and viticulture consortium\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nFiscal Year 2004 Agriculture appropriations bill and to commend the \nleadership of the subcommittee for crafting this bill under very \ndifficult financial constraints.\n  I wish to thank the subcommittee for recognizing the importance of \nthe winegrape and wine industry for the U.S. economy and the economy of \nCalifornia. Winegrapes account for two-thirds of the total U.S. grape \ncrop. Furthermore, grapes are the highest value fruit crop in the U.S. \nand are the seventh largest agricultural crop in our nation. For my \nhome State of California, the winegrape industry produces $33 billion \nfor the economy, making winegrapes the State's largest agricultural \ncrop. Yet, unlike most of our Nation's largest crops, winegrapes \nreceive no direct farm subsidies.\n  I would like to ask Ranking Member Kohl about two items in this \nlegislation that involve cooperative research efforts that are \nessential to the future of the winegrape and wine industry. First, the \nHouse legislation includes $3 million in ARS funding for a Grape \nGenomics Research Center at the University of California at Davis. It \nis important that this funding level be maintained in the final version \nof this bill. Funding for such projects is crucial since cooperative \nresearch has been behind the success of the winegrape industry. \nInvestment in research must continue if we are to withstand the rigid \ncompetition from our world neighbors who would love to replace our \nindustry with their own products. This can only be done with the \ncooperation of the U.S. Congress to ensure the American wine industry \nhas the necessary resources to continue the cutting edge research and \ndevelopment that has kept this industry competitive.\n  In California, winegrapes are grown in areas being rapidly developed \ninto urban uses. If our winegrape and wine industry is to continue to \nthrive, we must be more efficient with our land; we must produce grapes \nmore resistant to diseases; and we must be good neighbors to the \nsurrounding environment. This proposed $3 million investment in \nviticulture research will ensure that already successful collaborative \nefforts among the grape and wine industry, universities, and USDA is \ncontinued in the years to come. It is a wonderful investment into our \nindustry's future. I ask Senator Kohl that in conference with our House \ncolleagues, we make every effort to ensure this important funding in \nthe House bill is kept in the final version of the fiscal year 2004 \nAgricultural appropriations bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to respond to \nthe Senator from California by saying that I appreciate the value of \nsound research programs that use a combination of the expertise of the \nindustry involved, the best scientists in our universities, and the \noutstanding scientific resources within the Department of Agriculture. \nAs Senator Feinstein noted, we have fiscal restraints with which we \nmust abide. I assure the Senator that I will bring an open mind to the \nconference and will try to craft the best possible legislation.\n  I certainly will do what I can in conference to see that this \nresearch continues, and I will carefully consider the $3 million \nproposed for the Grape Genomics Center at UC Davis.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, once again, I thank the subcommittee, \nand I wish to raise one more issue that relates to getting the best \npossible use of the research dollars. Both the Senate and House bills \ninclude funding for the Viticulture Consortium at last year's level of \n$1.8 million from CSREES. I remain hopeful that this funding level can \nbe increased to $2.5 million. The Viticulture Consortium is a truly \nunique and effective research program that addresses unmet national \nresearch needs important to the winegrape growing industry. The \nconsortium is an active partnership of Federal, State, and industry \nresources which enhances research coordination, improves research \nefficiency, and eliminates duplication of effort. This is a \ncollaborative program administered by Cornell University, Penn State \nUniversity, and the University of California. Research proposals have \nbeen received from 20 States and research priorities are developed by a \nnational network of key industry research and extension representatives \nknown as the American Viticulture and Enology Research Network, AVERN. \nThis type of collaborative program can serve as a model for research \ninvolving other commodities.\n  Again, recognizing the limits facing us, I ask the leaders of the \nsubcommittee to work with me to provide a modest increase in the \nfunding level for the Viticulture Consortium in this bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate this unique effort to use a cooperative \napproach to get the most output out of each scarce research dollar \nappropriated to the winegrape and wine industry. I also look forward to \nworking with the Senator on this issue, not only in the upcoming \nconference, but also in the future to see how the Viticulture \nConsortium can continue to expand on its excellent work.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2090\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I comment on the Hatch-Harkin-Durbin \namendment No. 2090 adopted by the Senate yesterday. This action taken \nby the Senate is an important step in our continuing efforts to assure \nthat Americans have access to high quality dietary supplements to \nmaintain and improve their health.\n\n[[Page S14152]]\n\n  Over 158 million Americans take dietary supplements to maintain and \nimprove their health. From vitamin C to calcium to glucosamine to beta \ncarotene, there is a full range of healthful supplements that are part \nof the daily lives of people all over this country.\n  Consumer expenditures on these products reached a reported $17.1 \nbillion in 2000, double the amount spent just 6 years earlier. And, \naccording to a recent report by the Food and Drug Administration, the \nuse of dietary supplements is likely to grow due to factors such as the \naging of the baby-boom generation, increased interest in self-\nsufficiency, and advances in science that are uncovering new \nrelationships between diet and disease.\n  In response to efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to \ninappropriately cut off consumers' access to some supplements, in 1994, \nthe House and Senate unanimously approved the Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act, DSHEA. I was pleased to have played a role in \ncrafting this important legislation. This law balanced continued \nconsumer access to vitamins, minerals and other dietary supplements, \nincreased scientific research on the benefits and risks of supplements \nand needed consumer protections.\n  DSHEA provides a number of important consumer protections. It \nrequires that claims made on supplement labels, packaging and \naccompanying material be ``truthful, non-misleading and \nsubstantiated.'' In addition, the act prohibits manufacturers from \nmaking claims that products are intended to diagnose, treat, cure or \nprevent a disease.\n  DSHEA also provides for good manufacturing practice standards setting \nrequirements for potency, cleanliness and stability of products. It \nrequires that manufacturers submit adequate information as to the \nsafety of any new ingredients contained in dietary supplements before \nthose products can be sold.\n  DSHEA also provided the Federal Government a number of avenues for \nthe removal of unsafe dietary supplements from the marketplace. If the \nFDA determines that a product poses an unreasonable risk when taken as \ndirected, the product can be removed from the market. If the Secretary \ndetermines that a product poses an imminent hazard to the public \nhealth, he can remove the product from sale.\n  Finally, in order to promote expanded scientific research on the \nbenefits and health effects of dietary supplements, DSHEA mandated the \nestablishment of the Office of Dietary Supplements within the National \nInstitutes of Health. This research is crucial to expanding reliable \ninformation to the American people.\n  Unfortunately, despite some recent improvement, the history of \nimplementation of DSHEA by the FDA has been poor. The Food and Drug \nAdministration has failed to use the many tools provided by DSHEA. It \nhas failed to carefully review claims for truthfulness. It has failed \nto put in place new good manufacturing practice standards. It has \nfailed to aggressively remove from the market illegal street drug \nknock-offs and other products which are in clear violation of DSHEA \nrequirements.\n  Part of the problem has been resources. The FDA needs adequate \nresources to appropriately implement and enforce DSHEA. Congress has \nresponded by regularly providing funds over the last several years \nbeyond those requested in the President's budget, reaching $9.7 million \nin fiscal year 2003.\n  The amendment we approved yesterday would increase funding for \nimplementation and enforcement of DSHEA by at least 17.5 percent. It \nrequires FDA to spend no less than $11.4 million for this purpose, $1 \nmillion more than requested by the administration. This is a \nsubstantial and necessary increase. I would like to see even more \ndevoted to this purpose. In fact, S. 1538, legislation Senator Hatch \nand I introduced earlier this year would increase FDA funding to $20 \nmillion next year, rising to $65 million per year within 5 years. We \nwill continue to work to gain adoption of this more aggressive \napproach.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations subcommittee for their willingness to work with us and \ngain approval of this important consumer protection amendment. I also \nwant to express my support for an amendment Senator Durbin offered to \nexpedite the FDA's action on dietary supplements containing ephedra. \nThe FDA should make a decision promptly on this matter and it should be \nbased on sound science.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, prior to the 1996 farm bill, the annual \ncost-share assistance payment limitation for the Agricultural \nConservation Program, ACP, was $3,500. With the advent of the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentive Program, EQIP, in 1996, the annual \ncost-share assistance payment limit was increased to $10,000 per year.\n  EQIP also instituted another change, rather than single year \nagreements, conservation agreements under EQIP were set at a minimum of \n5 years to improve conservation benefits and increase farm payments. \nHence, the 1996 law set a 5-year payment limitation of $50,000 for \nthose rare instances in which a participant received the maximum \n$10,000 annual payment each of 5 years.\n  Between 1996 and 2002, the national average EQIP cost share amount \nper farm per 5-year contract was less than $10,000, or less than 20 \npercent of the $50,000 payment limitation.\n  Between 1996 and 2002, for animal waste storage structures, one of \nthe most expensive practices eligible for EQIP assistance, the national \naverage per farm per 5-year contract amount has been $13,573, also \nconsiderably below the $50,000 payment limitation at that time.\n  The 2002 farm bill increased the payment limitation nine-fold to \n$450,000 over the 6-year life of the farm bill.\n  The $450,000 limit was arrived at in the House-Senate conference \ncommittee. The Senate version of the farm bill had a 5-year $150,000 \nlimitation. The House bill had a $200,000 limitation.\n  Amazingly, on the very last day of the farm bill conference the \npayment limit was increased to $450,000, three times greater than what \nthe Senate had approved. This new number showed up out of nowhere, with \nvirtually no discussion or debate in public.\n  The Senate bill contained an important provision related to the \npayment limit. All payments were made directly attributable to real \npersons by Social Security number. This direct attribution provision \nwas intended to prevent participants from forming dummy corporations \nand partnerships for the purpose of getting around the payment limit \nand collecting multiple payments.\n  This provision was retained in the conference committee, so that at \nleast the $450,000 limit was to apply to an individual or an entity \nregardless of the number of farming sites in an operation or the number \nor type of business arrangements the EQIP operator was engaged in.\n  In promulgating rules and guidance for the implementation of EQIP, \nhowever, USDA has decided to allow the $450,000 to be multiplied by the \nnumber of partners in a single farming operation. This essentially \nmakes the limitation meaningless, since it allows business structures \nto be arranged to collect multiple payments.\n  While no single person could collect more than $450,000, relatives, \nemployees, farmhands and others could be made partners that each could \ncollect up to the maximum amount.\n  Farmer demand for EQIP remained very high throughout the 1996 farm \nbill period and its $50,000 multi-year limitation. Demand outstripped \nfunding.\n  Congress responded in 2002 by increasing total funding for EQIP five \nfold, and I was heavily involved with that effort.\n  However, by simultaneously increasing the payment limit nine fold, \nthe new $1 billion per year funding level may not result in more \nfarmers being served, which was Congress' intention.\n  The ranking systems in many States being put in place to determine \nwho wins EQIP contracts and who goes on the waiting list appears to be \nfavoring the large farm/large contract applicants.\n  My amendment would scale the payment limit back to $300,000. This is \nstill double the amount passed by the Senate in 2002, and more than \nadequate for 97.8 percent of EQIP participants.\n  My amendment does not scale back funding for EQIP. Rather, it \nprovides that dollars appropriated by this bill cannot be used to pay \nUSDA salaries and expenses to operate the EQIP program with payments \ngreater than $300,000 per agricultural operation.\n\n[[Page S14153]]\n\n  Adoption of this amendment will allow more farmers to participate in \nthe program in the coming year. Adoption of the amendment will result \nin a fairer distribution of dollars within the program. Adoption of \nthis amendment will prevent EQIP resources from being gobbled up by a \nfew large contracts to mega farms.\n  This is a fair compromise, a good compromise. It provides access to \nthe program by all types of farms and all sizes of farms, but it puts a \nlimit on the amount of taxpayer support any one operation can receive.\n  If we do not pass this amendment, I think by the time of the next \nfarm bill there will be lots of media attention focused on how this \nenvironmental quality cost share program has become a new subsidy \nprogram, paying out six and seven figure checks, for the Nation's \nbiggest operations. And there will be questions about why an \nenvironmental program is leading to concentration and consolidation.\n  A $450,000 payment limit has no effect on 98.9 percent of all \nlivestock operations. A $300,000 payment limit has no effect on 97.8 \npercent of all livestock operations. That means my amendment only \naffects 1.1 percent of livestock operations.\n  The 1.1 percent of mega-operations will still be eligible for \n$300,000. They just will not be able to take such a big piece of such a \nsmall pie. I do not think it is unreasonable to reduce full funding for \nthe largest 1.1 percent of livestock operations so that more family \nfarmers can participate.\n  So what I am saying is let's be careful. Let's be balanced. Let's \nincrease the payment limitation, and avoid a ``sky's the limit'' \napproach.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to provide a few brief \ncomments on the Agriculture appropriations bill and to also make a few \ncomments regarding my friend and colleague, the distinguished new \nchairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Utah.\n  The chairman has done an outstanding job putting this bill together \nunder a difficult budget allocation, and I congratulate him for his \nwork.\n  I also want to make a few comments regarding several programs in this \nbill that are of particular interest to me in my role as the chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee.\n  I urge the chairman and the members of the subcommittee who will sit \non the conference to support as much funding as possible for USDA's \nhomeland security funding request and the Dole-McGovern International \nSchool Lunch Program.\n  Both of these programs are vital to our ongoing war against \nterrorism.\n  The USDA homeland security funds will support the rapid response \nanimal and plant health diagnostics networks established last year by \nUSDA.\n  These networks will allow us to respond quickly to an animal or \ndisease outbreak that occurs, whether naturally occurring or \nintentionally introduced.\n  While this may not seem like a serious risk, I can tell you that the \nthreat is real. We know some of the 9/11 hijackers had agriculture \ntraining, and the former Soviet Union had weaponized many of these \ndiseases. The intentional introduction of any of these diseases would \nhave a devastating impact on both the agriculture and national \neconomies.\n  Regarding the Dole-McGovern program, it often provides the only meal \nthat many students--particularly those in the Middle East--receive each \nday.\n  Young girls go to school so they can receive these meals. They gain \nan education, they broaden their horizons, and it will eventually help \nto bring greater stability to that part of the world.\n  Young boys go to schools where they can receive a meal and \ninstruction in math and science instead of radicalism and extremism. \nMany terrorist recruiters get their youngest members through the offer \nof a warm, nutritious meal each day.\n  We must give these students the opportunity to be fed and get a basic \neducation, rather than spending their days learning how to fire an AK-\n47. Thus, I urge support for these programs as this bill moves to \nconference.\n  Before yielding the floor, I also wish to make a few comments \nregarding our new subcommittee chairman.\n  When I first heard he would become chairman of the subcommittee, I \ndidn't know whether to congratulate him or send him a sympathy card.\n  I have spent the better part of the years I have had the privilege to \nserve Kansas in the House and Senate wandering around in what you might \ncall the agriculture policy pasture. For a short time, I even served as \nthe head of the sometimes powerful House Agriculture Committee.\n  What my ears in that pasture have taught me is that if you spend much \ntime dealing with agriculture policy, you often end up feeling like \nyour are straddling the barbed wire fence. The issues are never easy.\n  There are often strong and very real policy differences among the \nfarm groups and varying regions of the country. They are some of the \nmost difficult issues I have ever faced, and they have certainly been \nknown to tie this bill up in past years.\n  Earlier, it appeared that many of those issues would bog the bill \ndown again this year.\n  However, as we would say in Dodge City, he took the bull by the horns \nand charged ahead. I know that it has not been easy, but I also want \nthe chairman to know that I think he has done a remarkable job.\n  He managed to balance a severely reduced budget allocation in a \nmanner that was fair to all members and regions of the country, and he \nhas worked to find the middle ground on many issues. As a result of his \nefforts, we will spend only 1 or 2 days on the bill this year, instead \nof the week or more we spent in recent years.\n  He has taken what is often a thankless job and has performed \nadmirably. He deserves both the thanks and praise of the Senate.\n  I say to the chairman, job well done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the agriculture appropriations bill funds \nseveral important programs at the Department of Agriculture, the Food \nand Drug Administration, and other domestic food services provided \nthrough the Department of Health and Human Services. These funding \nprograms are critically important to our Nation's farmers, families, \nand children.\n  Considering the importance of this bill, and at this critical time, I \nam once again greatly disappointed to report the amount of flagrant \nporkbarrel spending in this bill. This year's agriculture spending bill \nincludes nearly $300 million in questionable earmarks. Despite the \nobvious need to eliminate the excessive special interest earmarks in \nthe agriculture appropriations bill, the appropriators tacked on 395 of \nthe usual garden-variety, special interest earmarks. Sadly, it appears \nthat the porkbarrel ``business as usual'' attitude reigns once again.\n  Let's take a look at some of the porkbarrel projects in this year's \nagriculture appropriations bill:\n  An increase of $300,000 over the fiscal year 2003 level for research \non alternative swine research;\n  An increase of $1.4 million over the fiscal year 03 level for dairy \nforage research in Madison, WI;\n  An increase of $1 million for research on taramix control using China \nbeetles in Reno, NV;\n  A $100,000 increase for the development of commercially approved \nvaccines for catfish in Auburn, IL;\n  An increase of $450,000 over the fiscal year 03 level for a \nlaboratory in Parlier, CA, to study the Glassy-winged sharpshooter and \nPierce's disease;\n  A $150,000 increase to study grape genetics in Geneva, NY;\n  An additional $300,000 for potato storage research in Madison, WI;\n  An additional $200,000 for research on seafood waste at the \nUniversity of Alaska;\n  An additional $300,000 for the U.S. Vegetable Laboratory in \nCharleston, SC;\n  An unrequested earmark of $631,000 for alternative salmon products in \nAlaska;\n  An earmark of $358,000 for alternative tobacco uses in Maryland;\n  An earmark of $442,000 for apple fire blight in Michigan and New \nYork;\n  An earmark of $278,000 for asparagus technology and production in the \nState of Washington;\n  An earmark of $200,000 for berry research in Alaska;\n  $600,000 for cool season legume research in Idaho, Washington and \nNorth Dakota;\n  $234,000 for cranberry and blueberry disease and breeding studies in \nNew Jersey;\n\n[[Page S14154]]\n\n  A whopping $2 million for exotic pet diseases in California;\n  $844,000 for soybean research in Illinois;\n  $596,000 for peanut research in Alabama;\n  $502,000 for wheat sawfly research in Montana;\n  $450,000 for agricultural-based industrial lubricants in Iowa;\n  $690,000 for agriculture waste utilization in WV--pretty fancy term \nfor fertilizer;\n  $150,000 for salmon quality standards in Alaska;\n  $250,000 for the National Wild Turkey Federation, located in South \nCarolina;\n  $300,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin;\n  $2 million to address chronic wasting disease in Wisconsin;\n  $250,000 to address chronic wasting disease in Utah--maybe we should \nstudy chronic wasting disease right here in Washington, because the \namount of waste that goes on in this city has reached chronic levels, \nand that is stating it mildly;\n  $1 million for grasshopper and Mormon cricket activities in Utah;\n  $300,000 for grasshopper and Mormon cricket activities in Nevada;\n  $150,000 for beaver control in Kentucky;\n  $225,000 for blackbird control in Kansas;\n  $350,000 for evaluating native plant materials in Alaska;\n  $600,000 for cranberry production in Massachusetts and Wisconsin.\n  Here is the clincher: the report accompanying this bill directs the \nSecretary of Agriculture to take all necessary measures to maximize and \nto provide a fair allocation of resources under the farm bill to the \nState of Alaska. This directive is seen as necessary because the \ncommittee is deeply disturbed that Alaska has largely been ignored thus \nfar in the implementation of the farm bill passed in 2002. We certainly \nwould not want Alaska to suffer from a lack of Federal dollars now \nwould we?\n  Even the reliable earmarks like shrimp aquaculture and peanut \nresearch are included. Shrimp aquaculture in Arizona and other states \nhas been a consistent beneficiary of taxpayer dollars for 11 years, \nwith this year's earmark being $4.2 million. Unfortunately, there is \nlittle explanation included to justify why targeted Federal dollars for \nearmarked projects are more important than other programs to protect \nfood safety or more directly support farm programs in this bill.\n  I am confident that many of my colleagues will maintain the \nimportance of the need to fully fund these and many of the other \nprojects in their respective States. That is fine. I do not fault them \nfor it. In fact, let me state clearly, that I do not question the \nmerits of these projects. Most of them, I am sure, are very important \nand worthy for Federal funds.\n  It is the process with which I have a serious problem. The \nAppropriations Committee has effectively usurped the power of the \nauthorizing committees and acts as one, all-powerful funding machine. \nProjects are often funded with little or no background study, and are \napproved after simply being requested by a fellow Senator. These same \nprojects are directed to certain States and localities, completely \ncircumventing the proper, competitive-based awards process. \nAdditionally, the Appropriations Committee routinely uses directive \nlanguage to force cabinet secretaries and agency heads to use scarce \ntaxpayer dollars to fund members' pet projects, while not alloting them \na single dime with which to fulfill the requirements imposed upon them \nby the appropriators.\n  This spending spree is an outrage. As all of my colleagues know, CBO \nrecently projected a potentially debilitating $480 billion deficit for \n2004. More importantly, we are at war. President Bush is poised to sign \na supplemental appropriation of $87 billion for the ongoing military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Every one of us has asked ourselves \nthe same question: ``where is that money going to come from?'' I have \nan idea Mr. President. Let's start with this bill. Let's eliminate all \nof the unrequested earmarks, all of the special deals, all of the pork \nand all of the waste. Let's prove to the American taxpayer that we in \nWashington do not see them as simply a cash cow for our every financial \nwhim.\n  I urge my colleagues to work harder to curb our habit of funneling \nresources to parochial interests. Serving the public good must continue \nto be our mandate, and we can only live up to that charge by keeping \nthe process free of unfair and unnecessary spending that unduly burdens \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to speak on amendment \n2094, which was successfully added to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture \nappropriations bill yesterday. This amendment restores decreased \nfunding for food stamp recipients in Alaska and Hawaii. Senators \nStevens, Inouye, and Akaka have joined me in cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the cost of food items \nin Alaska and Hawaii, rather than researching the actual cost for these \nitems. This method of estimating prices rather than researching prices \nled to a negative update that slashed benefits for the most vulnerable \nAlaskans and Hawaiians. The cuts in benefits, which took effect on \nOctober 1 of this year, essentially locks low income residents of \nAlaska and Hawaii into trying to buy this year's food at last year's \nprices. This just does not work.\n  Please allow me to give a few examples about the actual cost of food \naround my State. In the general store in Port Graham, a remote village \nin the southcentral part of Alaska that is only accessible by boat or \naircraft, one gallon of milk costs $11.59. In the village of Hoonah, \nwhich is a remote village located on an island west of our State \ncapitol of Juneau, oranges cost nearly $5 a pound.\n  Cutting the benefits for folks who are already paying far above the \nnational average for food is unconscionable. This amendment, which is \nfully offset, says that the most vulnerable Alaskans and Hawaiians \nshould not be stripped of their ability to put food on the table for \ntheir families.\n  This amendment will make a real difference for those in Alaska and \nHawaii who are working to become self-sufficient.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, last year Congress created the Public \nTelevision Station Digital Transition Grant Program within the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to help public television continue \nbroadcasting to rural America in the digital age.\n  As with any first year program there are some fine points that need \nto be ironed out. I am concerned about potential inequities in the \ndistribution of funds that may result from the grant competition.\n  I support awarding grants to public television stations that provide \na broadcast service to rural populations, regardless of the location of \ntheir main transmitter. If a public television station's digital \ntransmitter serves less than 500,000 people it should be considered \nrural and automatically given the highest score for rurality.\n  The Department's use of Per capital Income, PCI, as a factor in \ndetermining an applicant's score is appropriate. However, I encourage \nthe Department to weight PCI by population. Unless a score is weighted \nby population, it may result in an inequitable score if a small portion \nof the coverage area reaches an enclave of higher income viewers. \nHighest priority should be given to rurality and critical need in \nscoring applications. The weighted PCI score should not exceed 15 \npercent of the total score.\n  Furthermore, I believe that it would be beneficial for the Department \nto consult with public televisions stations through their national \ntrade organization to assess the critical needs of the stations.\n  Finally, I support the sue of funds for purchasing equipment \nnecessary to allow local control over digital content and programming \nthrough the use of multicasting and datacasting technologies.\n  I urge the Department to take the necessary steps to address these \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I would like to note in the Record some Utah projects \nthat are important to reference as a Senate priority as we conference \nthis bill with the House. It is important that report language be \nincluded noting an application that will be submitted to USDA for Rural \nCommunity Advancement Program funding and placing a priority upon its \nconsideration. This RCAP application will be for potable water, fire\n\n[[Page S14155]]\n\nprotections, and waste water extensions in Wellsville, Utah.\n  I also note the importance of providing Natural Resource Conservation \nService dollars for ditch, canal, and irrigation improvements in \nWellsville, UT, as well as watershed protection funding under Public \nLaw 566 for piping and lining the Washington Fields Canal in the \nvicinity of St. George and Washington County, UT. The WFC provides \nwater to 4800 acres of farmland and is currently in very poor \ncondition. Given the significant growth in this area and the listing of \ntwo endangered species in the river system, this funding is important \nto save water that is currently wasted and that could augment stream \nflows not only for the community, but as needed for environmental and \nconservation purposes.\n  Finally, I am supportive of several projects to bring drinking water \nto Kane County residents through the Kane County Water Conservancy \nDistrict in southern Utah. These projects, including the Strawberry/\nMovie Ranch, Meadow View Heights, and Johnson Canyon projects, are \nnecessary because of the ongoing drought in Utah, the degraded existing \nwater systems, and increased demand caused by development. These \nprojects are of great value, and I hope that the USDA would seriously \nconsider applications for loans and grants under the authorized program \nfor water and waste disposal. The Johnson Canyon project, in \nparticular, is of great importance to Kane County residents. Due to the \nsevere drought and other factors, the well that supplies water to \nJohnson Canyon residents has shown a dramatic decrease in the drinking \nwater quality, and individuals are now faced with installing reverse \nosmosis systems for their drinking water. In fact, because of the high \nlevel of total dissolved solids in the water, the well has become an \ninferior source, and the State of Utah recommends that an inferior \nsource should not be allowed if a better source of water is available. \nThe district has found higher quality water, and this project will \nallow development of this important resource.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there is an issue that has been rule \n14'd and is on the calendar, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct, which has 54 cosponsors. It overwhelmingly passed the House back \nin April 285 to 140. This legislation is important to millions of \nAmericans who want to be able to exercise their second amendment \nrights. There is simply no reason we should not be able to complete \naction on this bill expeditiously--there are not many measures around \nhere that have that many cosponsors--that is, unless people want to \ndelay its consideration with unrelated amendments.\n  In an effort to address this matter fairly and efficiently, I have \nindicated to my good friend and colleague, the assistant Democratic \nleader, that I will propound the following consent request as a way to \npossibly expedite consideration of this measure which is supported by a \nsubstantial majority of our colleagues on a bipartisan basis.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of S. 1806; that \nthere be 6 hours of general debate on the bill equally divided; that \nthe only amendments in order be two relevant amendments offered by each \nside, with each first-degree amendment subject to a second-degree \namendment which shall be relevant to the first degree amendment; \nprovided further that each first-degree amendment be limited to 1 hour \nof debate evenly divided, and each second-degree amendment be limited \nto 30 minutes of debate equally divided; provided further that upon \nexpiration of all time, the Senate immediately proceed to a vote on all \npending amendments; after disposition of the pending amendments, the \nbill be read a third time, and the Senate immediately proceed to a vote \non final passage, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I share the distinguished Senator's desire \nto pass this most important legislation. In fact, I am a cosponsor of \nthis bill, which has been introduced on a bipartisan basis by Senators \nCraig and Baucus. This legislation would protect firearm and ammunition \nmanufacturers from lawsuits related to deliberate and illegal misuse of \ntheir products. It will protect the rights of Americans who choose to \nlegally purchase and use their products. So the legislation makes \nsense.\n  As a gun owner since I was a young boy, I believe law-abiding \ncitizens have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms. I also \nbelieve the rights of the responsible gun owner should not be \ncompromised or jeopardized by individuals who use firearms to commit \ncrimes. The vast majority of Nevada gun owners use their guns safely, \nand I will\n\n[[Page S14156]]\n\nwork in a bipartisan fashion to safeguard their rights. I will work to \npass this bill, and I think we have the votes to pass it.\n  However, in a short time I will object to this consent request by my \nfriend because it does not advance our shared goal of enacting this \nbill into law. In fact, this request, in my opinion, would set us back \nin our efforts to pass the legislation. We need to take the time \nnecessary to debate and vote on the amendments that Senators want to \noffer to this bill, and then we need to pass it.\n  I think this late in the session, with the constraints that are \nobviously present with everybody, it just would not help us. I will \nwork with my friend and anyone else to get a unanimous consent \nagreement both sides can agree to.\n\n  For now, on behalf of Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and others, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Nevada is certainly correct. At this \nlate stage in the session, the only way we could advance this proposal \nto completion would be with a consent agreement that allowed us to deal \nonly with relevant amendments. One of the concerns is that we could end \nup having amendments on minimum wage or hate crimes or other issues \nthat are completely unrelated to the underlying subject matter. So it \nwas my belief that the consent agreement I just offered was reasonable \nin the sense that it did allow relevant amendments to the underlying \nbill, but it also gives us an opportunity to reach completion.\n  I want to modify my request a couple of more times and see if it \nmight be more enticing to my good friend from Nevada. I modify my prior \nunanimous consent request as follows: That there be 8 hours instead of \n6, 8 hours of general debate on the bill equally divided, and that the \nonly amendments in order be three relevant amendments offered by each \nside instead of two, with each first-degree amendment subject to a \nsecond-degree amendment which shall be relevant to the first-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I really do \nbelieve we can work with Senators on our side and a few on the other \nside to come up with a reasonable approach to this legislation that I \nthink has an outstanding chance of passing. We can't do it now. We are \nwrapping up this session of the legislature. Even though my friend has \nsuggested relevant amendments, we need to take a little bit of time to \nwork this through. The time that has been suggested by my friend is \nsomething that may or may not work.\n  I just say to everyone within the sound of my voice, we need some \ntime to work this out. We will be happy to cooperate in any way we can, \nbut there are too many objections on this side to move forward at this \ntime.\n  On behalf of Senator Reed of Rhode Island and others, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me propound one last unanimous \nconsent request, again bearing in mind that the only chance of moving \nthis legislation forward this late in the session would be with a time \nagreement with relevant amendments. The underlying bill being supported \nby 54 cosponsors, we suspect well more than 60 are advocating this \nlegislation. Let me try to entice my good friend one more time by \nfurther modifying my second request in the following way: I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 10 hours of general debate on the bill \nequally divided, and that the only amendments in order be 4 relevant \namendments offered by each side, with each first-degree amendment \nsubject to a second-degree amendment, which shall be relevant to the \nfirst-degree amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, on certain \nissues, I am fairly easy to entice, but the fact is, on this, I have a \nsignificant number of Senators on this side who are not able to be \nenticed at this stage. On their behalf, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this is a very important piece of \nlegislation that should be enacted in this Congress. It is apparent it \nwill not be done in the first session of the 108th Congress. There are \nnot many measures around here that have 54 cosponsors and probably with \nsupport well in excess of 60. I hope we can work together in the early \npart of the next session and advance this legislation to final passage, \nwith relevant amendments, so it does not become a measure that attracts \nevery single good cause some Senator may want to propose totally \nunrelated to the underlying question of whether gun manufacturers \nshould be held responsible for acts perpetrated by individuals using \ntheir product--a fundamentally unfair trend developing in the country \nthat should be stopped before it goes any further.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I may respond, I think the approach \nthat we get into the legislation early next year is the way it will be \npassed. There will be a decision made early on by the leadership on \nboth sides, I am sure, as to if it is necessary to attempt to invoke \ncloture on this matter. We will have lots of time early next year to do \nthis.\n  I look forward to working with my friend from Kentucky to move \nforward on this most important legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14156-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14156-S14160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTERNET TAX NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I say to my friends on both sides of the issue, I think \nwe now have the proper legislative agenda in preparation for \namendments. Before I make an opening statement, I thank Senators Allen \nand Wyden for their hard work on this issue. I also pay my respects to \nthe Senator from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, and the Senator from \nTennessee, Senator Alexander, who have taken a deep and abiding \ninterest in this issue and have a very real understanding of it. This \nis a complex and difficult set of issues associated with the Internet.\n  I apologize for leaving out my dear friend from Delaware, Senator \nCarper,\n\n[[Page S14158]]\n\nwho probably knows more than the other two put together; at least, he \nbelieves so.\n  Again, these are difficult and complex issues. They have been \naffected significantly by changes in technology over the years. When we \nfirst did this moratorium issue, it was much simpler than it is today. \nAs the Internet has obtained dramatically new capabilities with \ndramatic changes in its nature, the issue has changed. The Senators \nfrom Ohio, Tennessee, and Delaware have raised significant and valid \nconcerns. We believe we have tried to address those concerns.\n  Definitions certainly are critical in addressing this issue. Words \nhave meaning and importance when we are talking about this issue before \nus. I hope we can give fair consideration to the concerns and the \nproposals made by the opposition to this bill or those who would like \nto see it significantly modified.\n  Again, I thank my friends from Virginia and Oregon who have worked \ntremendously for years in the committee on this issue. I think the \nSenator from Oregon can remind me how many hearings we have had on this \nparticular issue, but it must be in double digits--more than 10--over \nthe past 6 or 7 years. Those hearings have been certainly appropriate, \nbecause each time we have had them the technology changed and the \nissues changed.\n  Madam President, this bill would ensure that consumers would never \nhave to pay a toll when they access the Information Highway. Whether \nconsumers log onto the Internet via cable modem, DSL, dial-up, or \nanother technology that has yet to be invented, under S. 150 they will \nnot see any State and local taxes on their monthly Internet bill. Now \nwould their monthly Internet bills increase because of State and local \ntaxes on Internet access that are passed down to consumers. Plainly and \nsimply, this is a pro-consumer, pro-innovation, and pro-technology \nbill.\n  S. 150, which was introduced in January by Senator Allen, would make \npermanent the current Federal prohibition on State and local taxes on \nInternet access contained in the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 \n(ITFA). It also would extend permanently the current moratorium in ITFA \non multiple or discriminatory state and local taxes on e-commerce \ntransactions.\n  In addition, this bill would extend by 3 years the current \ngrandfather clause contained in ITFA. This clause permits States that \nimposed or enforced a tax on Internet access prior to the passage of \nITFA in 1998 to continue taxing Internet access. After 2006, this \ngrandfathering protection would lapse.\n  Five years ago, Congress took appropriate action when it passed the \nIFTA, legislation that encouraged the growth and the adoption of the \nInternet by exempting Internet access from State and local taxation, \nand by protecting e-commerce transactions from multiple or \ndiscriminatory taxation.\n  As my colleagues know, over the past decade, the Internet has grown \nfrom a tool used primarily by academics and scientists for research \npurposes to a broadly utilized communications, information, \nentertainment, and commercial medium, as well as an important vehicle \nfor political participation. Indeed, the Internet has started to become \na fixture and core component of modern American life that has created \nand continues to generate social and economic opportunities throughout \nthe United States. This was our goal then and it continues to be our \ngoal today.\n  There is little doubt that the development and growth of the Internet \nwas aided by the moratorium. For example, in the past 5 years and with \nthe help of ITFA, household use of the Internet has doubled. At the \ntime of the legislation's enactment in 1998, 26 percent of United \nStates households had Internet access. By 2001--the year that the \nmoratorium was extended for a 2 year period--just over 50 percent of \nU.S. households had Internet access. By the end of 2002, approximately \n64 percent of American households had Internet access. However, despite \nthese significant growth rates, Internet access adoption rates remain \nlow relative to other basic technologies. Broadband access in \nparticular remain low. Indeed, in 2002, only 15 percent of American \nhouseholds had broadband Internet access. This means that a significant \nnumber of American consumers still have not gained the full benefits \nthat Internet technologies promise.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to extend permanently the Internet tax \nmoratorium and thus fulfill our promise to consumers that Government \ntaxes will not inhibit the offering of affordable Internet access. By \nsupporting S. 150, we can continue to promote the adoption of the \nInternet by our citizens as well as encourage innovation relating to \nthis technology. Just as Internet access evolved from basic dial-up \nservice to broadband services since the enactment of ITFA, a permanent \nextension of the Internet tax moratorium is expected to encourage \nbusinesses to further evolve Internet technologies and consumers to \ncontinue adopting such technologies.\n  I am fully aware that State and local government groups are concerned \nabout certain aspects of this bill and, in particular, worry that this \nlegislation will result in significant revenue losses to the States and \nlocalities. As many of you know, I have worked closely with the co-\nsponsors of the legislation in an attempt to accommodate many of the \nconcerns of the States and local governments. In fact, I am a co-\nsponsor of the substitute amendment to S. 150 only because I was \nsatisfied that the amendment's co-sponsors had compromised as much as \nthey reasonably could with the States and localities. What we present \ntoday is a good-faith effort to address State and local worries while \nstill keeping intact one of the key goals of S. 150: to keep Internet \naccess tax free from taxation.\n  I point in particular to our efforts to clarify that traditional \ntelephone services would not become tax-exempt as a result of this \nlegislation. Nor will this legislation prevent the States from imposing \nproperty, income, and other non-transactional taxes on Internet access \nproviders. Nor would this bill make tax-free any service packaged with \nInternet access solely by virtue of such bundling. In addition, in \norder to give currently grandfathered States a reasonable amount of \ntime to adjust their budgets, the bill extends the existing \ngrandfathering provision by 3 years instead of terminating it \nimmediately.\n  I also am aware that some of my colleagues object to the Internet tax \nmoratorium because they believe that Congress has no role in how States \nand localities tax Internet access. I respect the views of those \nMembers, but I also respectfully disagree with them on this matter. \nInterstate communications--including the Internet--are part and parcel \nof interstate commerce, which Congress has the constitutional right to \nregulate. This means that Congress does indeed have the right to \ndetermine how the Federal Government, the States, and localities tax \nthe Internet.\n\n  There is also the argument that this extension is an unfunded \nmandate. On this point, it is important to note that this bill would \nnot impose any additional responsibilities on State or local \ngovernments. Rather, S. 150 only says that States and localities may \nnot impose taxes on Internet access. That's it. Furthermore, Congress \nmade sure that ITFA held the Federal Government to the same standards \nas those imposed on the States. The act expresses the sense of Congress \nthat no new Federal taxes on Internet access should be enacted. The \nFederal Government is in this with the States and localities because \nkeeping Internet access tax-free is a core goal of our national \neconomic policy.\n  With respect to the question of whether it's wise to make Internet \naccess tax free, this body has a long history of giving tax incentives \nto commercial activities that we believe help our society. The Internet \nis a technology that is a source of and vehicle for significant \neconomic benefits. The proponents of this legislation strongly believe \nthe Internet clearly merits the tax incentives provided by S. 150. But \nthis debate is not just about economic benefits.\n  During my presidential candidacy, one of the many rewarding \nexperiences I had was seeing how the Internet served as a medium for \npolitical participation. Hundreds of thousands of people logged on to \nmay campaign website where they were able to access information and \norganize. For me, keeping Internet access tax-free is about protecting \nconsumers' wallets, but it also is about improving our political \nprocess and the right and ability of those citizens to participate \nfully in that process.\n\n[[Page S14159]]\n\n  I recognize that there are others who wish to continue to make the \nInternet tax moratorium temporary. Their premise is that Internet \ntechnologies continue to evolve and thus Internet access may develop \ninto a service the States and localities would wish to tax. I would \nrespond that this moratorium should be permanent to continue \nencouraging those very Internet-related innovations. By making this \nmoratorium permanent, the businesses that invest in and provide \nInternet access technologies will be able to operate in a predictable \ntax environment. This will result in continued investment in this very \nimportant medium.\n  I will be very candid on this point, though: If a permanent \nmoratorium passes and 3, 4, 5 years down the road we find that the \neffects of this moratorium were other than what we intend today, I will \njoin my colleagues in reviewing this issue and work to amend the \nlegislation to correct any unforeseen problems with it. But that should \nonly happen if and when there is a legitimate problem. That doesn't \nneed to happen, and it shouldn't have to happen, on a predetermined \nschedule.\n  Today, however, we are here to vote on a bill that enjoys strong bi-\npartisan support--further evidence of the fact that this Senate \nbelieves in a permanent extension of the moratorium and the consumer \nand business benefits such an extension will bring. Likewise, H.r. 49, \nthe Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which is similar to S. 150, \nalso enjoyed significant support in the House of Representatives. \nIndeed, the House passed H.R. 49 in September with strong bipartisan \nsupport, including support from the House leadership of both parties.\n\n  S. 150 has been thoroughly vetted and considerably negotiated. It was \napproved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation in July after the committee held hearings on the bill. \nIn October, the Senate Committee on Finance discharged S. 150 after \nthat committee examined the bill. Throughout this legislative process, \nthe various stakeholders have met several times to try to come as close \nto a middle ground as possible without sacrificing the basic goals of \nthis legislation. I believe that this bill is a strong attempt to \naddress the concerns and needs of all the relevant stakeholders.\n  For all of the reasons stated, I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill and add it to the long line of pro-consumer legislation we have \npassed this year--including the Do Not Call Registry and spam \nlegislation. Let us again join together to give American consumers \naffordable access to the Internet, a crucial medium of communications, \ninformation, commerce, and political participation.\n  I look forward to hearing the debate and discussion by my colleagues \non both sides of the issue. We hope to have an amendment proposed by \nthe Senators from Delaware, Ohio, and Tennessee, and we would like to \ndebate that. Others would like to speak on that amendment, so we will \nnot have a time certain set for that amendment. But we hope we can have \nit at a fairly early time in the morning. My understanding is we will \nbe back in at 9:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator McCain, for beginning the discussion in the kind of \ntone I think we want to have for this debate. We have on the floor a \nnumber of Senators who have been the most interested in this issue. I \ntell them I think they represent the most thoughtful people not just in \nthe Senate but in public life. We obviously have differences of \nopinion, but I think we are going to have an important debate, in a \nthoughtful fashion. The decibel level has certainly gotten pretty high \nin recent days on this issue.\n  I am very appreciative to the Senate Democrats who are supportive of \nthe position Senator Allen and I have put together, particularly \nSenators Leahy, Boxer, Lincoln, and Baucus, all of whom joined as \noriginal sponsors of the managers' effort.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes tonight--I know other colleagues are \nanxious to talk--to describe how we got to this point and why I believe \nthe approach Senator Allen and I are taking is a wise one.\n  About 7 years ago, after I came to the Senate, I began to think about \nhow the Senate could write the rules of electronic commerce so as to be \nfair to all sides while at the same time allowing this tremendously \nexciting medium, the Internet, to flourish.\n  We were seeing early on problems with respect to how the Internet was \nregulated around the country. We saw discrimination. We saw in some \njurisdictions, for example, if you bought the newspaper the traditional \nway, the snail-mail route, you would end up not paying a tax, but if \nyou bought the online edition of that paper, you would pay a tax. That, \nit seemed to us, was a discrimination against technology. So about 7 \nyears ago, I said the bedrock of our effort ought to be technological \nneutrality. The Internet should not get a preference, nor should the \nInternet be discriminated against.\n  I went to Senator McCain and Senator Leahy of Vermont, really known \nas the Senate's Mr. Internet. He was up on these issues when I think a \nlot of people thought a monitor was a television set. The two of them \njoined me in a bipartisan effort to pass this law that has now been on \nthe books for more than 5 years.\n  When Senator Allen came to the Senate, he and I teamed up for a \nnumber of years on this issue, and, of course, other Senators who have \ncome to this body.\n  I say in beginning the debate, many of those who now oppose the \nextension of the law we are proposing are using the very same arguments \nthey made 5 years ago that have not been borne out. For example, we \nwere told years ago that the States would not be able to collect \nvarious taxes--property taxes, corporate taxes, and other kinds of \ntaxes. We were told that all across America, Main Streets would shrivel \nup and die because of Internet sales. We were told that States would \nlose an enormous amount of revenue. I want to respond to each one of \nthose arguments tonight.\n  First, with respect to loss of revenue, not one jurisdiction has come \nforward and given an example of how they are hurt by their inability to \ndiscriminate against electronic commerce. All the bill says is you \ncannot discriminate against electronic commerce, and not one State has \ncome forward and given an example of how they have been hurt by their \ninability to discriminate against electronic commerce.\n  Not one independent study has been done in the last 5 years \nindicating that the States would lose revenue as a result of this bill.\n  Finally, with respect to this question of Main Street and the retail \nstores, what we have seen is during the period this law has been in \neffect, Internet sales have gone from 1 percent to 2 percent. I think \nit is fair to say our legislation has not exactly emptied the malls of \nAmerica. In fact, in most of our malls, it is still pretty hard to find \na parking spot.\n  As we go at this issue, it is important to look at the record, and \nparticularly it is interesting to note it in the context of what was \ndiscussed tonight.\n  I have noted that a number of our colleagues, particularly from the \nrural areas--the Dakotas and other areas--have talked about the \nimportance--and I share their view--of building the network out; of \nusing funds, whether it be tax credits or Government moneys, to \nfacilitate broadband to rural areas. Their effort is one that I \nsupport. But think about the consequences of our saying tonight on the \nfloor of the Senate: Let's use Government dollars to help companies \nbuild out the network, promote broadband in rural areas. We will say \nthat tonight, but tomorrow we will end up sticking it to consumers with \nnew taxes with respect to Internet access.\n\n  In effect, the policies we are talking about promoting tonight with \nGovernment dollars--and many Senators are on legislation to offer tax \ncredits to promote broadband to rural areas which would, in effect, be \nnegated by the effort some are offering to allow for these taxes on \nInternet access.\n  Senator Allen and I have spent many months trying to work with the \nState and local governments to address their concerns. We have had \nmonths of negotiations, and those negotiations all went on before our \ndistinguished colleagues--the Senators from Tennessee, Ohio, and \nDelaware--came into the debate.\n\n[[Page S14160]]\n\n  I note that in the effort to try to find common ground, Senator Allen \nand I agreed to a number of requests that were made by State and local \nofficials. We agreed, for example, to the request from State and local \nofficials for new statutory language further tightening the definition \nof ``Internet access.''\n  We agreed to the request for new statutory language on what is called \nbundling, which is, in effect, where you have Internet access bundled \nwith information technology services other than Internet access, and it \nis important to separate the two for taxable purposes.\n  In addition, we agreed to the requests from State and local officials \nfor new statutory language protecting a variety of other taxes, such as \nproperty and income taxes, that were never affected by the original \nlegislation we authored, but we thought in the name of trying to find \ncommon ground, we would add that as well.\n  We have agreed to a request for a savings clause on universal service \nand a variety of regulatory proceedings.\n  Finally, we have agreed to allow States grandfathered so as to \nprotect existing treatment under their State laws of these services 3 \nmore years of Internet access taxes.\n  I say as we begin tonight, Senator Allen and I in 2 months of \nnegotiations agreed to five requests from State and local officials to \ntry to find common ground on this matter, and I ask tonight, what has \nbeen offered in return? What have been offered in return are \nessentially these projections that say vast sums are going to be lost \nto the States if this legislation that Senator Allen and I have \nproposed is extended.\n  I just ask Senators to note the language associated with these \nprojections. The language is always, this bill could cost such-and-\nsuch; and the sum is, of course, a very large number. Never is it \npresented in terms of any kind of independent study that this law has, \nin fact, cost revenue or would cause revenue to be lost in the future.\n  After Senator Allen and I made these five separate concessions in an \neffort to find common ground, we now have these various projections \nthat, for all practical purposes, we are trying to convince the Senate \nthat Western civilization is going to end if we urge that this law be \nupdated.\n  I know colleagues are anxious to talk, and I certainly want to give \nthem that opportunity. I close with one last point as we begin this \ndiscussion.\n  I think colleagues know the technology sector has taken a real \npounding in the last couple of years, but what we have seen in the last \nfew months is that the technology sector is beginning to have a \nresurgence. We have begun to see, both with respect to the stock market \nand capital investment in the sector, the technology area is really \nbeginning to come back.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, I think that if, in fact, the \nSenate unravels the law of the last 5 years, fails to allow us to \nupdate this law, the progress that has been seen in the technology \nsector in the last few months could well unravel.\n  If, in fact, the more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in this country \nare allowed to take a bite out of the Internet, and we have the \nInternet access area broken down into its subparts and all of them are \ntaxed, I think that could derail the very impressive progress we have \nseen in the technology sector in the last few months.\n  Let us not put in place a regime of multiple and discriminatory taxes \non electronic commerce, if for no other reason than it would send a \nhorrendous message to this sector where finally in the last few months \nwe are beginning to see some resurgence.\n  I see my good friend from Virginia on his feet. I want to tell him \nhow much I appreciate his cooperation. When I began this effort, he was \na Governor and was supportive of our efforts then. I am pleased to have \nhad a chance to team up with him as a member of the Commerce Committee.\n  I also say, because we have Senators who do not share the view of \nSenator Allen and myself--Senator Voinovich, Senator Alexander, and \nSenator Carper--that my door continues to be open to all Senators, \nincluding Senators who do not share our view, in an effort to try to \nfind common ground.\n  Senator Allen and I thought the five concessions we made during 8 \nweeks of negotiations were part of an effort to be sensitive to the \nconcerns of State and local bodies. Obviously, we have not done that to \nthe satisfaction of all and our door remains open to all Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a unanimous \nconsent request? In fact, I have two of them.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2559\n\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate it very much. It will just take a few minutes. \nI have two unanimous consent requests. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 2559, the \nMilitary Construction appropriations bill; that the conference report \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I would simply say that is unfortunate. This is a military \nconstruction conference report. I cannot believe there is any \ncontroversy on that. I appreciate my friend yielding to me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14160-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14160-S14171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1828\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order entered with respect to H.R. \n1828, the Syria Accountability Act, be changed to reflect that the time \nfor consideration of the measure be reduced to 60 minutes--the original \ntime was 90 minutes--that the time be divided as follows: 30 minutes \nfor Senator Specter and 15 minutes each under the control of Senators \nLugar or Boxer or their designees; that at 9 a.m., Friday, November 7, \nthe Senate then proceed to consider the measure under the limitations \nas provided under the previous order as modified above, with the \nremaining provisions remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will speak at more length at a later time on \nwhy I think it was important that these unanimous consents be approved \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to ask my colleagues to \nsupport S. 150, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, and the \nsubstitute or managers' amendment that has recently been adopted.\n  I thank our chairman of the Commerce Committee, John McCain, our \ncommodore, on his great navigational skills as we worked through this \nmeasure. I also thank my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, for his \ngreat leadership, assistance, and true partnership in trying to get \nthis measure through for greater opportunity for Americans.\n  I also thank others who are on this amendment, Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Sununu, Leahy, Baucus, Boxer, Lincoln, Smith, the high-tech task \nforce chairman, Senator John Ensign, Senator Warner of Virginia, \nSenator Burns, who is chairman of the Internet Caucus, and the Senator \nwho is in the chair right now, Mr. Chambliss. All have helped work on \nthis reasonable compromise.\n  There have been a number of concerns to this measure raised by our \nopponents. We have had several months of negotiations. I am confident \nthe bill as it is presented to us on the Senate floor strikes an \nappropriate balance between protecting every American from harmful \nregressive taxes on Internet access while ensuring that necessary \nprotections are in place for State and local governments to maintain \ntheir existing revenue base.\n  The fundamental principle driving this legislation is very simple and \nclear, and that is the Internet must remain as accessible as possible \nto all people in all parts of America forever. This was a principle \nestablished in the 1998 legislation when Congress passed the Internet \nTax Freedom Act and it is the principle I ask all Senators to keep\n\n[[Page S14161]]\n\nin mind as we consider this legislation this evening and tomorrow.\n  My colleagues have heard me say on many occasions that I believe we \nought to be promoting freedom and opportunities for all Americans. We \nneed to be advancing ideas, concepts, and policies that help create \nmore jobs and prosperity rather than more taxes and burdens.\n  The Internet itself is one of our country's greatest tools and \nsymbols of innovation and individual empowerment. In my view, the \nInternet is the greatest invention for the dissemination of ideas and \nthoughts since the Gutenberg press. When Martin Luther nailed his 95 \ntheses to the church at Wittenberg, if it were not for the Gutenberg \npress no one would have read those documents and those thoughts.\n  So today, we have the Internet for the dissemination of ideas. It is \nan individualized empowerment zone where individuals are able to access \ninformation, communicate, get knowledge, information, as well as engage \nin commerce. It is a tool for education. It is a tool for information \nand commerce. And when we are looking at that, I ask, why would there \nbe some who would want to burden that? I think we ought to be trusting \nfree people and free enterprise. We ought to be on the side of freedom, \nbecause that is what has allowed the Internet to flourish, rather than \nthe side of those who would want to make this advancement in technology \neasier to tax for tax collectors.\n  Some people ask, why is the Federal Government involved in this? \nWell, heck, if there is anything that is in interstate commerce by its \narchitecture, by its design, by its structure, it is the Internet. One \nof the great things about the Internet is that it is not confined to \nboundaries of States or even countries for that matter. For those of us \nwho thought opening up to China was a question that we needed to \nbroach, I thought the fact that the Internet was available and to the \nextent that the Chinese people could get more ideas from outside of \nChina and not filtered through their government, that was a reason to \nhopefully open up China for greater prosperity and freedom.\n\n  This legislation provides and promotes equal access to the Internet \nfor all Americans. It obviously is designed to protect Americans from \nharmful and regressive taxes on Internet access services, as well as \npreventing duplicative and predatory taxes on Internet transactions. \nSpecifically, as this measure is before us now, it does several things.\n  First, it extends permanently the current Federal prohibition of \nState and local taxation of Internet access service.\n  Second, it makes permanent the ban on all multiple and discriminatory \ntaxes relating to electronic commerce. It ensures that several \njurisdictions, for example, cannot tax the same transaction simply \nbecause the transaction happens to occur over the Internet.\n  Third, our legislation repeals the so-called grandfathering provision \nover a 3-year period.\n  Fourth, we make clear the original intent of the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct by updating the definition of Internet access to ensure that the \nmoratorium applies consistently to all consumers.\n  If we are going to exempt Internet access services from taxation \npermanently, then I believe it makes sense to do so in a manner that \napplies to all methods of Internet access, regardless of how a consumer \nchooses to access the Internet, whether by digital subscriber line, \notherwise known as DSL connections, by wireless connection, cable modem \nservice, satellite, or dial-up service.\n  Fifth, and lastly, this legislation makes very clear that nothing in \nthis measure prevents the collection or remittance of State and Federal \nuniversal service fees. The Internet tax moratorium that has been in \nplace for 5 years has contributed to the extending of Internet access \nto over 127 million citizens, about 45 percent of the population of \nAmerica. Unfortunately, that did expire Friday. Every day that it \nlapses, there is the opportunity for consumers to be susceptible to \npestering new taxes on Internet access services as well as taxes on e-\nmail, instant messages, spam filters, and even Web searches. For every \ndollar in taxation added to the cost of Internet access, we can expect \nto see the loss of utilization of the Internet by thousands of American \nfamilies, especially lower income families.\n\n  According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 30 percent \nof non-internet users say cost is a major reason they remain offline. \nAdditionally, another 43 percent of non-internet users agreed with the \nstatement that the Internet is too expensive.\n  So, for about half the country who are still not on line, keeping \naccess affordable is vital, and that means keeping access free from \nState, local, and Federal taxation. The guiding principle is clear, of \ncourse: To keep it accessible to all people in all parts of the country \nforever. This is the position I have held since 1997, since my days as \nGovernor in Virginia when I was one of only four Governors with this \nposition.\n  I cannot ever envision a time where we believe it desirable for any \ngovernment, State, local, or Federal, to tax access to the Internet. I \ncannot envision any time in our future where it will make sense to have \nmultiple taxes on the Internet. Nor can I imagine any time in the \nfuture where there ought to be discriminatory taxes or predatory taxes \non the Internet.\n  Yet if the Senate fails to take action or vote for this legislation, \nsuch Members of this body will be permitting and in effect advocating \ntaxing the Internet.\n  There are more people empowered by the Internet today because the \nFederal policy of the United States has consciously allowed Internet \ninnovators, investors, entrepreneurs, and consumers to remain free from \nonerous taxation of access to the Internet.\n  As many of you know, when this was first enacted there were dozens of \nStates and local taxing commissars who were, back then, right in the \nbeginning, imposing disparate taxes on a consumer's ability to surf the \nInternet. Since the last expiration of the Internet Tax Freedom Act in \n2001, some States have begun taxing the high-speed component of \nbroadband Internet access services. They are asserting that certain \nportions of high-speed broadband Internet access are telecommunications \nservices rather than Internet access and the States are thereby \ncircumventing the original intentions of the law.\n  Working with Chairman McCain and Senator Wyden and Senator Sununu in \nthe Commerce Committee, we updated the definition of Internet access to \nassure that all access services, regardless of the technology used to \ndeliver the service, are covered by the moratorium and therefore exempt \nfrom State and local taxation.\n  There have been some misleading statements, some clever hyperbole, \nand some statements that are just flat-out wrong. I want to set the \nrecord straight.\n  They have raised a number of concerns, the proponents of higher \ntaxes, with this legislation, indicating that we have expanded the \nmoratorium on Internet access to include all telecommunications \nservices making tax free even traditional services like local and long \ndistance telephone communications.\n  They have also raised a question of whether or not this bill would \nprohibit States from imposing property taxes, income taxes, or \ncorporate taxes on telecommunications carriers and Internet service \nproviders.\n  I want Members of this body to understand and be clear on the facts \nand the truth about this legislation. This bill does not affect \ntraditional voice or long distance telephone services or any other \ncommunications service that is not directly used to provide Internet \naccess. This bill, S. 150, does not affect a State's ability to collect \nincome taxes, property taxes, or other corporate taxes, such as \nfranchising fees, that are unrelated to Internet access.\n  The facts are, S. 150 does not unnecessarily expand the moratorium on \nInternet access; rather, the legislation clarifies and updates the \noriginal intentions of the Internet Tax Freedom Act to include high-\nspeed Internet access services. Only because some States and localities \nhave attempted, and in fact are circumventing the original law by \ntaxing portions of high-speed Internet access, did the definition of \nInternet access need to be updated.\n  The impact of broadband and efforts to stop broadband from being \ndeployed by this taxing approach that is going\n\n[[Page S14162]]\n\non, that we are trying to cure, will have a very significant impact on \nsmall towns and rural areas. Our colleague, Conrad Burns of Montana, \nlikes to talk about how you have to get broadband out in the country, \nand he would say there is a lot of dirt you have to dig through just to \nget from one light bulb to another. The same applies to getting \nbroadband out into the communities and out into the country. If you \nhave higher costs imposed on Internet access and then on top of it all \nyou are putting higher costs on the investment for the transport, that \nmeans fewer people in a less populated area will be able to afford \nbroadband, thereby denying them opportunities that one would have, \nwhether it is for information, for education, for knowledge, or for \ncommerce, for small businesses and people who live in rural areas.\n  Another fact: In this bill it only makes permanent the tax moratorium \non Internet access services, which is simply the ability to get access \nto the Internet. Once a consumer has accessed the Internet, the \nmoratorium does not affect the services that are purchased, used, or \nsold over the Internet that would otherwise be taxable, even if such \nservices are bundled together with Internet access services.\n  So, in summary, the fact is, by allowing this moratorium to expire, \nthe Senate has opened the door for States and localities to begin \nimposing regressive taxes on Internet access services. By taxing \nInternet access, States and localities are actually contributing, and \nwould be contributing, to the economic digital divide. The more \nexpensive we allow the State and local tax commissars to make Internet \naccess, the less likely people are going to be able to buy these \nadvanced services, such as high-speed broadband connections, Internet \nprotocol software, wireless or WiFi devices, and many other multimedia \napplications.\n  At a time when technology, as my friend Senator Wyden has said, and \nthe Internet are growing and improving almost every aspect of our daily \nlives, where access to the Internet is not a nicety but a necessity for \nAmericans, imposing new taxes on access or levying taxes that \ndiscriminate against the Internet as a form of commerce will never be \nsound policy for America. As a tool, the Internet breaks down economic \nand educational barriers, leveling the playing field for millions of \nAmericans.\n  There are those who say it shouldn't be permanent; let's make it \nshorter. When you talk to business investors--and let's go back to \nrural and small town areas. When someone is making a business \ninvestment they want to have some credibility and stability and \npredictability as to making these millions of dollars of investment to \nget into a smaller market. What is going to be our rate of return? When \nare we going to recoup the tens of millions of dollars it takes to get \ninto these areas?\n\n  We just heard an argument on the Agriculture bill about loans to get \nbroadband. It is a lifeline for folks out in the country, in rural \nareas. There are all sorts of incentives that people are for.\n  Businesses making those investments have to figure out when are they \ngoing to get a return on the investment. If you tax a transport or make \nit for a short duration of time, they are going to say: Gosh, there are \ngoing to be taxes on it in a few years so there will be fewer \ncustomers. We just can't risk that investment to get out into those \nareas.\n  So, more than ever, I really do believe we ought to listen to good, \nsound business reasoning, common sense and logic. In fact, most \neconomists and technology experts agree that we need to be encouraging \nthe deployment of the next generation broadband Internet connections \nand bring our communications infrastructure into the 21st century.\n  Economists at the Brookings Institution estimate that widespread \nhigh-speed broadband access would increase our national gross domestic \nproduct by $500 billion annually by 2006.\n  Failure to pass this legislation with a permanent moratorium and with \nan updated and clear definition of Internet access like the one this \namendment provides, will leave broadband Internet access susceptible \nand open to harmful taxation. In many States and localities, those \ntaxes could go up as high as 25 percent.\n  Any additional tax burdens on the Internet will mean additional costs \nmany Americans cannot afford, forcing the poor in our society to reduce \nor even forego their use of the Internet as a tool for exploration, \ninformation, education, and individual opportunity.\n  More than ever before, when our economy is finally moving forward in \nthe right direction, the people of this country need security with \nregard to their financial future. Businesses need certainty that prices \nfor Internet access will remain affordable to consumers if they are \nexpected to build out high-speed networks to rural and small-town \ncommunities. In a society, indeed a world, where the quality of life \nand economic power is directly proportionate to one's access to \nknowledge, we must close the economic digital divide rather than \nexacerbate it with State and local taxes.\n  I call on my colleagues to join with the chairman, our commodore, \nSenator McCain, Senator Wyden, and all of us in supporting the Internet \nTax Nondiscrimination Act and permanently extending the Internet \nmoratorium on tax access and multiple and discriminatory taxes. As we \nvote on amendments to what would be this Internet access tax issue--and \nthere will be amendments--I respectfully ask my colleagues as we look \nat these amendments to be leaders who stand strong for freedom and \nopportunity for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, like my friend from Virginia, I am a \nformer Governor, as were Senator Alexander, Senator Graham, and Senator \nVoinovich. We served as chief executives of our States. I loved being \nGovernor. I have never talked to anybody who didn't like the job. As a \nmatter of fact, I enjoy being here and working with my friends John \nMcCain, Ron Wyden, and others.\n  When I was privileged to be Governor of Delaware, we actually cut \ntaxes 7 out of 8 years. We also balanced our budget 8 years in a row. \nAmong the things I didn't like as Governor was when the Federal \nGovernment came in and tried to tell us in Delaware we had to spend \nmoney for some purpose but never provided the revenues to pay for that \nexpenditure. Similarly, I never liked it when the Federal Government \ncame in and unilaterally reduced our revenue base for programs we \nneeded in our State to educate our kids, to provide health care, child \ncare, environmental protection, and transportation. I never liked it \nwhen the Federal Government came in and tried to undercut our ability \nto raise revenues for those purposes and never provided an offset to \nmake up the difference in the revenue that was taken away by the \nFederal action.\n  I remember as Governor coming here and testifying in the early to mid \n1990s. I believe Governor Voinovich did as well. We called on the \nFederal Government to stop placing unfunded mandates on State and local \ngovernments. The message is pretty simple. Don't tell us to spend money \nfor things and expect us to use our revenues. Don't come in and \nrestrict our ability to collect revenues without providing something to \nmake up for it. Our voices were heard. In 1995, legislation was adopted \nto stop unfunded mandates and dictates by the Federal Government which \nhad an adverse effect on my State and other States.\n\n  I believe--correct me if I am wrong--that 91 Senators voted in 1995 \nfor the unfunded mandates bill. Sixty-three of the 91 Senators who \nvoted for that bill in 1995 are still here in the Senate.\n  In 1998, when Congress adopted an Internet tax moratorium, it was in \nessence on an unfunded mandate. The Congress agreed to restrict the \nability of State and local governments to raise revenues in three \nareas. The moratorium which was adopted in 1998 said State and local \ngovernments could not tax access to the Internet. For the monthly bills \nwe receive from AOL and other Internet providers, State and local \ngovernments cannot add a tax to that Internet access bill.\n  Similarly, if there was an Internet transaction multiple States would \nlike to tax or multiple counties within a State would like to tax, \nthose multiple taxes were essentially stopped by the 1998 moratorium.\n  Thirdly, discriminatory taxes against transactions over the Internet \nwere banned as well. For example, we don't\n\n[[Page S14163]]\n\nhave a sales tax in our State, but in my State you could, of course, \nbuy from a local merchant a good or a product and not pay a sales tax \nor tax of any kind. If any State were to pass a law that said if we \nwere to make the purchase of the same good over the Internet we would \nhave to pay a tax, that would be a discriminatory tax. That is not \npermitted under the 1998 Internet tax moratorium.\n  The Internet tax moratorium which was adopted 5 years ago was adopted \nin order to give Internet commerce a chance to grow and to mature. \nStates didn't like having their ability to raise revenues as they saw \nfit restricted by the Federal Government. But they excepted 11 States \nthat were actually doing that kind of thing, and their ability to raise \nrevenues was grandfathered in.\n  For the last 5 years--initially the Internet tax moratorium was for, \nI think, 2 or maybe 3 years--when it was about to expire, the question \nwas, should we renew it? I believe it was in 2001 when it was about to \nexpire that Congress renewed it for an additional 2 years. It did not \nbroaden the kind of three principal activities that were covered in the \ninitial moratorium that said the same three applied. State and local \ngovernments, unless they are grandfathered in, can't begin taxing \naccess to the Internet. State and local governments could not have \nmultiple taxes on the same transactions over the Internet. Further, \nthis ban on discriminatory taxes was upheld for another 2 years. Last \nFriday that 5-year ban expired, as I think most of us know. Certainly \nSenators Voinovich and Alexander and I would like to see the \nmoratorium, the ban, on the Internet tax access, multiple taxes, and \nthe ban on discriminatory taxes extended.\n  This is not an argument about taxes on access to the Internet. I \nthink we actually agree on that. There should not be taxes imposed by \nState and local governments unless they are already grandfathered in on \naccess to the Internet. That is not what this is all about. This is not \nabout whether or not we are going to tax anybody's e-mail. We are not \ngoing to do that. We are not interested in that. One of our colleagues, \nSenator Voinovich, will have more to say about that later. He may offer \na sense of the Senate to make it absolutely clear that nobody around \nhere is interested in taxing access to the Internet.\n  But as we look to nurture our economy and economic activity that is \ndriven in part by commerce over the Internet, let us remember there is \nanother set of voices that need to be heard. They are the voices of the \npeople who are running our State governments, the folks who are running \nour cities and our counties and trying to do so in an environment where \ntheir revenue base continues to diminish. Their responsibilities to \neducate our kids don't diminish. In fact, those responsibilities are \ngetting tougher as we impose academic standards and raise our \nexpectations in our schools. We need to provide some kind of health \ncare for people, young and old. Those needs are not diminishing. In \nfact, the burden through Medicaid on State and local governments, if \nanything, is increasing, not diminishing.\n\n  I was Governor during good times. I don't know if it was easy to be \nGovernor from 1992 to 2000, but it was a heck of a lot easier than \ntoday. Today, instead of dealing with budget surpluses and figuring out \nhow to invest or use the budget surpluses or how to cut taxes in order \nto return a portion of the surpluses, State and local governments are \nscraping for every dime to try to meet the needs of their States.\n  The question to consider today and tomorrow and perhaps next week is, \nWhat right do we have as a Federal legislature, as a Congress, to step \nin and mandate the reduction in the tax base, the revenue base, of \nState and local governments? What right do we have to do that? What \nright do we have to do that in the face of the Constitution? What right \ndo we have to do that in light of the legislation adopted in 1995 \nbanning unfunded mandates? We have heard from Governors and mayors from \nevery corner, county council men and women, commissioners, we heard \nfrom folks from every corner of this country saying, Abide by the law \nyou voted for in 1995 banning unfunded mandates.\n  I close with where I started. I have not talked to one Senator who \nsays he or she is for taxing access to the Internet. We are not. I have \nnot heard from any Senator, Democrat or Republican, from any part of \nthis country, who says they are for taxing any person's e-mails. We are \nnot. By the same token, my friends, I don't believe we should be for \nstepping in, beyond a very narrow moratorium on which we already spoke \nin those three areas, to broaden that moratorium to further undermine \nthe revenue base of our State and local governments, during very \ndifficult times for all of them, without giving that action in this \nproposal a whole lot more thought and debate and discussion. We will \nhave that opportunity today and tomorrow.\n  I say to Senator Voinovich, Senator Graham, Senator Alexander, and \nothers who have joined and will join in offering an amendment tomorrow, \nincluding Senator Hollings, Senator Stevens, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Lautenberg, and others, I am proud to join in this \ninitiative. It is possible in the end, I believe, to come up with a \npolicy that is fair to State and local governments and is fair to those \nwho would seek to expand our economy and to do so through Internet \ncommerce.\n  Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to vote on an amendment offered \nby Senator Alexander, Senator Graham, Senator Voinovich, and myself to \ndo just that. I look forward to further debate on that amendment and \nthe opportunity for an up-or-down vote on that amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware, my \ncolleague from the State of Tennessee, and my colleague from the State \nof Florida for standing up--all of us former Governors--to deal with a \nmatter that will have great impact on our respective citizens for many \nyears ahead. We want to make sure that whatever we do makes sense.\n  Before I begin, I would like to set the record straight that this \ndebate is about federalism, unfunded mandates, and protecting States' \nability to collect taxes. It has nothing to do with taxing e-mail.\n  I have made the issue of unfunded Federal mandates a top priority \nduring my 36 years of public service. At every level of government--as \na State representative, county auditor, county commissioner, lieutenant \ngovernor, mayor of the City of Cleveland, Governor of Ohio for 8 \nyears--I have seen firsthand how the relationship of the Federal \nGovernment with its State and local counterparts affects our citizens \nand the communities in which they live. My background has fueled my \npassion for the issue of federalism and the need to balance the Federal \nGovernment's power with powers that our Founding Fathers envisioned to \nthe States.\n  This very body was created, in part, to guarantee that States had \nadequate, equal means to assert their interest before the Federal \nGovernment. Our forefathers provided that each State has two Senators \nto protect States rights and federalism, and prior to 1913 those \nSenators were elected by their legislatures to guarantee that they \nwould protect federalism. I believe strongly that the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and State and local governments should \nbe one of partnership. That is why I vowed when I was elected to the \nSenate, I would work to find ways in which the Federal Government can \nimprove the way it works with these levels of government to serve the \nAmerican people.\n  I have also been concerned about the tendency of the Federal \nGovernment to preempt the functions of State and local governments and \nforce on them new responsibilities, particularly without also providing \nthe funding to pay for these new responsibilities.\n  Seventeen years ago, in 1986, I spoke to the Volunteers of the \nNational Archives regarding the relationship of the Constitution to \nAmerica's cities and the revolution of federalism. I brought to the \nattention of the audience my observation, since my early days in \ngovernment, regarding the course American government has been taking:\n\n       We have seen the expansion of the federal government into \n     new, non-traditional domestic policy areas. We have \n     experienced a\n\n[[Page S14164]]\n\n     tremendous increase in the proclivity of Washington both to \n     preempt state and local authority and to mandate actions on \n     state and local governments. The cumulative effect of a \n     series of actions by the Congress, the Executive Branch and \n     the U.S. Supreme Court have caused some legal scholars to \n     observe that while constitutional federalism is alive in \n     scholarly treatises, it has expired as a practical political \n     reality.\n\n  In 1991, I started a long crusade when I became a member of the \nNational Governors Association, working with the State and Local \nGovernment Coalition to do something about unfunded mandates. In fact, \nas Governor of Ohio, I requested that a study be done to examine \nunfunded mandates. It was the first of its kind in any State. It \ncaptured just how bad the mandate problem was in real dollars. Between \n1992 and 1995, Ohio had unfunded mandates of almost $2 billion. These \nefforts were strongly supported by Senator Kempthorne, Senator Roth, \nSenator Glenn, Congressmen Robert Portman, Tom Davis, and Bill Clinger \nand culminated with the passage of the unfunded mandates legislation in \nthe Senate on March 15, 1995.\n  As a matter of fact, for the first time in my life I set foot in the \nSenate when the Senate passed that Unfunded Mandate Relief Act. I was \nin the Rose Garden representing State and local government when \nPresident Clinton signed the legislation on March 22, 1995. In fact, I \nhave that pen proudly displayed in my Senate office.\n  This milestone concluded a lengthy and coordinated effort by State \nand local government officials and their congressional allies to reduce \nthe economic burden of Federal unfunded mandates and the adverse impact \nthey have on State and local services.\n\n  By the way, this was the second plank in the Contract With America \nthat was developed in 1994. I will never forget when we were in \nWilliamsburg and committed ourselves to the Contract With America. The \nSenator from Virginia was present at that time in the capacity of \nGovernor of Virginia.\n  I believed then and I believe today that mandates forced us to cut \nvital services and cut taxes. Mandates also rob our citizens and \nelected officials of perhaps the most fundamental responsibility of \ngovernment, prioritizing government services. The Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act does not prohibit unfunded mandates, but it does slow down \nthe process of enacting a mandate and forces each Senator and House \nMember to go on record that we want to mandate or prevent action by \nState or local governments without providing the resources with which \nto pay for it. It ensures that Congress is informed and accountable \nwhen considering an unfunded mandate for pending legislation. The law \nwas designed specifically to ensure an up-or-down vote on whether to \nimpose a mandate.\n  The mandate we are debating is exactly what the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act was designed to address. This is the first time this Act has \nbeen used on the Senate floor since it was enacted in 1995. When this \nlegislation passed the Senate in March of 1995, the vote was an \noverwhelming 91-to-9 vote. Of the 91 Senators supporting the bill, 50 \nare still here today, and of the 9 nays, 7 Senators are still in \noffice. In addition, 14 Members of the House--voting in favor of \nunfunded mandates reform--have moved over to the Senate. So we have 64 \nSenators today who voted for this bill in 1995 in their respective \nChambers.\n  The bill currently under consideration, the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act of 2003, sponsored by my good friend from \nVirginia, Senator Allen, and Senator Wyden and Senator McCain, has \nincluded unfunded mandates by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  In fact, I want to quote from the Commerce Committee's report dated \nSeptember 29, 2003, in which CBO said:\n\n       By extending and expanding the moratorium on certain types \n     of state and local taxes, S. 150 would impose an \n     intergovernmental mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act. CBO estimates that the mandate would cause state \n     and local governments to lose revenue beginning in October \n     2006; those losses would exceed the threshold established in \n     [the unfunded mandates relief legislation]. While there is \n     some uncertainty about the number of states affected, CBO \n     estimates that the direct costs to states and local \n     governments would probably total between $80 and $120 million \n     annually. . . .\n\n  Furthermore, they went on to say:\n\n       Depending on how the language altering the definition of \n     what telecommunications services are taxable is interpreted, \n     that language also could result in substantial revenue losses \n     for states and local governments. It is possible that states \n     could lose revenue if services that are currently taxed are \n     redefined as Internet access under the definition of S. 150.\n\n  Finally, the report states that CBO cannot estimate the magnitude of \nthese losses.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate, CBO said: Depending on how the \ndefinition is interpreted, the loss of revenue to the States and local \ngovernments could be substantial.\n  If CBO cannot calculate the potential loss of revenue to the States, \nwhy in the world would we change the definition of Internet access? And \nwhy in the world would we make the new definition permanent?\n  Even FCC Commissioner Michael Powell said the telecommunications \nindustry is in flux and that few industry experts could agree on a \ndefinition in view of the rapid changes in technology.\n  Senator Wyden, in his presentation earlier this evening, made the \nallegation that no State will lose money under this proposal. We asked \nthe National Governors Association to contact the tax commissioners \nfrom various States and here are some of the findings: Kentucky will \nlose $265 million; Iowa, $45 to $50 million; Maine, $35 million; \nMichigan, $360 million; New Jersey, $600 million; Ohio, $55 million; \nOklahoma, $159 million; Tennessee, $358 million; Utah, $92 million; \nWashington, $33 million.\n  That is a lot of money--a lot of money--and States will lose tax \nrevenue under this proposal.\n  In my own State, I spent a lot of time with our Ohio Tax \nCommissioners Office and the Office of Budget and Management. According \nto the Department of Taxation in Ohio, we will be losing about $700 \nmillion over our 2-year biannual budget period.\n  Last week, my staff was on a conference call with SBC Communications, \nBell South, Sprint, the Tennessee Revenue Director, and the Ohio Tax \nCommissioner's Office. The telecommunications companies did not dispute \nthe Ohio Tax Department's estimates.\n  So let's be honest about it. If this permanent moratorium goes \nthrough with the current definition, there is no question in the world \nthat States are going to lose money.\n  At the end of that conversation, by the way, the only thing we got \nout of it was that there was uncertainty, confusion, and speculation \nregarding what this all meant.\n  In addition, we are going to be losing $350 million, at least, as a \nresult of this proposal today.\n  If we pass S. 150, Congress will, in effect, force States to raise \ntaxes or cut services in order to make up the difference. In other \nwords, all 50 States will be forced to debate whether to raise taxes, \ncut services, or come to Congress for more money. Mr. President, unlike \nCongress, by law all states must balance their budgets. They don't have \nthe option of printing more money like the federal government.\n  States have to balance their budgets and if they don't spend within \ntheir means, they are forced to make a choice to either cut services or \nraise taxes. Of course, that is something we have not done. And I \nmention, that some of my colleagues say States are not fiscally \nresponsible. I would like to say that most of the States in the United \nStates of America are much more fiscally responsible than this body, in \nwhich we have increased spending and added to our burgeoning deficit.\n\n  Mr. President, the newspapers in Ohio get it. The Cincinnati \nEnquirer, one of the most conservative papers in Ohio, understands:\n\n       One reason governors, mayors and county officials oppose \n     expanding the Internet tax ban is that telecom companies are \n     racing as fast as they can to convert most services to the \n     Internet. If just about everything gets tax-exempt under a \n     broader ``Internet access'' definition, states and localities \n     would take a huge tax revenue hit.\n       The development of DSL, broadband and cable Internet \n     service were just the sort of new access technology that \n     Voinovich and others hoped would result from the tax \n     moratorium, but they don't want it expanded to kill existing \n     tax revenues.\n\n  The Akron Beacon-Journal also understands:\n\n\n[[Page S14165]]\n\n\n       In short, critical programs would be put in jeopardy, from \n     mental health care to public schools.\n\n  Even the Washington Post understands:\n\n       What's driving this legislation is that telecommunications \n     companies and Internet service providers see an opportunity \n     not only to make the tax moratorium permanent--in itself a \n     bad idea--but to save what could amount to billions in \n     additional taxes. The law frees service providers from having \n     to pay taxes on telephone service they use to provide \n     Internet access. And as the Internet becomes a more effective \n     medium for providing phone service and delivering products \n     such as downloaded movies, software and music, the \n     legislation could sweep such offerings within the ambit of \n     services that states are prohibited from taxing.\n       The Internet shouldn't be subject to conflicting taxes, but \n     that's no reason to argue that it shouldn't be taxed at all. \n     There should be a level playing field for taxing Internet \n     access, whether it comes through ordinary dial-up, cable \n     modems or high-speed telephone lines.\n       The last thing Congress should do now to cash-strapped \n     states is pass a law that would not only permanently put \n     Internet access off limits for taxation but also deprive them \n     of revenue that they now collect.\n\n  And they go on--I will finish the quote--\n\n       Proponents of the law are busy demagoguing the issue, \n     suggesting, as Senate sponsor Ron Wyden (D-OR) put it the \n     other day, that users ``could be taxed every time they read \n     their local newspaper online or check the score of a football \n     game.'' Congress should step back from the brink, temporarily \n     extend the moratorium and sort this all out in a way that \n     doesn't intrude on state prerogatives.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these articles be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, Oct. 31, 2003]\n\n                    Halloween Scare: Internet Taxes\n\n                             (By Tony Lang)\n\n       Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio has been boiled in a witches' \n     cauldron this week by critics angered that he helped block an \n     expanded ban of taxes on Internet services. The current \n     Internet Tax Moratorium, which he supports, expires Saturday.\n       Anti-tax groups making Voinovich out to be the devil \n     incarnate are roasting the wrong guy. Voinovich favors \n     keeping the tax moratorium on Internet access. He helped \n     negotiate the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1997, supported its \n     renewal in 2001 and opposes new taxes on telecommunication \n     services. And yes, he strongly opposes a tax on e-mail.\n       But he and other senators do object to new legislation \n     which would expand the definition of ``Internet access'' and \n     not only exempt some telecom services now taxed but also some \n     income, property and other business taxes. That legislative \n     change could cost state and local governments between $4 \n     billion and $8.75 billion a year by 2006, the Multistate Tax \n     Commission estimates. The Congressional Budget Office agrees \n     losses would be substantial.\n       Voinovich, a states-rights federalist, argues it would be \n     unconstitutional for the Federal government to abolish \n     existing State and local tax revenue streams. It also would \n     violate the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Relief Act, which then-\n     Gov. Voinovich lobbied for and U.S. Rep. Rob Portman of \n     Terrace Park sponsored. That law attempts to bar Congress \n     from imposing a mandate on states without paying for it.\n       One reason governors, mayors and county officials oppose \n     expanding the Internet tax ban is that telecom companies are \n     racing as fast as they can to convert most services to the \n     Internet. If just about everything gets tax-exempted under a \n     broader ``Internet access'' definition, States and localities \n     would take a huge tax revenue hit. The development of DSL \n     broadband and coaxial cable Internet service were just the \n     sort of new access technology that Voinovich and others hoped \n     would result from the tax moratorium, but they don't want it \n     expanded to kill existing tax revenues. The loss in Ohio \n     services is calculated at $450 million.\n       The world won't end tomorrow if the tax moratorium expires. \n     It lapsed for a month in 2001 before Congress extended it. \n     The House already passed a bill (H.R. 49) on Sept. 17 making \n     the Internet tax ban permanent. This week, Sens. Voinovich, \n     Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Ernest Hollings of South \n     Carolina, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Maria Cantwell \n     of Washington State put a legislative ``hold'' on S. 150, and \n     according to Senate rules of ``unanimous consent,'' it will \n     take some cutting and pasting before all agree to bring it to \n     a floor vote.\n       Ohio Gov. Bob Taft wrote to urge the Senate Finance \n     Committee to limit the tax ban to Internet access only. \n     Internet sales are a different matter. The Capitol Hill in-\n     fighting over taxing e-commerce is even more bloodcurdling, \n     and as rife with falsehoods. The tax ban doesn't mean the \n     Internet is a tax-free zone. But Internet sales, according to \n     the Department of Commerce, accounted for only 1.3 percent of \n     all retail sales in 2002. Still it's no wonder Lamar \n     Alexander is leery of sales tax bans. Tennessee has no State \n     income tax. Someday, States may settle on some simple point-\n     of-origin sales tax system for mail order, catalog and \n     Internet sales, but meantime Congress should keep its hands \n     off and limit itself to protecting interstate commerce and \n     lively tax competition between states.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Beacan Journal, Oct. 30, 2003]\n\n                           Responsible George\n\n       Sen. George Voinovich finds himself in a familiar position. \n     The Ohio Republican has angered many in his party. His \n     offense? He wants Congress to act responsibly. He has \n     correctly questioned aspects of legislation that would extend \n     the Internet Tax Freedom Act, the five-year-old moratorium on \n     State and local taxation of Internet services set to expire \n     on Saturday.\n       Voinovich isn't alone. Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee \n     Republican, has echoed his concerns. So have many Republican \n     governors, including Bob Taft of Ohio. They do not oppose the \n     ban. (Voinovich helped to negotiate the original moratorium.) \n     They recognize the need to encourage Web businesses. What \n     they find troubling is the breadth of the extension.\n       In September, the House approved legislation that would \n     make the ban permanent. The Senate is considering a similar \n     bill. Both would expand the definition of Internet services \n     to such an extent that State and local governments would risk \n     a substantial erosion of their tax base. Not surprisingly, \n     the revised definition was inserted in haste, more \n     ideologically driven that practical.\n       No surprise, either, that Voinovich, a former governor, \n     would spot the difficulty ahead. States collect taxes on \n     local and long-distance telephone services. \n     Telecommunications companies are increasingly looking to \n     ``bundle'' products, offering a collection of services, \n     including Internet access. The proposed extension would \n     permit the bundled items to be viewed as one product. Thus, \n     products that currently are taxed, such as a local phone \n     service, would be exempt.\n       The amount of revenue lost? Ohio would surrender an \n     estimated $350 million a year. The potential bleeding \n     explains why Bob Taft fired a letter to Charles Grassley of \n     Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The \n     governor stressed the ``devastating'' impact on States.\n       The Multistate Tax Commission (an association of State tax \n     directors) estimates the proposed extension would drain at \n     least $4 billion a year from all State treasuries and as much \n     as $8.75 billion by 2006. Again, these are funds States \n     already collect, and many States face a fiscal crunch as \n     severe as any in the past 50 years.\n       In short, critical programs would be put in jeopardy, from \n     mental health care to public schools.\n       George Voinovich certainly knows unfunded mandates. He has \n     long railed against the feds making demands and leaving \n     States to pick up the tab. In this instance, Congress would \n     tamper with established ways of States raising essential \n     revenue, leaving governors and State lawmakers to cover the \n     difference.\n       Better, the responsible argument goes, to extend the \n     current ban on taxing Internet services for a period of time, \n     allowing lawmakers to think harder about their next step.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 4, 2003]\n\n                             Tax and Click\n\n       State and local governments have broad power to tax as they \n     see fit--everything from clothes and food to electricity and \n     telephone service. Nearly everything, that is, except the \n     Internet. Under a supposedly temporary law passed in 1998 and \n     already extended once, Congress prohibited States from taxing \n     Internet access fees, the monthly charges imposed by Internet \n     service providers. Proponents argued that the nascent engine \n     of the Internet shouldn't be slowed by taxing it and that it \n     would take time to devise a system to prevent duplicative or \n     discriminatory taxes. Now, with the tax moratorium having \n     expired on Saturday, Congress is poised to make the ban \n     permanent, broaden its reach and wipe out existing taxes that \n     had been grandfathered in under the previous law. With State \n     budgets under stress and the Internet thriving, this is an \n     unnecessary--and costly--incursion on States' rights.\n       The argument for permanently barring taxes on Internet \n     services centers on two issues. One is the argument that \n     taxing Internet access, whether through phone lines or cable \n     modems, would amount to double taxation, because the phone \n     lines and cable service are already taxed. That's true, but \n     purchasing Internet access provides a separate--and \n     separately taxable--bundle of services. Terming this double \n     taxation is like saying that a shopper who pays tax on a pair \n     of slacks should then be exempt from being taxed on a shirt \n     bought with it.\n       The other argument is that taxing Internet access would \n     worsen and prolong the digital divide, the computer gap \n     between rich and poor. This may be a problem, but prohibiting \n     taxation is not the answer. It's not the extra few cents on a \n     monthly bill that's stopping the less well-off from Googling \n     their way to the middle class. A policy to erase the digital \n     divide, however laudable, doesn't justify the no-tax \n     solution. The federal government wants to spur home ownership \n     for low-income families--surely a bigger problem than lack of \n     Internet access--but that doesn't lead it to tell local \n     governments that they can't impose property taxes.\n\n[[Page S14166]]\n\n       What's driving this legislation is that telecommunications \n     companies and Internet service providers see an opportunity \n     not only to make the tax moratorium permanent--in itself a \n     bad idea--but to save what could amount to billions in \n     additional taxes. The law frees service providers from having \n     to pay taxes on telephone service they use to provide \n     Internet access. And as the Internet becomes a more effective \n     medium for providing phone service and delivering products \n     such as downloaded movies, software and music, the \n     legislation could sweep such offerings within the ambit of \n     services that states are prohibited from taxing.\n       The Internet shouldn't be subject to conflicting taxes, but \n     that's no reason to argue that it shouldn't be taxed at all. \n     There should be a level playing field for taxing Internet \n     access, whether it comes through ordinary dial-up, cable \n     modems or high-speed telephone lines. The last thing Congress \n     should do now to cash-strapped States is pass a law that \n     would not only permanently put Internet access off limits for \n     taxation but also deprive them of revenue that they now \n     collect. Proponents of the law are busy demagoguing the \n     issue, suggesting, as Senate sponsor Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) put \n     it the other day, that users ``could be taxed every time they \n     send an e-mail, every time they read their local newspaper \n     online or check the score of a football game.'' Congress \n     should step back from the brink, temporarily extend the \n     moratorium and sort this all out in a way that doesn't \n     intrude on State prerogatives.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I have made the point that I have \nstrong concerns with the pending legislation because it is an unfunded \nmandate. At the same time, I think it would be wrong for Congress to do \nnothing and allow taxes on Internet access.\n  As I have said emphatically, I am against taxes on e-mail and the \nInternet. It is no secret that my interest in the current moratorium \ndates back to my time as Governor. During my tenure as Governor, I was \nalso chairman of the National Governors Association. As chairman, I \nasked Governor Mike Leavitt to be the lead Governor on the Internet \neconomy and its effects on State government and federalism. The NGA \nefforts on this important topic led to the current moratorium on \nInternet taxes which was signed into law in 1998, and then again in \n2001.\n  Our goal then is the same as my goal today: to encourage the growth \nof the Internet as a driving force in our economy.\n  Let's look at the facts.\n  Under the original 3-year moratorium from 1998 to 2001, the Internet \nrapidly expanded to all corners of our country. The point I am trying \nto make is that with the current moratorium that we have, we have seen \nunbelievable expansion in the Internet. That is what we wanted to have. \nThat is why we put the moratorium in effect.\n  In February 2002, the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration at the Department of Commerce issued a report entitled \n``a Nation Online: How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the \nInternet.'' It is just unbelievable what has happened during that \nperiod of time. My point is, the Internet flourished in all segments of \nsociety during the original moratorium, and I think it is safe to \nassume that Internet usage continues to increase every day.\n  The question is, how do we continue to support the growth of the \nInternet and bring parity for all Internet service providers without \ncausing undue harm to our State and local governments that have been \nexperiencing serious budget shortfalls?\n  S. 150 would, for the first time since 1998, change the definition of \nInternet access and, without a clear understanding of the definition's \nimpact, rush to make it permanent.\n  The fact is, Internet technologies are changing more rapidly than \never. Companies are moving quickly to provide multiple services over a \nsingle line, including Internet access, voice communication, data \nservice, and entertainment service. It does not make sense to change \nand make permanent the definition of Internet access when the \ntechnologies and the different ways Internet services are being offered \nis changing so rapidly.\n  My colleagues, Senators Alexander, Graham, and Carper, and I will \nintroduce an amendment that simply keeps current law in place and \noffers language to level the playing field for DSL, wireless, cable, \nand satellite Internet services. Basically, what we are offering will \nbe a 2-year moratorium. We will amend the current definition of the \nInternet tax moratorium to preclude the taxing of DSL.\n  Many States today, under the grandfather clause of the tax \nmoratorium, have been collecting taxes on DSL. Several other States, \nbecause of a loophole in the definition, have started collecting taxes \non DSL connections. What we are proposing--and it is very fair--is that \nin consideration of this body extending this moratorium for only 2 \nyears, States such as Ohio and others that are now collecting Internet \ntaxes will give them up at the end of a 2-year period. This gives them \nadequate time to prepare, in terms of their budget, for the loss of the \nrevenues.\n  Clearly, the States are willing to give up taxes that they are now \ncollecting on the Internet in consideration of not going forward with a \npermanent moratorium with the definition that is now contained in the \nbill before us. In other words, the fear of what could happen under the \ndefinition of the bill that is before us today in the managers' \namendment is so large that they are saying: We will give up that money \njust so it lasts for 2 years. During this time, we can work on a \ndefinition that will make sense.\n  I believe that is a very fair proposal. It means we will be reducing \ntaxes on the Internet in many of our States that are now collecting \ntaxes.\n  Last but not least, on October 29, the Wall Street Journal wrote an \neditorial entitled ``Taxing Your E-Mail.'' The Journal claimed that a \nfew Republicans have decided to dress up as tax-and-spend Democrats for \nHalloween. The fact is, the Wall Street Journal article completely \nmisstated what we are trying to do here tonight. The reference to \ntaxing e-mail is nonsense.\n  In fact the Cincinnati Enquirer followed up the Wall Street Journal \nby saying on October 31, quote:\n\n       Anti-tax groups making Voinovich out to be the devil \n     incarnate are roasting the wrong guy. Voinovich favors \n     keeping the tax moratorium on Internet access. He helped \n     negotiate the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998, supported its \n     renewal in 2001 and opposes new taxes on telecommunication \n     services. And yes, he strongly opposes a tax on e-mail.\n\n  In fact, I am going to be introducing an amendment tomorrow that is a \nSense of the Senate to make it very clear that this is not about taxing \ne-mail. I think it is important my colleagues understand that. This is \nnot what this legislation is about.\n  I am hoping tomorrow we will have an opportunity to vote on this bill \nand this amendment. I hope my colleagues will be fair enough to \nunderstand how serious this matter is to the future of our States and \nto federalism. I hope we are successful tomorrow with our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, there have been some comments \nby my colleagues that the people who are concerned about this issue and \nwho are at risk are Governors, State legislators, mayors, county \ncommissioners, and other officials at the State and local level. I beg \nto disagree. The people who are at risk include that child who is in an \novercrowded classroom. The people who are at risk are those persons who \nhave suffered a heart attack and are waiting for the emergency medical \nservice to arrive. The people who are at risk include that woman whose \ncar is broken down on a dark highway and who is waiting for the State \ntrooper to come give assistance.\n  Under this concept of federalism that our Government has followed \nsince its beginning, those responsibilities--education, emergency \nresponse, law enforcement--have been placed in the hands of the States. \nIt is their responsibility to provide for a governmental structure of \nState and local response that will fulfill those and literally \nthousands of other responsibilities.\n  It has been said that federalism is the most significant governmental \nconcept which has been developed by the United States. It is a \nphilosophy which has always been in flux. We are looked down upon in \nthis Chamber by two of the figures who represent the divisions within \nfederalism: Our first Vice President, John Adams, who was a strong \nadvocate of a central government; Thomas Jefferson, our second Vice \nPresident, who was an equally strong advocate of responsibility being \nplaced as close as possible to where the people affected by that action \nof government live.\n  Federalism depends upon certain fundamental principles. One, it \ndepends\n\n[[Page S14167]]\n\nupon the principle of a respectful relationship between the central \ngovernment and the States. It depends upon the ability to accept \ndiversity.\n  Most countries have a ministry of education which is responsible for \neducation on a nationwide basis. We have gone a different course. We \nhave 50 States which have the primary responsibility for education from \nprekindergarten to graduate school. We have the concept that the States \nshould be given significant latitude so they can be the laboratories \nfor experimentation in our Nation.\n  We also believe under federalism that there should be, to the \ngreatest degree possible, a matching of power and responsibility. If \nthe States, for instance, have a certain set of responsibilities, they \nshould have the commensurate power to organize to meet those \nresponsibilities and to determine what level of revenues are going to \nbe necessary to meet those responsibilities and from what source or \nsources those revenues should come.\n  We recognize that under our Constitution, the Federal Government has \nultimate authority. If there is a conflict between the States and the \nnational government, the national government prevails. That concept was \nengrained in our Nation through the Civil War which settled the \nquestion of which level of government was supreme.\n  The Federal Government should not use this power that it has in an \narrogant manner but, rather, with discretion and respect. State \ngovernments have all power that is not delegated to the Federal \nGovernment. But they, too, should not use that residual power in an \narrogant way but recognize that, while they are serving specifically \nthe constituents of their State, they also are serving ends that \nbenefit the Nation. Education is the most obvious example of a \nresponsibility which has national service but which is directed at the \nState and local school district level.\n  Mr. President, the term ``situational Federalist'' has come into \nvogue to describe people who will be Federalist, particularly in \nrepresenting the role of State and local government when the ends to be \nmet will be achieved through decentralization, and they are not \nFederalist when the ends they seek to achieve will be better \naccomplished through centralizing power.\n  I reject the concept of ``situational Federalism.'' I believe, for \nthis great, large, diverse, dynamic country to best function, we in \nWashington should be very respectful of the role of the States, even \nwhen the end result of that may be a policy position with which we do \nnot necessarily agree.\n  I think we have arrived at one of those moments tonight. In this \ncase, almost everyone in this Chamber supports the principle that is in \nthe national interest to have an expansion of access to this wonderful \nnew world made possible by the Internet. But we believe we should carry \nout that objective with discretion. That is what we have done to date. \nWe have incrementally, 2 years at a time, extended the moratorium on \nthe ability of State and local governments to have taxation of access \nto the Internet; and we have been carefully defining just what the \nrange of that moratorium on taxation would be. And outside of that \ndefinition, we have given the States and local governments significant \nauthority. That authority has resulted in a not insignificant totality \nof the revenue of State governments.\n  As an example, last year, on a nationwide basis, State governments \ncollected between $4 billion and $9 billion of revenue from sources \nwhich this legislation would render immediately and permanently \nnontaxable. I believe that is not an example of the respectful way in \nwhich the Federal Government should deal with our Federal partners at \nthe State level.\n  As Senator Voinovich has said, and as Senator Carper and as Senator \nAlexander will say, we will make a proposal tomorrow that I think \nrepresents that appropriate respectful relationship. It does what we \nhave done now twice before--provide for a 2-year moratorium on Internet \naccess. It keeps, with one exception, the same definition of interstate \naccess that we have had from the beginning of this series of \nmoratoriums. It does not preemptorily eliminate the ability of those \nStates that were grandfathered in to continue to collect those taxes. \nIt will anticipate a gradual phaseout of that grandfather status, but \nnot one that could have a shock effect on the ability of those 11 \nStates, which does not include my State, and which does not include the \nState of the Presiding Officer. We should not look at this parochially \nfrom our own interests but, rather, what best serves our \nresponsibilities as Federalists.\n  Mr. President, I intend to speak at somewhat greater length tomorrow \nas we get into the details of why we believe S. 150, as submitted, is \nnot in our tradition of federalism, and to suggest an alternative, \nwhich will be offered by four of us who are now colleagues, but \npreviously in our life did have the responsibility of the chief \nexecutive of one of our 50 States, and therefore know from personal \nexperience the challenges that States have in educating its young \npeople, providing critical law enforcement and emergency services to \nour people, and the necessity of having the capacity to fund those \nservices, which is the equivalent of the responsibility itself. I \nbelieve the proposal that will be offered tomorrow is a reasoned \nproposal that assures that there will be no further encroachment on \naccess to the Internet through increased taxation, while at the same \ntime respecting the fact that taxation on telecommunications revenues \nrepresents a significant capability of the States to meet their \nobligations.\n  Mr. President, with that somewhat philosophical introduction, I look \nforward to a debate on the specifics of this issue when we meet again \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nhis remarks and say to him and the Presiding Officer and Senator Carper \nhow much I appreciate the opportunity to work with them on this issue. \nThey have been leaders in our country, in our States, among the best \nGovernors we have had over the last number of years, and I welcome the \nchance to work with them. I thank Senators Allen and Wyden for their \nhard work on this issue. They have been working at it for a long time. \nI respect that and appreciate it. I thank Senator McCain for his \ncongeniality and his efforts to move things along. He and the majority \nleader, last week, agreed to give us an opportunity, as they have done \ntonight, and for tomorrow, to make our case, state our issues, have \nvotes that we want to have, and I am grateful for that during a busy \nseason. It would have been easier to just let this go by. There are a \nlot of issues before the Senate, but there are a bipartisan group of us \nwho think this is very important as well. Each of you have stated \ntonight--and I don't need to restate it--why that is so.\n  I think it is a part of the tradition of the Senate that it be the \nsaucer in which the coffee cools. What we have found over the last \nseveral days is, as our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nlooked at this unfunded Federal mandate that affects internet access, \nthey have more questions about it. There are more people who are deeply \nconcerned about the proposal of the distinguished Senators from \nVirginia and Oregon.\n  So I am appealing tonight, and will be doing so tomorrow, especially \nto those Members of the Senate who have been mayors and Governors, who \nhave been legislators, city council men and women, to look at this and \nthe issues of Federalism. In sort of a reverse partisanship, I want to \nappeal to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, for whom the idea of \nunfunded Federal mandates has been a central part of our beliefs. It \nwas the center of our Republican resurgence in 1994, the heart of the \nContract With America. S. 1, the No. 1 Senate bill that the new \nRepublican majority leader, Bob Dole, introduced in 1995, was the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act. So this is important stuff for the \nRepublican Party.\n  In listening, though, to the issues that are being discussed tonight, \nlet me see if I can summarize some of what I believe I have heard and \ndiscuss for a moment the amendment that I will be sending to the desk, \nor have already forwarded to the desk, on behalf of several of us.\n  The question tonight is whether and to what extent we will allow \nState and local governments to tax Internet access. That is the issue. \nThere are really\n\n[[Page S14168]]\n\ntwo arguments among those of us who are arguing. The first one is--and \nI may be alone in this, but I don't think so--I don't like any unfunded \nFederal mandate. I supported the idea of a moratorium on State and \nlocal taxation of access to the Internet when it all began. Most of us \ndid. That was in the mid-nineties. It is hard to think back that far. \nThe Internet was an infant in a crib then and none of us wanted it to \nbe squashed in its infancy.\n  Then after 3 years, along came various advocates who said: Let's give \nit another 2 years. That very narrow ban on Internet access, which \ndidn't cost very much money--probably so little money during that time \nit didn't qualify under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act as an unfunded \nFederal mandate--so it was extended 2 years.\n  Now the advocates of the other position are coming along and saying: \nWe want to make this ban permanent, and we want to broaden the \ndefinition of what we mean by ``Internet access,'' so what we have here \nis not such a complex issue. We have really two questions: Do we want a \npermanent ban, or do we want a 2-year ban? The second is, Do we want to \nextend the same definition of ``Internet access'' we now have with a \nminor change, or do we want a broad definition of ``Internet access'' \nthat might cost State and local governments billions of dollars? That \nis really the issue that will be presented when we vote most likely \ntomorrow.\n  I send to the desk, but do not call up, an amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lautenberg, and ask that it be \nfiled.\n  I wish to discuss three issues. One is the strange case of amnesia \nthat seems to have set in, especially on my side of the aisle, about \nunfunded Federal mandates. The Presiding Officer made an eloquent \ndiscussion of that issue. So did other speakers.\n  The second is, I would like to discuss specifically why this is an \nunfunded Federal mandate under the specific terms of the budget law \nwhich was amended in 1995.\n  Finally, I want to say a word about the amendment which we will \noffer, which we believe is a better extension of the ban on Internet \naccess than that proposed by Senator Allen and Senator Wyden.\n  I very well remember 1994 and 1995. Senator Voinovich remembered he \nwas in Williamsburg, VA, when the Governors met. I remember that \nSenator Voinovich, then a Governor, was the acknowledged leader of \nState and local forces who were deeply concerned about the practice of \nWashington politicians passing laws claiming credit and then sending \nthe bills to mayors and Governors. Nothing really made us Governors \nmuch madder than that, people getting elected to Congress and presuming \nthey had suddenly arrived here in Washington, that they had a great \nidea about children with disabilities, and they would order us to do it \nand then order us to pay for it, or at least pay for half of it.\n  We cared about children with disabilities, too, and we felt as if we \nwere elected to make those decisions. We found nothing in our laws and \nconstitutions about how the Federal Government ought to define for us \nwhat our tax base ought to be or ought to be telling us all of these \nthings.\n  I vividly remember the new Republican majority leader of the Senate, \nBob Dole, coming to Williamsburg that very meeting Senator Voinovich \nmentioned. Governor Allen, now Senator, was presiding. Thirty \nRepublican Governors were there. Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader \nBob Dole came. Speaker Gingrich talked about the Contract With America. \nWe Republicans can remember that--300 Republican candidates standing on \nthe steps of this U.S. Capitol saying: Here is our 10-point plan; elect \nus, and if we break our promise, throw us out. That is what we said. \nThat is what we Republicans said. What was our promise? The heart of \nthat promise was no unfunded Federal mandates.\n  Senator Dole knew that. It wasn't just a matter of the House of \nRepresentatives. He came to Williamsburg, VA. He pulled out a copy of \nthe Constitution. He must have done it 100 times in the next year \nbecause I was with him 100 times in the next year when he did it. We \nwere both campaigning in Presidential primaries, and he would read the \ntenth amendment. He would read:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  That was Bob Dole in 1994 and 1995. He was good to his word.\n  We have a practice of the Senate. The majority leader will pick the \nmost important bill and make it his bill and call it S. 1. S. 1 that \nyear for Senator Dole, the new Republican majority leader, was the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. As Senator Voinovich said \nearlier, it passed 91 to 9. Sixty-three of the Senators who voted for \nit then are serving in this body today. Twelve of them were House \nMembers then.\n  There was a lot of steam in that argument then. I would like to read \njust a paragraph from a backgrounder put out by the Heritage Foundation \nin December of 1994. This is just a little while after the Governors \nmet. This paragraph says:\n\n       Throughout much of American history, especially since the \n     New Deal--\n\n  This is how they were looking at it--\n\n     the Federal Government increasingly has encroached upon the \n     fiscal and constitutional prerogatives of State and local \n     government. Today this imbalance has reached a crisis point, \n     and the States are fighting back. Through a variety of \n     initiatives, they are demanding that Federal mandates be \n     funded and, in many cases, even are challenging the authority \n     of the Federal Government to impose these mandates, whether \n     funded or not. With the new more State friendly Congress--\n\n  That is us, the Republican Congress--\n\n     States and localities have a historic opportunity not only to \n     effect mandate relief, but also to restore balance in State-\n     Federal relations.\n\n  Then they begin to list in this Heritage Foundation document some of \nthe ways States and localities that seemed to have reached their limit \nare fighting back. They are publicizing the costs of unfunded mandates. \nThey are holding their Congressmen accountable. They are challenging \nCongress's authority to impose the mandates. They are suing the \nGovernment for the violation of the tenth amendment. They are lobbying \nCongress to pass mandate relief legislation--no-money, no-mandate \nconstitutional amendments.\n  They are considering a collective action to challenge the Federal \nGovernment's right to pass laws that impose duties on States without \npaying the bill.\n  This was the mood in 1994 and 1995, and this was a major reason why \nthe Republican majority was elected. I hope we don't forget that. I \nknow at the time a great many of our colleagues remember it because \nthey talked about it eloquently in their speeches when the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act was enacted in 1995.\n  Senator Lott said:\n\n       It is things like unfunded mandates that drive good people \n     out of office.\n\n  Senator Thomas said: I served in the Wyoming Legislature and a good \ndeal of our budget was committed, before we ever got to Cheyenne, to \nunfunded mandates.\n  Senator Feinstein, a cosponsor of our amendment, said: I was \npresident of the board of supervisors. I was mayor. I saw the \ndevelopment of these unfunded mandates firsthand and in doing so I \nprobably speak for the mayors and local officials all across the \nNation.\n  Senator Nickles, chairman of the Budget Committee, said: I used to \nserve in the State legislature and we really resented the idea that the \nFederal Government would come in and mandate how we would spend our \nresources.\n  I am reading speeches from the Congressional Record of Members of \nthis body in 1995, who voted to ban unfunded Federal mandates.\n  Senator Hutchison of Texas said: Almost one-third of the increase in \nthe Texas State budget over the past 3 years has been the result of \nunfunded Federal mandates--one-third, she underlined.\n  Senator Burns talked about the impact of unfunded mandates.\n  Senator Bennett told a beautiful story about encountering a mayor \nduring a campaign in his State in Utah, and he ended up with the mayor \nsaying, well, if I had a U.S. Senator in front of me with his undivided \nattention, the one thing I would say to him is stop the unfunded \nmandates.\n  That is just a few of the things that were said. So the question now \nthen is,\n\n[[Page S14169]]\n\nis this really an unfunded Federal mandate? Well, that is not too hard \nto figure out. Some of my colleagues seemed surprised when I suggested \nthis might be, so I have put a letter on every Senator's desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This letter responds to the three questions \n     you posed in your letter of November 4, 2003, regarding S. \n     150, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act.\n        1. How much revenue is being collected by state and local \n     governments from taxes on DSL?\n        CBO estimates that state and local governments currently \n     collect at least $40 million per year in taxes on DSL service \n     (Digital Subscriber Line--a high-speed data transmission over \n     regular telephone wires). They are likely to collect revenues \n     totaling more than $80 million per year by 2008 due to growth \n     in the use of high-speed Internet access. These collections \n     are primarily sales and use taxes on DSL service.\n        2. What would be the revenue loss to state and local \n     governments under the managers' amendment to S. 150?\n        Based on the version of the proposed amendment CBO \n     received late this afternoon (S150MGR.6), CBO has determined \n     that the bill would create intergovernmental mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. We estimate that \n     those mandates would impose costs on state and local \n     governments in at least one of the next five years that would \n     exceed the threshold established in that act ($60 million in \n     2004, increasing to $66 million in 2008). We have identified \n     three major impacts, each of which would, by itself, exceed \n     the threshold:\n       Revenue losses of $80 million to $120 million per year, \n     starting in 2007, to state and local governments that are \n     already taxing Internet access and were covered by the \n     ``grandfather clause'' contained in the Internet Tax Freedom \n     Act. Some of these are taxes on DSL services. We have no \n     information to suggest that other states will impose taxes on \n     Internet access in the near term.\n       Other states are currently imposing taxes on charges for \n     the portions of DSL services they do not consider Internet \n     access. Those states would lose at least $40 million in sales \n     and use taxes on DSL services in 2004, and at least $75 \n     million by 2008. The preemption of DSL taxes would stem from \n     section 2(c) of the amendment, which defines ``Internet \n     access.''\n       Substantial revenue losses that could result from:\n       (a) The inability of state and local governments to collect \n     transactions taxes (including sales and use taxes and gross \n     receipts taxes) on certain types of telecommunications \n     services. For example, if technological change shifts \n     traditional telecommunications services to the Internet, \n     those services--for example local and long distance phone \n     calls--could be included, for free, when a customer purchases \n     Internet access;\n       (b) The free inclusion of content (movies, music, and \n     written works) with Internet access in response to the tax \n     exemption provided by this bill. Such content is subject to \n     sales and use taxes under current law but might increasingly \n     be available at no charge as part of an Internet access \n     package.\n       CBO does not have sufficient information to estimate these \n     revenue losses, but we believe they could grow to be large. \n     There is some question, however, as to what types of \n     transactions could not be taxed under the bill; under some \n     interpretations, these revenue losses could remain quite \n     small. The issue might ultimately have to be resolved in the \n     courts.\n       3. How much tax revenues do state and local governments \n     collect on telecommunication services?\n       Based on information from industry representatives, state \n     and local governments, and federal statistical sources, CBO \n     estimates that state and local governments currently collect \n     more than $20 billion annually from taxes on \n     telecommunications services. Such taxes generally fall into \n     two categories: transactions taxes and business taxes. \n     Transactions taxes (for example, gross receipts taxes, sales \n     taxes on consumers, and taxes on 911 service) account for \n     about two-thirds of the total.\n       In arriving at this estimate, CBO took into account the \n     fact that some companies are challenging the applicability of \n     taxes to their services, and thus may not be collecting such \n     taxes, even though states and local governments feel they are \n     obligated to do so. Such potential liabilities are not \n     included in the estimate.\n       If you would like further details on the information \n     provided in this letter, we would be pleased to provide it. \n     The staff contacts for this legislation are Sarah Puro and \n     Theresa Gullo.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert A. Sunshine\n                              (For Douglas-Holtz-Eakin, Director).\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. There is a letter that I received yesterday from the \nCongressional Budget Office on every Senator's desk. It describes the \nthree ways in which the proposed ban on State and local Internet access \ntaxes by Senator Allen and Senator Wyden violate the Federal Budget \nAct--specifically, the amendments of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nof 1995.\n  These are the three ways: One, there is a revenue loss of $80 million \nto $120 million per year to State and local governments already taxing \nInternet access. There are 11 such States.\n  Second, there are losses of $40 million to $75 million of taxes on \nDSL services that States now collect. That is the second violation of \nan unfunded mandate.\n  Third, and this makes the point it is not only an unfunded mandate, \nit is potentially a great big unfunded mandate. The Congressional \nBudget Office says in its letter that the third way this proposal \nviolates the Budget Act is ``substantial revenue losses that could \noccur'' when technological change shifts traditional communication \nservices to the Internet--for example, local and long distance phone \ncalls--or when content, music, movies, written works is provided free \nwith Internet access.\n  This may sound complicated but it is not so complicated. Basically, \nwhat this says is it already is happening, that your telephone company \nor your cable TV company will provide your Internet access. CBO says \nthat State and local governments today now collect more than $20 \nbillion annually from transaction sales and use taxes on \ntelecommunications services.\n  What this letter further says is that the Allen-Wyden proposal will \ntake an undetermined amount of this $20 billion and ban the ability of \nState and local governments to include that as part of their tax base. \nIt is enough, according to the CBO letter, to define it as an unfunded \nFederal mandate. But they say they cannot tell the exact amount of the \n$20 billion that might be exempt from State and local taxation.\n  The Multistate Tax Commission said it could tell. It estimated $4 \nbillion to $5 billion. That is an awful lot of money. The Senator from \nOhio, the Presiding Officer, in his argument read a list of what State \nrevenue officers have told him, and what they estimate it might take.\n  The problem is the broader definition of Internet access, which is \ncontained in the bill of the distinguished Senators from Virginia and \nOregon, raises the likelihood that some--maybe a lot--of the $20 \nbillion that is now used by State and local governments to pay for \nschools, State parks and to keep other taxes down, would be taken away \nfrom their tax base.\n  What do we then do about it? Well, we think we have a suggestion \nwhich we hope tomorrow our colleagues in the Senate, if we are able to \nvote on it, then will agree with us. Our suggestion is an extension of \nthe current ban on Internet access for 2 years, with the same narrow \ndefinition that we now have, with the exception that we would make sure \nthat in 23 States which do not now tax DSL, that is telephone service \nthat delivers broadband, they would not be allowed to do that.\n  So in taking the issues that I heard from the distinguished Senators \nfrom Virginia and Oregon, I would summarize them this way: They argue \nthat the Internet is so valuable that we need to override this law we \nhave against unfunded Federal mandates. I agree it is valuable but it \nis not an infant. It is a pretty big boy. It is out there in the world. \nWe know what it is and it should stand on its own now.\n  The telephone is also a magnificent invention. We do not exempt it \nfrom taxation. The television is a magnificent invention. We do not \nexempt it from taxation.\n  If we really think in the Congress that the Internet deserves to be \ncompletely exempt from State and local taxation, then why do we not pay \nfor it? Why do we not pass a law that we might call the Unfunded \nFederal Mandate Reimbursement Act and just let every mayor and every \nGovernor send us a bill every year and we will send them a check. If it \nturns out to be $20 billion, we will send them $20 billion. If it turns \nout to be $4 billion, we will send them $4 billion because we will have \nsaid the Internet is so important that we in Congress think it ought to \nbe subsidized, that there should be relief from taxation, and so we are \ngoing to pay for it. That would be the honest thing to do, rather than \njust to say we think it is important but you pay for it.\n\n  That is what we said with how we helped disabled children. That is \nwhat\n\n[[Page S14170]]\n\nwe said with stormwater runoff. That is what we said with clean water. \nWe think it is a great idea, you pay for it. That is why we are in \nWashington. We print money. You balance budgets. We think it is a good \nidea, you pay for it. That is what the fuss is about.\n  The second thing I have heard is it is in interstate commerce and we \ncould not touch it. Telephones are in interstate commerce. We do not \nkeep States and local governments from taxing telephones. Televisions \nare in interstate commerce. Buses are in interstate commerce. Planes \nare in interstate commerce. Catalog sales are in interstate commerce. \nSeverance taxes are in interstate commerce. A great big part of every \nState and local government's budget is made up of a tax base that \nincluded items that are in interstate commerce. So that argument does \nnot wash at all.\n  Taxing broadband, that is a good point. Broadband is coming fast. We \ndo not want to interfere with that so our conclusion is, let us stop it \nin the 23 States that do not now tax broadband. Let us put DSL and \ncable--that is the broadband is delivered--on an equal playing field. \nIn the States that do tax DSL, they can continue that for the 2 years \nof the ban.\n  Multiple taxation, that was raised by the Senator from Virginia. \nWell, we are extending the current language and it bans multiple \ntaxation. Discriminatory taxation, we propose to extend the current \nlanguage, and that bans discriminatory taxation.\n  State and local taxation on Internet access, we would propose to \nextend the ban on Internet access taxation for 2 years so we can think \nthis through. So we have taken care of that as well. Tomorrow, when \nhopefully we will be voting on this, we will have this choice: Do you \nwant a permanent ban on Internet access taxation, or do you want a 2-\nyear ban? Do you want a broad definition of what we mean by Internet \naccess, a definition that could cost States a significant share of \ntheir State or local tax base, or do you want a narrow definition, \nvirtually the same one we have today?\n\n  I believe the prudent thing for us to do is to take the law that we \nhave today, slightly modify it to put DSL and cable on an equal playing \nfield, extend it for 2 years, and let us continue the debate we are \nhaving about how to define the two words ``Internet access.'' That is \nreally the problem. I agree with the Senator from Oregon. He has worked \nlong and hard on this. There have been many meetings. We just don't \nagree on what the definition of Internet access is.\n  But until we can agree, we should not put this potentially huge \nunfunded Federal mandate into the law. So tomorrow I hope to bring up \nthis amendment I have filed tonight. I hope our colleagues will compare \nit with the proposal of the Senator from Virginia and Oregon, and I \nhope they will adopt ours.\n  I also have a point of order I could raise, which would cause the \nSenate to consider whether the Allen-Wyden amendment is an unfunded \nFederal mandate. If there is a motion to waive the point of order, \nwhich I believe would be sustained by the Chair, then Senators would \nhave an opportunity to cast a vote for or against an unfunded Federal \nmandate. But I am going to reserve that option and hope that sometime \ntomorrow we can have a clear up-or-down vote on the amendment which I \noffer with a number of other Senators.\n  I look forward to the debate tomorrow.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very briefly, because Senator Lautenberg \nhas not had a chance to speak and he has been gracious enough to just \ngive me a couple of minutes to respond to our friend from Tennessee, I \nthink he knows we have a difference of opinion on this issue, but I \nwant him to know how much I appreciate the way he has worked with this \nSenator. I think he is going to be a great addition to the Senate. I \nlook forward to the many issues where we are going to find common \nground, even though this is not one of them.\n  Just briefly on this unfunded mandate question, I think it is clear \nthat, with the more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in our country, if \never there was something that was inherently interstate in nature, it \nis the Internet. I think we can just imagine the kind of chaos if even \na small fraction of these 7,600 taxing jurisdictions took a bite out of \nthe Internet. We would have a crazy quilt of laws with respect to the \nInternet.\n  There are a whole host of activities where the Federal Government has \nessentially made it clear they were inherently interstate in nature and \nyou do not hear the States expressing any grievances. You don't hear \nStates complaining that they can't tax airline tickets or mail or a \nvariety of other things because we are talking about something that is \nso crystal clear in terms of its very nature--in effect, the essence of \narticle I, section 8, of the Constitution--that this has been an area \nwhere the Federal Government has said it is not appropriate to let \nthousands of local and State jurisdictions simply make a mishmash out \nof a regulatory regime that needs to be uniform in nature.\n  I know we are going to talk more about that tomorrow. I am going to \ngo through, tomorrow, the history of the Unfunded Mandates Act that \nsupports the position Senator Allen and I have taken.\n\n  Two other points very quickly and then I do want to let our friend \nfrom New Jersey have some time for which he has been patiently waiting. \nWith respect to the telecommunications services issue which the Senator \nfrom Tennessee has discussed, I want to make it clear that Senator \nAllen and I have done everything but hire a sky writer to fly over the \nCapitol, to make it clear that telecommunications services, which can \nbe taxed today, would and should be taxed in the future. It is \nabsolutely clear with respect to all the work we have tried to do, both \nin the committee and working with various State and local officials, we \nfeel very strongly about it. It is what the bundling issue has been all \nabout in terms of separating out Internet access, which should not be \ntaxed, and telecommunications services, which ought to be taxed.\n  Senator Allen and I continue to be interested in working with \ncolleagues to try to find common ground in this area, but the two of us \nhave done everything except march down the street with a sandwich \nboard, trying to argue that telecommunications services must be taxed \nand that it is Internet access about which we are concerned.\n  Finally, the last point I would make is we need to have a discussion \nin the Senate with respect to what the competitive playing field will \nlook like under the amendment at least as outlined tonight by the \nSenator from Tennessee. We have already seen a competitive disadvantage \nestablished, given the developments in the last few years between cable \nand telecommunications. It is the view of the Senator from Virginia and \nI, as two Members of the Commerce Committee who have focused on this \nissue for many months, that we think the competitive disadvantage, \nwhich has been established in the last few years between cable and \ntelecommunications, will widen under the proposal the Senate is going \nto be asked to look at tomorrow as an alternative. We are going to have \na chance to discuss it.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to the Senator from Tennessee with \nrespect to how he has handled this issue. We have a difference of \nopinion on it, but I admire the Senator from Tennessee very much and I \nlook forward to working closely with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2559\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct the attention of my friend from \nTennessee to Homeland Security and to Leave No Child Behind. If he \nwants to find some unfunded mandates, have him come to Nevada and find \nout what those two pieces of legislation have done--I should say that \npiece of legislation, Leave No Child Behind, and what we have done to \nthe State of Nevada and every other State by not properly funding the \nLeave No Child Behind Act and what we have done with all of our demands \non State and local government with our unfunded mandates relating to \nhomeland security. That is the subject of another speech.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2559, the Military Construction \nappropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S14171]]\n\n  I do this because, in the State of Nevada, Nellis Air Force Base and \nthe Fallon Naval Air Training Center are desperately in need of \nconstruction starts and completion of jobs that are already underway.\n  So I hope my friends on the other side will allow this very important \nconference report to be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that be done with no intervening action or debate.\n  I so move.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from Oregon \nand my colleague from Virginia for the hard work they did to get us to \nthis point where we have an opportunity to review some of the problems \nwe have seen in the Internet tax area. I had an early opportunity to \nreview and carefully consider S. 150, and I support the stated purpose \nof this legislation. I agree that the American consumer should be \nencouraged and not taxed to access the Internet.\n  I also agree with the stated purpose of this legislation, that the \nFederal Government should ensure tax-free access to the Internet, \nirrespective of the technology the consumer uses, whether it is the \nregular dial-up modem, cable modem, DSL, wireless, or satellite.\n  My concerns with this legislation don't stem from its stated \npurposes. My concerns are with the legislation's unstated purposes and \nunintended consequences which most State, county, and local tax experts \nbelieve would jeopardize important revenue streams, such as the gross \nreceipts tax, that were permitted under the first two iterations of the \nInternet tax moratorium.\n  The Internet tax moratorium bill was conceived in 1998 as a \nproconsumer legislative attempt aimed at increasing American access to \nthe Internet. Now that the bill has been rewritten and greatly \nexpanded, it has as a result become another corporate giveaway of \npotentially enormous and devastating proportions.\n  According to the Commerce Committee report accompanying S. 150, the \noriginal enactment of this legislation in 1998 imposed a temporary \nmoratorium on ``certain taxes that could have a detrimental effect on \nthe continued expansion of Internet use in the United States.''\n  In 1999, only 26 percent of United States households had Internet \naccess, according to the Department of Commerce. In September 2001, 51 \npercent of United States households had Internet access. In 2002, \naccording to the Forrester Research firm, 64 percent--quite a jump in a \nyear--of U.S. households had Internet.\n  The number of households with Internet access has more than doubled \nin 4 years, from 26 percent in 1998 to 64 percent in 2002. I am sure \nthe rate of Internet access today is even higher.\n  Many households, however, only have basic dial-up access to the \nInternet and haven't moved to the faster broadband access services.\n  Clearly, the supporters of this bill can't blame an access tax that \nisn't being imposed for the digital divide that exists between people \nwho have Internet access and those who do not, or between households \nwhich can afford broadband or wireless Internet access service and \nthose households which still use the narrowband dial-up.\n  Nevertheless, I would support an extension of the moratorium on \nInternet access taxes. By temporary, I am talking about a couple of \nyears. But to make the moratorium permanent, as this bill would do, in \nmy view is an abdication of responsibility on our part.\n  I cannot and will not support a permanent moratorium that is so \npoorly defined that it won't just apply to access taxes. I cannot and \nwill not support a moratorium that will deprive the States of $4 \nbillion to $9 billion in revenues by the year 2006, according to the \nMulti-State Tax Commission and the National Governors Association. \nBased on the language in the bill reported out of the Commerce \nCommittee, my home State of New Jersey by itself stands to lose $833 \nmillion in annual revenues. Other States also stand to lose hundreds of \nmillions of dollars as well. Maybe some Senators are willing to look \nthe other way and not address the problems with this bill. So be it. \nBut I cannot do that. Even under the managers' amendment, which is a \nmodest improvement, the annual revenue loss for New Jersey is believed \nto be somewhere around $600 million. My question is: Why are we doing \nthis to States when they are facing the biggest fiscal crisis they have \nseen since World War II or even the Depression years?\n  A permanent, poorly crafted moratorium? No way. I cannot in good \nconscience support something so far reaching.\n  That is why I support an amendment I believe will be offered by some \nof my colleagues, Senators Alexander, Carper, and Voinovich, to extend \nthe existing moratorium for only 2 years, and to fix the discrepancy in \nthe way DSL and cable modem are treated for tax purposes.\n  I realize even if this amendment is offered and agreed to, States \nsuch as New Jersey will still lose much-needed revenue, but at least we \ncan and must minimize the impact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, prior to wrap-up, this completes the \ndebate and discussion for this evening. It is my understanding that \nSenators from Tennessee, Ohio, and Delaware have an amendment that has \nbeen filed and they will call it up when we begin our continued debate \non this legislation tomorrow morning at 9:30. I hope we can limit our \ndebate on that amendment and have a vote on it and then take up other \namendments. It is still the intention of the majority leader to finish \nthis legislation tomorrow. I hope we can achieve that goal.\n  I know everybody would like to go home on Friday afternoon, but I \nhave been assured by the majority leader we will remain until \ncompletion of the legislation.\n  I think it has been a good debate tonight. I thank all of my \ncolleagues. I look forward to disposing of the amendments tomorrow when \nwe reconvene at 9:30.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14171-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14171-S14172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1828\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent request \nregarding the Syria Accountability Act in just a minute.\n  This is an important piece of legislation that requires our immediate \nattention.\n  This bill would establish economic sanctions against Syria, unless \nthe President certifies that Syria has ceased all support for \ninternational terrorism and has gotten out of the weapons of mass \ndestruction business.\n  As we have known for some time, Syria supports and sponsors Hizballah \nand other terrorist groups. Hizballah, of course, was responsible for \nthe deadly attack against 298 of our marines in Lebanon 20 years ago, \nand they have also been behind repeated attacks against Israeli \ncivilians over the years.\n  It is also no secret that the Baathists of Syria and Iraq shared a \ncommon view of the world. They are anti-western, corrupt, and \ndangerous. Our intelligence experts have noted a significant amount of \nweapons and terror traffic between Iraq and Syria leading up to the \nwar. This would be consistent with reports that Syria offered sanctuary \nto senior figures from the Iraqi regime.\n  And now, as our brave men and women fight a low-intensity conflict in \nIraq, it is becoming clear that many of the threats that they face \nresult from the porous border with Syria, and the failure of Syria to \ncrack down on cross-border terrorism.\n  Make no mistake: This bill is critical to our troops, and to \nrestoring peace in the Middle East. It is also critical to holding \nSyria accountable for their shabby record on terrorism and human \nrights.\n\n[[Page S14172]]\n\n  I am hopeful my colleagues on the other side will pass it without \nfurther delay.\n  To my knowledge, no amendment has been filed tonight. I hope tomorrow \nmorning we can pass the Syria Accountability Act. We can shorten the \ntime to 1 hour. Under the present consent agreement which has been \napproved before this body, we will move to it for an hour and half at \nany time the majority leader wishes. We have waited a long time to get \nto this. I hope we can do it tomorrow.\n  I hope that also tomorrow--and I was willing to do it tonight, but it \nhas been rejected on two separate occasions--we can pass the Military \nConstruction appropriations bill. I don't understand why we can't do \nthat. We could have this matter on the President's desk in a matter of \nhours. After it is signed, places such as Nellis Air Force Base and \nFallon Naval Air Training Center would be able to start construction \nprojects that are badly needed. Both of those bases are terribly busy \nbecause of what is going on in the Middle East and because of the \ntraining for our naval airmen and Air Force airmen. I know the people \nat Nellis badly need this money.\n\n  I ask consent that the order entered with respect to H.R. 1828, the \nSyria Accountability Act, be changed to reflect the time for \nconsideration be reduced to 60 minutes; that there be 30 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Specter, 15 minutes each for Senators Lugar and \nBoxer, or their designees; and at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning the Senate \nproceed to the measure under limitations provided under the previous \norder as modified above with the remaining provisions of the order now \nin order to remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I would hope that the majority would allow the Senate, \nbefore we take our weekend break, to do these two pieces of \nlegislation--the Syria Accountability Act and the military construction \nconference report. I hope we can do that. These are non-partisan \nmeasures. I don't know what advantage any of us have by taking a few \nminutes and passing them. I hoped we could do military construction in \ntonight's wrap-up. It is something that needs to be done that no one \ndisputes. No one needs it more than the military of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14172-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I rise today to commend an initiative \nrecently launched by the National Association of Broadcasters and its \nlocal radio and television station members.\n  With more than 140,000 military personnel stationed in Afghanistan, \nIraq and around the world, the resources needed to take care of our \ntroops and their families are strained. As an Air Force reservist, I \nhave seen firsthand the financial and emotional difficulties that many \nfamilies face when a family member is on an extended deployment.\n  Of course, the military takes care of its own. But, as the war on \nterror continues and needs escalate, the military cannot do it alone. \nTo respond to this growing need, the four military aid societies have \njoined together to create a single umbrella organization: the Armed \nForces Relief Trust.\n  In support of this new relief organization, local commercial radio \nand television stations are airing radio and television public service \nannouncements, asking viewers and listeners to contribute to the Trust. \nThe over-the-air broadcast medium continues to be the most effective \nway to rapidly disseminate information to the public. Last year, the \nfour military emergency assistance programs disbursed more than $109 \nmillion in interest-free loans and grants to more than 145,000 \nindividuals and families in need. With the help of America's local \nradio and television stations, I am convinced that the Trust will be \nable to assist even more military families.\n  I applaud the efforts of local broadcasters to support the families \nof those who defend us every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14172-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE CRIMINAL SPAM ACT OF 2003\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in June of this Year, I introduced S. \n1293, the Criminal Spam Act, together with my friend Senator Hatch and \nseveral of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. In September, the \ncommittee unanimously voted to report the bill to the floor. Two weeks \nago, the Senate adopted portions of the bill as an amendment to S. 877, \nthe CAN SPAM Act. The bill has been cleared from the Democratic \ncloakroom for weeks.\n   Unfortunately, this important measure is hung up on the Republican \nside because of an anonymous ``hold'' by some Republican Senator.\n   The Criminal Spam Act targets the most pernicious and unscrupulous \nspammers--those who use trickery and deception to induce others to \nrelay and view their messages. Ridding America's inboxes of deceptively \ndelivered spam will significantly advance our fight against junk e-\nmail.\n   Why would anyone want to prevent passage of this important \nlegislation? It is bipartisan. It is non-controversial. It enjoys broad \nsupport from businesses, consumer groups, and civil liberties groups \nalike. The administration has only good things to say about it, and I \nknow of no individual or organization that opposes it.\n   The answer must be that someone on the other side of the aisle is \nplaying politics with this bill, holding it up for some reason that has \nnothing to do with it--or for no reason at all.\n   We could pass the Criminal Spam Act today, the House could act \nquickly and we could start prosecuting the worst of the worst spammers \nwithout delay. Instead, a single Republican Senator is allowing these \nindividuals to continue to flood the Internet with their unwanted ads.\n   The Internet is a valuable asset to our Nation, to our economy, and \nto the lives of Americans. We should act now to secure its continued \nviability and vitality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14172-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14172-S14173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1753, the \nNational Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003. As \nwe all know, reauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a very \nimportant issue for the financial services industry and for consumers. \nWhen I talk to my friends in this sector, it is always the first thing \nthey ask about. It touches everyone and their money and our national \neconomy. It is critical that we act on it before adjournment. I believe \nthat the Banking Committee under the leadership of Chairman Shelby has \ncreated a fair, bipartisan bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  We have been talking about this issue for several years. We have held \na number of hearings on it. We looked it over pretty thoroughly, and I \nthink we have come up with a reasonable approach. Most importantly, we \nhave to act now because this bill is also important to our overall \neconomy.\n  Last week we had great economic news. Our economy is roaring back and \nthat is good news for everyone. But if we fail to pass this bill, it \ncould end up being a serious speed bump on the road to a better \neconomy. If there is one thing that markets hate, it is uncertainty. \nThey want to know where we are and where we are going. For better or \nworse, the markets think we are going to pass this bill. They think we \nare going to outline a stable path for financial institutions when it \ncomes to the sharing of information. Any talk or any sign from Congress \nthat makes the markets think that we aren't going to pass this bill \nwould create a great deal of uncertainty in the financial markets. Now \nthat our economy is really coming to life, that is the last thing we \nneed. If the markets think we are going to let the FCRA lapse, they are \ngoing to get very jittery very quickly. I can understand that. This is \na sensitive, complicated area. I don't think any of us wants the FCRA \nto lapse.\n\n[[Page S14173]]\n\n  We need Federal preemption in this area. I think it would be a \nmistake to let States and localities all try to impose their own \nprivacy rules. There are trillions of dollars at stake. We have to be \nvery careful. But if we fail to pass this bill, we open a Pandora's box \nof States and localities writing their own rules, and the markets and \nfinancial institutions just are not prepared for that. We can't let \nthat happen. We don't need that uncertainty now. Who knows what would \nhappen.\n  On a personal note, I am very pleased that the bill contains strong \nidentity theft and privacy protections, including my amendment on \nSocial Security number truncation that will help prevent thieves who go \n``dumpster diving'' or try to steal credit reports from mail boxes. \nIdentity theft is a growing problem in America. The Internet is making \nit easier for thieves to obtain consumer information. My amendment will \nhelp fight this growing menace. Under this bill, consumers can block \nout their Social Security number on their credit reports. It is just \nthe sort of simple, commonsense approach that will help consumers \nwithout burdening business.\n  I would also like to talk about the amendments that are going to be \noffered by my colleagues from California. They are based, in large \npart, on a California bill, SB1. I am sure California has a fine \nlegislature. And I am sure their representatives try their best to \nrepresent their California constituents. But I do not think the \nCalifornia legislature represents the people of Kentucky or the other \nStates very well. That is not their job. If we adopt the amendments to \nbe offered by my friends, it would have the effect of imposing \nCalifornia's rules on the rest of the Nation. That is a bad idea that \nwill only lead to the economic uncertainty we have to avoid.\n  If California wants to try to craft their own rules and work with \nFederal regulators, I say more power to them--but not if it puts a \ncrimp on the national economy or starts rewriting the rules for the \nother 49 States. Our credit system is a national system and it needs a \nnational standard. Standards that may work in California or Kentucky \nmay not work for the country as a whole. Usually I am all for taking \npower away from Washington and sending it back to the States and local \ngovernment. But on this bill we cannot ignore the fact that credit \nrules and markets and money are all part of a broader, national economy \nthat requires a unified, Federal approach. To let States undermine that \nwould be a recipe for disaster.\n  S. 1753 is a fair and balanced bill that sets a fair and balanced \nstandard for our entire Nation. It is bipartisan, it is common sense, \nand it is a prudent solution to a pressing problem for our financial \ninstitutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14173-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING BENJAMIN AND ALEC WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I honor Benjamin Richard \nWilliams and Alec David Williams for receiving the Eagle Scout Award. \nAs an Eagle Scout myself, I know first hand the dedication and hard \nwork involved in attaining this prestigious award. These two brothers, \nfrom my home State of Idaho, are exceptional individuals who have \naccomplished much in their young lives. Allow me a moment to tell you \nabout them.\n  In addition to his rank of Eagle Scout, Ben has served diligently in \nthe Boy Scout organization, most recently as Senior Patrol Leader. He \nhas also been heavily involved in extra-curricular activities at Boise \nHigh School. Ben is a cross-country runner and is involved in his \nschool's jazz and marching bands. All of this while keeping a very \nimpressive 3.95 GPA.\n  Alec is here with us in the Senate today, serving our country as a \ncongressional page. We appreciate his valuable service in this \ncapacity. Alec has served in several capacities in the Boy Scouts, most \nrecently as the assistant senior patrol leader. Alec is also an \nexceptional student with a 4.0 GPA. Attaining the rank of Eagle Scout \nis one more accomplishment to add to his already impressive list.\n  I commend Benjamin and Alec on receiving their Eagle Scout Awards. \nThrough the leadership and service opportunities provided in the \nScouting program, Ben and Alec are better prepared to serve their \nfamilies and America's communities. I wish them continued success in \nall of their endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14173-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14173-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14173-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE APPROVAL OF THE USE OF $10,623,873 PROVIDED BY THE \n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, PUBLIC LAW 108-7, THE \n          CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS RESOLUTION, 2003--PM 55\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with Division C, District of Columbia Appropriations Act \nof Public Law 108-7, the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, \nI am notifying the Congress of the proposed use of $10,623,873 provided \nin Division C under the heading ``Federal Payment for Emergency \nPlanning and Security Costs in the District of Columbia.''

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Edwards, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1833. A bill to improve the health of minority individuals; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 40 years ago, the famous and \ninspirational civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer rallied the Nation \nwith her statement ``I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.'' Her \nwords still resonate with millions of Americans today. Whether we are \ntalking about African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans or American \nIndians, the fact is that minorities continue to live sicker and die \nyounger in America. We know that African Americans are one-third more \nlikely than all other Americans to die from cancer. They have the \nhighest rate of hypertension in the world. Latinos have the least \ninsurance, with one in three having no coverage at all. American Indian \ntribes struggle with what can only be called epidemics of diabetes, \nwith rates near 50 percent in certain tribes. The tremendous gains that \nwe have witnessed in science and medicine have benefited millions of \nour citizens, but too often they are out of reach for minorities.\n  It is a privilege to join my colleagues to introduce the Healthcare \nEquality and Accountability Act. Our goal is to produce major \nimprovements in all aspects of minority health care. It expands health \ninsurance coverage. It supports better access to services that are \nculturally and linguistically appropriate. It strengthens the safety-\nnet. It promotes the development of new and better ways to treat \ndiseases that disproportionately affect minorities.\n  It also increases the diversity of the health care workforce. Many \nstudies show that minority health professionals dramatically increase \naccess to care and the delivery of good care to\n\n[[Page S14178]]\n\nminority patients. Despite their importance, however, the percentage of \nminority health professionals is shockingly low. African Americans, \nLatinos and American Indians account for almost 25 percent of the \nNation's population--but they account for less than 10 percent of the \nNation's doctors, less than 5 percent of dentists, and only 12 percent \nof nurses.\n  Our bill will increase the number of minority health professionals by \nexpanding existing pipeline programs and developing new ones. It also \nprovides additional scholarship support to enable more minority and \nlow-income students to make their careers in health care.\n  Another critical need addressed by this bill is accountability. It \nholds health care agencies and institutions, public and private, \naccountable for the care delivered to their minority populations as \nwell as their health outcomes. It reauthorizes the Office of Minority \nHealth, increases the effectiveness of the Office for Civil Rights and \nestablishes a new Office for Health Disparities within the Office for \nCivil Rights. It also establishes compliance offices in each of the \nFederal agencies, to ensure that the policies, programs and practices \nof each agency are in compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act, \nwhich prohibits discrimination based on race, ethnicity or national \norigin.\n  We can't just talk about racial and ethnic health disparities. We \nhave to do more to eliminate them. All Americans deserve fair and \nequitable treatment in health care. The administration has said time \nand time again that it is committed to improving minority health. But, \nthe President's own budget eliminated all funds for workforce diversity \ntraining programs, and all funds for the Community Access Program, \ndespite the overwhelming evidence that minority health providers and \ncommunity health centers dramatically improve access to care and \nquality of care for minority populations. The President's budget also \nreduced funds for the Office of Minority Health, and it has made the \nOffice for Civil Rights virtually powerless to carry out its mission.\n  Vast numbers of minority Americans are needlessly suffering because \nof administration's neglect. We cannot turn our back on the needs of \nnearly one-third of the Nation's population. Whether we are talking \nabout health insurance, language access, disease prevention, or public \nhospitals and community health centers, the need is great and the time \nis now. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, so that we do what \nis so clearly needed to improve the health and health care for millions \nof minority Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW:\n  S. 1834. A bill to waive time limitations in order to allow the Medal \nof Honor to be awarded to Gary Lee McKiddy, of Miamisburg, Ohio, for \nacts of valor while a helicopter crew chief and door gunner with the \n1st Cavalry Division during the Vietnam War; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n   Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that \nwould waive rigid time limitations in order to allow the Medal of Honor \nto be awarded to Gary Lee McKiddy, of Miamisburg, OH, for acts of valor \nwhile a helicopter crew chief and door gunner with the 1st Cavalry \nDivision during the Vietnam War. There is a companion bill in the House \nof Representatives, H.R. 369, which was introduced by Representative \nSander Levin and is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of forty-three \nMembers of Congress.\n   I think it is important that my colleagues hear the heroic story of \nSergeant Gary Lee McKiddy. Sergeant McKiddy served with the 1st Cavalry \nDivision in Vietnam. He was a helicopter crew chief and a door gunner. \nOn May 6, 1970, Sergeant McKiddy's helicopter came under enemy fire and \nreceived several damaging blows, causing the helicopter to crash and \nstart burning. Through investigations, the Army arrived at the \nconclusion that Sergeant McKiddy was thrown free of the helicopter and \nwas out of harm's way, but bravely returned to the burning helicopter \nand found Specialist Four James Skaggs, who was unconscious, and \ncarried him to safety. Sergeant McKiddy then returned to the wreckage \nto help rescue the pilot, Warrant Officer Tommy Whiddon, when the \naircraft's fuel cells exploded, killing Warrant Officer Whiddon and \nSergeant McKiddy.\n   I think we all can agree that this is an incredible story of \nbravery, honor, and selflessness. Specialist Four Skaggs wrote in a \nletter, ``Gary McKiddy was awarded the Silver Star for these acts of \nheroism but not the Medal of Honor because there were no witnesses. I \ndon't understand how he could be awarded the Silver Star based on this \ninformation but no the Medal of Honor. There has never been any doubt \nin my mind about what happened that day. I am totally convinced Gary \nMcKiddy earned and deserves the Medal of Honor.''\n   Sergeant McKiddy's brother, Rick, lives in Warren, MI. Rick McKiddy, \nother family members, and Specialist Four Skaggs have been fighting for \nSergeant McKiddy's Medal of Honor for 20 years to no avail. They've \ncontacted countless persons at the Pentagon and have taken their case \nto anyone who will listen. They've exhausted their resources. I think \nthat Sergeant McKiddy deserves a second chance. It is time for Congress \nto act.\n   As we all know, the Medal of Honor is defined as ``the highest award \nfor valor in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon \nan individual serving in the Armed Services of the United States.'' \nUnfortunately, the time limit for the application for the Medal of \nHonor ran out before an application was submitted on Sergeant McKiddy's \nbehalf. The bill that I am introducing today waives the time limit on \nthe application and requests that the President award Sergeant McKiddy \nthe Medal of Honor.\n   With Veteran's Day quickly approaching, I think this is a very \nfitting way to honor not only Sergeant McKiddy, but all of those men \nand women who have given their lives for our country.\n   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1834\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO AWARD MEDAL OF HONOR TO GARY LEE \n                   MCKIDDY FOR VALOR DURING THE VIETNAM WAR.\n\n       (a) Waiver of Time Limitations.--Notwithstanding the time \n     limitations in section 3744(b) of title 10, United States \n     Code, or any other time limitation, the President is \n     authorized and requested to award the Medal of Honor under \n     section 3741 of such title to Gary Lee McKiddy, of \n     Miamisburg, Ohio, for the acts of valor referred to in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Action Described.--The acts of valor referred to in \n     subsection (a) are the conspicuous acts of gallantry and \n     intrepidity at the risk of his life and beyond the call of \n     duty of Gary Lee McKiddy, between October 25, 1969, and May \n     6, 1970, and particularly on May 6, 1970, the day he died \n     during a combat operation in Cambodia while serving as a \n     Specialist Four in the 1st Cavalry Division of the United \n     States Army.\n       (c) Posthumous Award.--The Medal of Honor may be awarded \n     under this section posthumously as provided in section 3752 \n     of title 10, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1835. A bill to extend the effective period of the Undetectable \nFirearms Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. 922 note) for 10 years; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleague Senator Patrick Leahy, and Ranking Democrat Member of the \nJudiciary Committee, legislation to reauthorize the Undetectable \nFirearms Act. I want to thank Senator Leahy for joining with me in \nintroducing this bill and for his cooperation in working together on \nthis important issue.\n  This reauthorization will extend the existing ban on the manufacture, \nsale, importation, shipping, possession, transfer, or receipt of \nfirearms that could not be detected by a metal detector or x-ray \nmachine. Everyone in this Chamber knows how deeply I care for the \nSecond Amendment and the individual's right to own and bear arms. I \nwant everyone to understand that this ban does not ban a single firearm \nin production today. It prevents any individual or company from \ncreating an undetectable firearm.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the measure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch to\n\n[[Page S14179]]\n\nintroduce legislation to extend the Undetectable Firearms Act for ten \nyears. I appreciate working with the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and thank him for his leadership on this legislation.\n  The Undetectable Firearms Act became law in 1988, long before the \ntragic attacks on our country on September 11, 2001. The Undetectable \nFirearms Act also known as the ``plastic gun law'' made it illegal to \nmanufacture, import, possess, or transfer a firearm that is not \ndetectable by walk-through metal detectors or airport x-ray machines. \nThis law has been extended once, and is due to expire on December 10, \n2003.\n  It is critical that this bill does not expire at the end of this \nyear. Over the past two years, Congress has done tremendous work to \nmake America a safer place and prevent any more terrorist attacks. We \nneed to act today to ensure that Americans are not needlessly \nvulnerable to attacks at airports, schools, and other public buildings.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation to extend the \nUndetectable Firearms Act for the next ten years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1837. A bill to combat money laundering and terrorist financing \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of a bill \nthat I am introducing today, the Combating Money Laundering and \nTerrorist Financing Act of 2003.\n  Money laundering is a significant threat to our country because it \nundermines our national security, promotes corruption and funds \nterrorism. Money laundering operations as a whole include such \nmechanisms as structured transactions, wire fraud, over- and under-\ninvoicing, and other activities designed to defraud and hide profits \nfrom illegal activities. All of these transactions undermine legitimate \nfinancial institutions by promoting corruption, funding criminal and \nterrorist operations, and by providing a method of profiting from \nillegal transactions such as drug trafficking and weapons sales.\n  We know that money laundering is the functional equivalent of a war \nindustry for terrorist groups. Terrorist groups do not function in a \nbubble but will use whatever means available to obtain funding for \ntheir cause. Our attention and rhetoric are focused on identifying and \nhalting those mechanisms used specifically by terrorist organizations \nsuch as charitable organizations, money service businesses and \nalternative remittance systems which are often referred to as hawalas. \nFrankly, the tools used to launder and disguise funds for terrorist \norganizations are similar, and quite often identical to, those used by \nmany drug traffickers and criminal organizations to clean their own \ndirty money.\n  No matter how the funds are obtained and ultimately used, they are \nstill dirty, and if we are ever going to get ahead of the curve, we \nmust design a better way to identify and halt this flow of illegal \nfunds. The bill I am introducing today includes several provisions that \nwill strengthen our current money laundering and terrorist financing \nlaws to enhance our ability to identify and eliminate various avenues \nused to launder money, whether it be for drug traffickers, criminal \norganizations or terrorists.\n  This bill adds several provisions to the list of specified unlawful \nactivities within the RICO statute that serve as predicates for the \nmoney laundering statute including: burglary and embezzlement, illegal \nmoney transmitting businesses, alien smuggling, child exploitation and \nobscenity. It would close a loophole on securities fraud by including \nthe purchase of securities with the sale of securities as a money \nlaundering offense, and adds the unlawful use of Social Security \nnumbers to the list of money laundering offenses.\n  It adds a provision to the civil forfeiture statute to include the \nforfeiture of property outside the U.S. territorial boundaries if it \nwas used in the planning of the terrorist act that occurred within the \njurisdiction of the United States and includes a parallel transaction \nprovision which provides that all parts of a parallel or dependent \nfinancial transaction are considered a money laundering offense if one \npart of that transaction involves the proceeds of an unlawful activity.\n  Our best response to money laundering and terrorist financing threats \nis a comprehensive and coordinated response which must be laid out in \nan effective strategy. This bill also reauthorizes the National Money \nLaundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act through 2006. This yearly \nstrategy must identify the risks and threats we face. Without a \ncomprehensive strategy, we cannot begin to implement laws and \nregulations that will effectively combat money laundering sources and \nshut down the system as a whole. Only when we have a systematic \napproach to money laundering will we be able to avoid the duplication \nand inconsistencies that currently plague our efforts.\n  This legislation is important to identifying particular money \nlaundering operations and putting them out of business. I encourage you \nto pass this legislation to ensure our national security against the \ncontinued threat posed by terrorist financing and financial crimes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1838. A bill to require payments to State and local governments \nfor infrastructure and social services needs in the same amount as the \namount of relief and reconstruction funds provided to Iraq; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, rebuilding Iraq is critical to peace \nand stability in the Mideast and to help win the war on terrorism. \nToday, American families and American cities are also hurting and I \nbelieve they deserve the same assistance we are providing for families \nand cities in Iraq. While keeping our commitments abroad, we must not \nneglect our homeland.\n  Today, President Bush signed into law an $87 billion supplemental \nappropriations bill that includes $20.3 billion for reconstructing Iraq \nand to assist Iraqi families. I opposed this legislation because I do \nnot believe this plan is the most effective way to protect American \nsoldiers and to advance our interests. Providing assistance to help \nrebuild Iraq is the right thing to do; however, we must also provide \nequal consideration and equal funding to resolve America's domestic \nproblems. That is why I am introducing the American Parity Act to \nensure that any additional spending for Iraq's postwar reconstruction \nplan is balanced dollar-for-dollar with new investments in education, \nhealth care, transportation, housing, social services and public safety \nneeds across the United States.\n  President Bush's economic approach has left State and city \ngovernments facing billions in budget deficits forced lay offs, \neducation cuts, Medicaid cuts, reductions in critical social service \nprograms and tax increases.\n  State and city governments need our help to protect their public \nservices, rebuild America's roads and bridges, and ensure resources are \navailable to help unemployed and impoverished Americans. My legislation \nwill authorize payments to States and cities to assist them with their \nsocial service and infrastructure needs in the same amount as provided \nfor relief and reconstruction in Iraq. Local governments will receive \nat least one-third of the total funds authorized.\n  These funds will be used to help America's children, seniors, and \nstruggling families who depend upon affordable health care, quality \neducation and public transportation programs that are facing massive \ncuts in order to balance state and local budgets across the Nation. \nThese funds will assist in the development of our economy and create \njobs.\n  Health insurance has become too expensive. Double-digit increases in \nhealth care premiums make it hard for Americans and businesses alike to \nafford health care. Today, more than 44 million Americans have no \nhealth insurance. More than ever, these Americans need access to \nMedicaid and other health care programs that help with the high cost of \nprescription drugs. However, many of these programs are endangered by \nstate and local budget cuts. The American Parity Act will help State \nand local governments continue to provide health care assistance.\n\n[[Page S14180]]\n\n  In our changing global economy, every American needs access to \nquality schools and advanced skills to succeed in our rapidly changing \neconomy. In order for our American business to grow, we need workers to \nbe more innovative and more productive than those of our competitors. \nMy legislation will help cities provide additional resources to improve \neducational programs, modernize and rebuild crumbling schools, reduce \nclass size, improve special education and help pay teachers.\n  Our Nation is facing an affordable housing crisis. Recent changes in \nthe housing market have limited the availability of affordable rental \nhousing across the country and have dramatically increased the cost of \nthose that remain. In 2001, more than 14 million families spent over \nhalf of their income on housing. This bill will provide funding so that \nstates and cities produce housing for working families.\n  We must show the same commitment to rebuilding Main Street as we have \nshown in rebuilding Iraq. American citizens deserve access to the same \nbenefits and services we are so nobly providing to the people of Iraq. \nThe American Parity Act will help States and cities cope with their \ncurrent fiscal crisis and help ease potential cuts in programs critical \nto the most vulnerable in our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The President has proposed a multibillion dollar \n     reconstruction project for Iraq.\n       (2) The President's plan includes resources to rebuild \n     potable water and wastewater treatment facilities; schools \n     and health facilities; ports and airports; the electric power \n     system, roads, and bridges; railroad infrastructure; solid \n     waste management services; irrigation systems; and selected \n     local government buildings.\n       (3) State and local governments in the United States have \n     their own unmet infrastructure and social services needs.\n       (4) State and local governments represent a significant \n     segment of the national economy whose economic health is \n     essential to national economic prosperity.\n       (5) Present national economic problems have imposed \n     considerable hardships on State and local government budgets.\n       (6) Those governments, because of their own fiscal \n     difficulties, are being forced to take budget-related actions \n     which tend to undermine Federal Government efforts to \n     stimulate the economy.\n       (7) Efforts to stimulate the economy through reductions in \n     Federal Government tax obligations or increased spending on \n     Federal programs are weakened when State and local \n     governments are forced to increase taxes or cut spending.\n       (8) Efforts by the Federal Government to stimulate the \n     economic recovery will be substantially enhanced by a program \n     of emergency Federal Government assistance to State and local \n     governments to help prevent those governments from taking \n     budget-related actions which undermine the Federal Government \n     efforts to stimulate economic recovery.\n       (9) State and local governments deserve, at a minimum, the \n     same level of Federal investment to address infrastructure \n     and social services shortfalls as the amount of relief and \n     reconstruction funds provided to Iraq.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Payments to State and Local Governments.--The Secretary \n     of the Treasury shall, in accordance with the provisions of \n     this Act, make payments to States and local governments to \n     coordinate budget-related actions by such governments with \n     Federal Government efforts to stimulate economic recovery.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriation.--There is authorized to \n     be appropriated to the Secretary of the Treasury for fiscal \n     year 2003 for payments under this Act an amount equal to at \n     least the total amount appropriated for fiscal year 2003 \n     under the heading ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund'' in \n     the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003, \n     and any amounts appropriated for such Fund in any subsequent \n     appropriation Act. Such amounts shall be in addition to, and \n     not in lieu of, other amounts appropriated for payments to \n     States and local governments.\n       (c) Availability to Local Governments.--Not less than one-\n     third of the amount appropriated pursuant to the \n     authorization in subsection (b) shall be made available to \n     local governments under the applicable laws of a given State.\n\n     SEC. 3. ALLOCATION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish a formula, \n     within 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     for determining the allocation of payments under this Act. \n     The formula shall give priority weight to the following \n     factors:\n       (1) The unemployment rate in relation to the national \n     average unemployment rate.\n       (2) The duration of the unemployment rate above such \n     average.\n       (3) Median income.\n       (4) Population.\n       (5) The poverty rate.\n\n     SEC. 4. USE OF FUNDS BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Funds received under this Act may be used \n     only for priority expenditures. For purposes of this Act, the \n     term ``priority expenditures'' means only--\n       (1) ordinary and necessary maintenance and operating \n     expenses for--\n       (A) primary, secondary, or higher education, including \n     school building renovation;\n       (B) public safety;\n       (C) public health, including hospitals and public health \n     laboratories;\n       (D) social services for the disadvantaged or aged;\n       (E) roads, transportation, and water infrastructure; and\n       (F) housing; and\n       (2) ordinary and necessary capital expenditures authorized \n     by law.\n       (b) Certifications by State and Local Governments.--The \n     Secretary of the Treasury may accept a certification by the \n     chief executive officer of a State or local government that \n     the State or local government has used the funds received by \n     it under this Act only for priority expenditures, unless the \n     Secretary determines that such certification is not \n     sufficiently reliable to enable the Secretary to carry out \n     this Act. The Secretary shall prescribe by rule the time and \n     manner in which the certification must be filed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14180-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14180-S14181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 260--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n  SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SHOULD TAKE ACTION TO REMOVE \n   DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS CONTAINING EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS FROM THE MARKET\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. McCain) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 260\n\n       Whereas, a RAND Corporation study commissioned by the \n     Department of Health and Human Services found no evidence for \n     long-term efficacy of ephedrine alkaloids for weight loss and \n     that there is no credible science showing that ephedrine or \n     dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, as those \n     products are used by the general population, improve athletic \n     performance;\n       Whereas ephedrine alkaloids can--\n       (1) increase heart rate and blood pressure;\n       (2) stimulate the central nervous system; and\n       (3) lead to strokes, seizures, psychosis, cardiac \n     arrhythmia, heart attacks, and deaths;\n       Whereas the Food and Drug Administration has received \n     approximately 16,500 adverse events reports for consumers who \n     have used dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, \n     including approximately 155 reports of death;\n       Whereas the Inspector General of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services has noted with concern that about 60 \n     percent of persons suffering adverse events related to the \n     use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are \n     under the age of 40;\n       Whereas a study published in the Journal of Neurology found \n     that there may be an association between the use of more than \n     32 milligrams per day of ephedra and an increased risk of \n     hemorragic stroke, but the daily dose recommended by the \n     dietary supplement industry is about 3 times that much;\n       Whereas a study published in Mayo Clinical Proceedings \n     found that in 36 out of 37 serious cardiovascular events \n     associated with ephedrine alkaloids examined, the patient had \n     consumed doses of a dietary supplement containing ephedrine \n     alkaloids at or below the dose recommended by the \n     manufacturer;\n       Whereas a study commissioned by the Food and Drug \n     Administration to review reports of ephedrine alkaloid-\n     related adverse events (including serious adverse events such \n     as seizures, strokes, and death), which resulted in \n     publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of an \n     article in 2000, found that 31 percent of the reports were \n     definitely or probably related to ephedrine alkaloid use and \n     an additional 31 percent were possibly related to ephedrine \n     alkaloid use;\n       Whereas a study published in the Annals of Internal \n     Medicine concluded that--\n       (1) the risk for an adverse reaction after the use of \n     ephedra is substantially greater than with other herbal \n     products; and\n       (2) the sale of ephedra as a dietary supplement should be \n     restricted or banned to prevent serious adverse reactions in \n     the general population;\n       Whereas approximately 30 members of the United States Army \n     have died after taking a dietary supplement containing \n     ephedrine alkaloids, and the Department of Defense has banned \n     the sale of dietary supplements\n\n[[Page S14181]]\n\n     containing ephedrine alkaloids from military commissaries \n     worldwide because of safety concerns;\n       Whereas the American Medical Association has called on the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to ban the sale of \n     dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids;\n       Whereas the National Football League, the International \n     Federation of Football Associations, the National Collegiate \n     Athletics Association, the Commissioner of the National \n     Association of Baseball with regard to the Minor Leagues, \n     Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and \n     the International Olympics Committee have banned the use of \n     ephedrine alkaloids by their athletes;\n       Whereas 3 States, representing 65,000,000 Americans, have \n     banned dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids;\n       Whereas major drug store chains representing 17,300 stores \n     nationwide have pulled ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary \n     supplements from their shelves;

Res. 262\n\n       Whereas the currency of the People's Republic of China has \n     been tightly pegged to the United States dollar at the same \n     fixed level of 8.28 yuan to the dollar since 1994;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has significantly intervened in foreign exchange markets in \n     order to hold the value of their currency within its tight \n     and artificial trading band, resulting in enormous growth in \n     China's dollar reserves, estimated to be over \n     $346,000,000,000 as of June 2003, an increase by 43 percent \n     from June 2002;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has seen significant \n     increases in production capability, productivity, and foreign \n     direct investment since initially pegging the yuan to the \n     dollar, which would generally lead toward upward pressure on \n     the currency value;\n       Whereas this peg, in the face of growing pressure, clearly \n     represents a manipulation of China's currency;\n       Whereas the undervaluation of China's currency distorts the \n     value of exports from China and the price of foreign products \n     for Chinese consumers;\n       Whereas the value of China's currency has had and continues \n     to have a negative impact on the United States manufacturing \n     sector, contributing to significant job losses and business \n     closures;\n       Whereas the G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank \n     Governors in September of this year stated that ``more \n     flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major \n     countries or economic areas to promote smooth and widespread \n     adjustments in the international financial system, based on \n     market mechanisms.''; and\n       Whereas the market-based valuation of currencies is a key \n     component to the health of global trade and the stability of \n     the world economy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Secretary of the Treasury to initiate \n     expedited negotiations with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, bilaterally or through the International \n     Monetary Fund, for the purpose of ensuring a market-based \n     exchange rate valuation to permit effective balance of \n     payments adjustments and to eliminate the unfair advantage; \n     and\n       (2) encourages the People's Republic of China to continue \n     to act on its commitments to the trade rules and principles \n     of the international community of which it is now a member.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Sense of the \nSenate resolution to encourage the Department of the Treasury to \ninitiate expedited negotiations with the People's Republic of China on \nestablishing a market-based currency valuation and to fulfill its \ncommitments under international trade agreements.\n  The resolution explains why China's currency policy is an unfair \nmanipulation which violates international trading rules and puts \nAmerican manufacturers at a disadvantage. We cannot continue to allow \nthis exploitation to continue to the detriment of our workers. \nTherefore, this resolution sends a strong message to the administration \nthat we must increase our efforts to bring about a market-based \nvaluation of China's currency.\n  In an open trading system, manipulation of currency--either by \nfrequent intervention or by a calculated undervaluation of one's \ncurrency through a fixed exchange rate--undermines the concept of \ncomparative advantage by creating market distortions. These disruptions \nnot only affect trade but also result in the loss of real jobs for U.S. \nmanufacturers. This is particularly devastating in my State, which has \nlost over 17,300 manufacturing jobs since July 2000.\n  Congress granted Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for China \nbecause we knew that China would become a major player in international \nmarkets whether we wanted them to or not. After all, China already \nenjoyed total access to our market while we did not have the same \nbenefit. Perhaps most importantly, we supported PNTR because a China in \nthe World Trade Organization is bound by the same international trade \nrules as the United States or any of our other trading partners. While \nmany were optimistic about the increased market access to the world's \nlargest population, few dared to expect this to be an easy path.\n  I have heard from company after company who have had to face the \nreality that they can no longer compete with unfairly priced Chinese \nproducts. Some argue they were forced to close their doors because of \nChina's low labor costs, and others argue it is the lack of labor and \nenvironmental regulations in China that makes us uncompetitive. \nHowever, the full extent of China's advantage is the combination of an \nartifically undervalued currency,\n\n[[Page S14182]]\n\nunfair non-tariff barriers, and low cost of production.\n  While we all want wages, labor rights, and environmental protection \nto improve in China, the biggest concern that every manufacturer brings \nto my attention is that they can't compete with a currency \nundervaluation that economists estimate could be as high as 40 percent. \nThis serves as a de facto subsidy that no competitor can surmount.\n  The damage manufacturing has sustained is nothing short of alarming. \nFrom July 2000 through July 2003, almost 2.7 million U.S. manufacturing \njobs have been eliminated. New England alone lost more than 214,000 \nmanufacturing jobs between June 1993 through June 2003, with fully 78 \npercent of those losses, 166,000 jobs, occurring since January of 2001. \nThe job losses have been so focused on the manufacturing sector that a \nmanufacturing worker had a 50 times greater chance of losing his or her \njob than did other workers.\n  For these reasons, I have been among a core group in Congress that \nhas called on the administration to take strong action with regards to \nthe foreign manipulation of currencies. I was pleased to work with my \ncolleagues to ask the Treasury Secretary to make China's currency the \ntop priority of his recent trip to Asia.\n\n  Secretary Snow took the message to China that the manipulation of its \ncurrency must end and that China should take steps to freely float its \ncurrency. I was pleased with his action and I was further encouraged by \nthe fact that President Bush raised the same concern with his \ncounterpart at the APEC Summit.\n  The administration has placed a high priority on this issue, but I am \nconcerned about the findings of Treasury's recent report on currency \nmanipulation. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to determine \nyearly if foreign countries ``manipulate the rate of exchange between \ntheir currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing \neffective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive \nadvantage in international trade.'' The law then requires that Treasury \ninitiate expedited negotiations with these countries.\n  However, in the face of compelling evidence of the deliberate \ncurrency manipulation by the Chinese government to gain an unfair trade \nadvantage, that report downplayed the nature of China's exchange rate \npolicy, stating that ``no major trading partner of the United States \nmeets the technical requirements for designation.'' I believe that the \nfacts clearly illustrate that the definition has been met.\n  China has seen significant increases in production capability, \nproductivity, and foreign direct investment since the initial peg, \nwhich would generally lead towards upward pressure on the currency \nvalue. In response, the government of the People's Republic of China \nhas had to significantly intervene in its foreign exchange markets in \norder to hold the value of their currency within its tight and \nartificial trading band. This manipulation has resulted in enormous \ngrowth in China's dollar reserves, estimated to be over $346 billion as \nof June 2003, an increase of 43 percent from June 2002.\n  In addition, China's policy is clearly in violation of article IV of \nthe WTO which says members ``shall not by exchange rate action \nfrustrate the intent'' of the WTO, which is to create fair and open \nmarkets for global commerce. China has joined the world trading \nsystem--it must now play by its rules and adhere to these principles.\n  This resolution is about restoring some sense of order to the global \ntrading community which has been distorted by the policy of the Chinese \ngovernment to unfairly subsidize every single export through the \nmanipulation of its currency. It is my hope that the strong message \nsent by this Sense of the Senate will result in a renewed vigor and \nresolve to bring China's currency into the free market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/06/senate-section/article/S14182-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2115.

It is the sense of \n     Congress that after the periods of time specified in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, consideration will \n     be given to such additional funding for these programs as may \n     be necessary.\n       (g) Rongelap.--\n       (1) In the joint resolution of January 14, 1986 (Public Law \n     99-239) Congress provided that because Rongelap was directly \n     affected\n\n[[Page S14189]]\n\n     by fallout from a 1954 United States thermonuclear test and \n     because the Rongelap people remain unconvinced that it is \n     safe to continue to live on Rongelap Island, it is the intent \n     of Congress to take such steps (if any) as may be necessary \n     to overcome the effects of such fallout on the habitability \n     of Rongelap Island, and to restore Rongelap Island, if \n     necessary, so that it can be safely inhabited. Accordingly, \n     it is the expectation of the Congress that the Government of \n     the Marshall Islands shall use such portion of the funds \n     specified in Article II, section 1(e) of the subsidiary \n     agreement for the implementation of section 177 of the \n     Compact as are necessary for the purpose of contracting with \n     a qualified scientist or group of scientists to review the \n     data collected by the Department of Energy relating to \n     radiation levels and other conditions on Rongelap Island \n     resulting from the thermonuclear test. It is the expectation \n     of the Congress that the Government of the Marshall Islands, \n     after consultation with the people of Rongelap, shall select \n     the party to review such data, and shall contract for such \n     review and for submission of a report to the President of the \n     United States and the Congress as to the results thereof.\n       (2) In the joint resolution of January 14, 1986 (Public Law \n     99-239) Congress provided that the purpose of the review \n     referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be to \n     establish whether the data cited in support of the \n     conclusions as to the habitability of Rongelap Island, as set \n     forth in the Department of Energy report entitled: ``The \n     Meaning of Radiation for Those Atolls in the Northern Part of \n     the Marshall Islands That Were Surveyed in 1978'', dated \n     November 1982, are adequate and whether such conclusions are \n     fully supported by the data.

Congress also notes and \n     specifically endorses the preamble to the U.S.-FSM Compact \n     and the U.S.-RMI Compact, which affirms that the governments \n     of the parties to the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI \n     Compact are founded upon respect for human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms for all.

Any determination of inadmissibility or \n     deportability shall be based on reasonable statutory grounds \n     and shall be subject to appropriate administrative and \n     judicial review within the Federated States of Micronesia. If \n     a citizen or national of the United States is a spouse of a \n     citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Government \n     of the Federated States of Micronesia shall allow the United \n     States citizen spouse to establish residence. Should the \n     Federated States of Micronesia citizen spouse predecease the \n     United States citizen spouse during the marriage, the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia shall allow \n     the United States citizen spouse to continue to reside in the \n     Federated States of Micronesia.\n       (b) In enacting any laws or imposing any requirements with \n     respect to citizens and nationals of the United States \n     entering the Federated States of Micronesia under subsection \n     (a) of this section, including any grounds of inadmissibility \n     or deportability, the Government of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia shall accord to such citizens and nationals of the \n     United States treatment no less favorable than that accorded \n     to citizens of other countries.\n       (c) Consistent with subsection (a) of this section, with \n     respect to citizens and nationals of the United States \n     seeking to engage in employment or invest in the Federated \n     States of Micronesia, the Government of the Federated States \n     of Micronesia shall adopt immigration-related procedures no \n     less favorable than those adopted by the Government of the \n     United States with respect to citizens of the Federated \n     States of Micronesia seeking employment in the United States.\n     Section 143\n       Any person who relinquishes, or otherwise loses, his United \n     States nationality or citizenship, or his Federated States of \n     Micronesia citizenship, shall be ineligible to receive the \n     privileges set forth in sections 141 and 142. Any such person \n     may apply for admission to the United States or the Federated \n     States of Micronesia, as the case may be, in accordance with \n     any other applicable laws of the United States or the \n     Federated States of Micronesia relating to immigration of \n     aliens from other countries.

In addition to diplomatic missions and \n     representation, the Governments may establish and maintain \n     other offices and designate other representatives on terms \n     and in locations as may be mutually agreed.\n     Section 152\n       (a) Any citizen or national of the United States who, \n     without authority of the United States, acts as the agent of \n     the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia with \n     regard to matters specified in the provisions of the Foreign \n     Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended (22 U.S.C. 611 et \n     seq.), that apply with respect to an agent of a foreign \n     principal shall be subject to the requirements of such Act. \n     Failure to comply with such requirements shall subject such \n     citizen or national to the same penalties and provisions of \n     law as apply in the case of the failure of such an agent of a \n     foreign principal to comply with such requirements. For \n     purposes of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, the \n     Federated States of Micronesia shall be considered to be a \n     foreign country.\n       (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a \n     citizen or national of the United States employed by the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia with respect \n     to whom the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia \n     from time to time certifies to the Government of the United \n     States that such citizen or national is an employee of the \n     Federated States of Micronesia whose principal duties are \n     other than those matters specified in the Foreign Agents \n     Registration Act of 1938, as amended, that apply with respect \n     to an agent of a foreign principal. The agency or officer of \n     the United States receiving such certifications shall cause \n     them to be filed with the Attorney General, who shall \n     maintain a publicly available list of the persons so \n     certified.\n\n                               Article VI\n\n                        Environmental Protection\n\n     Section 161\n       The Governments of the United States and the Federated \n     States of Micronesia declare that it is their policy to \n     promote efforts to prevent or eliminate damage to the \n     environment and biosphere and to enrich understanding of the \n     natural resources of the Federated States of Micronesia.

Prior to any decision pursuant to this subsection, the \n     views of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia \n     shall be sought and considered to the extent practicable. If \n     the President grants such an exemption, to the extent \n     practicable, a report with his reasons for granting such \n     exemption shall be given promptly to the Government of the \n     Federated States of Micronesia.\n       (f) The laws of the United States referred to in section \n     161(a)(3) shall apply to the activities of the Government of \n     the United States under this Compact, as amended, and its \n     related agreements only to the extent provided for in this \n     section.\n     Section 162\n       The Government of the Federated States of Micronesia may \n     bring an action for judicial review of any administrative \n     agency action or any activity of the Government of the United \n     States pursuant to section 161(a) for enforcement of the \n     obligations of the Government of the United States arising \n     thereunder.

Any person described in section 141(a)(5) who \n     is not a citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia shall \n     be subject to United States laws relating to selective \n     service.\n     Section 342\n       The Government of the United States shall have enrolled, at \n     any one time, at least one qualified student from the \n     Federated States of Micronesia, as may be nominated by the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, in each of:\n       (a) The United States Coast Guard Academy pursuant to 14 \n     U.S.C. 195.\n       (b) The United States Merchant Marine Academy pursuant to \n     46 U.S.C. 1295(b)(6), provided that the provisions of 46 \n     U.S.C. 1295b(b)(6)(C) shall not apply to the enrollment of \n     students pursuant to section 342(b) of this Compact, as \n     amended.\n\n                               Article V\n\n                           General Provisions\n\n     Section 351\n       (a) The Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Federated States of Micronesia shall continue to \n     maintain a Joint Committee empowered to consider disputes \n     arising under the implementation of this Title and its \n     related agreements.\n       (b) The membership of the Joint Committee shall comprise \n     selected senior officials of the two Governments. The senior \n     United States military commander in the Pacific area shall be \n     the senior United States member of the Joint Committee. For \n     the meetings of the Joint Committee, each of the two \n     Governments may designate additional or alternate \n     representatives as appropriate for the subject matter under \n     consideration.\n       (c) Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the Joint Committee \n     shall meet annually at a time and place to be designated, \n     after appropriate consultation, by the Government of the \n     United States. The Joint Committee also shall meet promptly \n     upon request of either\n\n[[Page S14205]]\n\n     of its members. The Joint Committee shall follow such \n     procedures, including the establishment of functional \n     subcommittees, as the members may from time to time agree. \n     Upon notification by the Government of the United States, the \n     Joint Committee of the United States and the Federated States \n     of Micronesia shall meet promptly in a combined session with \n     the Joint Committee established and maintained by the \n     Government of the United States and the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands to consider matters within the jurisdiction \n     of the two Joint Committees.\n       (d) Unresolved issues in the Joint Committee shall be \n     referred to the Governments for resolution, and the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia shall be \n     afforded, on an expeditious basis, an opportunity to raise \n     its concerns with the United States Secretary of Defense \n     personally regarding any unresolved issue which threatens its \n     continued association with the Government of the United \n     States.\n     Section 352\n       In the exercise of its authority and responsibility under \n     Title Three, the Government of the United States shall accord \n     due respect to the authority and responsibility of the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia under Titles \n     One, Two and Four and to the responsibility of the Government \n     of the Federated States of Micronesia to assure the well-\n     being of its people.\n     Section 353\n       (a) The Government of the United States shall not include \n     the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia as a \n     named party to a formal declaration of war, without that \n     Government's consent.\n       (b) Absent such consent, this Compact, as amended, is \n     without prejudice, on the ground of belligerence or the \n     existence of a state of war, to any claims for damages which \n     are advanced by the citizens, nationals or Government of the \n     Federated States of Micronesia, which arise out of armed \n     conflict subsequent to November 3, 1986, and which are:\n       (1) petitions to the Government of the United States for \n     redress; or\n       (2) claims in any manner against the government, citizens, \n     nationals or entities of any third country.\n       (c) Petitions under section 353(b)(1) shall be treated as \n     if they were made by citizens of the United States.\n     Section 354\n       (a) The Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Federated States of Micronesia are jointly committed \n     to continue their security and defense relations, as set \n     forth in this Title. Accordingly, it is the intention of the \n     two countries that the provisions of this Title shall remain \n     binding as long as this Compact, as amended, remains in \n     effect, and thereafter as mutually agreed, unless earlier \n     terminated by mutual agreement pursuant to section 441, or \n     amended pursuant to Article III of Title Four. If at any \n     time the Government of the United States, or the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, acting \n     unilaterally, terminates this Title, such unilateral \n     termination shall be considered to be termination of the \n     entire Compact, in which case the provisions of section \n     442 and 452 (in the case of termination by the Government \n     of the United States) or sections 443 and 453 (in the case \n     of termination by the Government of the Federated States \n     of Micronesia), with the exception of paragraph (3) of \n     subsection (a) of section 452 or paragraph (3) of \n     subsection (a) of section 453, as the case may be, shall \n     apply.\n       (b) The Government of the United States recognizes, in view \n     of the special relationship between the Government of the \n     United States and the Government of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, and in view of the existence of the separate \n     agreement regarding mutual security concluded with the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia pursuant to \n     sections 321 and 323, that, even if this Title should \n     terminate, any attack on the Federated States of Micronesia \n     during the period in which such separate agreement is in \n     effect, would constitute a threat to the peace and security \n     of the entire region and a danger to the United States. In \n     the event of such an attack, the Government of the United \n     States would take action to meet the danger to the United \n     States and to the Federated States of Micronesia in \n     accordance with its constitutional processes.\n       (c) As reflected in Article 21(1)(b) of the Trust Fund \n     Agreement, the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia further \n     recognize, in view of the special relationship between their \n     countries, that even if this Title should terminate, the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia shall \n     refrain from actions which the Government of the United \n     States determines, after appropriate consultation with that \n     Government, to be incompatible with its authority and \n     responsibility for security and defense matters in or \n     relating to the Federated States of Micronesia or the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n\n                               TITLE FOUR\n\n                           GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                               Article I\n\n                      Approval and Effective Date\n\n     Section 411\n       Pursuant to section 432 of the Compact and subject to \n     subsection (e) of section 461 of the Compact, as amended, the \n     Compact, as amended, shall come into effect upon mutual \n     agreement between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia subsequent \n     to completion of the following:\n       (a) Approval by the Government of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia in accordance with its constitutional processes.\n       (b) Approval by the Government of the United States in \n     accordance with its constitutional processes.\n\n                               Article II\n\n                   Conference and Dispute Resolution\n\n     Section 421\n       The Government of the United States shall confer promptly \n     at the request of the Government of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia and that Government shall confer promptly at the \n     request of the Government of the United States on matters \n     relating to the provisions of this Compact, as amended, or of \n     its related agreements.\n     Section 422\n       In the event the Government of the United States or the \n     Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, after \n     conferring pursuant to section 421, determines that there is \n     a dispute and gives written notice thereof, the two \n     Governments shall make a good faith effort to resolve the \n     dispute between themselves.\n     Section 423\n       If a dispute between the Government of the United States \n     and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia \n     cannot be resolved within 90 days of written notification in \n     the manner provided in section 422, either party to the \n     dispute may refer it to arbitration in accordance with \n     section 424.\n     Section 424\n       Should a dispute be referred to arbitration as provided for \n     in section 423, an Arbitration Board shall be established for \n     the purpose of hearing the dispute and rendering a decision \n     which shall be binding upon the two parties to the dispute \n     unless the two parties mutually agree that the decision shall \n     be advisory. Arbitration shall occur according to the \n     following terms:\n       (a) An Arbitration Board shall consist of a Chairman and \n     two other members, each of whom shall be a citizen of a party \n     to the dispute. Each of the two Governments which is a party \n     to the dispute shall appoint one member to the Arbitration \n     Board. If either party to the dispute does not fulfill the \n     appointment requirements of this section within 30 days of \n     referral of the dispute to arbitration pursuant to section \n     423, its member on the Arbitration Board shall be selected \n     from its own standing list by the other party to the dispute. \n     Each Government shall maintain a standing list of 10 \n     candidates. The parties to the dispute shall jointly appoint \n     a Chairman within 15 days after selection of the other \n     members of the Arbitration Board. Failing agreement on a \n     Chairman, the Chairman shall be chosen by lot from the \n     standing lists of the parties to the dispute within 5 days \n     after such failure.\n       (b) Unless otherwise provided in this Compact, as amended, \n     or its related agreements, the Arbitration Board shall have \n     jurisdiction to hear and render its final determination on \n     all disputes arising exclusively under Articles I, II, III, \n     IV and V of Title One, Title Two, Title Four, and their \n     related agreements.\n       (c) Each member of the Arbitration Board shall have one \n     vote. Each decision of the Arbitration Board shall be reached \n     by majority vote.\n       (d) In determining any legal issue, the Arbitration Board \n     may have reference to international law and, in such \n     reference, shall apply as guidelines the provisions set forth \n     in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of \n     Justice.\n       (e) The Arbitration Board shall adopt such rules for its \n     proceedings as it may deem appropriate and necessary, but \n     such rules shall not contravene the provisions of this \n     Compact, as amended. Unless the parties provide otherwise by \n     mutual agreement, the Arbitration Board shall endeavor to \n     render its decision within 30 days after the conclusion of \n     arguments. The Arbitration Board shall make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law and its members may issue dissenting \n     or individual opinions. Except as may be otherwise decided by \n     the Arbitration Board, one-half of all costs of the \n     arbitration shall be borne by the Government of the United \n     States and the remainder shall be borne by the Government of \n     the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\n                              Article III\n\n                               Amendment\n\n     Section 431\n       The provisions of this Compact, as amended, may be further \n     amended by mutual agreement of the Government of the United \n     States and the Government of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, in accordance with their respective \n     constitutional processes.\n\n                               Article IV\n\n                              Termination\n\n     Section 441\n       This Compact, as amended, may be terminated by mutual \n     agreement of the Government of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia and the Government of the United States, in \n     accordance with their respective constitutional processes. \n     Such mutual termination of this Compact, as amended, shall be \n     without prejudice to the continued application of section 451 \n     of this Compact, as amended, and the provisions of the \n     Compact, as amended, set forth therein.\n     Section 442\n       Subject to section 452, this Compact, as amended, may be \n     terminated by the Government of the United States in \n     accordance\n\n[[Page S14206]]\n\n     with its constitutional processes.

Any such \n     person may apply for admission to the United States or the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands, as the case may be, in \n     accordance with any other applicable laws of the United \n     States or the Republic of the Marshall Islands relating to \n     immigration of aliens from other countries.

For \n     purposes of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands shall be considered to be a \n     foreign country.\n       (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a \n     citizen or national of the United States employed by the \n     Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands with \n     respect to whom the Government of the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands from time to time certifies to the \n     Government of the United States that such citizen or national \n     is an employee of the Republic of the Marshall Islands whose \n     principal duties are other than those matters specified in \n     the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, that \n     apply with respect to an agent of a foreign principal. The \n     agency or officer of the United States receiving such \n     certifications shall cause them to be filed with the Attorney \n     General, who shall maintain a publicly available list of the \n     persons so certified.\n\n[[Page S14210]]\n\n                               Article VI\n\n                        Environmental Protection\n\n     Section 161\n       The Governments of the United States and the Republic of \n     the Marshall Islands declare that it is their policy to \n     promote efforts to prevent or eliminate damage to the \n     environment and biosphere and to enrich understanding of the \n     natural resources of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

In the event of such an attack, the Government of the \n     United States would take action to meet the danger to the \n     United States and to the Republic of the Marshall Islands in \n     accordance with its constitutional processes.\n       (c) As reflected in Article 21(1)(b) of the Trust Fund \n     Agreement, the Government of\n\n[[Page S14217]]\n\n     the United States and the Government of the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands further recognize, in view of the special \n     relationship between their countries, that even if this Title \n     should terminate, the Government of Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands shall refrain from actions which the Government of \n     the United States determines, after appropriate consultation \n     with that Government, to be incompatible with its authority \n     and responsibility for security and defense matters in or \n     relating to the Republic of the Marshall Islands or the \n     Federated States of Micronesia.\n\n                               TITLE FOUR\n\n                           GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                               Article I\n\n                      Approval and Effective Date\n\n     Section 411\n       Pursuant to section 432 of the Compact and subject to \n     subsection (e) of section 461 of the Compact, as amended, the \n     Compact, as amended, shall come into effect upon mutual \n     agreement between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands subsequent \n     to completion of the following:\n       (a) Approval by the Government of the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands in accordance with its constitutional \n     processes.\n       (b) Approval by the Government of the United States in \n     accordance with its constitutional processes.\n\n                               Article II\n\n                   Conference and Dispute Resolution\n\n     Section 421\n       The Government of the United States shall confer promptly \n     at the request of the Government of the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands and that Government shall confer promptly at \n     the request of the Government of the United States on matters \n     relating to the provisions of this Compact, as amended, or of \n     its related agreements.\n     Section 422\n       In the event the Government of the United States or the \n     Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, after \n     conferring pursuant to section 421, determines that there is \n     a dispute and gives written notice thereof, the two \n     Governments shall make a good faith effort to resolve the \n     dispute between themselves.\n     Section 423\n       If a dispute between the Government of the United States \n     and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n     cannot be resolved within 90 days of written notification in \n     the manner provided in section 422, either party to the \n     dispute may refer it to arbitration in accordance with \n     section 424.\n     Section 424\n       Should a dispute be referred to arbitration as provided for \n     in section 423, an Arbitration Board shall be established for \n     the purpose of hearing the dispute and rendering a decision \n     which shall be binding upon the two parties to the dispute \n     unless the two parties mutually agree that the decision shall \n     be advisory.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 350, H.J. Res. \n63.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 63) to approve the ``Compact \n     of Free Association, as amended between the Government of the \n     United States of America and the Government of the Federated \n     States of Micronesia,'' and the ``Compact of Free \n     Association, as amended between the Government of the United \n     States of America and the Government of the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands,'' and otherwise to amend Public Law 99-239, \n     and to appropriate for the purposes of amended Public Law 99-\n     239 for fiscal years ending on or before September 30, 2023, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of H.J. \nRes. 63, legislation to approve and extend the Compacts of Free \nAssociation between the United States and the Federated States of \nMicronesia, FSM, and the United States and the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands, RMI. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources with jurisdiction over these islands, I am pleased that we \nare ready to pass this legislative package. We have made great progress \nin a short amount of time. The administration did not transmit the \njoint resolution to the Senate until July 14, 2003, and the original \nCompact expired on September 30. Since that time, we have been on an \nextension. However, in just over 3 months, Congress has completed its \nwork and is now poised to enact the agreements that will govern our \nmutually beneficial relationship for the next 20 years.\n  The legislation now before the Senate encompasses a broad array of \nimportant policy issues, including funding, education, labor, disaster \nassistance, and immigration matters. Consequently, a number of \ncommittees have assisted the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in \nreaching this bipartisan agreement. For helping us resolve these \nnumerous issues, I would like to thank Budget Committee Chairman \nNickles and Ranking Member Senator Conrad; Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Senator Kennedy; \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Senator Harkin; and \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee Chairman Inhofe and Ranking \nmember Senator Jeffords. Thanks also to the staff from these committees \nfor their assistance.\n  I must of course express my appreciation to the members of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. In particular, I would like to \ncommend the leadership, provided by Senator Bingaman, the ranking \nmember of the committee and Senator Craig, chair of the Public Lands \nand Forests Subcommittee. A special thanks to Senator Akaka, a great \nfriend and voice for the islands. The committee is grateful for his \nassistance in this effort. Finally, I would like to thank Kellie \nDonnelly and Allen Stayman of the committee staff for their hard work \nand dedication throughout this process.\n  Enactment of the amended Compacts will continue a remarkable \nrelationship first forged after World War II. It is important to \nremember that these islands were occupied by Japan and experienced some \nof the bloodiest fighting during World War II. After the war, the \nislands were placed under the United Nations' trusteeship system. The \nUnited States served as U.N. trustee and in that capacity, aided the \nislands' transition into self-governing nations, freely associated with \nthe United States. With the ratification of the original Compact of \nFree Association in 1986, a unique relationship with these islands was \nformed.\n  The Compact of Free Association has guided our Nation's relationship \nwith the FSM and RMI for the past 17 years. Most would agree that the \noriginal Compact has been a success. Indeed, the Compact has achieved \nits goals of, 1, establishing full self-governance for the islands and \nending the U.N. trusteeship; and 2, securing our mutual defense \ninterests. One final goal remains, to assist Micronesia and the \nMarshall Islands in their efforts to advance economic self-sufficiency. \nThe amended Compacts aim to achieve this goal.\n  The amended Compacts also seek to improve upon the original. After \nnearly 20 years of free association, the United States has learned a \ngreat deal and has identified areas in need of improvement. The \nlegislation now before us continues U.S. economic assistance and each \nnation, including the United States, has increased oversight and \naccountability responsibilities via the Joint Economic Management \nCommittees that have been established.\n  In order to realize the goal of economic self-reliance for the \nislands, the amended Compacts establish and capitalize trust funds for \nthe FSM and RMI, respectively. Properly managed, the trust funds will \nprovide an ongoing source of revenue when annual payments by the United \nStates end in 2023.\n  H.J. Res. 63 further provides annual funding to address the migration \nimpacts to neighboring Hawaii, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and \nAmerican Samoa. In the wake of September 11, the Compacts' immigration \nprovisions have been strengthened. In addition, funding is provided for \nfood importation programs and judicial training.\n  Importantly, the amended Compacts maintain our Nation's defense \nrights in the western Pacific. It should be noted that the FSM and RMI \nhave proven to be two of our country's most steadfast\n\n[[Page S14223]]\n\nallies in this region of the world. The United States has a ``strategic \ndenial right,'' that is, the right to deny access to the islands by the \nmilitary forces of other nations. In addition, the United States has a \n``defense veto'' that allows our Government to veto local actions that \nare determined to be incompatible with our defense responsibilities. \nThe amended Compacts also seek to continue access to the U.S. military \nfacilities at Kwajalein for the next 50 to 70 years.\n  The major policy issues of education and disaster assistance that are \naddressed in the amended Compacts have a very real impact on the daily \nlives of Micronesian and Marshallese citizens. Federal education \nprograms have been available to the FSM and the RMI under the current \nCompact since 1986 and the administration testified that it assumed \ntheir continuation when it renegotiated the Compact. The Compact's goal \nof moving the islands to economic self-sufficiency will fail without \nthese programs or funds to replace them.\n  In response to concerns expressed by the House and Senate \nEducation Committees, we have reached agreement on an alternative \napproach to the education issue. The amended Compacts maintain the \nvital education programs of Pell Grants and the Individuals with \nDisabilities and Education Act. The remaining Federal formula grant \neducation programs are terminated. In their place, a straight \nauthorization is provided, $12,230,000 for the FSM and $6,100,000 for \nthe RMI. This authorization creates a new discretionary grant program \nfor the islands. The intent is to shift funding for these island's \nprograms from their formula allocation of the national appropriation \nfor these programs, to a separate appropriation of equal value.\n\n  In both chambers, the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittees, which have funded the education programs for the islands \nfor the past 17 years, have agreed to assist in funding this new \napproach. Once appropriated, the education funding would be disbursed \nand monitored in accordance with the Compact's fiscal procedures \nagreements with the FSM and RMI, respectively.\n  Islands are prone to natural disasters such as typhoons and, \nsurprisingly, droughts. Disaster assistance, then, is of the utmost \nimportance. In approving the original Compact, Congress ensured FEMA \nassistance for both the FSM and RMI. Clearly, some form of disaster \nassistance is necessary for infrastructure repair, to promote the goal \nof economic self-sufficiency, and to protect our investments.\n  As transmitted by the administration, the amended Compacts replaced \nFEMA with the U.S. AID's office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, OFDA. \nBecause of the Energy Committee's concerns with OFDA's lack of \nreconstruction capability, the committee reinstated FEMA's services for \nthe FSM and RMI. Only last week, the administration submitted an \nalternative proposal for disaster assistance that includes both FEMA \nand OFDA participation. While the proposal may be workable, it would be \npremature to adopt it at this time. The legislation now before the \nSenate maintains FEMA's services for a period of 5 years. During this \ntime, the administration will negotiate disaster assistance that \nprovisions with the Governments of the FSM and RMI. It is the \nCommittee's expectation that an agreement will be concluded \nexpeditiously and if progress is not made in a timely fashion, the \ncommittee may conduct an oversight hearing on the matter. At the end of \n5 years though, if a conclusion is not reached and enacted during that \ntime period, the administration's hybrid proposal will be triggered.\n  I am pleased that the amended Compacts will soon be signed by the \nPresident, and I thank my colleagues for their support of this \nsignificant legislative package.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of the \nCompact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, legislation that \nwill extend and strengthen our Nation's special relationship with two \nyoung Pacific Island nations, the Federated States of Micronesia, FSM, \nand the Republic of the Marshall Islands, RMI.\n  The special ties between these islands and the United States have a \nlong history, from the 19th Century New England whaling industry, \nthrough the terrible years of World War II, to the period of United \nStates administration under the United Nations Trusteeship system. From \n1947 to 1986, the U.S. governed these islands on behalf of the U.N. and \nwas responsible for promoting the political, economic, and social \ndevelopment of the inhabitants. In 1986, the U.S. fulfilled its \nobligations to the U.N. with implementation of the Compact of Free \nAssociation, approved by Public Law 99-239. The Compact formally ended \nU.S. administration and allowed the FSM and RMI to achieve self-\ngovernment and international recognition. The Compact also allowed the \nU.S. to continue the special security relationship forged during the \nTrusteeship. Now 17 years later, the Compact continues to provide for \nmutual defense and for political and economic stability in a region of \nsignificant interest to the U.S.\n  Prompt enactment of H.J. Res. 63 is needed to update and extend \nprovisions of the Compact, particularly those economic assistance \nprovisions which expired on September 30, 2003, but which have been \ntemporarily extended.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues of the scope and importance of \nhis security relationship because it provides one of the compelling \nreasons to support this resolution. Our mutual security includes the \nobligation of the U.S. to defend these nations as if they are a part of \nthe U.S., and it is based on a simple geographic reality--the FSM and \nRMI lie between the state of Hawaii, and our Territories of Guam and \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in the western \nPacific. During World War II, the islands of the FSM and RMI served as \nhard-fought stepping-stones in the Allied defeat of Imperial Japan. To \nhelp assure that such a struggle will never need to be repeated, the \nCompact grants the U.S. the right to deny access to the islands by the \nmilitary forces of other nations, as well as the right to veto local \nactions that the U.S. determines are incompatible with its defense \nresponsibilities. The Compact also provides that the FSM and RMI will \nsympathetically consider U.S. requests for military basing rights. In \nthe past, U.S. nuclear weapons tests in the Marshall Islands played a \ncentral role in the development of our Nation's nuclear deterrent. \nToday, the missile test range at Kwajalein continues to play a vital \nrole in maintaining the nation's ballistic missile capability and in \ndeveloping missile defense systems. Enactment of this legislation could \nsecure U.S. access to the missile test and space surveillance \nfacilities at Kwajalein beyond 2016.\n  A second major element in the special relationship established by the \nCompact is the mutual interest in promoting economic development. This \ngoal has been approached by providing a combination of financial and \nprogram assistance. Significant economic development occurred from 1986 \nto 2003, but the remote and resource-poor island economies continue to \nbe based on the government-sector, and they are heavily dependent on \nU.S. assistance. Development has also been hindered by the Compact's \nweak accountability mechanisms and by the island governments' poor \nplanning and management capabilities.\n  A third element in this special relationship is the Compact's \nprovision granting FSM and RMI citizens the opportunity to live, work, \nand study in the U.S. as resident aliens. This privilege provides an \noutlet for the islands' population growth, but it has also resulted in \nsignificant migration to Hawaii, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, CNMI. Due to relatively poor health and \neducation conditions in the FSM and RMI, these migrants pose a \ndisproportionately high impact on social services in the jurisdictions \nto which they migrate.\n  Finally, the Compact included a full and final settlement of all \nclaims resulting from the U.S. nuclear weapons testing program that was \nconducted in the RMI from 1947 to 1958 and which significantly \ncontaminated the islands of four atolls.\n  I commend the representatives of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, \nand the United States for their work over the past 4 years to extend \nand strengthen the Compact. The two new Compact agreements they \nconcluded are nested within this joint resolution and will\n\n[[Page S14224]]\n\nprovide the assistance needed to assure continued economic development \nand mutual security in partnership with the United States. The \nadministration transmitted the legislation on June 27, it was \nintroduced as S.J. Res. 16 on July 14, 2003, and ordered reported by \nthe committee, with amendments, on September 17. It would provide about \n$4 billion in funding over the 20-year period from fiscal year 2004 to \n2023 for grants, contributions to trust funds, payments to extend the \nlease at Kwajalein, the cost of certain domestic services and programs, \nand $30 million annually to be allocated among Hawaii, Guam, the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa to mitigate the impact of \nmigration from the FSM and RMI. The package would also continue program \nassistance to the FSM and RMI through a range of domestic programs\n  To improve the effectiveness of U.S. assistance in the future, the \namended Compacts have enhanced accountability mechanisms. For example, \ninstead of providing financial assistance in the form of direct cash \npayments, funds will be disbursed through sector grants targeted to \npriority areas such as health and education. A new ``Fiscal Procedures \nAgreement,'' will establish new planning and reporting requirements, \nincluding the establishment of a joint economic management committee \nwith each nation. These committees will have a U.S. majority \nmembership, and the power to impose grant conditions and withhold \nfunds. Finally, the Compacts anticipate the end of annual U.S. \nfinancial assistance after 2023 and provide fro contributions to two \ntrust funds that will become an alternate source of funding after that \nyear.\n  The U.S. currently has access to military sites at Kwajalein Atoll \nuntil 2016, but this legislation provides an opportunity to extend U.S. \naccess until 2086. The new arrangement regarding Kwajalein was \nnegotiated with the Marshall Islands national government which has not \nyet reached agreement with all of the landowners involved. Accordingly, \na new land use agreement will need to be concluded between the \nlandowners and the Government of the RMI in order to give effect to the \nnew access agreement. Until that time, this legislation requires that \nthe increased payments be held in an interest-bearing escrow account.\n  Two issues that were not resolved during the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee's consideration of this resolution are education \nand disaster assistance. As pointed out earlier, U.S. assistance under \nthe Compact is provided through a combination of financial assistance \nand program assistance. In the case of education, U.S. domestic \nprograms account for roughly 40 percent of education funding, with \nlocal and U.S. financial contributions making-up the balance. These \nU.S. programs were first made available to the FSM and the RMI as an \ninitiative of President Kennedy during the Trusteeship period and were \ncontinued under the Compact as negotiated and approved under President \nReagan. The administration testified on this resolution in July before \nthe Energy Committee that continuation of these programs was assumed \nwhen it renegotiated the Compact. Unfortunately, as the legislation \nmoved forward, the House and Senate HELP Committees opposed \ncontinuation.\n  It was clear during the committee's consideration that the Compact's \ngoal of promoting economic self-sufficiency would fail without \nmaintaining current levels of support for education. This could be done \nby either continuing these programs, as assumed by the administration, \nor by providing an alternative source of funding.\n  The Energy Committee recommended continuation of critical programs \nand the ``cash-out'' of the remainder. Three domestic education \nprograms that would be very hard, if not impossible, for the island \ngovernments to duplicate would continue: Pell Grants, programs under \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, and Job Corps. \nPell grants to students attending the two community colleges in the FSM \nand RMI rate vital to the survival of these two institutions and there \nis consensus to support their continuation. IDEA serves a special \npopulation in the islands that, without the extension of the U.S. \nprogram, is unlikely to be adequately served. Finally, an exception is \nmade for Job Corps because of the role it plays in preparing young \npeople to enter the workforce. This is particularly true at Kwajalein \nAtoll where the U.S. Army vigorously supports the continuation of Job \nCorps because it helps maximize local employment at the U.S. Army base \nthere.\n  For the remaining Federal formula-grant programs administered by the \nDepartments of Education and Labor, and for the Head Start Program, the \ncommittee recommended termination of the islands' eligibility and \nproviding the islands with mandatory funding to replace, or ``cash-\nout'', the actual programs. However, the compromise agreed to with the \nHouse would provide an authorization for a discretionary, not mandatory \n``cash-out'' of the programs to be terminated. The replacement funding \nunder this proposal would continue to be provided by the appropriations \nsubcommittee for Labor, HHS, and Education, but instead of being \nallocated from the appropriation for each of the national programs, \nthere would be a new, separate appropriation of equal value to \nsupplement the education sector grants provided by the Secretary of the \nInterior under section 211(a) of the two Compacts.\n\n  The initial authorization levels for these two new discretionary \ngrants are based on estimates obtained from the Congressional Research \nService and the Department of the Interior's Federal Program \nCoordinator, $12,230,000 for the FSM, and $6,100,000 for the RMI, and \nthe authorization includes an inflation adjustment. Once appropriated, \nthis supplemental funding would be used in accordance with an agreement \nbetween the appropriate cabinet officer and the Secretary of the \nInterior, and would be disbursed and monitored in accordance with the \nCompact's Fiscal Procedures Agreements with the FSM and RMI, \nrespectively.\n  I support this compromise reluctantly because I am uneasy with \ndiscretionary funding for such a critical element of the Compacts. \nNevertheless, it appears to be the best that can be worked out under \nthe circumstances and I look forward to working with my colleagues next \nyear to make sure that the funding is shifted smoothly from the \nallocation for each of these national programs to a new FSM-RMI \nsupplemental appropriation of the same amount. I thank Senator Gregg \nand Senator Kennedy for their cooperation in resolving these difficult \neducation issues, and Stephanie Monroe and Jane Oates of the HELP staff \nfor their time and effort in working out this compromise. I \nparticularly want to thank Senator Akaka for his hard work and \ncommitment to this legislation, and to recognize Noe Kalipi and Melissa \nHampe of his staff for their contributions.\n  A second item that was not resolved during the Energy Committee's \ndeliberations was disaster assistance. The administration proposed that \nthe current eligibility of the islands to participate in the disaster \nassistance programs of FEMA be terminated and replaced with eligibility \nfor assistance from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, OFDA. \nThis approach was clearly flawed because OFDA is not required to \nrebuild essential infrastructure following disasters.\n  In response to this need, the administration transmitted a new \nproposal last week that would provide for assistance from both OFDA and \nFEMA. However, the details for implementing this new joint-program \napproach were not set forth in a subsidiary agreement, as has been done \nwith other programs to be extended to the islands. Accordingly, a \ncompromise has been developed that would continue FEMA assistance, as \nrecommended by the Energy Committee, while the administration \nundertakes negotiations with the islands and FEMA on the new approach \nin which all parties seek to conclude subsidiary agreements that would \nclarify implementation of the new approach. To help assure that all \nparties will negotiate in good faith, the compromise further provides \nthat the statutory language for the new approach, as submitted by the \nadministration, would go into effect 5 years after the date of \nenactment of this joint resolution. It is my expectation that \nsubsidiary agreements and any negotiated changes to the statutory \nlanguage would be agreed to between the island governments and \nrepresentatives of FEMA, OFDA, the\n\n[[Page S14225]]\n\nState Department and the Interior Department long before that deadline. \nI thank Senators Inhofe and Jeffords for their help in resolving this \nmatter and I look forward to working with them next year to assuring \nthat the islands have the disaster assistance that is essential to the \nsuccess of their economies, and to the success of the Compacts.\n\n  I believe that we have taken two excellent agreements, as negotiated \nbetween the U.S. and the FSM, and between the U.S. and the RMI, and we \nhave improved them so that they will serve as a solid foundation for \nfuture relations. I want to thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Domenici, for his leadership on this legislation and for his \ncommitment to continuing the bipartisan approach that has characterized \nthe committee's work on insular affairs. Finally, I wish to recognize \nthe work of Al Stayman and Kellie Donnelly of the Energy Committee \nstaff for their dedication and hard work in guiding this legislation \nthrough the process.\n  In 1986, the United States fulfilled its obligations under the \nTrusteeship and established a successful partnership under the Compact \nof Free Association to advance the interests of the United States, the \nFSM, and RMI in mutual security, and to economic development. Today, I \nurge my colleagues to support passage of H.J. Res. 63 and to affirm our \nNation's commitment to mutual security, economic development and to the \ncontinuing special relationship with the islands, and the people, of \nthe Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nengage in a colloquy with Senator Specter, Senator Bingaman, and \nSenator Harkin regarding the education provisions of H.J. Res. 63, to \napprove and extend the Compacts of Free Association between the U.S. \nand the Federated States of Micronesia, FSM, and the U.S. and the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, RMI.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Of course.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. U.S. assistance under the current compact is made \navailable as both financial and program assistance. In the case of \neducation, several U.S. domestic programs have been extended to the FSM \nand RMI since the compact was first approved in 1986. In July, the \nadministration testified on this legislation and stated that ``funding \nin the compact was not structured to replace expiring Federal programs, \nor take the place of any program that is eliminated now, or could be \neliminated in the future.'' In other words, continuation of the current \nprogram assistance was assumed. However, the House and Senate HELP \ncommittees have raised objections to this approach. Because these \nprograms account for about 40 percent of the FSM and RMI education \nbudgets, the success of the compacts depends upon either continuing the \nextension of these programs, or providing an alternate source of \nfunding.\n  The Domenici-Bingaman amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.J. \nRes. 63 includes language modeled on that passed in the House, that \nwould create an authorization for alternate funding. The amendment \nwould continue eligibility for certain essential programs, but \neligibility would be ended for the remaining Department of Education \nand Department of Labor formula-grant programs, and for the Head Start \nprogram. In their place, an authorization is provided to fund two \ndiscretionary supplemental education grants: $12,230,000 for the FSM, \nand $6,100,000 for the RMI. Once appropriated, these supplemental \neducation grants would be disbursed, used, and monitored in accordance \nwith an agreement between the Secretary of Education and the Secretary \nof the Interior, and in accordance with the compact's fiscal procedures \nagreements with the FSM and RMI, respectively. This approach resolves \nthe disagreement with the HELP committees while best assuring that the \nFSM and RMI will continue to have the resources needed to meet their \neducation needs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I agree. These grants, if funded, would continue the \nlevel of assistance which the administration and the island \nrepresentatives assumed would be available to meet the education goals \nwhich they jointly established in the new compacts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to ask the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education, whether they support this approach and whether they will \nfund these alternate grants?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes. I support this approach proposed by my colleagues \nfrom the Energy Committee and assure them that, given a sufficient \nallocation, I will support funding for education in the FSM and RMI \nthrough the new supplemental education grants authorized in their \namendment to H.J. Res. 63.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I concur in this approach and also assure my colleagues \nof my support for continued funding for education in the FSM and RMI \nunder this new authorization.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nengage in a colloquy with Senator Inhofe, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nJeffords regarding the disaster assistance provisions of H.J. Res. 63 \nto approve and extend the Compacts of Free Association between the U.S. \nand the Federated States of Micronesia, FSM, and the U.S. and the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, RMI.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Under the current compact, the disaster assistance \nprograms of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, have been \navailable to the FSM and RMI since 1986. Located in the western \nPacific, the RMI and FSM are vulnerable to typhoons and experience \nperiodic droughts in connection with the El Nino weather pattern. This \nvulnerability to disasters presents risks to public health and safety, \njeopardizes the substantial investment made by the U.S. in the island's \ninfrastructure, and it threatens achievements of the common goal of all \nthree nations--promoting economic growth. Consequently, FEMA's presence \nin the islands has been shown to be an essential component of the \nassistance provided under the compact.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Would my colleague yield for a brief point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As transmitted by the administration, the joint \nresolution approving the amended compacts would have eliminated FEMA \nand replaced it with the U.S. AID's Office of Foreign Disaster \nAssistance, OFDA. However, during consideration of this joint \nresolution by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the \nCommittee recommended reinstatement of FEMA's availability.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. In the final days before approval of \nthe compacts, FEMA has transmitted a revised proposal regarding \ndisaster assistance that would involve both FEMA and OFDA. This new \nproposal, coming at such a late stage in the process, has not been \nshared with the FSM and RMI. Indeed, it is my understanding that there \nare a number of questions about how the new proposal would work. \nNevertheless, the concept appears sound and staff from the committee \nhave worked with our colleagues on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to craft a compromise.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct. Our staffs have been working for the \npast few months on this issue. The compromise we have reached would \ncontinue the FEMA program in the islands for the next 5 years, as \nrecommended by the Energy Committee. In addition, the Secretary of \nState would be directed to immediately undertake negotiations, in \nconsultation with FEMA, with the governments of the FSM and RMI \nregarding disaster assistance. Finally, if an agreement is not \nconcluded and legislation is not enacted which reflects the new \nagreement within 5 years, then the administration's revised disaster \nassistance proposal would go into effect.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct. The compromise also directs the \nadministration to report to Congress by June 30, 2004, on the outcome \nof such negotiations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes. We hope and expect that an agreement will be \nconcluded and transmitted by next June 30 and do not believe it should \ntake the full 5 years.\n\n[[Page S14226]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is right. The Committees expect that FEMA, the \nadministration, and the island governments will engage in such \nnegotiations expeditiously and in good faith. Depending on the progress \nmade by June 30, 2004, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee may \nhold an oversight hearing on the matter.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with this approach.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As do I.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues for their support and for their \ncooperation in reaching this agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment which is at the desk be agreed to, the joint \nresolution, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the \namendment to the preamble which is at the desk be agreed to, the \npreamble, as amended, be agreed to, the amendment to the title which is \nat the desk be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable en bloc, and that any statements related to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
