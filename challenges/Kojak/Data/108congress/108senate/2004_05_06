We are grateful for this \nwondrous country whose roots are still deep enough in spiritual reality \nto acknowledge that vital prayer is critically necessary not only for \nour well-being, but for our survival.\n  My Dear Lord, grant afresh to the Members of this historic Chamber \nthe increased power in mind, heart and will to overcome unnecessary \nconflicts, shallow contentions and abiding differences to such a degree \nthat their honest tensions will bring the good and the best to our \nAmerican people, both living in our homeland or serving throughout the \nworld. Give our President, our leaders, our citizens and especially \nthese Senators a depth of selflessness, a love of others and an \nexpansion of vision that will enhance and fulfill dreams and goals of \nour gifted Founding Fathers. Let them seek and find Your path as \nearnestly today as our ancestors did in 1776 and 1787.\n  Finally, my Lord, teach us that prayer that is powerful is more than \nasking You for gifts, answers or promises fulfilled but, rather, the \nyielding of ourselves to truth. May our actions demonstrate that our \npassion for our country is not sourced in the conservative view of \ntruth or the liberal view of truth but in the right view of truth. Give \nour Senators righteous, humble and honest minds that the awesome task \nthat is theirs will be effectively achieved for ourselves and our \nposterity. Guide them with foresight that when their labor here be \nended Scripture could testify of them as it does of King David, ``he \nled them with a pure heart, and guided them with skillful hands!'' \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4931-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4931-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

and\n       (B) work with the international community to ensure that \n     the individuals responsible for crimes against humanity in \n     Darfur are accountable for their actions.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do want to draw attention to this \nterrible tragedy unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan. I have had \nthe opportunity to travel to the Sudan a number of times, many times \nover the last several years, and care greatly for the people there, as \ndo all of our colleagues who are in this Chamber today.\n  I thank Senator Brownback for his tremendous leadership on this \nissue. He will come to the floor later today to comment on this \nimportant resolution. He has shown steadfast commitment throughout for \nthe people of southern Sudan.\n  I also thank Senator Feingold. He and I have had the opportunity to \nwork together for many years on the Africa Subcommittee and have worked \ntogether to draw attention to the terrible civil war in Sudan, which \nhas displaced millions of people. A million people have died over the \nlast 20, 22 years.\n\n  I also thank my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, who now \nchairs the African Subcommittee, as well as Chairman Lugar and Senator \nBiden, and all the colleagues who have worked on this issue.\n  The international community estimates that 1 million--1 million--\nSudanese in the Darfur region have been displaced by the ongoing \nattacks by government-backed militias. At least 110,000 Darfur Sudanese \nhave sought refuge in Chad. But even there the militias have been able \nto cross the border and attack the refugee camps. It is an ongoing \ntragedy.\n  The outgoing United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Khartoum says \nthe continuing atrocities are nothing short of genocide.\n  Since the violence began in February of last year, up to 30,000 \nDarfur natives have been killed. The U.N. coordinator warns that the \nraping, looting, and mass destruction being perpetuated is ``more than \njust a conflict.'' He warns that, ``It is an organized attempt to do \naway with a group of people.''\n  On Monday, a U.N. mission returned from a 6-day inspection of Darfur. \nThe team concludes that many of the violations they investigated may \nconstitute war crimes and/or crimes against humanity. Their report, due \nto be completed by the end of this week, is expected to confirm many of \nthe accounts of mass murder, multiple rapes, aerial bombings, and \nground attacks.\n  The crisis only threatens to worsen. Later this month, the rainy \nseason will begin. Aid experts tell us the massive yearly flooding may \nseriously hinder their efforts to distribute desperately needed aid and \nmedical supplies. Amnesty International warns that the impending rains \nare a ticking timebomb in the countdown to disaster.\n  The situation in Darfur is dire. I take a special interest in the \nplight of the Darfur people because of my own contact with the \nSudanese. I have traveled extensively throughout southern Sudan. I have \nhad the opportunity to perform medical mission work in that part of the \nworld in a hospital in a little village called Lui. I have visited the \nNuba Mountains in central Sudan, the Blue Nile region north of there, \nas well as Pabong, which is one of the oil regions in which there has \nbeen a lot of displacement.\n  Recently, in August, I was in southern Sudan, where I had the \nopportunity again to operate and perform surgery and serve the \ncommunity there in this hospital in Lui, the only medical facility in \nabout a 150-mile radius of that small village.\n  Through these travels, I have had the opportunity to take care of \npatients who have come in with war-torn injuries, and who are suffering \nfrom the plight of this civil war, a brutal war--the innocent people \nthere who are being shattered day in, day out, by civil war.\n  I wanted to share with my colleagues the suffering of the people of \nsouthern Sudan and thus wholly endorse this resolution. We have all \nworked together--Senators Brownback, Feingold, Biden, Lugar, Helms, and \nmany others--to enact a Sudan Peace Act in the past. That bill, indeed, \nprovided a framework for peace negotiations in Sudan.\n  This past September, shortly after we were in southern Sudan, I was \nheartened by the cease-fire by the Khartoum government and the Sudanese \nrebels. Peace, it seemed, at that point in time might finally come. But \nnow my hopes are wearing thin. The government of Khartoum absolutely \nmust take responsibility for its complicity in the systematic murders \nand atrocities being committed in Darfur by the Janjaweed.\n  On Tuesday the U.S. Agency for International Development delivered \nthe first of four aid airlifts planned for the week. The Agency is \nproviding thousands of blankets and temporary shelter and medical \nsupplies and food. But even with the best, the most hopeful, the most \noptimistic projections that the Darfur crisis can be controlled, the \nmost optimistic say it will continue for another 18 months, even if \nKhartoum right now starts cracking down on the Janjaweed militias. \nHence, there is not time to waste. Literally millions of lives are in \nthe balance. We must draw the worlds's attention to the crisis in \nSudan.\n  This week's elections of Sudan to a third term on the United Nations \nHuman Rights Commission is a travesty. It undermines the credibility of \nthe Commission but, more importantly, it signals to the Sudanese people \nthat the highest human rights body in the world has abandoned them and \nignored their plight.\n  I stand alongside the administration in its unqualified disapproval \nof Sudan's inclusion in the U.N. Human Rights Commission. By approving \nS. Con. Res. 99, however, this body rightly condemns the actions of \nKhartoum and Darfur. We put Khartoum on notice that the Senate will \ncontinue to scrutinize and hold accountable acts of commission or \nomission by the Khartoum government that violate their citizens' human \nrights.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the majority leader reserve the \nremainder of his time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that completes leader time. That should not \ntake away from morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, too, will use my leader time and \nreserve the\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nremainder of the allocation for our Democratic colleagues to use the \nother time in morning business.\n  I share the sentiment expressed by the majority leader with regard to \nS. Con. Res. 99, regarding the Sudan. It is past time that we were \nheard on this troubling situation. I commend Senators Feingold and \nBrownback as well for their leadership.\n  Late last year, United Nations Under Secretary General for \nHumanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland called the developing situation in the \nDarfur region of Sudan, where two rebel groups have been locked in a \nbattle with Sudanese government forces and government-backed militias \nsince February 2003, ``the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe.''\n  Mr. Egeland has seen a lot of disaster, and he does not use terms \nlike catastrophe loosely. In a world increasingly torn asunder by \nethnic and regional conflicts, calling Darfur the world's worst \ncatastrophe is saying something. Unfortunately, it appears that Egeland \nhas chosen the right word to describe this situation.\n  Amnesty International has reported that it ``continues to receive \ndetails of horrifying attacks against civilians in villages by \ngovernment warplanes, soldiers, and pro-government militia.'' Doctors \nWithout Borders reported that the regions is the scene of \n``catastrophic mortality rates.''\n  And American government and international estimates suggest that \nnearly 3 million people have been affected by the terrible fighting in \nDarfur; 700,000 have been displaced; 100,000 have fled to neighboring \nChad, and 30,000 have been killed.\n  Meanwhile, international aid agencies estimate that, as a result of \nthis fighting, they have been able to help only 15 percent of the \npeople who need it. The Sudanese Government has systematically and \ndeliberately denied humanitarian assistance for, and international \naccess to, this region.\n  At the same time, credible reports suggest the militia forces backed \nby the Government of Sudan are engaged in the use of rape as a weapon \nof war, are abducting children, and are destroying food and water \nsources. If all this were not sad and outrageous enough, the Sudanese \nGovernment--the same one that is complicit in these atrocities--just \nTuesday was chosen to serve on the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission. Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times recently described \nthe situation in the Darfur region this way: I can't get the \nkaleidoscope of genocide out of my head since my trip last month to the \nSudan-Chad border: the fresh graves, especially the extra-small mounds \nfor children; the piles of branches on graves to keep wild animals from \ndigging up corpses; the tales of women being first raped and then \nbranded on the hand to stigmatize them forever; the isolated peasants, \nunfamiliar with electricity, who suddenly encounter the 21st century as \nhelicopters machine-gun their children.\n  Each of us hoped we would leave this hatred, violence and ethnic \ncleansing behind in the 20th century. At the very least, we must now \nensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. I was heartened when \nthe United States recently voted against a resolution backed by the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Commission because it didn't do enough to \ncondemn ethnic cleansing in Darfur. And I am pleased that the President \ncondemned the Sudanese Government's actions there. But that is just a \nfirst step.\n  If the Government of Sudan ever wants to be welcomed into the \ncommunity of nations, it must take concrete steps that befit a member \nof the United Nations Human Rights Commission. It must immediately take \nactions to cease the attacks in Darfur. It must allow the delivery of \nhumanitarian assistance to people in the Darfur region. President Bush \nmust direct the United States Representative to the United Nations to \nseek an official investigation by the United Nations to determine if \ncrimes against humanity have been committed by the Government of Sudan \nin the Darfur region.\n  This is the very least the international community must do, and we \nmust do it now. Any delay will have a terrible cost in human lives.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise with several of my colleagues \ntoday to bring to the attention of this body a severe situation in the \nwestern part of Sudan. The Darfur region is facing an acute \nhumanitarian catastrophe, which has been cited by some individuals as \nthe worst humanitarian crisis in the world today.\n  For over a year now, government-backed militias have been carrying \nout savage attacks on innocent civilians and have engaged in the use of \nrape as a weapon, abducted children, destroyed food and irrigation \nsystems and burned villages. We are gravely concerned about the \nviolence that persists, despite the April 8 cease-fire agreement. \nRecent estimates report that 3 million people are beyond the reach of \naid agencies trying to provide assistance in Sudan, and mortality rates \nin the Darfur region are catastrophic.\n  The Darfur disaster has forced staggering numbers of people to flee \ntheir homes. More than 800,000 people have been displaced, with more \nthan 100,000 of them crossing the border into neighboring Chad. Less \nthan half of these refugees are living in UNHCR camps. Refugees \nInternational reported yesterday that 540 refugees in Chad are near \ndeath due to lack of food. To make matters worse, the rainy season is \nexpected soon, at which time roads will be impassable and the delivery \nof aid extremely difficult.\n  Human Rights investigators have finally been allowed into the region \nand we anticipate their findings later this week. However, initial \nreports indicate that their movements were severely restricted, despite \nnumerous requests for full access to the region. The international \ncommunity must continue to call on the Government of Sudan to grant \nvisas to the humanitarian organizations who are ready and waiting to \nprovide much-needed assistance in Darfur.\n  Civil war has left carnage during the two decades of fighting in \nSudan. The largely Arab-Islamic North had been fighting the \npredominantly African-Christian and animist South over issues of \nreligion and Sharia law. Negotiations have included tough compromises \nover issues of power- and wealth-sharing. I believe that continued \npressure on Sudan to end the suffering in Darfur can lead to a \nnegotiated settlement between the North and the South, which we hope to \nsee in the coming days. But we cannot wait for this agreement to \naddress the current situation; the humanitarian crisis in Darfur \nwarrants immediate attention by the international community.\n  Today the Senate passed S. Con. Res. 99, condemning the Government of \nSudan for their complicity in attacks against innocent civilians and \ncalling on them to immediately end such brutality. It calls on Sudan to \ngrant immediate and unconditional access to Darfur for humanitarian and \nhuman rights organizations and for a cease-fire monitoring team. In \naddition, it calls on the USAID Administrator to develop a plan for the \ndelivery of humanitarian assistance, by air if necessary. Furthermore, \nthe resolution urges the Secretary of State to develop a plan for \nfurther bilateral and multilateral action in the event that the \nGovernment of Sudan fails to immediately allow access, including a plan \nto seek a Security Council resolution addressing the Darfur situation. \nFinally, S. Con. Res. 99 urges the President to direct the U.S. \nRepresentative to the United Nations to seek an official investigation \nto determine if crimes against humanity have been committed by the \nGovernment of Sudan in Darfur and work with the international community \nto ensure that the individuals responsible for such crimes are \naccountable for their actions.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this important resolution. \nThe 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide was an important reminder \nof the devastating effects that international blindness can have on a \npopulation. Just this week, Sudan was voted back onto the U.N. Human \nRights Commission, despite protests by the United States. How can a \nnation who allows for nearly 1 million displaced persons, catastrophic \ndeaths, and the threat of continuing death and disease, remain on the \nvery body of the United Nations which is responsible for preventing \nsuch atrocities?\n  We have a moral responsibility to the people of Darfur, let us not \nwait until another life is lost.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, the Foreign Relations Committee\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\ndischarged a resolution which speaks to the situation in Darfur, Sudan. \nI am alarmed by reports of atrocities there. I am worried that genocide \nmay be unfolding.\n  We need to make a determination about what is going on in Darfur and \nrespond accordingly. Administration officials have termed it ethnic \ncleansing. This would be horrific in and of itself. But we also have to \nask whether or not Khartoum's actions are an intent to destroy in whole \nor in part a particular ethnic or racial group or groups. If so, what \nshould we do about it? These are questions we must answer right away.\n  As you know, the administration has been heavily involved in \nnegotiations between the government in Khartoum and southern Sudanese \nrebels. If an agreement is reached, it will bring an end to twenty \nyears of civil war between the Muslim north, and non-Muslim south.\n  It will end 20 years of attacks against Muslims in the Nuba mountains \nand southern Sudanese; 20 years during which the government of Sudan \ntargeted civilians either with its military forces, or through \ngovernment allied militias; 20 years during which 2 million people have \ndied; 20 years during which millions were displaced both within Sudan \nand beyond its borders.\n  The war sparked outrage among members of the international community \nbecause of the brutality of attacks against men, women and children. \nSome cast the war as Muslim versus Christian. I think this captures \nonly a fraction of the story. Arab militias took southern, non-Muslims, \nblack Africans captive as slaves. They pursued a scorched earth policy \nin southern villages. Muslims living in the Nuba Mountains, who happen \nto be black, were victims of attacks as well. One is left to wonder if \nthe real cause of the attacks wasn't good old fashioned racism. And \nwhile the United States continues to spend valuable diplomatic time and \npolitical capitol to bring an end to the north-south conflict, history \nis repeating itself in western Sudan.\n  Early last year, ethnic minorities living in western Sudan took up \narms to protest Khartoum's arming of Arab militias in the region, and \nwhat they believed was economic marginalization by the government in \nKhartoum. The wisdom of this course of action on the part of the rebels \nmay be debatable. What is not debatable is the disproportionate \nresponse of the government--ethnic cleansing in Darfur by means of a \nwell orchestrated campaign of attacks aimed specifically at non-\nmilitary persons who belong to the same ethnic groups as the rebels.\n  Khartoum is employing the same tactics in Darfur that they used \nagainst those living in southern Sudan: Aerial bombardment of civilians \nwith helicopter gun ships and planes, and attacks by government \nsupported Arab militias known as janjaweed, which employ scorched earth \ntactics against villages inhabited by black Africans. We are receiving \nreports of a variety of abuses perpetrated by the janjaweed--routine \nrape of women, murder of men, the wanton burning of children--from \ncredible sources working in Darfur. In my view, these deliberate \nattacks and atrocities against civilians constitute crimes against \nhumanity.\n  President Bush's statement on Sudan issued on April 7, while helpful, \nwas inadequate. He condemned the atrocities in Darfur, but the \nstatement does not speak to the ethnic nature of the attacks. We all \nknow that ethnic cleansing has the potential to turn into genocide. By \nfailing to highlight this very dangerous dimension of Khartoum's \ncampaign, the president failed to speak to the most alarming aspects of \nthe crisis.\n  The statement says that President Bush expressed his views condemning \nthe atrocities directly to Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Since \nU.S. officials have acknowledged that the actions constitute ethnic \ncleansing, describing them as well ``organized,'' and \n``comprehensive,'' I sincerely hope the President took Bashir to task \nabout the particular evil of such actions. Given the vagueness \nPresident Bush's statement, however, one is left to wonder.\n  Our Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, Rich Williamson, \nhas said that 30,000 people are dead as a result of the conflict. One \nmillion people--25 percent of the population--are displaced, according \nto the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.\n  All of them are in dire need of assistance because on top of razing \nentire villages and firebombing civilians, in addition to burning \ncrops, raping women, torturing men and throwing children into burning \nhuts, on top of all the misery the government has heaped on the people \nof Darfur for months, Khartoum has refused to allow humanitarian relief \norganizations free, unfettered, regular access to the region. According \nto the State Department, it takes aid workers 2 months to get visas. \nAnd this is an improvement--it used to take 3 to 4 months.\n  After pursuing a scorched earth policy in Darfur for months--burned \ncrops, stolen cattle and poisoned wells--the government's latest \noutrage is cynically ordering people to return to their homes. The few \nagencies on the ground in the area indicate that people cannot venture \neven 100 yards outside the displaced persons camps without being \nattacked. Even if they are able to make it home safely, there is \nabsolutely no likelihood of people surviving in communities that \nliterally no longer exist. At this point, return is not an option and \nKhartoum is well aware of this.\n  And the attacks by the janjaweed continue despite the April 8 cease-\nfire agreement.\n  Over 100,000 people have fled across the border into Chad. They too \nare still subject to attack from the janjaweed. UNHCR is in the midst \nof attempting to relocate refugees farther from the border to enhance \ntheir safety. Only half of refugees are living in camps in more secure \nlocations. The other half are making do the best they can. A report \nissued by Refugees International indicates that many refugees are \nliving in the open with no food, water or shelter.\n  According to UNHCR's public documents, it needs $27 million to \naddress the needs of refugees in Chad. It has less than half of that on \nhand. Soon the rainy season will make roads impassible, preventing the \ndelivery of food and shelter materials. The World Food Program is \nattempting to stockpile food in advance of the rains, but they have a \n35 percent funding shortfall as well. We have contributed significant \nfunds, but we and the rest of the international community need to do \neven more.\n\n  Congress needs to do more as well. S. Con. Res. 99 speaks to the \nnature of the violence and urges the President to do two main things:\n  First, develop a plan to deliver humanitarian aid to the nearly 1 \nmillion people who have been driven from their homes that does not \nnecessitate permission from the government of Sudan. I hope that this \nplan includes immediate use of the commodities we are holding in the \nEmerson Trust stockpiles. I would also encourage the administration to \ncome up with a way to deliver food through neighboring countries, \nincluding Chad.\n  Let me also say that I expect and welcome a request in the \nforthcoming supplemental for money to meet the humanitarian needs \nengendered by the crisis in Darfur.\n  Second, it urges the Secretary of State to develop options to \nincrease sanctions on Sudan if the attacks in Darfur do not stop \nimmediately.\n  I co-sponsored this resolution because I think that these are \nimportant steps. They are only steps however. If we do not see any \nchange on the ground by the end of May, we should go even further than \nthis resolution suggests.\n  We should amend the Sudan Peace Act, which was aimed at jump-starting \nthe north-south peace process, so that it is relevant to the situation \nin Darfur. Three changes are essential. First, the act, Public Law 107-\n245, imposes sanctions on the government of Sudan if the President \ndetermines that it is not making a good faith effort to negotiate a \npeace agreement. The act should be amended to require that the \nPresident certify that neither the government nor government allied \nmilitias have attacked civilians in Sudan 30 days from the enactment of \nthe act and every 90 days thereafter. If the President cannot certify \nsuch, then the sanctions in section 6, paragraph 2 should be triggered.\n  The same certification should apply to humanitarian access. This is \nalready in the legislation, however the requirement is obviously not \nexplicit enough\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nfor the White House. Despite the restrictions placed on the non-\ngovernmental organizations attempting to go into Darfur, on April 21, \nthe President certified the government of Sudan had not unreasonably \ninterfered with humanitarian efforts. Making the law more explicit may \nprevent another such mistake.\n  Finally, we should add a requirement that our permanent \nrepresentative to the U.N. Security Council pursue a Security Council \nResolution condemning the government of Sudan for its actions in \nDarfur, and calling for accountability for those who are found \nresponsible for orchestrating and carrying out the atrocities.\n  Mr. President, the administration has said that it will not attempt \nto secure the north-south peace agreement at the expense of the people \nin Darfur. I agree. In fact, a north-south agreement will be \nmeaningless in the face of ethnic cleansing in western Sudan. I believe \nthat we must ratchet up the pressure on the Government of Sudan, and \nour partners in the international community to bring an end to the \ncriminal acts of the government in Khartoum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4936-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4936-S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RISING COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to comment as well on another \nmatter closer to home.\n  It is graduation season. Over the next several weeks, in cities and \ntowns in South Dakota and across America, hundreds of thousands of \nyoung people will graduate from high school.\n  Parents will tell their graduating sons and daughters, ``I'm proud of \nyou.''\n  Unfortunately, many parents will also have to tell their children, \n``I'm sorry.''\n  ``I'm sorry that we can't afford to send you to college.''\n  The novelist James Michener grew up dirt poor in Pennsylvania, but he \ngot a good education.\n  He once told an interviewer, ``I went to nine different universities \nand never paid a nickel of my own money. My wife got many scholarships. \nWe are children of the United States.''\n  James Michener was able to graduate from college because America \ninvested in him. In his case, it was the GI bill that opened the doors \nof higher education.\n  In my own case, it was the Air Force ROTC that opened those doors.\n  I was the first person in my family ever to go to college. I worked \nto pay part of my tuition, and my parents helped; my mother went back \nto work when I was in high school just to help pay for my college \neducation.\n  Even with all of us pitching in, I still could not have paid for \ncollege without help from the United States Government.\n  I am deeply mindful of, and grateful for, the investment America made \nin me. It is partly because of my own background that I am troubled \ntoday to see many families in America priced out--or on the verge of \nbeing priced out--of the college market.\n  Since President Bush took office, the average tuition at a 4-year \npublic college has increased 28 percent.\n  This year, tuition increased at State universities in all 50 States. \nIn some States, tuition shot up as much as 40 percent. And more \nincreases are slated for next year.\n  The University of Kentucky is raising tuition for freshmen and \nsophomores by $618 next year. That is a 14-percent increase--on top of \nthis year's 14-percent increase.\n  The University of Missouri will see a 7.5-percent tuition increase \nnext year--on top of this year's increase of 20 percent.\n  In Texas, the University of Houston recently raised tuition by 25 \npercent. The University of Texas at Austin plans a 26-percent increase. \nAnd Texas A University will charge students 21 percent more.\n  In Washington State, community college tuition is going up 7 percent, \nbringing the total increase over the past 5 years to more than 35 \npercent.\n  In California, where budget cuts and tuition increases this year shut \nan estimated 175,000 students out of community colleges, State \nlawmakers are now considering a 44-percent increase in community \ncollege fees; that would be on top of last year's 64-percent increase.\n  They are also looking at a 10-percent tuition increase for University \nof California students and a 9-percent budget cut for the Cal State \nsystem.\n  At the same time tuition is increasing dramatically, the value of the \nPell Grant, America's main college tuition assistance program, is \ndeclining.\n  In 1979, the maximum Pell Grant covered 77 percent of the tuition at \na 4-year public college or university. By 2001, that percentage had \ndropped to just 42 percent.\n  Today, the average college student needs to come up with $3,800 per \nyear out-of-pocket--that's after grants and loans.\n  Most college students today work. In fact, more than three-quarters \nof all full-time students at public colleges and universities work, and \nthey work an average of 22 hours per week. Yet student debt has doubled \nover the last decade.\n  Students graduating from college this month will leave school with \n$17,000-worth of student loan debt; that's for undergraduate students. \nProfessional and graduate students often graduate with $100,000--or \nmore--in student loan debt. And they are luckier than some.\n  The rise in college costs is outpacing the ability of many low-income \nfamilies to pay for college. At 4-year public colleges, tuition costs \nfor the lowest 20 percent of wage earners rose from 12 percent of \nfamily income in 1980 to 25 percent of family income in 2002.\n  At 4-year private colleges, tuition costs for low-wage earners rose \nfrom 58 percent of family income in 1980 to 117 percent of family \nincome in 2002.\n  And according to the National Center for Public Policy and Higher \nEducation, in the fall of 2003, at least 250,000 prospective college \nstudents were priced out of the college market. They had the grades to \ngo to college; they just couldn't afford the tuition.\n  When I graduated from high school, a college education was a big \nadvantage. Today, it is rapidly becoming a necessity. The fastest-\ngrowing and best-paying jobs today require at least some college.\n  Over the course of his or her career, a person with a 2-year college \ndegree will earn an average of $400,000 more than a high school \ngraduate. Someone with a 4-year degree will earn nearly $1 million \nmore.\n  But it is not just individuals who suffer when middle- and lower-\nincome Americans are priced out of college. Our entire Nation suffers. \nBroad access to higher education is critical to America's economic \nfuture, our national security, our intellectual and cultural life, and \nour democracy.\n  There was a story on the front page of the New York Times on Monday \nthat ought to alarm us all. The headline read: ``U.S. is Losing Its \nDominance in the Sciences.''\n  It said:\n\n       The United States has started to lose its worldwide \n     dominance in critical areas of science and innovation, \n     according to federal and private experts who point to strong \n     evidence like prizes awarded to Americans and the number of \n     papers in major professional journals. . . .\n       Foreign advances in basic science now often rival or even \n     exceed America's. . . .\n\n  It quoted John Jankowski, a senior analyst at the National Science \nFoundation, saying:\n\n       The rest of the world is catching up. Science excellence is \n     no longer the domain of just the U.S.\n\n  The article cited three statistics to support that claim:\n  First, in international competition involving industrial patents, the \npercentage won by Americans ``has fallen steadily over the decades and \nnow stands at 52 percent.''\n  Second, the percentage of research papers by Americans published in \ntop physics journals has declined from 61 percent in 1983 to just 29 \npercent this year.\n  Finally, the share of Nobel Prizes for science won by Americans has \nfallen to 51 percent. These are prizes America dominated heavily from \nthe 1960s well into the 1990s.\n  Unless we reverse this decline and regain America's scientific and \ntechnological edge, our children will grow up in a less productive, \nless prosperous America.\n  If we are going to meet the challenges of the future, we need the \nbest thinking and best efforts of every American. Yet the doors to \ncollege are narrowing.\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\n  What has the administration's response to this problem been?\n  Deafening silence.\n  The Higher Education Act is up for reauthorization. Yet this \nadministration has put forward no real plan to make college more \naffordable.\n  The Bush administration has stood by while States have slashed their \neducation budgets and raised college tuition to close State budget \nshortfalls.\n  The President's oversized tax cuts have eaten up Federal resources \nthat we could otherwise invest in higher education, and in basic \nresearch and investment.\n  Despite his repeated promises to increase the value of the average \nPell Grant, the President's proposed budget for next year freezes the \nPell Grant for the third year in a row.\n  The President's budget also cuts the Perkins Loan program--the \nFederal work-study program that has helped tens of millions of middle- \nand lower-income students work their way through college.\n  I hope we can come up with a better answer, and many of us have \nproposed one.\n  We believe the Government can, and must, create an opportunity \nsociety, where every college-ready student or worker who needs to \nupdate his or her skills has the chance to go to college, or get \nadditional training, without having to take on back-breaking debt to do \nit.\n  We want to increase the maximum Pell Grant from $4,050 to $5,100, to \ndouble the HOPE Scholarship tax credit from $1,500 per student to \n$3,000 per student, and to make the education tax credits refundable.\n  We also support efforts to help more African American, Hispanic, \nNative American, and other minority students attend college, because \ndiversity strengthens our democracy and our economy.\n  James Michener fought in World War II. He helped win perhaps the \ngreatest battle of the last century.\n  Americans in the 21st century will fight different battles. But the \nstakes are just as high.\n  We need to make sure that every son and daughter of America has the \nchance to go to college if he or she can do the work. It is not just a \nmatter of individual self-interest. In a real sense, it is a matter of \nour national survival.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4937-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to address the body this morning on \nthe importance of Senate action to confirm pending nominations for \nambassadorial and other foreign affairs posts.\n  Together, Republicans and Democrats on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee have worked to move nominations as expeditiously as possible. \nDuring the past few weeks, the committee has held hearings and \nconsidered nominations for more than 30 such posts. As a group, these \nnominees received bipartisan support. Our members voted unanimously in \nfavor of confirmation of each one at a business meeting last Thursday.\n  I was pleased last night when the Senate confirmed Paul Applegarth to \nbe chief executive officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation. I \nappreciate the work of Senator Frist and Senator Daschle to move this \nimportant nomination. The launch of the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation presents an important opportunity for the United States to \nenhance the effectiveness of its development assistance. Last year, \nCongress appropriated $1 billion for the MCC, and having a chief \nexecutive officer in place and ready to provide leadership in this new \nenterprise is a vital first step to ensuring its success.\n  I hope the Senate will now move with some dispatch on the rest of the \npending diplomatic nominees. The posts for which these individuals have \nbeen nominated hold great importance for our country. A few examples \nwill illustrate that point.\n  Among the nominees pending before the Senate is that of John \nNegroponte to be U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. As I said at Ambassador \nNegroponte's nomination hearing, the post will be one of the most \nconsequential ambassadorships in American history. The Ambassador to \nIraq not only will be called upon to lead an estimated 1,700 embassy \npersonnel--that is 1,000 Americans and 700 Iraqis--he will be the \nepicenter of international efforts to secure and reconstruct Iraq and \nprovide the developing Iraqi government with the opportunity to achieve \nresponsible nationhood.\n  American credibility in the world, progress in the war on terrorism, \nrelationships with our allies, and the future of the Middle East depend \non a positive outcome in Iraq. What happens there during the next 18 \nmonths almost certainly will determine whether we can begin to redirect \nthe Middle East toward a more productive and peaceful future.\n  The stakes for the United States in achieving success in Iraq could \nnot be higher.\n  I understand there is leadership activity that may make it possible \nfor the ambassadorship of John Negroponte to be considered by the \nSenate very soon. I very much appreciate that effort.\n  The pending nominees also include individuals to be ambassadors to \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Sierra Leone, \neach of which is struggling in the aftermath of ethnic conflict. They \ninclude nominees to be ambassadors to Poland, Romania, and Slovenia, at \na time when these countries are joining the European Union and looking \nto deepen their ties to the United States. They include nominees to be \nambassadors to Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and \nYemen at a time when the United States must improve its relations and \nencourage democracy and reform in the greater Middle East. They include \nalso nominees to be ambassadors to important regional anchors, such as \nBrazil, Nigeria, South Africa, and South Korea.\n  The ambassadorial nominees currently awaiting Senate confirmation \nwould represent the United States in countries with a collective \npopulation of more than 700 million people.\n  Foreign governments notice when U.S. ambassadorships to their \ncountries go unfilled for lengthy periods of time. An ambassadorial \nabsence can be read by some nations as a sign of declining American \ninterest. The United States needs strong and effective diplomatic \nrepresentation abroad to ensure cooperation in the fight against \nterrorism, to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to \nbuild trade and investment relationships that will strengthen our \neconomy and advance freedom and democracy worldwide.\n  We also must remember that ambassadorships function not only as \nrepresentation of the United States, but as managers of their \nembassies. Given that U.S. diplomatic missions have been terrorist \ntargets and remain the most visible American symbol in many countries \nwith a terrorist presence, we need leadership at these embassies. \nNeedlessly depriving an embassy of its ambassador in a time of \nterrorist threat may have consequences as grave as depriving a military \nunit of its commander in time of conflict.\n  Over the years, the Senate generally has done its duty to efficiently \nmove ambassadorial nominees. We should proceed carefully and \nthoughtfully when we evaluate diplomatic nominations. But we should \nproceed with dispatch. Nominations must not be delayed by inattention, \nbureaucratic arguments, or political motivations, and when our \nexaminations are complete, we should send the nominees to their post as \nquickly as possible.\n  I am confident the Senate understands the importance of confirming \nnominees who will be on the front lines of efforts to advance U.S. \ninterests around the world, and I ask all Members to join the Foreign \nRelations Committee in moving these nominees. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Missouri. How \nmuch time does the Senator yield to himself?\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, I am on the Senate floor to explain why I \nam on the floor today. A week ago, I came to the Senate floor to raise \nwhat I think is a very serious point, and that is, we are being \nfilibustered on the procedural motions to take the highway bill to a \nconference with the House.\n  I had the great privilege and pleasure back in January of 2003 to \nassume the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and I did \nso knowing full well that committee, along with the full committee, had \nthe responsibility for drafting what I consider to be one of the most \nimportant infrastructure bills this Congress ever deals with, and that \nis the transportation bill or, as it is known by some, the highway \nbill. This year we are calling it SAFETEA. This is the acronym adopted \nby the administration to emphasize the fact that it is a safety-related \nmeasure.\n  Good highways, roads, and bridges, along with mass transit and other \nelements, are vitally important to our country in a number of ways. For \nthose of us who are stuck in traffic around Washington, DC, being stuck \nin traffic is like having breakfast in the morning, and it is as \nreliable as flowers in the springtime. Better roads mean less \ncongestion, less hassle. But there are many other items that are very \nimportant as well, because good roads and the lack of congestion mean \nless pollution. Cars sitting idling pollute the atmosphere, so the \natmosphere is worse, the air quality is worse if you have congestion.\n  Highways are also important in another way. If we had passed the \nhighway bill last winter or even when we passed it in February, we \nwould have put people to work because every billion dollars of highway \ninvestment creates 47,000 jobs, and there is no question that we were \nwaiting to see the jobs come back. We needed these highway jobs this \nyear. We have missed this year's construction season.\n  Fortunately, the tax cuts passed by this body are working, and we are \nseeing an upturn in the economy, particularly in small business. That \nis another speech I will make on the Senate floor.\n  Tremendous numbers of people are going to work, as small business \nmembers, as proprietors starting their own businesses, 410,000 working \nselling their own products on e-Bay. They are creating good jobs. But \nwe still need the jobs.\n  Beyond that, good highways and good transportation are essential for \nthe long-term stability and growth of our States, our communities, and \nour Nation.\n  When I was Governor, I spent a lot of time working on economic \ndevelopment issues, and there is one thing I can tell you: if you are \ntrying to get jobs into a particular community, they have to have \ntransportation, particularly if they are dealing with goods or with \npeople who are coming into that community. Good roads mean good jobs. \nOur highways, our roads, our bridges, even our waterways are the sinews \nof economic commerce. Without good transportation, we do not have \ngrowth and we don't have jobs.\n  Finally, good highways mean safety. We kill about 43,000 people on \nthe highways in the United States every year. The Department of \nTransportation says about a third of those killed are killed because of \ninsufficient highway infrastructure. In other words, we have in \nMissouri many crowded two-way highways which have traffic that really \ndemands a divided highway. When you have that, you have frustration, \nand very often people from out of State are not familiar with the \ncurves and the hills and pass in areas where you cannot pass, and they \nhave tragic head-on collisions. I say we kill roughly three people a \nday on Missouri's highways, and I think one out of three is killed \nbecause of inadequate highways. All you have to do is travel the \nhighways and see the white crosses where people have died.\n\n  To deal with that situation, I set out to work on a bipartisan basis. \nWe have worked since a year ago January very closely with all the \ninterested parties--the people interested in road building, community \ndevelopment workers, union members, environmental groups who wanted to \nhave improved environmental processes. We brought all of them together \nin a bipartisan--let me emphasize bipartisan--bill for which I have \nthanked my colleagues on the other side many times for their great \ncooperation. We brought a good bill to the floor: $255 billion for \nhighways and bridges over the next 6 years. Boy, we passed it with a \nwhopping 76-vote majority in the Senate.\n  I go home and people say: What is happening to the highway bill?\n  I say: It is being filibustered.\n  They say: What? It passed by 76 votes.\n  I say: No, the simple procedural steps to move the bill to conference \nwith the House are being filibustered.\n  They say: What?\n  I say: Yes, there are about six steps that have to be taken to send a \nbill to the House of Representatives so we can sit down in a conference \nand get a final bill that has to then pass both Houses and go to the \nPresident.\n  We have been working for more than a year and a half. It has been \nmore than 7 months since the existing bill, TEA-21, expired. It has now \nbeen 7 weeks since the Senate passed a highway bill. It has now been 5 \nweeks since the House passed a highway bill. The majority leader and I \nhave gone to the Senate floor and asked unanimous consent three times \nto take the necessary steps to move the bill to the House.\n  All three requests have been objected to by my colleagues on the \nother side. Yesterday, a great group of citizens from the community of \nSaint Joseph, MO, was in my office. They traveled a long way to ask me: \nWhy do we not have a highway bill? I told them I wish I had a \nreasonable answer, but I do not.\n  Last Friday, I went to Kansas City, MO, where we had the road-\nbuilding group together and that was the union leaders, the \ncontractors, the community development people, the local elected \nofficials, and they gave me a stack of 43,000 signatures on petitions \nsaying pass this bill. Unfortunately, my suitcase was not big enough \nand the restrictions made it difficult for me to bring it here with me, \nbut if my colleagues want to see them we will bring 43,000 signatures \nto the floor to show how many Missourians want a highway bill.\n  They asked me why we have not even begun the process of meeting with \nthe House. There is no good reason, except politics, and that is not a \ngood reason.\n  Every single day someone asks me these questions, and now I ask my \ncolleagues once again why can we not start a highway bill conference? \nSome on the other side say they demand to know what is going to come \nout of the conference. I would love to know what is going to happen \ntomorrow. I would love to know what is going to happen the day after \ntomorrow. No one can say with certainty what is going to come out of \nany conference.\n  This is too important a bill to be a political football. We passed a \ntotal bill of $318 billion. The House passed one for a total of $275 \nbillion. We passed a much better bill. I want to see our bill passed. I \nwant to see $318 billion. I want to see the environmental streamlining \nin the bill that allows the environmental concerns to be raised early \non in the process and dealt with, that makes it easier to do the \nplanning.\n  The House bill had $11 billion worth of specific earmarks. My \ncolleagues probably read about it in the editorial pages. Now, the \noccupant of the chair may take great pride in the fact that some of \nthose were in a far northwest State, but I say to my colleagues we are \nnot going to be able to take a bill that has $11 billion of earmarks \nthat take away from the general allocation of funds among the States. \nSo that is something we have to negotiate, but we need to do that to \nget a good bill.\n  I cannot speak for the folks on the other side as to why they are \nwilling to kill the bill. They will not even let us go to conference to \ntry to get the bill that we passed. They have to be banking, I guess, \non perhaps a cynical notion that the American people will understand or \nthey will just blame Republicans, even though it is their side \ncurrently undertaking to kill the legislation.\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n  Are they killing it in hopes they can blame us? Is politics that \ncynical? I hope not. I thought we had to fight OMB to get the bill \ndone, and I am willing to make that fight.\n  As a matter of fact, people who have been around a long time know I \ntook on that fight against a President of my own party. The year I \ncampaigned, he made three wonderful appearances for me. I have great \nrespect for him, but he vetoed a highway bill, and I was the deciding \nvote that overrode that veto, much as I respected him, because I know \nhow important highways are to my State and to the country.\n  Several months ago we started the normal bipartisan process of \nwriting a highway bill. The bipartisanship carried through to a floor \nvote on the final bill. The Finance Committee provided the funds we \nneeded. It was paid for, without a tax increase and without bonding.\n  After we passed the bill, my colleagues and I cheered our success and \npraised the cooperative efforts across the aisle; yet somehow, now my \ncolleagues across the aisle tell me they do not trust me? Is this how \ngood faith bipartisanship is honored?\n  Will someone come to the floor and tell me that I have not acted in \ngood faith for days, weeks, and months through this process?\n  I have every intention to get a strong bipartisan conference report \nto the Senate floor and to the desk of the President but we cannot do \nthat if the Democrats prevent us from negotiating the final bipartisan \nbill. Unless they let the process go, this bill is dead and they will \nhave killed it; and for what?\n  My House counterpart Congressman Petri may have said it best as \nquoted in yesterday's edition of BNA:\n\n       House Highways, Transit and Pipelines Subcommittee Chairman \n     Tom Petri, R-Wis., hailed the move to ``normal order,'' Petri \n     said; people analyzing the situation said in the absence of \n     an agreement--on a number--it was better to go back to \n     conference because ``there might have been wisdom in the \n     ideas of the founding fathers.\n\n  The whole point of a conference with the House is to work out our \ndifferences and produce a final bill. It is past time to get to work on \nthose differences. I also read a quote in the paper yesterday where the \ndistinguished minority leader said his party did not want to ``roll the \ndice'' and hope they get adequate representation in conference.\n  Instead, I submit that my colleagues are ``rolling the dice'' with an \neven bigger gamble. Rather than even giving conference a chance, they \nare betting that voters will prefer procrastination over progress.\n  My constituents say, ``Senator, didn't the same people raising \nobjections vote for the bill?'' They also ask, ``Senator, didn't many \nDemocrats help draft the bill?'' Some even wonder ``Didn't I hear \nSenator so and so say the Nation needs a highway bill now?''\n  The resounding answer to all of their questions is yes. Yes, my \ncolleagues helped draft the bill. Yes, my colleagues voted in favor of \nthe bill. Yes, my colleagues make cries for a strong bill now. And, \nyes, unless the politics stop, they will also have killed this bill. To \nsteal a line from some great philosopher, they are all bark, no bite.\n  One week ago today I was on the Senate floor attempting to move this \nprocess forward. Now Republicans in both Chambers of the Capitol are \nprepared to work in conference to resolve our differences. In the near \nfuture, we will vote in the Senate to determine who really wants to \nback up their bark with a bite.\n  Right now safety and quality of life on our roads are taking a back \nseat to political warfare that has nothing to do with transportation. \nIt is time to end the filibuster on the highway bill.\n  That said, I renew my unanimous consent request from last week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof the House-passed highway bill, H.R. 3550; provided further, that all \nafter the enacting clause, be stricken, the text of S. 1072, as passed, \nbe inserted in lieu thereof; the bill be read a third time and passed; \nfurther, the Senate then insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House, and the Chair then be authorized to appoint conferees \non the part of the Senate with a ratio of 11 to 10.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, at this time I am not able \nto make a statement; so, I will make a statement when our time comes. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about a subject \nthat is dear to the heart of the Chair because Alaska contains much of \nthe energy that the United States needs. Yesterday, crude oil closed at \n$39.57 on the New York Exchange. Nationwide, the average price of \ngasoline is $1.84, expected to rise 5 to 10 cents over the next several \ndays, and even more as we enter the summer driving season which begins \non Memorial Day.\n  Natural gas prices are also at a record high for this year, 70 \npercent higher than they were a year ago. We are increasingly dependent \non imported supplies to set prices. In the Pacific Northwest, the \nsnowpack is at 50 percent of average, and so hydroelectric generation \nwill be at a record low this summer.\n  We currently import 55 percent of our oil. We will depend upon 70 \npercent for our demand by 2025. Meanwhile, we are experiencing record \ntemperatures in southern California where already there is a strain on \nthe region's electricity system.\n  I do not know what sort of psychological barriers need to be broken \nin the Senate to finally pass comprehensive energy legislation. We are \nvery close to breaking through every psychological barrier related to \nenergy policy. Oil will soon cost $40 a barrel. Gasoline will be over \n$2 a gallon. Natural gas will be permanently over $5 per MCF and the \nadequacy of our electricity generating grid this summer is now a simple \ncalculus. Will it be hotter than usual? Because if so, we will have \nblackouts again.\n  My colleagues will notice that I no longer believe that our growing \ndependence on imported oil will have the psychological impact necessary \nto motivate my colleagues into action on the Energy bill. For my part, \nI am alarmed. I see us becoming 70-percent dependent on imported oil. I \nread of terrorist threats against overseas oil infrastructure and \nrefining capacity, and I am amazed that I have colleagues who want to \nstop building our emergency supplies in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nor, even worse, call on us to use up those reserves now. In the past, \nthe result of such activity was miniscule in terms of its impact on \ngasoline prices. It is just something to talk about. It is not \nsomething that will do anything.\n  Instead, yesterday a number of Senators came to the floor and called \non the President to pressure OPEC to increase production and reduce \nprices. Does anybody assume he has not already done that? Does anybody \nassume they are interested in what we say today? It would be terrific \nif OPEC would do that, but I have to ask my colleagues, why would OPEC \ntake us seriously? OPEC sees us for what we are. We are hooked and we \ncannot even do the most incremental steps to begin to address this \nplight.\n  OPEC sees a Congress that has talked about passing an energy bill for \n10 years. They see a Congress that has failed every year for the last 3 \nyears to pass an energy bill. OPEC sees an America that lacks the \npolitical will to address its own crisis. Instead, we blame and \ncomplain. If you were OPEC, would you take us seriously?\n\n  Some say passing an energy bill will not do a lot for foreign crude \noil prices. I disagree. I think passing the first comprehensive energy \nbill to come out of this Congress in 12 years sends a strong signal to \noil-producing nations. I think if we do more to conserve energy, \nincrease production, diversify our energy supply, we will tell OPEC \nAmerica is a country with unity, commitment, and the political will to \naddress our most serious domestic problem, and that is our energy \nchallenges.\n  If Senate Democrats mean what they say when they wring their hands \nand lament the rising oil prices, pass this bill. When we voted last \nweek on the\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nauthorizing portion of the bill, we got only 14 Democrats to join us, \nand then someone on that side had the audacity to say it was the \nRepublicans' fault we didn't pass it. That is less than one-third of \nthe Democrats who voted in favor of it. Yet the steady stream of \nSenators who come down here to speechify on energy is from the other \nside. They are Democrats. Some of the Democrats down here on the Senate \nfloor yesterday wringing their hands about gasoline prices, blaming the \nadministration yesterday, are the same Senators who voted against the \nEnergy bill last week.\n  Last summer we had the biggest blackout in the Nation's history \nduring the August recess. You all remember that. When Congress \nreturned, Senators went to the Senate floor to make speeches, to wring \ntheir hands about the problem in our power grid. Some of those same \nSenators turned around a few weeks later and voted against an energy \nbill that mandated electricity reliability. Everyone who knows anything \nsays that must be adopted if we are to rearrange things and have power \nover the utility lines so we will not have blackouts. It is recommended \nby everyone who knows anything about it, and we sit here and fail to \npass the bill that contains it.\n  Gasoline prices have shattered all records in April. Prices could \nreach $3 by late September. I know that is a startling statement, but I \nmake it because I believe it. Prices could reach $3 a gallon by late \nsummer. Natural gas prices on average are 70 percent higher than last \nyear. Our electricity grid is every bit as vulnerable to a blackout \ntoday as last summer, and we stand here making speeches and passing the \nblame: Blame OPEC, blame the President.\n  The buck stops here. It is up to this Congress to pass a bill that \nstabilizes the price of oil, gas, coal, and natural gas. It is up to \nthis Congress to pass a bill that increases our production of energy \nfrom natural gas, wind, solar, geothermal, and clean coal. It is up to \nthis Congress to mandate electricity reliability. Let's stop \npoliticking on this energy bill and on this energy problem. Let's stop \nlooking to foreign shores to solve our problems. Let's stop looking to \nOPEC so they would have the will. Let us unify and resolve that lack of \nenthusiasm and unity. Let's roll up our sleeves and pass an energy \nbill.\n  It is possible. The bill before us now contains about half the Energy \nbill. It has all the tax credits that will bring much of the energy \nthat I have spoken about on board America. It will not do the whole \njob, but it will do something. We understand there are Senators who do \nnot want to see that pass. It has broad support and it will do \nsomething significant. I trust we will pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise in support of S. Con. Res. 99, \ncondemning the Government of the Republic of the Sudan for its \nparticipation and complicity in the attacks against innocent civilians \nin the impoverished Darfur region of western Sudan.\n  I commend my fellow cosponsors of this resolution for taking this \nessential first step in addressing the dual crises in Sudan. We must \ncondemn the Government of Sudan for its complicity in the human rights \nabuses and their gross failure to put an end to the current genocide.\n  In addition to the gross human rights violations, we now face a \nhumanitarian disaster. Over a million people are displaced and well \nover a hundred thousand have fled over the border to Chad.\n  The Government of Sudan is only making matters more difficult by \nresisting, delaying, frustrating the work of humanitarian assistance \ngroups, and the situation gets worse. Roads in the region are only \naccessible to the most sturdy of jeeps and trucks, and once the rainy \nseason starts in just a couple of weeks, those roads will be wiped out, \ncutting off aid altogether. The clock is ticking. We certainly cannot \ncontrol Mother Nature, so the world must act now.\n  I believe there are a few essentials that we should do immediately. \nFirst, the United States must push the United Nations Security Council \nto authorize a stability and support operation under chapter VII to \nhelp stop the atrocities and help distribute humanitarian aid. I would \nalso like to see an expansion of the civilian protection monitoring \nteams into the Darfur region. The Government of Sudan has had long \nenough time to stop the killing and facilitate the flow of aid. With \nthe rainy season coming, we cannot tell the people of Darfur to give \ntheir government more time to comply.\n  This may sound as if it is a radical step, but this step is needed. \nWe should not be, and do not want to be, in the situation 6 months or a \nyear or 2 years from now where we look back and say we should have \ntaken this step--oh, if we only would have sent this U.N. force in; if \nwe only would have sent these troops in we could have saved hundreds of \nthousands of lives--because that is the situation we are going to be \nin. We are going to look back and say, if we only would have acted, if \nthe world only would have acted, these lives could have been saved. Why \ndidn't we act? That is what has to take place. That, clearly, is what \nshould take place.\n  Second, I believe Congress should amend the Sudan Peace Act to \nrequire improvements in Darfur. We have the ability here in Congress to \ndo that.\n  Third, the United States should target sanctions against any members \nof the Sudanese Government found to be involved in these atrocities. We \nhave done it in regard to other individuals in other governments in \nother countries. We should do it in regard to these individuals. We \nshould make it very clear to them they will be held accountable.\n  Finally, the international community must act now. We need a special \nsession of the U.N. Human Rights Commission to appoint a special \nrapporteur for Sudan. The international community should also consider \na special tribunal to investigate the atrocities.\n  These steps form a broad outline of what must be done. We must work \ntogether with the administration in the coming days to iron out the \ndetails so we can move forward. The crisis is here, it is now, and this \nis what we must do. Clearly, this is a case of genocide, and the \ninternational community must face its moral responsibility to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4940-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4940-S4941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CRISIS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, let me turn to another area in the world \nwhere there is another humanitarian crisis, and that is the country of \nHaiti. I will be very brief because I have come to the Senate floor \nmany times before to talk about Haiti.\n  Haitian Prime Minister Latortue was on Capitol Hill yesterday. I had \nthe opportunity to meet with him. The majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader met with him, as well as other Senators. The Prime \nMinister is a very impressive man. He is a man who faces a very \ndifficult task in Haiti. The U.S. troops are scheduled to leave June 1 \nto be replaced with U.N. troops.\n  I will not try to summarize the message from the Prime Minister, but \ntwo things he said were very important which I will share with my \ncolleagues. First, the Prime Minister made a very strong case to the \nMembers of the Senate whom he talked to for the passage of a bill \nSenator Dodd and I have introduced in the Senate, a bill that, \naccording to the Prime Minister, within a relatively short period of \ntime would help create an additional 100,000 jobs in Haiti, 100,000 \njobs that are desperately needed.\n  This is a trade bill Senator Dodd and I have introduced that is \npending in the Senate. It has bipartisan support. There is a companion \nbill introduced by Congressman Clay Shaw in the House of \nRepresentatives. I again call my colleagues' attention to this bill and \nhope we can act on this bill this year. It is a bill that would restore \nthe assembly jobs in Haiti. Haiti at one time had many assembly jobs. \nAfter the sanctions were imposed during the Clinton administration, \nthese jobs basically went away. This bill will help restore these jobs. \nIt will make a big difference for Haiti.\n  The other point the Prime Minister made was the Haitian Government \ntoday is in desperate need of cash.\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nThey cannot even do little things such as get the electricity back on. \nI have talked to Mr. Noriega in our administration. I have talked to \nSecretary Colin Powell. Both are very sympathetic to what is going on \nin Haiti and the needs of the Haitian Government. Secretary Powell has \nassured me the administration is trying to reprogram money and to get \nadditional money for Haiti. Everyone agrees and understands the urgent \nneed for this money.\n  I simply say to the administration, this money is desperately needed \nnow. The new Haitian Government is struggling. They need to show the \npeople of Haiti some immediate victories. If the people of Haiti are to \nhave some confidence in this new Government, if they are to believe in \nthis new Government, if they are to have confidence in the new \nGovernment, they have to see something tangible and they have to see it \nfairly quickly.\n  I hope our administration will be able to reprogram some money, will \nbe able to set some money aside and get that money to Haiti so this new \nGovernment will be able to show the people of Haiti some good faith, be \nable to show them some victories, and the people of Haiti will be able \nto see there is, in fact, some hope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I believe many in the press world and \ntoo many outside the beltway are observing the gridlock in the Senate \nand probably just dismissing it as ``politics as usual.''\n  The truth is, it is not politics as usual. It is politics at its \nworst. The result is Americans are getting the worst, the very worst \nfrom the Senate, when they deserve the best.\n  With gridlock jamming our Nation's highways, we get gridlock on the \nhighway bill right here in the Senate. With our Nation's energy supply \nuncertain, the fate of the Energy bill in the Senate is equally \nuncertain. With a work-based welfare system doing wonders across \nAmerica, we see no work allowed on welfare reform in the Senate. As \nbacklogged as courtrooms are with lawsuits, so, too, is the Senate \nbacklogged with sensible tort reform. As emergency room patients wait \nfor a doctor's care, so, too, do emergency room doctors wait for \nmedical lawsuit reform from the Senate.\n  Gridlock, uncertainty, inaction, backlog, and delay; that is all the \nSenate is serving up these days. Gridlock, uncertainty, inaction, \nbacklog, and delay is all that is on the menu in the Senate these days.\n  There is a price for obstruction. It is real. It is painful and it is \nrising. Let me give a few examples.\n  For decades, now, congestion has been rising. According to the \ncommittee report on the highway bill, the extra time needed for a rush-\nhour commute has tripled over the past two decades. The resulting \ncongestion costs every man, woman, and child in the United States $520 \na year. About a billion gallons of gasoline are wasted every 2 months \non U.S. roads.\n  Yet this highway bill we have could create hundreds of thousands of \njobs in the next few years. This highway bill is being prevented from \nbeing written, right here in the Senate. This highway bill, which would \nprevent almost half a million accidents, save almost 2,000 lives over \nthe next two decades, this bill is stalled on an open road to nowhere.\n  Why? Because of Democratic obstruction. The House version and Senate \nversion of the bill are blocked by Democrats from going to conference \nto resolve our differences. It is the way we legislate in the Congress.\n  With gas prices rising this year, with wide-scale electrical \nblackouts last year, and with Middle East tensions every year, the \nEnergy bill is again stalled, going well into its third year of delay. \nBut a bill that will, according to the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, create 650,000 new jobs, that will boost the \neconomy and secure our energy supplies, is blocked by Democratic \nfilibusters.\n  Do we have to have another blackout before we are permitted to act? \nDo we have to have total shutdown of our freeways before the highway \nbill will be freed?\n  The price of obstruction is real. It is rising. And there appears to \nbe little relief in sight in our roads, at our pumps, in our \ncourtrooms, our emergency rooms, and our employment offices across \nAmerica, all due to obstruction by Democrats.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time is left on the majority side \nin morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the majority side there are 2 minutes 49 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I want everyone to listen. I know the best \ndefense is good offense. That was learned long before I used those \nwords. But that is what we have going on here today. We now have and \nhave worked all week on a bill that is extremely important to this \ncountry. We refer to it as FSC. It is a tax bill that deals with \ncorporate America.\n  As we speak, corporate America is being assessed penalties as a \nresult of trade sanctions that have been placed on them by the World \nTrade Organization. We are trying to work our way out of that, and we \nare very close to being able to pass a bill. But the majority, as they \ndo all the time, will not let us finish the bill.\n  Do you know what is holding up the FSC bill? Because the slow walk \nstarted last night. Four amendments. Four amendments: One by Senator \nFeingold, which basically says we should buy American products. He \nwants 5 minutes. Senator Cantwell wants to extend unemployment \nbenefits, 30 minutes; Senator Frank Lautenberg wants corporations that \nhave foreign subsidiaries not to do business with terrorist countries. \nIt does not sound too outlandish to me. Senator Corzine wants to impose \n301 actions, which basically is called super 301, which simply says the \nPresident has to enforce our trade laws.\n  Those are the four amendments, taking a total of an hour and 35 \nminutes, the majority will not let us go forward with on this bill. \nThat is it, an hour and 35 minutes. Tough votes by some. I don't know \nwhy it would be hard to vote ``buy America'' or extend unemployment \nbenefits or say foreign subsidiaries should not do business with \nterrorist organizations or countries, and enforce our trade laws. That \nis what they are.\n\n  But now we will hear the speeches: The Democrats are not allowing us \nto go forward with this most important--\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\nthey call it the JOBS bill; I will call it the JOBS bill. It is a way \nof kind of diverting our attention away from the real jobs problem, but \nit is a jobs bill. I acknowledge that. But that is what we are faced \nwith here.\n  The same good defense is being used offensively here because my dear \nfriend, the Senator from Missouri, has come to the floor and said: The \nDemocrats won't let us do our highway bill.\n  I have here--and I am not going to bring out all three charts, but \nthey are here--oh, I am sorry, we couldn't get them on three--there are \nfour charts of the 390-plus organizations that are saying: We agree \nwith the Democrats. We should not go to conference. They want $318 \nbillion in funding.\n  Now, why don't the Democrats want to vote on this? Are we being \npartisan? Maybe we have memories. Maybe we can reflect back on what \nhappened to the Energy bill. We went to conference with the Energy \nbill. We not only were not allowed to go to the conference, we did not \nknow where the conference meetings were held.\n  Medicare. We also remember that. We at least knew where the meetings \nwere held because the Republicans told us: You can have two people. We \nasked others to come to the meeting. They closed the meetings. That is \nnot what a conference is all about.\n  Yes, we do have memories. And through all this: Oh, they won't let us \ndo a highway bill. They are filibustering.\n  If a conference were appointed 5 minutes from now, what would happen \nis what we want to happen. If a conference were appointed 5 minutes \nfrom now, we would have the staffs of the Senate--majority and \nminority--meet to decide what actually should be done. It would be easy \nbecause it is a bipartisan bill. Then we would go over and meet with \nour counterparts in the House, and the staffs would meet.\n  This is a big bill. It would take weeks, at least 2 solid weeks, with \n20-hour-a-day, 6-day weeks, to get us to that point. They will not let \nus do that. The majority will not allow the staffs to meet on this \nbill. For people to say the only way to do a bill is to have this \nconference is foolishness--foolishness. We have passed lots of bills, \nin fact, scores of bills without going to conference. We have something \nwe call a preconference, and it is just as I described would happen \nfollowing the appointment of conferees.\n  So we understand, if we were working with an administration like this \nthat is so unreasonable, so impossible to deal with, and I were in the \nmajority, and I had a President like they were dealing with, I would \nprobably come out and do the same thing. It is all they can do. They \nare desperate. But we have the necessity of coming up with legislation \nthat is truly legislation that is good for the country, not necessarily \ngood for the President's reelection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4942-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4942-S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR ACTIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want to read the first two paragraphs of \nan editorial that appeared in the New York Times today, written by \nThomas Friedman.\n\n       We are in danger of losing something much more important \n     than just the war in Iraq. We are in danger of losing America \n     as an instrument of moral authority and inspiration in the \n     world. I have never known a time in my life when America and \n     its president were more hated around the world than today. I \n     was just in Japan, and even young Japanese dislike us. It's \n     no wonder that so many Americans are obsessed with the finale \n     of the sitcom ``Friends'' right now. They're the only friends \n     we have, and even they're leaving.\n       This administration needs to undertake a total overhaul of \n     its Iraq policy; otherwise, it is courting a total disaster \n     for us all.\n\n  I have been married for more than four decades, and there have been a \nlot of things that I think have made our marriage a success. I married \na girl I met in high school. The main thing that has been good for our \nmarriage is the ability for both of us to say ``I'm sorry.''\n\n  Relations in other aspects of our lives are based on the same \nprinciples of relationship that couples have. For example, the \nfoundations of nations, of countries are formed by relationships \nbetween people.\n  When I got home last night, my wife said words to me to the effect: I \nwatched all the news today. Why couldn't the President say he was \nsorry?\n  I had no answer for that. I flipped on the television set. The first \ntwo people I saw on TV interviewing others asked the same question: Why \ncouldn't the President say he was sorry. Why couldn't the President say \nhe was sorry, not only for himself but for all Americans? This is \nexpected in America.\n  I guess he couldn't say he was sorry for the same reason that in his \nlast press conference he couldn't say he had made a mistake. I add this \nto the list of mistakes that are paramount, No. 1, when he claimed on \nthe aircraft carrier, with his flight suit that he borrowed from \nsomebody, that major combat was over, and had the banner ``mission \naccomplished.'' The mission was not accomplished. He should have \nacknowledged that as a mistake. Then just a few days later, when \nsomeone said there are problems going on in Iraq, he said: ``Bring it \non.'' Well, we have almost 800 dead men and women. I think that was a \nmistake.\n  It was a mistake yesterday when he had the time and the ability to \nsay he was sorry. I don't have the position and power of the President \nof the United States; I know that. But I have the ability to say that \nall America is sorry for what went on in the prisoner of war camps in \nIraq. What went on in those prison camps does not represent America or \nits valiant military men and women.\n  We have so many reasons to be proud of what our Armed Forces have \ndone for this country, not just over the last couple of years but since \nour founding. We are reminded of that heroic service as we look out on \nThe Mall. We are going to dedicate in a couple of weeks a memorial to \nthe 16 million men and women who served in World War II. On Memorial \nDay, during that dedication, we will not only remember the 16 million \nwho served but the nearly 800 who have lost their lives in Iraq.\n  One of the hallmarks of our military in this great democracy is that \nour military is controlled not by soldiers, sailors, and airmen, but by \ncivilians. We maintain this critical feature of our system with checks \nand balances by having a Commander in Chief who is a civilian. The \nSecretary of Defense and his deputies are civilians, so these remarks \nare directed to the civilian leadership of our military.\n  Harry Truman was a war President. He had a sign on his desk that \nsaid, ``The buck stops here.'' He knew that in any administration there \nwould be mistakes, and he accepted responsibility for mistakes that \noccurred on his watch.\n  President Truman knew it was important to admit mistakes and take \nresponsibility so the mistakes would not be repeated. He knew if we \ndidn't admit mistakes, we couldn't learn from them.\n  The current administration has made some mistakes, and I have \noutlined some of them. We know in the first gulf war 90 percent of the \nwar costs were paid for by other countries, and our allies provided \nabout 200,000 troops. But in this war we are bearing 90 percent of the \ncost and taking 90 percent of the casualties. They said Iraqi oil \nrevenues would pay to rebuild the country, but we keep appropriating \nmore money and are being asked to come up with $25 billion more.\n  Vice President Cheney predicted that our soldiers would be greeted as \nheroes, bouquets would be thrown. Bombs are being thrown instead. We \nare now hearing that the administration received warnings about the \ntreatment of prisoners months ago, but those warnings were not taken \nseriously.\n  Last week, when Secretary Rumsfeld was in the Capitol in 407, the \nroom where we hear classified information, we weren't told that ``60 \nMinutes'' that very night would have a story about mistreatment of \nprisoners, with pictures of naked men, Iraqi prisoners, to humiliate \nthem. Now it has humiliated America. We should have been warned about \nthat. They knew or should have known that they were about to become \npublic and that they would affect the course of events in the ongoing \nwar on terror. After the civilian leadership has claimed for months \nthat it needed no more money, we are now asked for $25 billion.\n  This is not to cast stones but to cast responsibility. Mistakes \nalways have consequences. In war, the consequences are a matter of life \nor death. We talk in\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\nthe Senate about accountability. We want schoolteachers and public \nemployees to be accountable. But we must look beyond that at why our \ncivilian military should also be held accountable.\n  Our Founding Fathers believed that the civilian leaders of our \nmilitary should be held accountable. I share that belief. I hope the \nPresident does.\n  The time has been allocated to my friends. Senator Kohl has 5 \nminutes; Senator Feingold, 8 minutes; Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss juvenile crime and \njuvenile crime prevention programs. We must remember that a strategy to \ncombat juvenile crime consists of a large dose of prevention programs \nas well as strong enforcement. Juvenile justice programs have proven \ntime and time again that they help prevent crime, strengthen \ncommunities, and give children a second chance to succeed and lead \nhealthy lives. It is no secret that robust funding for these programs \nin the 1990s contributed to a 68 percent drop in juvenile crime from \n1994 to 2000. Most importantly, investment in our at-risk children will \nhelp prevent a life marred by crime and wasted in prison.\n  For these programs to succeed, however, they must be priorities for \nthis Congress and for this administration. We fear that we are failing \nto live up to our responsibility on this essential issue. A little more \nthan 3 months ago, President Bush released his fiscal year 2005 budget \nproposal. In it, juvenile justice and delinquency programs will receive \nonly about one-third of the funding they received 3 years ago. This is \nat a time when recent statistics indicate an uptick in juvenile crime \nand an increase in school murder rates.\n  We understand that other priorities compete with juvenile justice \nfunding and local crime prevention programs. Yet the amounts we are \ndiscussing are so small in the grand scheme of the budget, and the \nresults from the programs so immense, that they mandate our attention.\n  When the Senate considered the budget resolution, we began to address \nthe shortfalls in juvenile justice funding. I was pleased to work with \nSenators Hatch and Biden on an amendment to restore cuts made to \njuvenile justice programs and local law enforcement funding. Our \namendment represents a step in the right direction by restoring \njuvenile justice funding to last year's levels, and reversing the trend \nof ever-diminishing appropriations for these programs. It is essential \nthat the Kohl-Hatch-Biden amendment that restores juvenile justice \nfunding remain in the final Budget Resolution.\n  These programs are a wise investment. For every dollar spent on \nprevention, we save $3 to $4 in costs associated with juvenile crime. \nFurthermore, law enforcement officials strongly support prevention \nefforts. A recent poll shows that 71 percent of police chiefs, sheriffs \nand prosecutors believe that crime prevention efforts would have the \ngreatest impact in reducing youth violence and crime. So for those who \nmay fear that a crime prevention strategy is not ``tough'' enough on \njuveniles, we suggest that these programs make sound economic sense and \nare overwhelmingly endorsed by law enforcement. We must do a better job \nof funding them.\n  Let me tell you about two essential programs. In 1992, we established \nthe Title V Local Delinquency Prevention Program. Title V was and \nremains unique in that it is the only source of federal funding solely \ndedicated to juvenile crime prevention efforts. More importantly, Title \nV has proven to be a very successful program that encourages \ninvestment, collaboration, and long-range prevention planning by local \ncommunities.\n  Title V programs include preschool and parent training programs, \nyouth mentoring, after-school activities, tutoring, truancy reduction, \nsubstance abuse prevention and gang prevention outreach. Through these \ninitiatives, large cities like Milwaukee to small communities like \nLadysmith, WI are creating environments that strengthen families and \nhelp children avoid crime and develop into productive adults.\n  Enforcement is an important part of the overall strategy, but the \nadministration cuts those programs as well. Positive intervention and \ntreatment at this early stage of delinquency can prevent further \nviolent behavior and steer a young person in the right direction before \nit is too late. Realizing this, Congress created the Juvenile \nAccountability Incentive Block Grant Program, JAIBG, in 1997 and \nprovided it with healthy funding levels of $250 million. Congress \nreauthorized Title V and JAIBG in 2002 at even greater levels. And we \nimproved JAIBG by adding substance abuse and mental health counseling, \nrestitution, community service, and supervised probations to the list \nof program options. The reauthorized program also ensures State and \nlocal accountability for proper and effective uses of funds.\n  We have a choice in this Congress of where we want to invest our \nmoney. We can choose to address the roots of crime and invest in our \nchildren by preventing a life of criminal behavior. We can choose to \nintervene in a positive manner to work with those teens that have \nfallen through the cracks and have had a few scrapes with the law. We \ncan turn many of those kids around. I urge my colleagues to make the \nright choice this year and boost funding for the Title V program, the \nJuvenile Accountability Block Grant program, and juvenile justice \nprograms overall. We can and must do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4943-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4943-S4944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncalling attention to the horrifying crisis in Darfur, a part of western \nSudan where over a million people have been displaced by a brutal \ncampaign of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by government-backed militia \nforces and official Sudanese forces.\n  Human Rights Watch has documented massacres, widespread rape, massive \nforced displacement, and indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilians \nin Darfur. Amnesty International indicates that the ceasefire agreement \nsigned on April 8 has not stopped the attacks against civilians on the \nground, stating that ``attacks on villages continue; indiscriminate and \ndeliberate killings of civilians continue; looting continues and rapes \ncontinue.'' Doctors Without Borders, which is actually on the ground \ndelivering services in parts of Darfur, warns of desperate malnutrition \nand tells us that the absence of food aid on the ground is especially \nalarming because measles have broken out among the displaced, and \nmeasles can seriously aggravate malnutrition.\n  Because so many homes and farms and mosques and entire villages have \nbeen burned and totally destroyed, and because normal life has been so \nthoroughly disrupted, because fear still dominates the lives of so many \ncivilians, and because the rainy season is beginning--making much of \nDarfur completely inaccessible by road--literally hundreds of thousands \ncould die of starvation. The humanitarian task before the world would \nbe mammoth even if a major political breakthrough backed by what we \nhave not seen to date--actual effective action taken by the government \nof Sudan to put a stop to the attacks on civilians. Without such \naction, the crisis deepens each day.\n  And even as the government of Sudan has failed to take effective \naction to stop the attacks and protect the Sudanese people, they also \nhave denied humanitarian organizations and international investigators \naccess to Darfur, deliberately undermining the world's efforts to help \nthose who are suffering and starving. The government's aim appears to \nbe to drive ethnic Africans out of Darfur, and to shield this abhorrent \nagenda from the eyes of the international community.\n  It is a disgrace that this same government was just elected to a \nthird term on the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Africans have \nas great a stake in the commission's work and aims as any people \nanywhere in the world. They deserve far better representation.\n  Mr. President, crimes against humanity have been and continue to be \nperpetrated in Darfur, and the criminals responsible for these \natrocities--the planners directing this horror at the highest levels--\nshould be brought to justice.\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\n  I am proud to have joined with my colleague, Senator Brownback, who \nis deeply committed to Sudan, in introducing S. Con Res. 99. And I am \nso pleased to have been able to work as part of a bipartisan group, \nincluding Senators Frist, Daschle, Biden, Lugar, Alexander, Kennedy and \nDeWine on Sudan issue over the years. I mention as well that Senator \nDurbin has been enormously helpful at this time, issue, and discussion \npossible. I hope that today, by calling for urgent action to implement \na humanitarian response plan that does not bow to the constraints \nimposed by the wishes of the Sudanese Government, we can encourage \nthose working to respond to the needs on the ground. And by calling for \na Security Council resolution addressing the situation in Darfur, this \nresolution will make it crystal clear to the Sudanese government that \nthe current situation is simply unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the State Department and the \nWhite House to bring an end to Sudan's long and tragic north-south \nconflict. But the hopes that we all harbor of achieving a just and \nlasting end to that crisis simply cannot be meaningfully realized in \nthe context of the kind of brutality we see in Darfur.\n  At the same time, any hopes that the government of Sudan harbors of \nan easing of economic pressure or isolation stand no chance--no chance \nat all, Mr. President--of being realized until the situation in Darfur \nchanges, the attacks are stopped, and the international community--from \nhumanitarian aid agencies to cease-fire monitors to U.N. \ninvestigators--has full, unfettered access to the region. We need to \nsee real change--not rhetorical change, not change on paper, not change \non some days not more of the same on others. And we need to see it \nright away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Feingold and Senator \nBrownback and our colleagues for raising this issue not just on the \nfloor of the Senate but also across our Nation, because it is an issue \nof enormous importance and consequence, as it should be for all \nAmericans and for people all over the world.\n  It has been 10 years since the Rwanda genocide. A decade ago, 8,000 \nRwandans were being killed every day. Yet the international community \nwas silent. We did not stop the deaths of 800,000 Tutsis and \npolitically moderate Hutu, in spite of our commitment that genocide \nmust never again darken the annals of human history.\n  Sadly, we may now be repeating the same mistake in Sudan.\n  Over the past few weeks, reports of severe ethnic violence have come \nfrom Darfur, a region of western Sudan. We have heard accounts of \nthousands or even tens of thousands of people murdered, of widespread \nrape, and of people's homes burned to the ground.\n  The Sudanese government has refused to allow full access to western \nSudan. International monitors and humanitarian workers have been \nprevented from reaching the area. We need immediate access to gather \nmore information on what is happening and to provide urgent \nhumanitarian relief to the one million people the United Nations \nreports have been displaced internally in Sudan or across the border to \nChad.\n  Many of us hoped that the humanitarian ceasefire and agreement \nearlier this month between the Sudanese government and rebel forces in \nwestern Sudan would end the many months of violence against entire \ncommunities. It has not.\n  The burning of homes and crops of desperately poor villagers has left \nin its ashes a humanitarian disaster. Without immediate relief, experts \npredict deaths in the hundreds of thousands. The cruelty of the \nGovernment of Sudan and its paramilitary allies against other ethnic \ngroups raises the very real specter of genocide.\n  The United States and the international community need to act now, to \nstop this brutality, to save lives. If we fail to act--and to act now--\nthe consequences will be dire.\n  United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan was eloquent in his \nstatement at the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Rwanda \ngenocide. He said that he would not permit Darfur to become the first \ngenocide of the 21st century.\n  There will be discussion in Washington and around the world about \nwhether the ethnic violence in Darfur is, in fact, genocide, but we \ncannot allow the debate over definitions obstruct our ability to act as \nsoon as possible.\n  It is a matter of the highest moral responsibility for each of us \nindividually, for Congress, for the United States, and for the global \ncommunity to do all we can to stop the violence against innocents in \nDarfur. We must act, because thousands of people's lives will be lost \nif we do not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, this is a troubling time in America. \nYesterday I spoke on this Senate floor about the despicable abuses \nperpetrated against Iraqi prisoners. The damage done to every American \nand to the reputation of our great Nation as a whole as a result of \nthese barbaric acts is incalculable. It has severely tarnished our \nimage as a nation of laws, a nation that for more than two centuries \nhas been a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world.\n  Every day, quite rightly, we pride ourselves on our Constitution and \nour Bill of Rights. After all, they were the template for the universal \ndeclaration of human rights. We often criticize other nations for \nviolating those rights, for engaging in torture and other crimes, and \nit is right that we do. We should speak out when human rights and \nliberties are violated whenever and wherever it occurs.\n  But today we see our own faces in the mirror. Until recently, it was \nbeyond our ability to contemplate that we would become the subject of \nsuch universal ridicule and scorn for the actions of a handful.\n  The reputation of our Armed Forces, certainly since the First World \nWar, has deservedly been the finest in the world. As the father of a \nformer marine, I can attest that the training of our troops and the \noutstanding performance of the vast majority of them should make every \nAmerican proud. They conduct themselves professionally. They treat \nothers with respect. They perform bravely. And 138,000 men and women \nare courageously wearing America's uniform in Iraq today. Now they are \nendangered there and around the world.\n  At the heart of this problem is a failure of leadership, not \n``followship.'' We have heard from the Secretary of Defense. He was \nappalled by what happened, so appalled that he did not bother to read \nthe report that described the horrific conditions at Abu Ghraib prison \neven though he had been aware of the concerns for months; so appalled \nhe forgot that it was he who decided, apparently on his own, that the \nU.S. military would no longer be bound by the Geneva Conventions, an \nastounding decision when one considers its implication; so appalled \nthat his Department has treated those of us who have asked questions \nand sought information about the interrogation practices at U.S. \nmilitary detention facilities after reports of torture and even \nhomicide as a nuisance; so appalled that for days he treated this whole \nepisode as though he could not quite grasp what all the fuss was about. \nAfter all, these are terrorists, and we are fighting a war.\n  I have known Secretary Rumsfeld for 30 years. I like him. He is \nhighly intelligent. He has served his country with great devotion. But \nI believe that he and the Deputy Secretary bear ultimate responsibility \nfor this catastrophe.\n  The post-war chaos in Iraq that has resulted from such miserably poor \nplanning--and so many people warned them that it was miserably poor \nplanning--has claimed the lives and limbs of hundreds of America's \ntroops and civilians and thousands of Iraqis, including many civilians. \nIt has caused deep divisions between ourselves and the Iraqi people and \nMuslims around the world. It has so damaged our image as a nation that \nstands for respect for\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nhuman rights. This represents a colossal failure of leadership.\n  For 2 years, we have heard that if you are not with us, you are \nagainst us. Who is with us now? And who was ever with us? The coalition \nthe President speaks of is a mirage. It is Americans who are dying. It \nis Americans who are paying the price--another $25 billion, according \nto the President today, and that is only for the next few months. \nAnother $50 billion at least will be necessary next year just for Iraq. \nThat is $75 billion we do not have to pay teachers and police and \nfirefighters and other needs in America.\n\n  We have heard how the Secretary of Defense waited for months to tell \nthe Congress about what was happening in that prison. When the \nphotographs appeared in the press, he and the National Security \nAdviser, the President, everybody else said they were stunned and \nshocked and said these were isolated incidents. The only thing they \ncould have been shocked by was that the facts became public because \nthey had known about them for a very long time. That is the real \nquestion that should trouble each one of us: Why we thought it was OK \nto behave this way. It represents a serious flaw of character, of \nmorality, of decency, of professionalism, of training. It does not \nreflect the great military of our country. It certainly does not \nreflect the values of America, and we have to ask the leaders: Why did \nyou allow this shame to happen? Why did you allow America--America--to \nbe shamed this way throughout the world?\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that following morning business today the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 685, the \nnomination of John Negroponte to be Ambassador to Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I certainly will not \nobject, we hope to work very closely with our Republican friends and \nhave a good discussion and debate about the Negroponte nomination. I \nunderstand there are a number of other Senators who wish to be \nrecognized in regard to this nomination.\n  Last night, we confirmed two members of the Federal Marine Maritime \nCommission and the nominee for chief executive officer of the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation. We are now going to get the agreement \non Ambassador Negroponte, and we hope before the end of the day to \nannounce an agreement on additional ambassadors who might be confirmed \nyet today as well.\n  I hope all of the cooperation that is being demonstrated will allow \nthe administration to reciprocate with a number of our nominees to \nvarious boards and commissions from whom we have yet to hear. So I look \nforward to working through the confirmation of the Negroponte \nnomination today and the ambassadors tonight, and our hope is we can \nget additional cooperation from the administration on our board \nnominees very shortly.\n  I have no objection to going forward as the majority leader has now \nproposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I am pleased we are making progress. The fact that we are \ngoing to the debate on the future Ambassador of Iraq, Mr. Negroponte, \ndemonstrates that we are making some progress. We have a whole series \nof judges who must be addressed, a whole series of nominees who were \njust mentioned who must be addressed, and a whole series of ambassadors \non whom it sounds as though we are making some progress with the \nNegroponte nomination, as well as what we will see take place later \nduring the day.\n  I further ask consent that there then be 5 hours 30 minutes equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee; provided further that the minority time be divided \namong the list that is at the desk. I also ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader \nif it is his intention to go back to the FSC bill after we have \ncompleted this work. I have consulted with the assistant Democratic \nleader. We are now down to four amendments which will only require 1 \nhour 35 minutes on our side. We are getting down to a very small \nnumber. Only 1 hour 35 minutes on four amendments, and we would be \nfinished with the bill as far as our side is concerned.\n\n  I ask the majority leader if it is his intention to complete work on \nthe FSC bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, through the Chair, our \nintention is that as soon as we finish the 5 hours 30 minutes, we go \nback to the FSC/ETI JOBS bill. We have made tremendous progress on the \nbill. I congratulate the managers for their leadership over the course \nof the week. They have done a commendable job in getting the number of \namendments both down and dealt with. Some have been adopted. Some have \nhad votes on them over the course of the week. Our intention is, as \nsoon as we finish the Negroponte nomination debate and vote, to go back \nto FSC/ETI. I hope all 5 hours 30 minutes might not be required on the \nNegroponte nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  There is still 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining for the Democratic Party. The \nSenator from New Jersey has 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. May I make an inquiry? Are there other of my colleagues \nrequesting time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that \ntoo easily comes off our agenda in America and around the globe. We \naccepted S. Con. Res. 99 which condemns the Government of the Republic \nof Sudan for its participation and complicity in the attacks against \ninnocent civilians in the impoverished Darfur region of western Sudan. \nI think it is not enough just for us to be condemning in this \nsituation. It has all of the makings of turning into a humanitarian \ncrisis that rivals or at least approaches the kinds of problems we saw \nin Rwanda.\n  While we will take a stand in recognizing it as a problem, I think it \nis absolutely essential that we maintain attention and focus when there \nare so many events in the world that draw us away.\n  The United Nations, international humanitarian and human rights \norganizations, as well as our own Government, agree that the campaign \nby the extremist, theocratic Sudanese Government and their militia \nallies against Muslim civilians of African ethnicity in Darfur, western \nSudan, over the last 14 months has driven over 1 million civilians from \ntheir home. We have the risk of another tragic genocidal action in \nplace.\n  The 1 million Muslim civilians displaced within Darfur, Sudanese \ncitizens victimized by their own Government, cling to life as \ndisplaced, homeless persons living in the open or in pathetic and \ninadequate camps, in constant fear of further attacks and depredation.\n  Their physical condition is severely weakened, food supplies are \nexhausted, and the international community so far has been unable to \nget critically needed food assistance into the interior, due to \ndeliberate interference and\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nobstruction by the Khartoum government. These individuals, these Muslim \ncivilians, are fleeing systematic attacks by their own Government, \nSudanese armed forces, and their militia allies, the ``janjaweed.''\n  The horrors which civilian families in Darfur are fleeing include the \ncold-blooded murder of unarmed civilians; pillage and burning of \nvillages; organized, systematic rapes of women--wives, daughters, \nsisters; rape used as a deliberate weapon of terror and political \ncontrol; and the deliberate destruction of farms, the irrigation \nsystems, and food stockpiles on which this already impoverished region \ndepends; in other words, deliberately manufactured starvation that will \nlead to the kind of real potential for genocide that we have seen in \nother places on the African Continent. We must stay alert. We must keep \nthe focus of public opinion on this issue.\n  Last is a key point. Even though from 10,000 to as many as 30,000 \ncivilians have died so far in Darfur since February, 2003, the final \ndeath numbers for 2004 and 2005 may prove far higher because of the \nactions that are being taken and the lack of ability for the \ninternational community to actually participate and provide assistance \nfor the unbelievable inhumane conditions.\n  This is all in the context of a very difficult environment--\nunderdeveloped, impassable roads, huge swings in the nature of the \nweather. It is an incredibly complex and debilitating human situation \nwhich needs to be brought to attention. While genocide may not yet have \noccurred in Darfur, the elements are in place. The possibility of such \nhorrors should not be far from our minds. That is why I speak out about \nit on the Senate floor, and I will do it over and over. This needs to \nbe made into something about which we have a positive sense of \nresponsibility, both here in the United States and in the international \ncommunity.\n  U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan has compared the genocide in Rwanda 10 \nyears ago to events that are now unfolding. It will not be enough to go \nback and look, after the fact, to this kind of inhumanity to man.\n  We will have, later this year and next, an occasion to vow yet again, \nin the wake of another deliberately inflicted mass murder and disaster, \nto say: Never again. But we can do that now as opposed to after the \nfact. I hope all of us in this body, those of us who are part of the \nForeign Relations Committee and are very focused on these issues, will \nmake sure it stays a priority, although that is very hard in the \ncomplex world we have. So I hope by speaking out today and as we go \nforward that this Darfur situation will not fall off the radar screen.\n  This is a real risk of genocide evolving. I think it absolutely \nessential that our Government stand up, stand tall, be outspoken, make \nsure we are not tolerant of the developments that are so readily \nreported in that part of the world. It is important that we recognize \nit and keep it in the limelight so world public opinion can stop this \nkind of action before it happens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, I come to the floor to talk about \na bill of great significance to me. The Family Opportunity Act is a \nbill that I first introduced with Senator Kennedy in the 106th \nCongress.\n  This bill promotes family, work, and opportunity. Every day, across \nthe country, thousands of families struggle to obtain affordable and \nappropriate health care coverage for children with special health care \nneeds, including children with conditions such as autism, mental \nretardation, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, or mental illness. \nOver the course of the last three Congresses, this bill has enjoyed \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  Low and middle income parents who have employer sponsored family \nhealth care coverage and children with disabilities often find that \ntheir private insurance does not adequately cover the array of services \nthat are critical to their child's well-being, such as mental health \nservices, personal care services, durable medical equipment, special \nnutritional supplements, and respite care. Because Medicaid, our \nNation's health care program for low-income individuals, offers the \ntype of comprehensive care that best meets the needs of children with \ndisabilities, it can become a lifeline on which many parents depend. \nYet, Medicaid is a safety net program and one must be impoverished in \norder to be eligible. This presents a terrible choice for many low and \nmiddle income families who have a\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nchild with special health care needs: they must choose between work or \nimpoverishment. Or, in the worst cases, parents consider the \ndevastating choice of relinquishing custody for an out-of-home \nplacement so their child can obtain services they so desperately need.\n   The Family Opportunity Act helps families to address the needs of \nchildren with disabilities. Some Members of the Senate have voiced \nconcerns over the years about the cost of this bill and the expansion \nof the Medicaid program. Senator Nickles and I have had many long \ndiscussions about the goals of this legislation. I greatly respect his \nposition and I appreciate the thoughtful and productive debate that I \nhave been able to have with him. This bill would never have gotten to \nthis point without his help and I whole-heartedly thank him for his \nwillingness to work through his concerns with me. The Family \nOpportunity Act will cover families up to 250 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. This is less than coverage up to 600 percent of the \nFederal poverty level in my original bill. Senator Nickles and I have \nworked over the years to reach this compromise.\n   At Senator Nickles request, language has been added to this bill \nthat clearly conveys the intention of Senator Kennedy and me that \nStates who choose the FOA optional eligibility category will receive \nMedicaid match and not S-CHIP match for children covered under the \nFamily Opportunity Act. The legislation before us allows States the \noption of having families eligible for FOA pay up to 7.5 percent of \ntheir income for their premium. These family contributions are \naffordable and help to insure that children with disabilities have the \naccess that they need.\n   Senator Nickles expressed to me another concern. While States will \nhave the option to cover families above 250 percent of the Federal \npoverty level with 100 percent State dollars, States need to decide how \nthey want to spend their dollars. They should also be aware that it is \nnot the role of the Federal Government to help them when times are \nfinancially tough. Last May, the Congress provided States with $20 \nbillion in State fiscal relief. Ten billion went directly to Medicaid \nto address the rising costs in Medicaid. Over 60 percent of the \nspending in Medicaid is for optional services. The Family Opportunity \nAct is an optional service, and as much as I want States to take up \nthis Medicaid option for children with disabilities, I want to let \nStates know that they need to be responsible when expanding their \nMedicaid programs in good and bad budget times.\n   Senator Nickles and I have reached a good and fair compromise and I \nthank him for traveling this long road with me. As he can tell you, the \nFamily Opportunity Act is one of my highest priorities. Over the past 4 \nyears, I have worked closely with Senator Kennedy and Representative \nPete Sessions to advance this important legislation on behalf of \nthousands of families who need our help. I thank them both for their \nefforts along with the thousands of children and families who have been \ntireless advocates for this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleague \nSenator Grassley today in completing Senate passage of the Family \nOpportunity Act--so that once and for all, we can remove the barriers \nto quality and affordable health care for children with disabilities. \nBarriers that prevent families from staying together and staying \nemployed. And prevent their children from growing up to live \nindependent lives and become fully contributing members of their \ncommunities.\n  Many parents and leaders in communities throughout the country have \nworked long and hard and well to help us reach this milestone. They are \nparents, family members, citizens, and advocates. They are our friends, \nneighbors and colleagues. They showed us how we are failing families \nwith severely disabled children by not giving them access to the health \ncare they need to stay home and live in their community and compelled \nus to act. We have worked together for four long years to develop this \nlegislation and to all of them I say, thank you for helping us to move \nthis necessary legislation forward. You have been fearless and tireless \nwarriors for justice.\n  When we think of disabled children we tend to think of children who \nare disabled from birth. But fewer than 10 percent of all children with \ndisabilities are born with their disabilities. A bicycle accident or a \nserious fall or a serious illness can suddenly disable the healthiest \nchild. Currently, more than 9 percent of children in this country have \nsignificant disabilities. Many do not have access to even the most \nbasic health services they need to maintain their health status because \ntheir families cannot afford to pay for them. To obtain vital health \nservices for their children, families are being forced to become poor, \nstay poor, or to do the unthinkable--put their children in institutions \nor even give up custody of their children--all so their children can \nqualify for the health coverage available under Medicaid.\n  In a survey of 20 States, families of special needs children reported \nthey have turned down jobs, turned down raises, and turned down \novertime--all so their child can stay eligible for Medicaid through the \nSocial Security Income Program. The lack of adequate health care in our \ncountry today continues to force these families into poverty in order \nto obtain the care they need for their disabled children.\n  The bill we are considering today may be the most important \nlegislation we pass this Congress. It will close the health care gap \nfor the nation's most vulnerable population, and enable families of \ndisabled children to be equal partners in the American dream. It will \ntear down artificial barriers to success which have stood for far too \nlong. This bill will change lives.\n  This bill will change the life of 13-year-old Alice in Oklahoma, who \nwas disabled because of multiple dystrophy. Under this bill she will \nnow be able to get personal assistance to live at home with her family \nand go to her neighborhood school.\n  This bill will change the life of Johnny in Indiana, who has severe \nmental illness and needs multiple mental health therapies and drugs. \nHis mother will no longer be forced to give up custody of Johnny in \norder to secure the treatment he needs. Her goals of staying a \nproductive citizen and keeping her son at home will no longer be \ndenied--because her son will have access to the health care and \nsupports he needs.\n  This bill will change the life of Abby in Massachusetts, who is 6 \nyears old and has mental retardation. Her parents are very concerned \nabout her future. Already, she has been denied coverage by two health \ninsurance firms because of the diagnosis of mental retardation. Without \nMedicaid, her parents would be bankrupted by her current medical bills. \nNow Abby and her family will have a fair opportunity to work and \nprosper.\n  The Family Opportunity Act will make health insurance coverage more \nwidely available for children with significant disabilities, by giving \nfamilies opportunities to buy health care coverage through Medicaid. It \nwill provide States with greater flexibility to enable children with \nmental health disabilities to obtain the health services they need in \norder to live at home and in their communities. It will establish \nFamily to Family Information Centers in each State to assist families \nin meeting the unique health care needs of their disabled children.\n  The passage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act in 1999 \ndemonstrated our commitment to give adults with disabilities the right \nto lead independent and productive lives, without giving up their \nhealth care. It's time for Congress to show the same commitment to \nchildren with disabilities and pass the Family Opportunity Act.\n  These families aren't looking for a hand out--just a helping hand. \nToday, the Senate will move one step closer to providing it to them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the substitute \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported substitute \nas amended be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and \npassed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and \nthat any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The 5\\1/2\\ hours for debate is equally divided \nbetween the chairman and the ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof Ambassador John Negroponte to be U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. This \nposition will clearly be one of the most consequential ambassadorships \nin American history. The Ambassador to Iraq not only will be called \nupon to lead an estimated 1,700 embassy personnel--1,000 Americans from \nas many as 15 different agencies of our Federal Government, and 700 \nIraqis--but he will also be the focal point of international efforts to \nsecure and reconstruct Iraq and to provide the developing Iraqi \ngovernment with the opportunity to achieve responsible nationhood.\n  American credibility in the world, progress in the war on terrorism, \nrelationships with our allies, and the future of the Middle East depend \non a positive outcome in Iraq. What happens there during the next 18 \nmonths almost certainly will determine whether we can begin to redirect \nthe Middle East toward a more productive and peaceful future beyond the \ngrip of terrorist influences. Helping the Iraqi people achieve a \nsecure, independent state is a vital United States national security \npriority that requires the highest level of national commitment. With \nso much at stake, I am pleased the President has nominated a veteran \ndiplomat and manager to lead the American presence in Iraq.\n  Ambassador John Negroponte has served as U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, \nto Mexico, and to the Philippines. He has also served as an Assistant \nSecretary of State and Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs \nunder President Ronald Reagan. He has been the U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations since September 18, 2001, 7 days after the September 11 \nattacks. The contacts and credibility he has developed at the United \nNations will be invaluable.\n  If we are to be successful in Iraq, the United Nations and the \ninternational community must play a more central role. The United \nNations' involvement can help us generate greater international \nparticipation, improve the political legitimacy of the interim Iraqi \ngovernment, and take the American face off of the occupation of Iraq. \nThe appointment of an ambassador who occupies such a high and visible \npost underscores for our coalition partners and the Iraqis that the \nAmerican commitment to Iraq is strong and we mean to succeed.\n  In April, the Foreign Relations Committee held three hearings to \nexamine whether American and Iraqi authorities are ready for the \ntransition to Iraqi sovereignty on June 30. These hearings greatly \nadvanced our understanding of the situation in Iraq and answered many \nquestions. We will hold additional hearings this month to monitor \ndevelopments and to illuminate for the American people the challenges \nand responsibility we face in Iraq.\n  The President and other leaders, including Members of Congress, must \ncommunicate with the American people about our plan in Iraq. American \nlives will continue to be at risk in Iraq, and substantial American \nresources will continue to be spent there for the foreseeable future. I \nam convinced that the confidence and commitment demonstrated by the \npronouncement of a flexible but detailed plan for Iraq is necessary for \nour success, and such a plan would prove to our allies and to Iraqis \nthat we have a strategy and we are committed to making it work. If we \ncannot provide this clarity, we risk the loss of support of the \nAmerican people, the loss of potential contributions from our allies, \nand the disillusionment of Iraqis.\n  During Foreign Relations Committee hearings, I posed six detailed \nquestions as a way of fleshing out a plan for Iraq. Answers to these \nquestions would constitute a coherent transition strategy.\n\n  We discussed issues surrounding Ambassador Brahimi's efforts, the \nstatus of American Armed Forces in Iraq after the transition, the role \nof the U.N. Security Council resolutions, plans for elections, the \ncomposition of the U.S. Embassy, efforts to provide security for its \npersonnel, and how we intend to pay for the continued U.S. involvement \nin Iraq.\n  Under Secretary of State Mark Grossman testified about the reporting \nof engaging the interim Iraq government as soon as it is selected. We \ncannot simply turn on the lights in the Embassy on June 30 and expect \neverything to go well. We must be rehearsing with Iraqi authorities and \nour coalition partners on how decisionmaking and administrative power \nwill be distributed and exercised.\n  It is critical, therefore, that Ambassador Negroponte and his team be \nin place at the earliest possible moment. For this reason, the Foreign \nRelations Committee made a bipartisan decision to take up Ambassador \nNegroponte's nomination in an expedited fashion. Processing the \ndiplomatic nomination often requires weeks and sometimes months from \nthe time the President announces it. Through the diligent efforts of \nthe State Department and our\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\nown committee staff on both sides of the aisle, we accelerated the \nnormal timetable to give Ambassador Negroponte and the administration a \nchance to stand up the U.S. Embassy in Iraq as soon as possible.\n  I thank Senator Joe Biden and all the members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for their help in moving this nomination forward \nunanimously.\n  Ambassador Negroponte, with the support of his family, has made an \nextraordinary personal commitment to undertake this difficult \nassignment. Our Nation is fortunate that a leader of his stature and \nexperience is willing to step forward. The Senate must do our part by \nsupporting his efforts with the necessary attention and resources by \nallowing him to take his post as soon as possible.\n  I am grateful to the leaders on both sides of the aisle for allowing \nus to commence this debate this morning.\n  I add that Ambassador Negroponte's appearance before the Foreign \nRelations Committee--that led to a business meeting and the unanimous \nvote 19 to 0 on behalf of this nomination--was very important in terms \nof fleshing out the plan I mentioned in this comment.\n  We specifically asked Ambassador Negroponte questions regarding what \ncould be very difficult conversations even within our own Government--\nspecifically, a chain of command with the Ambassador, the Embassy, with \nthe thousand Americans from 12 to 15 agencies, as submitted in Under \nSecretary Mark Grossman's testimony, that these people coordinate the \nchain of command responsible for security in Iraq, the chain of command \ngoing from the President of the United States as Commander in Chief \nthrough the Secretary of Defense and through the Pentagon, through \nGeneral Abizaid and General Sanchez presently on the ground in command \nin Iraq. We asked specifically: What if there are disagreements or \ndifferences of judgment as to how the security functions ought to \nproceed, given political considerations, given international \nconsiderations that Ambassador Negroponte, if confirmed, would bring to \nthe fore? These are issues that can only be worked out in the field. \nBut it is important to raise the issues now.\n\n  Our current CPA Director, Ambassador Jerry Bremmer, understands this \nsituation very specifically. He told me in a telephone conversation \nyesterday that he has been visiting with General Abizaid and General \nSanchez specifically on these issues.\n  It is important for Ambassador Negroponte to be confirmed, to be a \npart of this conversation at the earliest possible moment.\n  Ambassador Negroponte responded to our questioning by pointing out \nthat he will physically be in New York during many days of this month \nbecause of his responsibilities as our Ambassador to the U.N. and that \nis a very important and pivotal position in the Iraq planning.\n  Ambassador Negroponte returned, in fact, from our public hearing \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee to the U.N. to consult with \nAmbassador Brahimi who was, in fact, making a presentation before the \nSecurity Council that very afternoon.\n  Ambassador Brahimi is now in Iraq. He is, once again, proceeding \nthrough consultation with Iraq authorities and others. He estimates \naround the 1st of June coming forward with those who have been \nsuggested by all parties to be the interim government: Apparently, 29 \npersons, including a Prime Minister, a President, two Vice Presidents, \n25 members of the consulting counsel.\n  It is very important, and we asked Ambassador Negroponte about this \nissue, that Ambassador Negroponte and those who he is going to have \nwith him--he has mentioned a DCM, Mr. Jeffrey, probably onboard within \nthe next 10 days in Baghdad--be in consultation with the 29 members, if \nthey prove to be acceptable to the Iraqis and to other parties involved \nbecause, in addition to conversations between our Ambassador and the \nchain of command, there will need to be intensive consultation with the \nIraqi leadership to which this measure of sovereignty is to be extended \nbeginning July 1.\n  On security issues and likewise on political issues, Ambassador \nNegroponte understands the Iraqi officials will believe, correctly, \nthat the governors of Iraq have Iraqi constituents, that on their part, \nas described in our hearing, there could be a certain amount of push-\nback from time to time by what they think are American measures or \ndecisions that are not wise, in their judgment, for either the security \nor the politics or the economy of Iraq.\n  Accommodating these three channels of thought requires what I \ndescribe as a time for rehearsal during June. Before the curtain opens \nJuly 1, it is extremely important that all of these parties have had \nintensive conversations, because the success demands--at least of the \nIraqi transition government, working with Ambassador Brahimi and other \nU.N. officials on the plans for elections now estimated to occur \nanytime from the end of December of this year to January of calendar \n2005--those preparations go smoothly.\n  These elections are the basis that many Iraqis have suggested provide \nlegitimacy for some Iraqis then to proceed to build a constitution and \na structure for governance of the country while security is provided by \nAmericans, by other coalition members, and increasingly, apparently by \nthe Iraqis themselves, and as the vetting of those who were previously \nin the army takes place, the continuing training of police so not only \nnumbers are increased but equally important the quality of service and, \ntherefore, the possibility for a security situation that involves \nIraqis and the expertise they may bring to that, well coordinated with \nthe military figures we have onboard now.\n  In our hearing, we also raised with Ambassador Negroponte the \nprobability of a U.N. Security Council resolution that brings some \ncertainty to these arrangements I have been describing and does so at \nleast in as timely a way as possible. Clearly, Ambassador Negroponte's \ncurrent duties--he has worked with colleagues on the Security Council--\nwill be very important in the careful drafting and execution of that \nresolution. He believes it is important, and so do members of our \ncommittee.\n\n  Likewise, we would like to see worked out, although this may not be \npossible, after July 1, the greatest possible certainty about the \nstatus of our forces and the forces of other foreign countries that are \na part of the coalition in Iraq--that issue is not at all a certainty--\nand precisely who is competent, given the governance situation to give \nit is still an open question, but it is a question that must be \nresolved. That is why we have laid it on the table as a part of our \nconfirmation proceeding with Ambassador Negroponte.\n  We have asked the Ambassador, likewise, about his enthusiasm for this \npost. I simply want to say, as I have in my earlier comments, we admire \nhis ability to take hold on fairly short notice of such a momentous \nresponsibility. He is a professional in every sense of the word, a man \nof great experience.\n  The committee was mindful from previous confirmation hearings on \nAmbassador Negroponte that questions have been raised about his tenure \nin Honduras. There have been, at the time of his U.N. confirmation, \nthose questions and others, at least, that members had.\n  I mention this because this has not always been smooth sailing with \nregard to these confirmation proceedings, nor should it be. Our members \ntake very seriously what happens in various countries during the tenure \nof Ambassadorships or what has been taking place at the United Nations \nduring the current responsibilities of Ambassador Negroponte.\n  The committee also is mindful simply of the hazards, the dangers, the \npolitical and security difficulties, that will attend not only our \nAmbassador but all of our American personnel who may be proceeding to \nset up the largest embassy we have had in any country at any time, in a \nvery short period of time, in which responsibilities have to be \ncarefully defined.\n  I am pleased a great number of brave Americans have, in fact, stepped \nforward and volunteered for positions in the American Embassy complex, \nnot only as a part of the State Department contingent, but from the \nother agencies that will be represented. That is the spirit with which \nAmbassador Negroponte approaches this responsibility. I find it not \nonly admirable but very fulfilling to see and to witness this kind of \nresponsiveness on his part.\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\n  Therefore, it is a privilege to commence this debate, indicating the \nnature of our hearing and the nature of other hearings we have had on \nAmbassador Negroponte in the past and our observation of his conduct \nand his achievements as an American public servant over the years. I \nbelieve the record is very complete on those achievements and on his \nqualifications. I am most hopeful during the course of the day our \ndebate will do much to boost the prospects for his success and will \nlead to a favorable vote of confirmation for him.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Negroponte \nnomination. Let me begin where I end up: I think we owe Ambassador \nNegroponte and his wife Diana, quite frankly, a debt of gratitude. It \ntakes political courage, physical courage, and moral courage to take on \nthis assignment. I cannot think in my years in the Senate of a \ncircumstance where we have placed an individual into a position where \nthe degree of difficulty in accomplishing his mission has been as high \nand the stakes as profound as Ambassador Negroponte is being positioned \nnow.\n  It is unusual, in all my years here of speaking to and voting on the \nAmbassadorships and positions of the State Department, for me to start \noff by thanking the nominee for being willing to take on this \nresponsibility.\n  Although the circumstance we find ourselves in in Iraq, I think, is \nstill redeemable, the degree of difficulty in accomplishing our mission \nhas been made extraordinarily more difficult by the events of the past \nyear and particularly by the revelations of the past several days.\n  Let me define at the outset once again--and I apologize to my friend \nand my chairman for having to hear me say this again and again and \nagain and again and again--what I would consider to constitute success, \nwhat our mission is. For me--and I have said this from before we went \nin, and consistently since then--it is leaving the Iraqi people with a \nrepresentative government of their choosing that is secure within its \nown borders and poses no threat to its neighbors and does not possess \nor seek to possess weapons of mass destruction or harbor terrorists. \nThat is difficult but doable. It is my hope that if we are able to help \nthe Iraqi people accomplish that, in time they could build political \nand economic institutions that we would recognize as a liberal \ndemocracy. But I want to make it clear what I believe the test of \nsuccess or failure is.\n  Unfortunately, the Negroponte nomination has been swamped by the \ndebate and the crisis we now face in Iraq and in the Middle East. So it \nis necessary to talk about the policy in Iraq more than about the \npersonality of the individual we are about to put in place to carry out \nAmerican policy.\n  As complicated as Iraq seems, in one sense it is fairly simple. We \nhave three basic options as a nation. One, we can continue to try to \nseek the objective I have stated, or even a broader objective of \nliberal democratization on the western model as some in the \nadministration state, by ourselves in the hope that more of the same of \nwe have been prescribing will bring about success.\n  Or we can conclude--as some have in this body, although they have \nrefrained from stating it; as some have in the American public, and \nthey have stated it; and as some serious press people and political \npundits and think-tank types have--that this is not doable, meaning the \nobjective I stated, and that we should figure out how, as rapidly as \npossible, to leave Iraq before it implodes.\n  There is a third option, which seems to me the only rational option, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the degree of difficulty has increased; \nand that is, we can get the Iraqi people more engaged and the world's \nmajor powers to help us invest in helping the Iraqi people accomplish \nthe goal of self-government. Nothing, in my view, from this point on \nwill be easy--nothing. Not a single aspect of this undertaking will be \neasy.\n  The chairman and I, from different perspectives, independently have \nbeen characterized as critics of administration policy. We both voted \nfor this. We both, in differing degrees, but I think on balance in \nagreement, laid out--this is not 20/20 hindsight--how difficult we \nthought the task would be before we went in, and the predicates that \nshould have been laid down to increase the prospects of success before \nwe went in, and have independently, together and with others, from the \nmoment we went in, met privately, publicly, within the committee and \nthrough our personal relationship, with administration officials and \nothers, argued for a different approach or a ratcheting up of the \neffort in Iraq in a way that could and would allow for legitimacy for \nwhatever government came forward and more security on the ground. \nBecause security is a precondition, in my view, for getting the Iraqi \npeople into a position where they are willing to take the risk--and \nthere will be risk--of raising their heads in an effort to form a \ngovernment that is not an Iranian model and not a strongman model.\n\n  This has been made more difficult by the fact that, in my view--\nspeaking for myself only--we have squandered every opportunity since \nthe statue of Saddam was pulled down by ropes. Since that moment we \nhave squandered every major opportunity we have had to get this \nendeavor on the right track. I want to make clear for anyone who is \nlistening that an incredibly large dose of humility is in order for \nanyone who stands and suggests that they know the answer in Iraq. I am \nnot suggesting that I know with any degree of certainty whether the \nprescription that I and others laid out in detail in July, August and \nSeptember the year before we went to war, in innumerable speeches and \npresentations on the Senate floor and other places since we went to \nwar, whether if had every single thing that I and others had suggested \nbeen done, I could guarantee the American public I am certain we would \nsucceed.\n  This is an incredible undertaking. There has been no time in the \nhistory of the modern nation state where what we are attempting to do \nin that region of the world has succeeded.\n  As I said to Ambassador Bremer, when Mr. Talwar and I were there a \nfew months after Saddam fell: ``Mr. Ambassador, I want you to \nunderstand that I believe if the Lord Almighty came down and gave you \nthe absolute correct answer to the first 20 major decisions you have to \nmake, you still only have a 65 percent of getting this right.''\n  I want to make clear, I understand this is a difficult deal. I \nunderstand that mistakes would be made no matter who had been \nPresident, no matter who had been in charge. But I do think we put \nourselves in a position where we started off this occupation having \nmade three very fundamental mistakes that have to be corrected.\n  One, we can correct. I believe the administration significantly \nexaggerated the imminence of the threat posed by Saddam, thereby \nsquandering an opportunity to build the international consensus we \nneeded, not to win the war but secure the peace. Committee reports we \nwrote, Democrats and Republicans in the committee, repeatedly started \noff saying: We do not need international help to win the war, but it \nwill be essential in winning the peace.\n  As a consequence of the exaggeration of the threat in terms of how \nimminent it was, we squandered the opportunity to isolate the French \nand the Germans, who I believe were taking advantage of President \nBush's misstatements and/or mistakes--unfairly taking advantage. We \nlost and squandered the opportunity to isolate them and, as a \nconsequence of that, at the same time to generate much broader \ninternational support so when we did go, there was a genuine coalition; \nthat there was more legitimacy for the undertaking from the outset.\n  The second serious mistake we made is going in with too few forces, \nsquandering the opportunity to wipe out the Republican Guard, to \nprevent looting and street crime, to secure nearly 1 million tons of \nweapons that are now being used against our troops that were left in \nopen depots, to avoid a security vacuum that is now being filled by \ncommon criminals, insurgents and rogue militias, and outside ``foreign \nfighters.'' It was not as if this was not a topic of debate before we \nwent. The way we treated and approached the Turks when we wanted the \n4th ID to come through, the arrogance of suggesting that we didn't need \nthat, we could still move anyway. What would be the status, I ask my \nfriend from\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nConnecticut, of the Sunni triangle, had the 4th ID come down from the \nnorth through the Kurdish area into the triangle?\n  Can I guarantee it would have been crushed? No. Can I say with \ncertainty we would be better off than we are now? Yes. We went with too \nlittle force, too little power.\n  That brings us to the third fundamental mistake we made--and I say \nthis not to criticize but to set up what I think we have to do from \nthis point on. If we can't determine individually or collectively what \nthe mistakes were that put us in this position, how in the devil are we \ngoing to get to the right decision now, if there is one? The third \nfundamental mistake in getting this right was, we went in with too \nlittle legitimacy. Not only didn't we have the rest of the world with \nus, we decided for some reason unknown to me--and I don't want to bash \nanybody--that Ahmed Chalabi and the expatriates were the answer to \nlegitimacy, and that initially General Garner, on the one hand, and \nChalabi on the other, would move along very quickly.\n  As a consequence, we squandered the opportunity to generate wider \nsupport inside Iraq and in the Arab world and among the major powers.\n  Now I have to add to the list of serious mistakes that were made \nthese horribly degrading abuses of jailed Iraqis that have made the \nproblem exponentially worse. I don't pretend to be an expert on Islam. \nI don't pretend to be an expert in terms of the culture in the Arab \nworld.\n  But I, like my chairman, have gone out and tried to hire for my staff \nserious experts. I have, as he has and my friend from Connecticut has \nand my friend from New Mexico has--we have, over the last couple of \nyears, sought out the most informed voices in this country about Islam, \nabout the Arab culture. I went so far, 2\\1/2\\ years or 3 years ago, as \nto go to Harvard and hire a professor whose expertise is Islam, because \nI was aware of how little I knew about the 1.2 billion Muslims in the \nworld.\n  One of the fairly clear conclusions I have arrived at, which is no \nrevelation to anyone, is that, as horrible as this sounds, we probably \nwould have done less damage to our image and our legitimacy and our \nmotive had the Iraqi prisoners been shot, like Saddam and other despots \nin that region do, than to have forced them, in some circumstances at \nleast, to engage in degrading, sexually embarrassing, humiliating \npositions.\n  If I am not mistaken, a picture I saw in the paper today was of a \nnaked Iraqi prisoner with a leash around his neck. There are certain \nthings that certain cultures take on as a degree of gravity and \ndepravity that don't occur in other communities.\n  So now these mistakes have complicated our mission and, I believe, \ngenuinely jeopardized our objective: a stable Iraq, with a \nrepresentative government that poses no threat to its neighbors, does \nnot possess weapons of mass destruction, or cradle terrorists.\n  To find our way from here, it seems to me we have to go back to first \nprinciples. I think one of those first principles is that we cannot \nwant freedom for the Iraqi people more than they want it. My premise \nhas been--and it is beginning to evaporate--that the vast silent \nmajority of Iraqis want freedom. They want a representative government, \nbut they have been brutalized for three decades and they have learned \nto keep their heads down, not merely as a consequence of the despot who \nruled them, but also because of a sense that the outside world won't \nstick with them. So they are keeping a pretty low profile. \nConsequently, the ``insurgents'' and others are the face of Iraq, in \nmany cases right now.\n  The second part of the first principle is that we have to create a \ncondition on the ground which will let them raise their heads above the \ncrowd and begin to take charge of their own country. The most important \ncondition, in my view--so you understand where I am coming from--the \nnecessary precondition for that is security in the neighborhood, \nsecurity in the streets, security so you can send your daughter from \nyour home to the corner store to pick up sundries needed for the meal. \nThat is the overwhelming majority of Iraqis, in the personal experience \nof all of us who have been there, as well as what the polling data \nshows.\n  So that raises a very difficult question: How could we create \nsecurity or a condition for security? There is no single step, in my \nview, that we can take. There is a coordinated series of steps that \nwould move us toward real security in Iraq for the purpose of letting \nthe Iraqis begin to work out their own governmental circumstances. The \nfirst is very unpopular. As my Democratic friends here can tell you, \nwhen I raise it in the caucus, it is not very popular. One is more \nAmerican troops now.\n  I have, as you have, surveyed not only the existing military force \nand generals, but I have been in contact recently with a total of seven \nformer CENTCOM commanders, supreme allied commanders, and/or generals \nin charge of the distribution of our forces for the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff over the last several years. There is an absolutely common thread \nthey all have. They have differences as to how many troops we could \ngarner quickly and from where we could get them. But they all agree on \nseveral things. We need more troops, if only for troop protection. We \nclearly need more troops, as well, to begin to create the environment \nof greater security on the ground. These generals also tell me--these \nare four-star folks, people who have run these shows--that we need to \ndemonstrate our resolve to our NATO friends, European friends, Arab \nfriends, Pakistani friends, all of whom have the capacity to help us in \none form or another in this. But as strange as it sounds to us, they \nare doubtful of our commitment. Are we going to stay? So I think we \nneed more forces.\n\n  Do I expect any Delawarean listening to this to be happy with me \nsaying that? No, not one. Am I frustrated that the failure to have the \nforces we recommended, that General Shinseki recommended, and others \nrecommended but was not followed puts me in the position of being the \nguy calling for more forces? Purely personally, it makes me angry that \nI am in the spot of having to be the one to deliver bad news to folks \nat home, as if this is my idea. But the fact is, no matter what we say, \nin my view, security requires more force.\n  It is going to require more sacrifice from the middle class and the \npoor. We have to do a much better job of sharing the burden here. I \nwant to warn everybody now. I am going to vote for more money for Iraq, \nbut I will introduce my amendment again, that people who are willing \nand able to pay for it now--pay for it, us, and not hand the bill to my \ngranddaughters. I will get back to that at another time.\n  The second thing in terms of security that we have to do is get a \nbuy-in from the world's major powers. It is going to be years before \nIraq can handle their own security. But we cannot sustain the effort on \nour own for years. We are providing nearly 90 percent of the troops, \ntaking 90 percent of the non-Iraqi casualties, and spending the bulk of \nthe reconstruction costs. Our troops have to be bolstered with troops \nfrom NATO, from India and Pakistan, and from the region.\n  Am I suggesting to you that I am naive enough to think we can do it \nin a big way now? No. But I have done the homework we have all done. I \nhave spoken with our Supreme Allied Commander; I have gone to NATO; I \nhave sat down with these generals. This is what they tell me.\n  Immediately, if there is a consensus among our NATO allies, we could \nget somewhere between as few as 3,000 and as many as 7,000 NATO troops. \nImmediately they could take over the border patrol. Immediately they \ncould take over what is left in the north, although we depleted many of \nour forces in the north in the Kurdish area, and/or coordinate the \nPolish division in the south, freeing up American forces that are now \ndoing those functions.\n  Why is that important? You say: Biden, out of 150,000, 160,000 folks, \nanother 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 troops are not going to make much \ndifference here. I argue it makes a significant difference in the buy-\nin of the major powers in the world. That, in turn, would open the door \nfor an appropriate resolution authorizing--this from the U.N., not U.N. \nblue helmets--an authorization for NATO forces. I believe that would \nbring in, with a lot of diplomacy and Presidential leadership, \nsignificant numbers of troops from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and \nfrom the region. But it is a process.\n  I do not know what the folks in South Carolina are saying, but I know\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\nwhat they are saying in Delaware: ``I ain't doing this alone, Joe.'' \nAnd they know if NATO is in, the prestige of the major powers is on the \nline, as well as ours, to stay the course.\n  Our troops have to be bolstered and NATO and the surrounding Arab \ncountries must be convinced to take on the urgent responsibility of \ntraining Iraqi armed forces and police.\n  I might add, the Germans and the French offered that right after \nSaddam's statue fell if, in fact, we were willing to get authorization \nfor that from the U.N.\n  The neighboring Arab countries are fully capable of training some of \nthese forces. Clearly, the Europeans have even greater experience in \ntraining police forces, all of which are urgently needed.\n  Many say this cannot be done. I know from the very serious people in \nthe press, they look at me and privately say to me: Senator, great \nidea, too late, man; get real. What can really be done?\n  Look, the President does not collect his paycheck--no President \ncollects his paycheck--by managing. He gets paid to lead.\n  We had before our committee two men I have high regard for, Mark \nGrossman from the State Department and Peter Rodman from the Defense \nDepartment. I asked Secretary Rodman what we're doing to get NATO to \nparticipate. He said, and I'm paraphrasing here: We have already asked, \nwhich is mildly disingenuous. I do not know anybody who has been here \nvery long who can name for me anything, other than declaring article V \ninvoked, that NATO has done spontaneously without U.S. leadership \nwithout a specific plan being brought to NATO, sold to NATO, and \nnegotiating with NATO in Brussels through Presidential leadership. The \nPresident has to commit to sell this.\n  Going to the U.N. is necessary, but it is not sufficient. Let's not \nget into this sort of ideological war that has taken place in the 30 \nyears I have been here about the U.N. The President has to win support \nof key countries first before he goes to the U.N., or before someone \ngoes to the U.N., and then the U.N. has to engage a Security Council \nresolution to give those major countries the political justification \nfor going to their constituencies and saying: I want to get in a deal \nyou didn't want me in, in the first place; it looks like it is going \nbad now, but is necessary for our security--ours, meaning France, \nEngland, Germany, wherever, any country.\n  The President should immediately, in my view, in light of the recent \nrevelations convene a summit of the major powers with the most at stake \nin Iraq, including those from the Arab world. The objectives for this \ngroup should be to endorse the Brahimi plan for a caretaker government, \npropose a senior international figure to referee the political disputes \nthat are going to take place between June 30 and elections being held \nin January, and call for and authorize a multinational security force \nunder NATO command and U.S. leadership to be the vehicle that provides \nthe security.\n  Then, as a final step, I think this group--call it a new contact \ngroup--should go to the U.N. and seek a security council blessing for \nthis agreement.\n  I have no illusions about the U.N. being able to bring anything \nspecial to Iraq, but its blessing is necessary to provide political \ncover to leaders whose people oppose the war and who will now be asked \nto sacrifice to build the peace. To paraphrase George Will, it may be a \nnecessary mask to hide the American face. And George Will is no fan of \nthe U.N.\n  Simultaneously, the President should be going to NATO. NATO cannot \ntake it on right away, and I will not go back through this again, but \nit can do a lot. It would free up, I am told, as many as 20,000 \nAmerican troops, open the door to participation by countries such as \nIndia and Pakistan, and send an important message to the American \npeople that we are not bearing the security burden in Iraq virtually \nalone.\n  By the way, when I go home, the people say to me: Well, the Brits are \nwith us, Joe? Americans do not know there are only 7,500 Brits there, \nGod bless them, in all their bravery--7,500. We have, what, 160,000 \nAmericans in the region? As John Kerry suggested, it seems to me we \nshould also make the training of Iraqi security forces a much more \nurgent mission than we have thus far but we must understand it will \ntake time and that it needs to be done right.\n  When I was in Iraq last summer, our specialists told me it would take \nfive years to recruit and train a police force of 75,000 and three \nyears to recruit and train an army of 40,000. Instead, the \nAdministration rushed 150,000 Iraqis into uniform with minimal vetting \nand training. When trouble came, many abandoned their posts.\n  Here, too, other countries could play a potentially decisive role. \nFor example, the Europeans have greater expertise than we do in \ntraining police. Even the French told me that under the right \nconditions they would be willing to train Iraqi police. Our friends in \nthe region, including Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco, could host training \nsessions for Iraqi police, border security forces, and the military. \nThey could, in fact, take American-trained Arab officers from Morocco, \nEgypt, and Jordan and embed them with Iraqi forces in Iraq now, a la \nFallujah.\n  There are a lot of specific ideas I will not bore my colleagues with \nnow that are not new to me. I am getting these from serious people who \nhave run the show in that region of the world, military forces. But by \ndoing this, it seems to me, we can significantly speed up the day when \nthe Iraqis can provide their own security and Americans can come home.\n  Why would other countries join what looks like a lost cause they did \nnot support in the first place? It is a reasonable question to ask. For \none simple reason: It is in their naked self-interest. For Europeans, \nIraq's failure endangers the security of their oil supply. They get a \nsignificantly higher percentage of their oil from the region than we \ndo. It is in their interest because they have large Muslim populations \nthat could be radicalized. It is in their interest because of the \nthreatening destabilization of refugee flows that would be created if a \ncivil war breaks out. It is in their interest because it is their front \nyard, and we may be creating a new, huge source of terrorism if the \nresult is not a civil election, but a civil war.\n  For Iraq's neighbors, a civil war in Iraq would draw them in--i.e., \nthe Kurds, the Turks, the Iranians. It would put moderates in the \nregion on the shelf for another generation. It would put radicals in \nthe driver's seat, and I think it would threaten the very survival of \nthe regimes in Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.\n  Would what I am suggesting be difficult to achieve? You bet. The bar \nhas been raised here. The degree of difficulty is exponentially \ngreater. Will it guarantee success? No. But I know of no other \nalternative than to try.\n  In light of all the mistakes we made, no one can guarantee success, \nbut if we do not do this, I think success will, in fact, be near \nimpossible.\n  If the President does do all of what we are talking about, it is not \ngoing to be enough to put us on the path to success given the \nrevelations of this week, the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. As I said \nbefore, no single act I can think of, other than maybe the bombing of \nthe holiest shrines in Najaf loaded with pilgrims, could have been \nworse for America's image than what has happened, notwithstanding the \nfact that it does not represent American troops, it does not represent \nAmerican values, it does not represent what the American people believe \nneeds be done.\n  The facts are appalling and so is the symbolism. Ironically, the \nabuses took place in the same prison that Saddam made himself famous \nfor his torture of his opponents. As a result, I am concerned that even \nif we do everything I just outlined in which several of us have been \nadvocating for months, we will not be able to muddle through the so-\ncalled transition of sovereignty on June 30 and then the elections next \nyear. The revelations have so damaged our prospects of success that I \nbelieve the only way to recover is to do something equally dramatic in \na positive sense. I think we need to make this less about us and more \nabout the Iraqi people.\n  The Iraqi people are going to wake up on July 1 and still see 140,000 \nAmerican troops out their window, patrols going by in Humvees at 40 \nmiles an hour. They will still lack security and they will still be \nseething about the abuse of\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\nthe prison scandal. And they will continue to blame us for everything \nthat has gone wrong in the country.\n  I ask any of my colleagues who are listening whether there is any \npossibility, no matter what the interim government is, that they will \nbe able to, even if they want to, vote to keep American forces in their \ncountry after July 1, when they are ostensibly in charge? Even as we \nmove to increase security and bring the rest of the world in, there are \nfour things we have to do right away, and I will end with this.\n  First, we should today announce that the Red Crescent, the Red Cross, \nthe international community, should be able to come into every prison \nin Iraq, open them up and put the international community permanently \nin the prisons as observers.\n  Second, we have to establish a credible, independent investigation of \nthe abuses and go as high in the command chain as the facts lead us and \ndemand accountability.\n  Third, we should close the Abu Ghraib prison, work with the Iraqi \npeople on a plan to destroy it or convert it to a monument. We cannot \ndo that precipitously because we need to build other facilities to \nhouse 5,000 prisoners. Possibly we should do as was recommended by the \nState Department and release a significant number of those prisoners \nwho, according to some in the State Department, need not be detained in \nthe first place.\n  Fourthly, and this is the most controversial thing I suspect I am \ngoing to say in the minds of my colleagues, in coordination with the \nBrahimi plan, we should hold snap elections now, ideally early this \nsummer, to create the equivalent of a loya jirga where on a community \nlevel across Iraq they will hold down and dirty elections to elect \nthose who will write this new constitution.\n  I want to see pictures and debates about whether people are getting \nshot going to the polls, scrambling going to the polls, arguing about \nwhether the election is free or not. I want this about the Iraqi \npeople.\n  This election will be far from perfect, but they could use their oil-\nfor-food ration cards as proof of registration and get on with it \nquickly as part of the transition that is already envisioned for the \ntotal free election in November of 2006 of an actual government.\n  The Iraqis would elect government representatives at a local level \nwho would come together, as I said, the equivalent of a loya jirga.\n  Until now, I believed that, provided the caretaker government was \nselected by a respected international figure with buy-in from the \nIraqis, not the U.S., it would pass the legitimacy test. In the wake of \nthe prison incident, I do not think that is possible.\n  The big obstacle would be security, especially in the Sunni triangle. \nAnd there is the certain prospect that some people will be elected that \nwe will not like.\n  But the vast bulk of the country could handle elections now. In the \nShi'a south, it is a gamble, but it is better than an even chance that \nmoderate Shi'a would emerge if given an opportunity for elections, and \nthey would finally use their power and influence to defeat Sadr and \nother radicals among them.\n  The U.N. has a team in place now to prepare for elections in January. \nLet's speak with Brahimi and see if we can speed up that process and \nmake elections the next step in the transition plan.\n  I realize this is a fairly radical proposal, but I believe we need a \nfairly radical proposal. This should focus on what the Iraqi people \nneed now, and we should demonstrate that everything in our mission is \nto turn this over as rapidly and clearly as possible.\n  I close with this one rhetorical question: The chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee has been pointing out, what about the \nconundrum when the interim government is appointed and it concludes we \nshould not be sending troops to Fallujah? I think there is a more basic \nquestion than that. What happens now that 70 percent of the Iraqi \npeople now think we should get out? By the time this prison scandal is \nover, it is going to be 90 percent. What happens when we appoint the \nnew Iraqi government and give it partial sovereignty and right out of \nthe box they say, Get out of Dodge?\n  We better do something quickly or Negroponte's Herculean efforts are \nlikely to be for naught.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Ambassador \nNegroponte. He is assuming an extremely difficult position. I wish him \nwell in this new position, and I commend him for his willingness to \ntake it on, quite frankly.\n  One of the most difficult problems he will face is how we correct the \nperceptions and the reality that have come to light with regard to \nabuse and humiliation of prisoners in Iraq. I want to say a few words \nabout that issue today as well.\n  I congratulate and commend BG Mark Kimmitt for the statement he made \nyesterday at a press briefing in Baghdad. He gave what I consider to be \na straightforward, unambiguous apology to the Iraqi people for what has \noccurred. In my view, that is the message that all of us in positions \nof responsibility should be conveying to the Iraqi people on this \nissue. His statement was as follows:\n\n       My Army's been embarrassed by this. My Army's been shamed \n     by this. And on behalf of my Army, I apologize for what those \n     soldiers did to your citizens. It was reprehensible and it \n     was unacceptable. And it is more than just words, that we \n     have to take those words into action and ensure that never \n     happens again. And we will make a full-faith effort to ensure \n     that never happens again.\n\n  Frankly, I regret the President did not use his opportunity in his \ninterviews to make the same straightforward apology to the Iraqi \npeople. I hope this Senate, in the resolution the leadership of \nRepublican and Democratic leaders is drafting for consideration in the \nSenate on this issue will contain that kind of straightforward apology \nto the Iraqi people. I think that is an appropriate message for all of \nus to embrace.\n\n  Much needs to be done in order to correct the situation that has \noccurred. I suggest one starting point would be the following.\n  First, a full accounting about who we have detained and what the \nadministration plan has been and is for these detainees; not just in \nIraq but in Afghanistan, in Guantanamo, wherever our military is \ndetaining foreigners, we need to come clean about what our intentions \nare and what actions we have taken.\n  Second, as to all detainees, we need to fully comply with the Geneva \nConvention. That means providing each of them an opportunity for a \nhearing, an opportunity to argue to someone they are improperly being \ndetained. As to detainees who are not a threat to our troops or to our \nnational interests and about whom we do not have evidence of criminal \nactivity, we need to release those detainees. Obviously, if they pose a \nthreat to U.S. forces or a threat to U.S. interests, then they should \nbe charged and they should be prosecuted. But if they pose no such \nthreat, they should be released.\n  According to the morning paper, the President has privately chided \nthe Secretary of Defense. This is an unusual way to conduct business \nhere in Washington, but I am never surprised anymore about how business \nis conducted. I heard the statement on the news that the President was \nstanding behind the Secretary of Defense. Then I opened the paper this \nmorning and it said a senior White House official said the President \nhas privately admonished the Secretary of Defense; that:\n\n     . . . Bush is ``not satisfied'' and ``not happy'' with the \n     way that Rumsfeld informed him about the investigation into \n     the abuses of U.S. soldiers at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison or \n     the quantity of information that Rumsfeld provided, the \n     senior White House official said.\n\n  Then it goes on to point out the senior White House official did:\n\n     . . . refuse to be named, so that he could speak more \n     candidly.\n\n  As I say, I am always amazed by the goings on in our Government. But \nI am glad to see the President shares some of the frustration I and \nmany of us here in Congress have had about the lack of full \ninformation, the lack of adequate knowledge about what is going on. In \norder to remedy the situation, I recommend the President start by \ndemanding a quick and a full response to the following questions: How \nmany people have we detained in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in other \nparts of the world? Who have we detained? Who have we taken into \ncustody? How many of them are still in custody, and to\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nthose who are not still in custody, what has happened to them?\n  There is a report that there are investigations about 25 deaths that \nhave occurred among detainees in Iraq. Where are these prisoners being \ndetained? Where in Iraq are they being detained? Which prisons? How \nmany in each prison? Where in Afghanistan are they being detained? \nWhich prisons? Where are they located? How long have these detainees \nbeen in custody? How many have been charged with crimes? Are we \nintending to charge these detainees with crimes? If not, what are we \nintending with regard to these detainees?\n  What is our position regarding our obligations under the Geneva \nConvention with regard to military detainees, with regard to civilian \ndetainees? How can we justify continued detention of people in each of \nthese categories?\n  Another set of questions I believe the President should insist upon \nanswers to, is what has happened to any prisoners we have transferred \nto third countries? How many captives have we in fact turned over to \nother countries for questioning? Which countries? Pakistan? Israel? \nOther nations? What are the policies and practices of those countries \nwith regard to torture of prisoners and treatment of prisoners? Have \nthey been afforded their Geneva Convention rights in those countries? \nWhat is the status of those prisoners now?\n  This is obviously a partial list of questions. The American public \ndeserves answers to these questions. The President deserves answers to \nthese questions. Those of us in Congress deserve answers to these \nquestions. If we are serious about taking corrective action to deal \nwith the abuses that have been disclosed, then in my view, at least, \nanswering these kinds of basic questions is an essential starting \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me thank my \ncolleague from New Mexico for his thoughtful comments. I certainly want \nto associate myself with them. I, too, want to commend General Kimmett \nfor his very concise, clear, unambiguous statement yesterday. I was \nmoved by it.\n  I was moved by the personal pronoun ``my,'' too--``my Army.'' This is \nsomeone who dedicated his life--in fact, the Kimmett family has one of \nthe most distinguished records of any American family when it comes to \nserving the U.S. Government in uniform. Mark and his family have worn \nthat uniform proudly. Over the years, numerous members of his family \nhave. I could feel the pain of Mark Kimmett's sentiments in those brief \ncomments he made so eloquently yesterday.\n  It is on that note that I would like to begin my remarks. Clearly the \nevents of the last several days, the revelations we have become aware \nof, the events going back now apparently as late as last November, \nindicate a very serious problem. But before getting into the details of \nthat, speaking for myself--and I am quite confident that I speak for my \ncolleagues here, and others--it is very clear that while this is a \nserious problem, the overwhelming majority of the more than 130,000 \nAmerican men and women in uniform who are operating in Iraq are good, \ndecent and caring people, who would never allow this kind of activity \nto occur on their watch. So I want to begin by thanking them. This is a \nvery difficult service they are engaged in.\n  Certainly those who are responsible for these acts and those who \ncondoned or allowed them to happen need to be brought to a bar of \njustice as soon as possible.\n  But I think it would be a mistake if we allowed our disgust with \nthese abuses to somehow cause those who are in uniform, serving in Iraq \ntoday, to believe that there is any feeling here that this is an \nindictment of all of them. It certainly is not.\n  Let me be clear--my disagreements with U.S. policy and how this whole \nmatter of Iraq has been handled, as well as the actions of what seem to \nbe only a few, in no way diminish my admiration and respect for those \nin uniform who are serving in Iraq or anywhere else.\n  However, these reports of abuses are very disturbing. And they are \nnot only unacceptable, they are possibly violations of United States \nlaw and international law. Moreover, it is obvious that this matter has \nnot been treated with the urgency it warrants. If in fact the reports \nare accurate, these events may have occurred as early as last November \nor December, and they are only now coming to light--primarily, it \nappears, because there are photographs. I suspect that had this been an \naccount reported in some written document, without any photographic \nevidence, it might not be receiving the kind of attention it deserves.\n  Obviously these allegations of abuse must be quickly investigated, \nand those responsible for these reprehensible acts brought to justice. \nThose in the chain of command as well, who failed to discharge their \nduties effectively to detect and prevent such actions, need to be \nsanctioned, including, to put it simply, fired.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that the majority of our service men and \nwomen are not to blame. I can not stress this point enough. The \noverwhelming majority of our troops are doing a superb job under very \ndifficult circumstances. They are putting their lives at risk every \nsingle day for this country.\n  Indeed, what has happened here, what has occurred, also puts all of \nthese honorable men and women who are serving, not only in Iraq but \nelsewhere, at risk. These abuses damage not only the victims, but our \ntroops. And they also damage America--they do great damage to our \ncountry. This is not who we are. This is not what we stand for. We are \na nation of laws. That is what we have stated over and over again.\n  A few moments ago, my colleague from New Mexico and I were having a \nconversation about these abuses. He eloquently pointed out that our \nConstitution is based on the fundamental concept and idea that it is \nnot just what we do, but how we do things. The founders of this country \ncould have set up any kind of a system. But they picked a system that \nin many ways is terribly inefficient. That is because they wanted to \nmake sure not only that we would do the right thing, but that we do it \nthe right way--that the ends do not justify the means; the means are \nalso important.\n  It is why a generation ago when there were trials to prosecute those \nwho were guilty of the crimes committed by the Nazi regime, every \nsingle one of those defendants at Nuremberg had a lawyer and had the \nright to present evidence. Some people suggested that those on trial in \nNuremberg ought to be summarily executed--that they shouldn't have a \ntrial. After all, these were dreadful human beings who committed \ndreadful and unspeakable crimes. But cooler heads and wiser heads \nprevailed and asserted that there is a huge difference between Western \ncivilization and the Nazis, not the least of which is that we do things \ndifferently. And by holding these trials, we set an example.\n  Unfortunately, the events that have just become known over the last \nseveral days indicate, at least in this instance, that we did not do \nthings any differently in the eyes of many than the dreadful regime we \noverthrew a year ago--the regime of Saddam Hussein. That is what I \nworry about. This does damage to the United States. It does damage to \npeople like Mark Kimmitt who spoke eloquently yesterday about his Army. \nAnd I worry about our men and women all over the globe who put \nthemselves in jeopardy for our country--not only in that the reports of \nthese abuses could cause an increase in violence against them, but I \nworry about what might happen if, heaven forbid, they are apprehended, \nand how they may be treated.\n  I know the matter before the Senate is the nomination of John \nNegroponte. I support that nomination. We have had our difficulties \nover the years, one going back to his days in Honduras when there were \nissues of human rights violations. I know Ambassador Negroponte. He has \nbeen a good ambassador in other capacities, a good ambassador at the \nU.N. He has done a good job in Mexico. We have worked together since \nour days of difficulty more than 20 years ago. I am confident John \nNegroponte can do a good job, particularly, I hope, in the area of \nhuman rights. He will be in charge of what I am told will become the \nlargest U.S. mission anywhere on the globe. And I am hopeful that John \nNegroponte, when he is confirmed--and I believe he\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\nwill be--will grab this issue and do what has to be done to get our \nwork in Iraq on track.\n  The responsibility for these abuses that have occurred in Iraq goes \nbeyond a few low-level bad apples. That is what worries me. This is \nclearly a problem of mismanagement at very high levels, which the Bush \nadministration needs to get a handle on, and quickly. If that means \nhigh-ranking officials need to be replaced, then that is a judgment \nthat we shouldn't dismiss out of hand.\n  After all, we are currently in the throes of trying to prove that we \nwant to help Iraqis create a new and democratic Iraq, and that in doing \nso we will respect Iraqi and Arab culture and tradition. It does not \ntake much of an imagination to figure out the disastrous consequences \nof these abuses, not only with respect to U.S. policy in Iraq but with \nrespect to our policies throughout the greater Middle East.\n  Over the past week, newspapers throughout the world have carried \nheadlines about these abuses. Not only in English speaking countries, \nobviously--Arab language newspapers have also carried the stories with \nheadlines such as ``The Scandal'' and ``The Shame.''\n  Anyone who knows anything about Arab culture will know this much: \nHonor and respect are valued highly. Many of these abuses with sexual \novertones were directly aimed at damaging the honor of Iraqis or \nforcing them to do things in contravention of their most deeply held \nbeliefs.\n  Let's not forget these abuses occurred in the very same prison Saddam \nHussein used to torture Iraqis. Now this prison has served as a source \nof allegations of sexual abuse, psychological torture, and even murder.\n  In the minds of Iraqis and those in the Arab world, what is to \nseparate these acts from past abuses?\n  Certainly the scope of these abuses does not compare to those that \noccurred under Saddam Hussein, but the unacceptability of these acts is \nnot something we should attempt to measure in quantitative terms. \nSurely we hold ourselves, I hope, to an entirely different and higher \nstandard than that with which we judged Saddam Hussein.\n  Moreover, diplomacy is a delicate game, and one mistake by the \nworld's superpower reverberates around the globe to the detriment of \nour foreign policy. It is going to make the job of Ambassador \nNegroponte--when the majority leader decides to move on his \nnomination--all the more difficult. As difficult as his job was going \nto be prior to the emergence of these allegations, it is exponentially \nmore so today.\n  Given the situation, I urge Ambassador Negroponte, when he is \nconfirmed, to draw on his previous experience to make the protections \nof human rights in Iraq a top priority.\n  I am stating the obvious. But these abuses must not occur again.\n  Moreover, we owe it to the more than 130,000 honorable and dedicated \nU.S. troops currently risking their lives in Iraq to ensure that those \nwho are found guilty of these crimes be punished to the fullest extent \npossible. Anything less would be a great disservice to all of these \nbrave men and women in uniform who now face a much more difficult task \nthan winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.\n  Equally troubling is that these disgraceful acts have been made \npossible by the administration's rigid philosophy of outsourcing jobs \nand responsibility. This time, though, it outsourced much of our \nmission in Iraq, responsibilities that should be given to well-trained \nmilitary personnel. The administration has outsourced these \nresponsibilities to private military firms (PMFs), that are virtually \nunregulated by our Government or any other.\n  I don't support the outsourcing American jobs abroad and I don't \nthink we should give our military duties to independent contractors, \neither. Indeed, reportedly, there are as many as 20,000 private \nmilitary firm personnel currently working in Iraq. It appears that no \nchain of accountability exists for their actions, that no universal \nrules exist to govern their operation in coordination with U.S. and \ncoalition troops. Most disturbing, according to reports, these private \nmilitary firms' personnel have been directly involved in some of these \ncrimes.\n  I ask my colleagues, is it any surprise to learn that members of an \nunregulated group of paramilitaries is alleged to have committed human \nrights abuses?\n  And I would ask the President of the United States and the Secretary \nof Defense--why were private contractors taking part in U.S. military \ninterrogations? And since when do we assign to non-official personnel \nthe most critical and delicate task to our military operations--\nunregulated personnel, I might add.\n  I am sure many agree that the use of these companies in sensitive \nmilitary situations certainly raises some ominous questions. That is \nwhy last week I sent a letter to the GAO along with four of my \ncolleagues--Senator Feingold, Senator Reid, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nCorzine--requesting that GAO investigators undertake an extensive \ninvestigation into the employment of these firms in Iraq.\n  I am hopeful, given the increasing violence in that country and \nrecent reports of abuse, including reports of abuse by private \ncontractors, that the General Accounting Office will expedite this \ninvestigation and answer all of the questions posed. Our troops, our \nmission in Iraq, and the American taxpayer deserve a prompt, \nindependent, and careful look into this matter.\n  Mr. President, if we are lucky, we may get a second chance to \ndemonstrate to the Iraqi people and the Arab world that we came to Iraq \nfor good--not abuse.\n  But we will only get that chance if we make amends fully and \ncompletely. That is why the administration must move quickly and \npublicly to bring the criminals who committed these abuses to justice. \nWe must also take back direct responsibilities related to the \nadministration of Iraq from private contractors and assume \nresponsibility for what are clearly official and delicate functions \nwhich have profound foreign policy implications if not handled \nproperly.\n  Mr. President, the sooner we do these things, the sooner we can get \nback on track helping the Iraqi people build a democratic and just \nsociety that reflects their own values and aspirations.\n  Ambassador Negroponte can play a critical role in making that happen, \nand I am therefore pleased that the Senate is poised to approve his \nnomination today. I fully support moving ahead to confirm him for this \ncritical post.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I might have an additional minute or 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         National Day Of Prayer\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would also like to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues an article from today's Washington Post. It was on \npage A-3 carried over to page A-6, and it worries me deeply because it \ngoes to what I am fearful may have had some underlying and undercurrent \neffect on the events of the last several days. It seems to speak to the \nextent that we are dehumanizing and minimizing and casting this pall of \naccusation over an entire religious group in the world.\n  Senator Biden pointed out in his remarks here this morning that 1.2 \nbillion people are observers of the Muslim faith.\n  And today is a national day of prayer in the U.S. It began with a \nresolution adopted in the Truman administration in 1952 and has been \nfollowed every year since then. When Harry Truman signed the \ncongressional resolution he called for ``a suitable day each year other \nthan a Sunday to be set aside for common prayer.'' Every administration \nsince 1952 has taken that day out of the calendar year to focus on \ncommon prayer. And it was under the Reagan administration that the \nfirst Thursday of May was set aside as the permanent day each year.\n  I cannot tell you how disturbing it was to read in this morning's \npaper a quote from one of the organizers of this year's day of prayer. \nThe quote was buried away, but let me read it, because it actually goes \nto the heart of what we are talking about. We are told here, this \nmorning, that they would make ``no apologies'' in today's celebration \nof prayer ``about the exclusion of Muslims and others outside of the \n`Judeo-Christian tradition' from ceremonies planned by the task force \non Capitol Hill and in state capitals across the country.''\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\n  ``They are free to have their own national day of prayer if they want \nto,'' she said.\n  Well, if you have that attitude about common prayer today, and you \nexclude religious groups from a national day of prayer, then what have \nwe come to?\n  I might point out as well, because the Presiding Officer will \nappreciate this--my wife pointed this out to me this morning--in Salt \nLake City, Mormons have complained that they are not allowed to lead \nprayers during today's observance. I don't know how you have a national \nprayer day in Salt Lake City and exclude the Mormons from \nparticipating.\n  But this sort of attitude where we are going to selectively choose \nreligious groups that can be involved, and the particular reference \nhere to the exclusion of anyone who might be of the Muslim faith, is \ntroubling to me because it is that sort of an attitude that contributes \nto the dehumanization of people and casts aspersions on an entire group \nof people.\n  Indeed, as we talk about what has occurred as a result of the actions \nof a few bad apples, I point out the story in today's newspaper because \nI think that the attitude of exclusion expressed in the story \ncontributes to an environment, if you will, that somehow makes these \nabuses permissible in the minds of some--that somehow these people are \nundeserving of the kind of treatment that every other human ought to \nreceive--particularly in the hands of a nation that prides itself on \nbeing governed by the rule of law and which respects individual rights.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article in today's \nWashington Post entitled ``Bush to Appear On Christian TV For Prayer \nDay'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Bush To Appear on Christian TV for Prayer Day\n\n                          (By Alan Cooperman)\n\n       President Bush's participation in a National Day of Prayer \n     ceremony with evangelical Christian leaders at the White \n     House will be shown tonight, for the first time in prime-time \n     viewing hours, on Christian cable and satellite TV outlets \n     nationwide.\n       For Bush, the broadcast is an opportunity to address a \n     sympathetic evangelical audience without the risk of \n     alienating secular or non-Christian viewers, because it will \n     not be carried in full by the major television networks. \n     Frank Wright, president of the National Association of \n     Religious Broadcasters, said more than a million evangelicals \n     are expected to see the broadcast.\n       Some civil liberties groups and religious minorities \n     charged that the National Day of Prayer has lost its \n     nonpartisan veneer and is being turned into a platform for \n     evangelical groups to endorse Bush--and vice versa.\n       ``Over the years, the National Day of Prayer has gradually \n     been adopted more and more by the religious right, and this \n     year in particular there is such an undercurrent of \n     partisanship because for the first time they are broadcasting \n     Bush's message in an election year,'' said the Rev. Barry W. \n     Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation \n     of Church and State.\n       The event's organizers denied that it amounts to a tacit \n     political endorsement.\n       ``We're in an election year, and we believe God cares who's \n     in those positions of authority,'' said Mark Fried, spokesman \n     for the National Day of Prayer Task Force. ``But we're not \n     endorsing a candidate--just praying that God's hand will be \n     on the election.''\n       The private task force, which operates from the Colorado \n     headquarters of the Christian organization Focus on the \n     Family, has encouraged the nation's churches to organize \n     potluck suppers and pipe the ceremony into their sanctuaries. \n     It will be taped in mid-afternoon in the East Room and re-\n     broadcast during a three-hour, late evening ``Concert of \n     Prayer'' featuring Christian music stars and other \n     luminaries, such as Bruce Wilkinson, author of the best-\n     selling ``Prayer of Jabez.''\n       ``This feed is available to any network anywhere in the \n     world free of charge, but only religious networks have an \n     inclination to pick it up,'' Wright said.\n       Fried said this year's theme is ``Let Freedom Ring.'' He \n     described it as the evangelical response to efforts to remove \n     the words ``under God'' from the Pledge of Allegiance and \n     keep the Ten Commandments out of public buildings.\n       ``Our theme is, there is a small group of activists \n     unleashing an all-out assault on our religious freedoms. They \n     are targeting the Christian faith,'' he said.\n       The National Day of Prayer has been celebrated every year \n     since 1952, when President Harry S. Truman signed a \n     congressional resolution calling for ``a suitable day each \n     year, other than a Sunday to be set aside for common prayer.\n       Under President Ronald Reagan, the date was set permanently \n     as the first Thursday in May. Since the mid-1980s, the \n     ceremony has been organized by the nonprofit task force \n     headed by two prominent evangelical women: Vonette Bright, \n     widow of Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright, and \n     Shirley Dobson, wife of Focus on the Family founder James C. \n     Dobson.\n       As in recent years, today's observances will begin with a \n     congressional prayer session on Capitol Hill in the morning, \n     followed by the afternoon ceremony at the White House. Under \n     President Bill Clinton, Bright said in an interview this \n     week, the White House observance was private and ``very \n     definitely lower key'' than under Bush, who has invited print \n     and television coverage each year.\n       Although ``we were disappointed'' with Clinton's low-\n     profile celebration, Bright said, evangelicals did not make \n     that sentiment public. ``We have as enthusiastically promoted \n     the Day of Prayer when Democrats were in office as when they \n     were not,'' she said, adding that any ``politicization'' of \n     the Day of Prayer ``would be so unfortunate.''\n       Bright did not hesitate, however, to express admiration for \n     Bush: ``I don't think he has a political agenda of his own. I \n     think he's really trying to do what would please God.''\n       She also made no apologies about the exclusion of Muslims \n     and others outside of the ``Judeao-Christian tradition'' from \n     ceremonies planned by the task force on Capitol Hill and in \n     state capitals across the country. ``They are free to have \n     their own national day of prayer if they want to,'' she said. \n     ``We are a Christian task force.''\n       The White House press office and presidential adviser Karl \n     Rove's office did not respond to calls seeking comment on the \n     National Day of Prayer observances.\n       Organizers said some Jewish rabbis, Catholic clergy and \n     mainline Protestants have been invited to the congressional \n     and White House ceremonies. But the exclusion of religious \n     minorities has led to protests in several cities.\n       In Salt Lake City, Mormons have complained that they are \n     not allowed to lead prayers during the local observance.\n       In Oklahoma City, the Rev. W. Bruce Prescott has planned an \n     interfaith ceremony on the steps of the state Capitol today \n     to protest the exclusively Christian ceremony inside the \n     building. ``As a Baptist preacher, it's hard for me to \n     protest prayer,'' he said. ``What I'd rather do is see if we \n     can't find a way to do it right.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in addition to \nmy time, I receive 10 minutes from Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we are currently engaged in a fierce battle to salvage \nsomething, anything, from the administration's effort at regime change \nand reconstruction in Iraq. Each day, the costs in lives and dollars \naccumulate, as the Iraqi people become more restive and impatient. \nInternational and regional support for our efforts is eroding at a time \nwhen an international effort, as distinct from the administration's \nunilateral approach, may be the only effective way to change the \npolitical dynamic and allow us to avoid being trapped in a long, \nbloody, and uncertain conflict.\n  Many Americans are asking how we came to this point. Some are asking \nwhy we must remain. The President has responded with a slogan: ``We \nmust not waiver.'' What we need is a plan, a plan based on reality, not \non ideology.\n  The administration launched the preemptive attack on Iraq to counter, \naccording to their claims, the overwhelming danger of Iraqi weapons of \nmass destruction and alleged ties between Saddam Hussein and \nterrorists. In the last year, no weapons of mass destruction have been \nfound, and no strong link has been established between Saddam and \nterrorists. Ironically, today, there is no shortage of terrorists in \nIraq. They have been drawn there not by Saddam but by his demise.\n  Now, the administration returns to the subtext of its justification \nfor preemptive action in the fall of 2002, the unalloyed evil of \nSaddam. That, of course, is a point beyond debate; indeed, a point that \nwas acknowledged by all sides during the debate in the fall of 2002.\n  When Secretary Wolfowitz testified recently before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, he continually reiterated the depravity of Saddam \nstressing, in his words, the ``density of evil'' that gripped Iraq \nunder Saddam. Looking backward at Saddam will not help us find a way \nahead today. Today, more relevant than the ``density of evil'' that \ngripped Iraq is the ``density of illusion'' that continues to grip the\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\nadministration and the Pentagon. The administration and the Pentagon \nstubbornly cling to illusions about the situation in Iraq. Let me \nsuggest some of the most salient.\n  For months, they have attempted to convince the world--and, perhaps, \nthemselves--that Iraqi security forces were capable of making a \nsignificant contribution to establish order and to defeat the \ninsurgency. No such capability exists at this time, and it may take \nyears to train a competent and cohesive force that can assume the \nsecurity role in Iraq that currently falls primarily upon the United \nStates.\n  For months, the Pentagon regaled us with charts showing the \nastronomical and rapid growth of Iraqi security forces from mere \nhandfuls to hundreds of thousands. They repeatedly stressed the \nproportional decrease of the American presence as a sign of progress. \nAll this was wishful thinking and political spinning.\n  The last few weeks have revealed the fact that a significant number \nof Iraqi security forces are ill prepared, ill equipped, and \nunmotivated.\n  A Washington Post article pointed out that on April 5, a new Iraqi \nbattalion of several hundred Iraqi soldiers refused to join U.S. \nMarines in the offensive in Fallujah. In the south, police units as \nwell as members of the Iraqi Civilian Defense Corps, equivalent to the \nNational Guard of the United States, refused to engage Sadr's forces. \nMG Martin Dempsey, commander of the 1st Armored Division in Iraq, \nestimated that one in 10 members of the Iraqi security forces actually \nworked against the U.S. forces and 40 percent simply walked away from \ntheir post because of intimidation during the recent violence in \nFallujah and in the south of Iraq.\n  The Pentagon likely had indications of problems with these forces. \nSeveral months ago MG Karl Eikenberry was dispatched to Iraq to conduct \na survey of Iraqi security forces. General Eikenberry is an extremely \ncompetent and experienced officer who played a key role in establishing \nthe new national army in Afghanistan after Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  For many weeks, I have been attempting to obtain this report to \nbecome informed and to inform my colleagues about the state of \nreadiness of the Iraqi security forces. The Pentagon has been \ncompletely uncooperative. This lack of cooperation and respect for the \nresponsibilities of Congress to perform oversight over the Department \nof Defense has been characteristic of this administration's approach \nthroughout the conduct of operations in Iraq, and it has contributed to \nthe predicament we find ourselves in today. Too often a small group of \ncivilians in the Pentagon has displaced normal planning functions and \ninstead, insulated from appropriate congressional oversight, has \nhatched plans for the occupation in Iraq that have proven to be \nmisguided and inept. The formation of credible and effective Iraqi \nsecurity forces is imperative, but not just because it reduces the \nburden and the threat to our forces. It is imperative we establish \nthese forces because today our goals for Iraq are being thwarted by a \nclimate of violence that affects every Iraqi and saps their willingness \nto commit to the reform of their country.\n  We often see the violence in Iraq as those attacks against our \nforces. When we do, we miss the pervasive and disturbing violence that \ntouches the lives of every Iraqi and, in a cruel irony, has many Iraqis \ncomparing the order under Saddam with the chronic disorder under the \nUnited States.\n  The following is an article, translated from Arabic, in the April \n25th edition of Al Manar, a newspaper from Baghdad:\n\n       The Iraqi society has never known or, even in U.S. gang \n     movies, seen such acts of looting, robbery, and murder as the \n     current crimes taking place in Iraq today, which cause \n     newborn's hair to turn gray. The crimes have become so common \n     that hardly an hour passes without hearing that some people \n     are being plundered or a number of cars are being stolen. The \n     drivers of the new and expensive cars have become a target \n     for the thieves and burglars.\n       Someone may think that such crimes occur in other places at \n     night; however, the strange thing is that in Iraq, they take \n     place during the day for everyone to see. In addition, the \n     numbers of these looting gangs have become very well known to \n     the ordinary citizens of Baghdad.\n       A few days ago, my relative's car was stolen at gun point \n     in Baghdad, but he managed to escape without being physically \n     harmed or injured in the incident. Having recovered from the \n     shock a few days later, his friends advised him to meet with \n     a former gang leader who enjoyed considerable status and \n     reputation among the members of the other criminal gangs. \n     Having no other option, my relative went to see the guy who \n     promised to take him to the gangs operating in the zone where \n     his car was stolen.\n       As promised, the man secretly took my relative to meet well \n     known gangsters where one of them congratulated him [my \n     relative] for his good luck because his car was stolen by a \n     gang ``that only steals cars but does not kill the owners; \n     otherwise, you would have been killed if it was another \n     gang.'' The strange thing is that most of the gangsters are \n     young boys between the age of 15 and 20 years.\n       After several terrifying trips, my relative found his car \n     when tough negotiations began. He was asked to pay $500, a \n     special offer out of honor and respect for their repentant \n     comrade who brought him to get his car back.\n\n  This true story is an example of dozens of other similar robbery, \nlooting, and murder crimes taking place in Baghdad where stealing and \nmurdering gangs have dramatically increased. Unless we are able to \nprotect the people of Iraq from criminal gangs and from situations as \nillustrated in these comments in the newspaper, we will fail in our \nmission because we have a situation where the basic elements of order, \nthe basic sense of safety and security have been completely eviscerated \nfor a vast number of Iraqis.\n  These are off the TV screens. But this is one of the constant \ndrumbeats that is turning the people of Iraq to become resentful of our \npresence.\n  The administration has also, together with the Pentagon, consistently \nunderestimated the number of troops necessary for the successful \noccupation of Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld and General Franks adroitly \nplanned the air and ground campaign that shattered the Iraqi army in a \nmatter of days. They correctly judged our overwhelming technological \nadvantages, together with the extraordinary courage and skill of our \nfighting forces, would quickly overwhelm the much larger Iraqi forces. \nBut winning a swift victory over a conventional military force is not \nthe same as successfully occupying a large country with a population of \n25 million.\n  From the beginning, our forces, including international allies, were \ninsufficient to physically and psychologically dominate the scene. The \nabsence or limited presence of coalition forces in many parts of Iraq \ngave the insurgents opportunities to organize and the perception they \ncould initiate hostile actions against our forces. One of the first \nclues I had suggesting a lack of adequate forces was the briefing I \nreceived last July from the 4th Infantry Division in Kirkuk on my first \ntrip to Iraq. I was taken aback, frankly, to learn there were hundreds, \nif not thousands, of Iraqi ammo dumps. Many of them were totally \nunsecured while others had some security barriers but were not secured \nby military personnel. This was the case all over the country.\n  Today munitions in these ammo dumps are being used to craft the \nimprovised explosive devices that bedevil our forces. This is one \nexample indicating additional troops could have been used effectively.\n  Another indication of the insufficient number of coalition military \nforces is the proliferation of private security forces. Why is it \nnecessary to have 20,000 armed private security guards in Iraq \nperforming essential military duties? The answer is simple. We did not \ndeploy sufficient military forces. These private security forces are \ngenerally highly trained professionals, typically veterans of our \nspecial operations forces. But their presence raises numerous \nquestions.\n\n  How, for example, do they coordinate with our military forces? What \nrules of engagement may they use? What is their legal status, \nparticularly after June 30, when limited sovereignty is transferred to \nsome Iraqi authority? I am still awaiting the answer to these questions \nfrom the Pentagon. Once again, my request has not been responded to \npromptly with detailed information or any information.\n  Last September, Senator Hagel and I proposed an amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill to increase the size of our Army by \n10,000 soldiers. That is a necessary initial step to provide the \nmanpower to continue to commit further forces to Iraq and to continue \nto meet the worldwide demands\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\nupon our Army. The Senate supported that amendment. Unfortunately, the \nadministration vociferously opposed it. They claimed Iraq was just a \nspike and that in the months ahead, the Army could begin to withdraw \nforces.\n  In January, they suddenly reversed this position and announced they \nwould take steps to increase the Army by 30,000 soldiers by tapping \ninto the supplemental appropriations bill. I am pleased the Pentagon is \nfinally convinced we need more forces for our Army, but they still \nmaintain this is a temporary emergency condition that is best funded \nthrough the supplemental appropriations process.\n  The reality is, this condition is not temporary. If we are serious \nabout succeeding in Iraq and meeting other demands throughout the \nworld, we must admit this is a task that will take many years and a \nlarger army for many years. We must provide for increases in end \nstrength for our Army in the regular budget process, not the \nsupplemental, by directing more resources to the Army from the other \nservices or by increasing the overall defense budget.\n  The administration and the Pentagon continually insist that we are \nbeing opposed by a small group of unrepentant holdouts from the former \nBaathist regime and an even smaller cadre of terrorists who have \nflocked to Iraq after the defeat of Saddam.\n  This view dangerously misconstrues the growing resentment of the Iraq \npopulation to our presence and the very real possibility that many \nIraqis will sympathize with the insurgents not because they agree with \ntheir political or religious views but because they see them as fellow \nIraqis resisting a foreign occupation.\n  Anthony Cordesman, a very prescient analyst at the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, pointed out that ``it is important \nto note that an ABC poll in February found a large core of hostility to \nthe Coalition before the tensions unleashed by current fighting, and \nthat core involved many Shi'ites as well as Sunnis.'' And, as reported \nin a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup poll, ``only a third of the Iraqi people \nnow believe that the American-led occupation of their country is doing \nmore good than harm, and a solid majority support an immediate pullout \neven though they fear that could put them in greater danger . . .'' \nAlthough half the Iraqis who responded to the poll said that they and \ntheir families were better off now then under Saddam, 71 percent of the \nrespondents when asked to classify the Americans as ``liberators'' or \n``occupiers'' chose ``occupier.'' The figure increases to 81 percent if \nyou exclude respondents from the semi-autonomous Kurdish region. More \nstartling is the fact that more than half the respondents outside of \nthe Kurdish region ``say killing U.S. troops can be justified in at \nleast some cases.''\n  What might have begun as the desperate acts of diehards from Saddam's \nregime has rapidly morphed into a widespread resentment of the United \nStates as ``occupiers.'' The insurgents have touched a nationalistic \nnerve that vastly complicates our efforts. Popular support is the \ncritical element in political warfare, and the administration is \nsquandering that support.\n  The latest revelations of gross abuse of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu \nGhraib prison have further fanned the flames of resentment and anger. \nIt is an aberration in the conduct of American soldiers, but its \noccurrence has confirmed in a very suspicious population the worst lies \nspread by our adversaries. In addition, these actions have poisoned our \nalready strained relations with many countries and their citizens \naround the world.\n  For months now, the Coalition Provisional Authority has been in \npower, and the administration touted that as an example of our \nreconstruction efforts. Frankly, I believe it has been dysfunctional \nfrom the beginning.\n  The President vested the Department of Defense with extraordinary \npowers in the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. Even before the \ninitiation of military operations, the decision was made to exclude \nexperts from the State Department from planning for the reconstruction \nand administration of Iraq. The task was given to a small group of \nideologues in the Department of Defense. They relied on the self-\nserving declarations of Chalabi and the exile crowd to assume away most \nof the problems that we later encountered in Iraq. Problems such as a \ndilapidated infrastructure an ancient rivalries between religious and \nethnic factions were conveniently ignored as the ``neocons'' predicted \nthat we would be welcomed with open arms in a country that was \neconomically and culturally ready for a rapid transition to democracy.\n  The institutional responsibilities for the transformation of Iraq \nwere given to Ambassador Bremer and the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, the ``CPA''. And, in this regard, the record is one of \nconfusion and ineptness.\n  The decision to disband the Iraqi army threw thousands of desperate \nand dangerous individuals onto the streets of Iraq. Many of these \nindividuals formed the heart of the insurgency that continues to attack \nour troops.\n  The decision to eliminate the Baath party from the civic life of Iraq \nwas quite correct in principle, but carried to such extremes that it \nalienated the Sunni community and provided additional fuel for the \ngrowing fires of resistance. To add insult to injury, the process of \ndebaathification was placed under the control of Chalabi, a figure of \nimmense distrust and dislike in Iraq.\n  I first heard these complaints from our military commanders last \nNovember during one of my trips to Iraq. They complained that thousands \nof teachers were being excluded from schools at a time when there was a \nconcerted effort to reopen schools throughout the country. These \nofficers explained that membership in the Baath Party was obligatory \nfor anyone who hoped to obtain a job like teaching in Iraq. Most of \nthese individuals were motivated not by political impulses but by \neconomic and career goals. Nevertheless, they were categorically \nexcluded subject to the discretion of Chalabi. It was a situation that \nfurther antagonized the Sunni community. The policy has been belatedly \namended but not after doing great damage.\n  This episode also illustrates the gap between the CPA and the \nmilitary commanders that actually were doing the work of rebuilding \nIraq. The CPA existed in a security bubble in Baghdad disconnected from \nthe field where Army division commanders and their staffs were taking \npragmatic actions to restore services, rebuild communities and instill \nhope in the people of Iraq. The CPA added little to these actions \nexcept indecision that simply complicated the action of commanders on \nthe ground.\n  In the past few days, a revealing memorandum by someone who served in \nthe CPA has surfaced that provided additional details illustrating the \nincompetence of the CPA. The anonymous author of the memo is a fan of \nChalabi and is hopeful for success in Iraq. This makes his criticism \neven more telling.\n  He describes the CPA as handling ``an issue like six-year-olds play \nsoccer: Someone kicks the ball and one hundred people chase after it \nhoping to be noticed, without a care as to what happens on the field.'' \nMy view is that the CPA quickly became a 30-day summer camp for \n``neocons.'' Subject-matter experts were displaced by ideological true \nbelievers who rotated in and out at a dizzying rate.\n  The CPA installed the Iraqi Governing Council composed of \nrepresentatives from the major factions and then allowed the Governing \nCouncil to pick ministers to run the major ministries, like Oil and \nPublic Works. The result was nepotism and corruption. As the memo \npoints out, ``both for political and organizational reasons, the \ndecision to allow the Governing Council to pick 25 ministers did the \ngreatest damage. Not only did we endorse nepotism, with men choosing \ntheir sons and brothers-in-law; but we also failed to use our \nprerogative to shape a system that would work . . . our failure to \npromote accountability has hurt us.\n  I met with a member of the Iraqi Governing Council on March 17 in \nBaghdad. He explained to me the importance of the June 30 date. As \nChalabi explained it to him, it is important because on that date they \nget to ``write the checks.'' I am sure there are competent and \npatriotic Iraqis involved in the Governing Council, but I am deeply \nskeptical of many, like Chalabi, who seem interested only in self-\npromotion based on deceit and deception.\n  Despite the institutional failings of the CPA, it has acquired some \nhard-\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\nwon experience. That experience disappears on July 1 as our new Embassy \nreplaces the CPA. I fear that we will witness once again a lack of \ncoordination and direction as a new team tries to organize itself in \nthe complicated and unforgiving environment of Iraq. I was hoping to \nhear Ambassador Negroponte describe in detail the organization and \npolicies that will guide the new Embassy. I didn't hear much.\n  There are numerous questions. What is the status of contracts with \nthe CPA, particularly contracts with security firms? Will American \ncivilian contractors in Iraq be subject to Iraq law or United States \njurisdiction? How will the Embassy be organized to avoid being \n``captive'' in the Green Zone in Baghdad? How will responsibilities be \ndivided between the Department of State and the Department of Defense? \nI'm still waiting for good answers.\n  We are in danger of repeating the mistakes we made a year ago. Once \nagain, we are approaching a critical juncture without a plan, just a \nnew set of players. And the clock is ticking.\n  The administration is pinning most of its hopes for political \nprogress in Iraq on the transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi entity on \nJune 30. In doing so, they confuse the difference between sovereignty \nand legitimacy. The new Iraqi entity--yet to be devised or to be \nfleshed out with Iraqis--may have some formal powers that may qualify \nit as a sovereign for the purposes of international law, but I doubt \nthat the vast majority of Iraqi citizens will see it as a legitimate \ngovernment. This new entity lacks the key components that people \nascribe to legitimate governments. Legitimate governments are created \nby internal political forces, preferably by elections, and legitimate \ngovernments control their territory.\n  This new entity will be a creation of the United States with the \nbelated and uncertain participation of the United Nations, and this new \ngovernment will exist because American military forces control the \nterritory of Iraq.\n  In a sense, the administration has already made June 30 both \nirreversible and irrelevant. Having held out the prospect of a \ntransition to Iraqi rule on June 30, it is impossible to turn back. But \non July 1, a prevailing sentiment in Iraq is likely to be \ndisappointment and a sense that the United States has, once again, \nfailed to carry out its word. This will further aggravate tensions, not \ndiminish them.\n  We can hope the participation of the United Nations will give us a \nreprieve from this fate, but the administration's disdain for and \ndistrust of the United Nations suggests to me that the current \narrangement of necessity will not be sufficient to truly give a sense \nof legitimacy despite recent efforts.\n  The surest route to legitimacy is through elections, but we are far \nfrom that day. Indeed, that day may continue to recede. Recent polling \nin Iraq underlines a disturbing fact:\n\n       Seventy-five percent of the Iraqis polled--that's the \n     largest percentage of people agreeing on virtually any \n     issue--say they would never join a political party and oppose \n     the existence of a political party.\n\n  If that is the case, the likelihood of a democratic Iraq is many \nyears away.\n  The administration's gravest illusion has been and continues to be \nthat the United States can do it alone.\n  Recent events show the necessity for significant international \ninvolvement, not unilateral action. The administration has made \novertures to the United Nations, but, as I have suggested, these \novertures smack more of political expediency than a new realization of \nthe value of broad-based collective action.\n  The monetary cost alone to the United States is staggering. We have \nspent $100 billion on the effort in Iraq with no end in sight. More \nimportantly, we have lost 767 men and women of our Armed Forces. \nIndeed, according to an article in today's Washington Post, Yale \neconomist William D. Nordhaus has estimated that the additional $25 \nbillion just requested for the war in Iraq will make it more costly \nthan the inflation-adjusted expenditures of the Revolutionary War, the \nWar of 1812, the Mexican-American war, the Spanish-American War, and \nthe Persian Gulf war combined.\n  These monetary costs are just a fraction of what we will end up \npaying. Each day we are accruing significant costs to recapitalize the \nequipment and materiel we are using up at alarming rates. The aircraft \nand the tactical and logistical vehicles will require massive overhauls \nand replacement. None of these costs are being adequately addressed in \nor outside the supplemental budgetary process or the regular budgetary \nprocess.\n  Without broad-based international support, we will be unable to \naccomplish our political goals, and we will be hard pressed to sustain \nthe billions of dollars necessary to sustain our effort in Iraq. As \nlong as we dominate the military and political forces deployed to Iraq, \nwe will be seen as occupiers serving our self-interest rather than a \nforce to advance the interests of the Iraqi people.\n  The administration has long maintained that Iraq is the ``central \nfront'' in the war on terrorism. They are badly mistaken. The ``central \nfront'' in the war on terrorism is the United States. The ultimate \nobjective of our terrorist adversaries is to once again inflict a \ncatastrophic attack against the United States. They are not distracted \nin this objective by Iraq. We should not be either.\n  Today, al-Qaida and sympathetic terrorist cells throughout the world \ncontinue to plot to conduct an attack against the United States or the \nhomelands of our allies.\n  The insurgents that we are engaging in Iraq may hate us with the same \nintensity as an al-Qaida operative, but they have chosen a different \npath--a path of guerrilla war against our military forces and the \ncitizens of Iraq. The majority are Iraqis motivated by specific \ngrievances involving our presence in Iraq. The ``foreign fighters'' who \nare in Iraq are drawn by the desire to fight the infidel. They are \ntemperamentally and technically much different than the plotters who \nattacked us on September 11. In contrast, there are still many al-Qaida \nand associated operatives who continue to plan stealthy attacks against \nAmericans rather than seek out a guerilla war against our military \nforces. To assume we will lure these terrorists into Iraq and destroy \nthem there is a dangerous misperception.\n  Once again, the value of a truly international approach to the war on \nterror becomes more evident. The key element in this struggle is \nintelligence, not simply military might. This intelligence is not the \nprovince of one country, even a country with the resources of the \nUnited States. It is the sum of the collective efforts of many \ncountries. To the extent we have alienated other countries or made \ntheir intelligence contributions more difficult, then we have \ndiminished the key element in defeating those who continue to plot to \nstrike our homeland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time expired.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed an \nadditional 5 minutes and that the other side be given an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, considering all of this, it is alarming to \nsee the inattention that the administration is paying to homeland \nsecurity.\n  What is also very disconcerting about the administration's view is \nthat they see al-Qaida as an institution rather than an ideology. It is \nan ideology, and it is an ideology that is spreading in the Islamic \nworld despite our huge efforts in Iraq, some might say even because of \nour efforts in Iraq.\n  This ideological battle will not be won by military means alone. It \nwill be won by providing Muslim populations around the world with a \ncompelling alternative to the jihad as a means of enhancing their sense \nof empowerment and defusing their sense of frustration.\n  Education and economic development spring to mind as ways to begin to \ncounter the appeal of the jihad. Once again, our choice of massive \nmilitary involvement in Iraq has constrained the resources that we can \ndeploy throughout the Muslim world to directly challenge the ideology \nof al-Qaida through education and economic development. Here also is \nanother example of where an international approach would have given us \nmuch more credibility and, potentially, more resources to advance this \nagenda of education and economic development.\n  The administration entered Iraq with illusions, and they struggle \ntoday in Iraq because of these illusions. The unfolding crisis in Iraq \ncan no longer tolerate illusion. It demands a realistic assessment of \nthe risks and resources, and a pragmatic plan to prevail.\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\n  The administration must develop a true plan for the war's financing \nwith realistic numbers in a timely manner.\n  The administration must commit more soldiers to the struggle in Iraq. \nThis means increasing the overall end strength of the Army through the \nregular budget process.\n  The administration must recognize that the struggle in Iraq is \nseparate from the war on terrorism and that the war on terrorism \nrequires more robust funding at home to protect America.\n  The administration must recognize and admit that we are committed to \na long and dangerous struggle in Iraq that will cover many years and \ncost many billions of dollars. The administration must seek to truly \ninstitutionalize our efforts in Iraq.\n  A government that deceives its people may sustain itself for a while. \nLincoln reminded us that ``you can fool some of the people some of the \ntime,'' but a government that deceives itself is doomed to failure, and \nits policies are doomed to failure.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we have a time limitation. I think \nI was allocated some time earlier. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is allocated 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will support John Negroponte to be \nAmerica's first ambassador to Iraq since the gulf war, and I will speak \nabout it in more detail in a moment.\n  First I want to say a few words about the larger issues of Iraq and \nthe enormously important challenge we face at an enormously important \ntime for our Nation. The stakes could not be higher for the safety of \n135,000 American soldiers serving in Iraq, for the future of Iraq and \nits 25 million citizens, for America's role in the world in the years \nahead, and for America's own security in the weeks, let alone the \nyears, ahead.\n  For the stability of the entire Middle East, America's ambassador \nmust convey to the new Iraqi government and the Iraqi people America's \nhopes for Iraq that it soon become a free, stable and prosperous and \npeaceful nation that respects the rights of its own citizens.\n  We pray that mission accomplished has not become mission impossible. \nAmerica's respect and reputation in the world have never been lower in \nthe entire history of our Nation. Where do we go to get our respect and \nreputation back? Where do we go to bring a respectable end to the \nnightmare for America that Iraq has become?\n  I worry that the actions of our Government may no longer keep America \ntrue to the ideals of the Nation's Founders so long ago.\n  I hope the appointment of Ambassador Negroponte, a career diplomat, \nwill mark a new beginning of serious American engagement in the real \nproblems in Iraq.\n  Too often, the Bush administration has been blinded by its arrogance \non Iraq and refused to recognize the cold, hard truth about its failed \npolicies. Time and again, the President has looked at events in Iraq \nthrough rose-colored glasses, ignored the administration's many \nmistakes in Iraq, and has failed to speak with candor either to the \nAmerican or the Iraqi people.\n  Ambassador Negroponte could not be entering this position at a more \nchallenging time. The allegations of prisoner abuse have shaken the \nfaith of the Iraqi people and the international community in the \nbenevolence of the U.S. involvement in Iraq. The new ambassador must \nstart to rebuild their trust.\n  In his April 20, testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nDeputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz spoke at length about the \nhuman rights abuses under Saddam. Seven of the 23 pages of his prepared \ntestimony addressed the atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein.\n  One of the goals of the U.S. occupation of Iraq should have been to \nherald a new day of human rights for the Iraqi people. Instead, many \nIraqis are equating America's crimes to those committed by Saddam \nHussein, using the same prison and the same torture rooms.\n  There is no question that this is not the case. There is no question \nthat Saddam's crimes were crueler and more horrific and more widespread \nby any objective standard.\n  But the reports of torture by American soldiers, and the reports that \nthese abuses took place at the direction of Army intelligence officers, \nCIA agents, and private contractors, are deeply damaging to our cause \nin Iraq and our reputation and interests in the world.\n  Nobody questions the commitment and skill of the vast majority of our \nsoldiers. They are performing admirably under extraordinarily difficult \ncircumstances. I have no doubt that these despicable incidents are even \nmore painful for them than they are for the rest of America. I am \nconcerned, however, that allegations of prisoner abuse are not limited \nto this one Baghdad prison. GEN. George Casey has said that this \nmilitary has conducted at least 25 criminal investigations into deaths \nand 10 criminal investigations into other allegations of misconduct \ninvolving detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Without a question, these reports of abuse strike at the heart of the \nmoral argument for the administration's war in Iraq.\n  It is clear that we need a full and independent investigation. The \nAmerican people need the truth. Congress needs answers. There must be a \nfull investigation and full accountability, including a comprehensive \nreview of all detention and interrogation polices used by military and \nintelligence officials abroad, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, and \nelsewhere.\n  We need to know when the torture started, why was it kept secret for \nso long, and why we had to learn about it from the media. No one should \nbe immune to questions, including the President.\n  This is President Bush's war. It is the result of his radical \ndoctrine of preventive war and American unilateralism run amok.\n  President Bush has spoken frequently about the dignity and human \nrights of the Iraqi people, and he made it a major justification for \nthe war.\n  In the East Room of the White house on March 19, 2004, President Bush \nasked: ``Who would prefer that Saddam's torture chambers still be \nopen?''\n  In the Cabinet room on December 24, 2003, the day Saddam was \ncaptured, President Bush said:\n\n       For the vast majority of Iraqi citizens who wish to live as \n     free men and women, this event brings further assurance that \n     the torture chambers and the secret police are gone forever.\n\n  The President has failed the Iraqi people, and he has failed America. \nHe has presided over America's steepest and deepest fall from grace in \nthe history of our country.\n  The buck stops at the Oval Office. The tragedy unfolding in Iraq is \nthe direct result of a colossal failure of leadership. It is a failure \nof calamitous proportions. The President should apologize to the Iraqi \npeople and accept full responsibility.\n  In the wake of this tragedy, Ambassador Negroponte will face an \nuphill battle regaining the enormous ground we have lost in winning the \nhearts and minds of the Iraqi people.\n  America's vision to rebuild Iraqi and provide new hope and \nopportunity was grand and noble, but we have not delivered on our \npromise. Far too many Iraqis have come to the conclusion that America \nis able, but unwilling, to meet their basic needs. The frustration with \nour unfulfilled promises is feeding into massive hatred for America and \nour soldiers, who are paying with their lives.\n  Last fall, President Bush requested $20 billion in emergency \nreconstruction assistance from Congress to provide basic services for \nthe Iraqi people. Congress wrote a large check to the Iraqi people, but \nthe administration still has not delivered it.\n  Ambassador Bremer spoke of the urgent need for this assistance in the \nSenate Appropriations Committee on September 22, 2003:\n\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\n\n       This is urgent. . . . Most Iraqis welcomed us as \n     liberators. Now the reality of foreign troops on the streets \n     is starting to chafe. Some Iraqis are beginning to regard us \n     as occupiers and not liberators. This was perhaps inevitable, \n     but faster progress on reconstruction will help.\n\n  Acting in good faith, the Congress approved this funding 3 weeks \nlater.\n  Despite the desperate need for reconstruction assistance in Iraq, the \nBush administration has spent only a small portion of these funds. A \nmere 14 percent of the billions provided by Congress last October has \nbeen obligated for reconstruction projects. The administration has not \nclearly told the Congress how much has actually been spent. It may not \neven know.\n  According to the most recent report to the Congress from the Office \nof Management and Budget: Nearly $3.6 billion was intended for public \nworks projects, including nearly $3 billion for drinking water, but \nonly $32 million has been obligated overall, and only $14 million has \nbeen obligated on drinking water; $443 million was intended for \nimprovements in hospitals and health clinics, but the coalition \ngovernment has obligated nothing.\n  Mr. President, $300 million was designated for health care equipment \nand modernization, but nothing has been obligated and $90 million was \ndesignated to build and repair schools, but less than a quarter of it \nhas been obligated.\n  Our half-hearted attempt to take the face of America off the \noccupation will inevitably exacerbate Ambassador Negroponte's \ndiplomatic challenges.\n  Our proposal to transfer sovereignty to the Iraqi people on June 30th \nand take the face of America off the occupation is nothing more than \nthat--a proposal. It's not even a real transfer of sovereignty.\n  At the very time we are talking about transferring sovereignty, \nPresident Bush is developing a grandiose plan to build a super embassy \nin Baghdad, staffed by 1,000 Americans. We will still have 135,000 \nAmerican soldiers on the ground in Iraq for the foreseeable future.\n  The new embassy's significance is clear. This administration wants \nBaghdad to be America's new colonial beachhead in the Middle East. As \none American official said it will be just like ``Saigon, circa 1969.''\n  By comparison, 147 Americans now work at the American Embassy in \nAfghanistan, a country with 4 million more people than Iraq; 500 \nAmericans work at the American Embassy in Egypt, a country nearly three \ntimes the population of Iraq; and 293 Americans work at the American \nEmbassy in India, a country of 1.8 billion people.\n  In fact, the administration is diverting funds intended for Iraq's \nreconstruction to support this Fortress America Embassy. According to \nan April 30th article in the Washington Post, $184 million has been \nreassigned from drinking water projects to pay for the operations of \nthe U.S. embassy. Another $29 million has been reallocated from \nprojects such as democracy building to the administrative expenses of \nUSAID.\n  And we wonder why the Iraqis hate us, why hatred for the American \noccupation continues to grow.\n  We all have a stake in Iraq's success--the administration, the \nAmerican people, the Iraqi people. Ambassador Negroponte has an \nenormous responsibility to ensure that our policy toward Iraq is based \nin reality and shaped by the facts on the ground.\n  As the Ambassador embarks on this new assignment, he must not gloss \nover the truth, even if it is painful. He must speak with candor to the \nAmerican people and the Iraqi people about America's objectives, our \nstrategy, and our successes, and he must be equally candid about our \nfailures.\n  He would be wise not to follow in the footsteps of so many in the \nBush administration who may have spoken candidly about the bleak \nsituation in Iraq to the President in private, but who constantly \nsought in public to put a positive face on the clear failures.\n  The stakes are high and the challenges are many. I wish Ambassador \nNegroponte great success and the best of luck. He will need both if \nAmerica is to succeed in stabilizing Iraq, delivering on our promise of \nfreedom and democracy, and bringing our troops home with dignity and \nhonor. I urge my colleagues to approve his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. I request the time run equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Does the Senator \nfrom Iowa have a certain amount of time? And if so, what is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has been allocated 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of John D. \nNegroponte to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. I understand and agree \nAmerica needs a representative there, more so now than ever. We need \nsomeone in Iraq who has a sterling record, an unassailable record in \nterms of his or her support for fundamental human rights and for the \nrule of law, someone who has no blot on their career record of having \nbeen involved in the kind of abuses that have come to light recently in \nIraq under our military jurisdiction.\n  After the terrible revelations of the abuses under our watch at the \nprison at Abu Ghraib--more is coming to light in Afghanistan, and we do \nnot know what is happening in Guantanamo--I believe nominating \nAmbassador Negroponte to this vital post would send entirely the wrong \nmessage. He is not the right person for this job at this time.\n  Why do I say that? Ambassador Negroponte served as U.S. Ambassador to \nHonduras from October 1981 through May of 1985. During this time, Mr. \nNegroponte showed a callous disregard for human rights abuses through \nhis tenure as U.S. Ambassador to Honduras. I speak of this from \nfirsthand knowledge. I traveled to Honduras during this period and I \nvisited one of the Contra camps along the border of Honduras and \nNicaragua with then Ambassador Negroponte. At that time, there were \nmany allegations that a so-called Battalion 316--which was supervised \nand trained by our CIA and by some of our military personnel--had been \ninvolved in some very egregious human rights abuses, including the \ndisappearances of people, including the disappearance and alleged \ntorture and murder of a Catholic priest.\n  At the time of my visit to the camp with Mr. Negroponte, I asked a \nnumber of questions about Battalion 316 and the alleged human rights \nabuses. I was told there were no such human rights abuses committed by \nthe Honduran military. It became clear to me I was misled, and quite \nfrankly I was not given answers to my questions about the human rights \nabuses being committed by Battalion 316. I believe Ambassador \nNegroponte knowingly misinformed me and knowingly misinformed the U.S. \nState Department about gross violations of human rights in Honduras \nduring his tenure.\n  I refer to a series of articles written in the Baltimore Sun in 1995. \nA June 19, 1995 article was talking about Ambassador Negroponte.\n\n       An ambassador, someone cynically once said, is sent abroad \n     to lie for his country. U.S. career diplomat John D. \n     Negroponte confused that with lying to his country. As U.S. \n     ambassador to Honduras during the early '80s, Mr. Negroponte \n     systematically suppressed reports to Washington describing \n     kidnappings and murders of political dissidents by a secret \n     unit of the Honduran army. Instead he was responsible for \n     false reports to Washington that portrayed the Honduran \n     regime as committed to democracy and the rule of law.\n\n  I will read further from this article:\n\n       Why should an experienced U.S. diplomat send false reports \n     to the State Department concealing damaging information about \n     the nation he was assigned to? Simple. For one thing, some of \n     his superiors wanted it that way. They weren't fooled. They \n     were part of a conspiracy to mislead Congress and the U.S. \n     public. The Reagan administration, which dispatched Mr. \n     Negroponte to replace an ambassador who was reporting \n     unwelcome facts, had an overriding policy objective in \n     Central America: to stop what it perceived as a threatened \n     communist takeover. Nothing else mattered.\n       Mr. Negroponte later told a Senate panel he never saw any \n     ``convincing substantiation'' that the notorious unit was \n     ``involved in death squad type activities.'' If so,\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\n     he outdid the three monkeys who saw no evil, heard no evil \n     and spoke no evil. The evidence was all around him, including \n     in his own embassy. A diplomat who tried to write a truthful \n     human rights report was ordered to remove the damaging \n     information. More than 300 articles about military abuses \n     appeared in the Honduran newspapers that year alone. Hundreds \n     marched through the capital in protests. A dissident Honduran \n     legislator personally appealed to Mr. Negroponte.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the articles from June 19, 1995, \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, June 19, 1995]\n\n                    Hear No Evil, See No Evil . . .\n\n       An ambassador, someone cynically once said, is sent abroad \n     to lie for his country. U.S. career diplomat John D. \n     Negroponte confused that with lying to his country.

Nothing else mattered.\n       Each year, U.S. embassies report on human rights abuses and \n     the State Department passes the information on to Congress. \n     Nations that consistently violate human rights are barred \n     from receiving U.S. military aid. By ignoring the clear, \n     unavoidable evidence that Hondurans were being kidnapped, \n     tortured, raped and murdered by a special unit under the \n     command of the army chief of staff, the Reagan administration \n     was able to boost military aid to Honduras from $3.9 million \n     in 1980 to $77.4 million four years later.\n       Mr. Negroponte later told a Senate panel he never saw any \n     ``convincing substantiation'' that the notorious unit was \n     ``involved in death squad type activities.'' If so, he outdid \n     the three monkeys who saw no evil, heard no evil and spoke no \n     evil. The evidence was all around him, including in his own \n     embassy. A diplomat who tried to write a truthful human \n     rights report was ordered to remove the damaging information. \n     More than 300 articles about military abuses appeared in \n     Honduran newspapers that year. Hundreds marched through the \n     capital in protests. A dissident Honduran legislator \n     personally appealed to Mr. Negroponte.\n       In the last of four articles resulting from a 14-month \n     investigation, Sun reporters Ginger Thompson and Gary Cohn \n     quote liberally from the 1982 and 1983 human rights reports \n     on Honduras. Each quotation is matched by persuasive evidence \n     it is a shameless lie. Even the Honduran government has now \n     acknowledged the atrocities. But not Mr. Negroponte, the \n     hard-line cold warrior who considered Henry Kissinger a \n     softie on Vietnam.\n       Now ambassador to the Philippines, Mr. Negroponte has \n     refuse to respond to questions repeatedly directed at him by \n     The Sun. But he can't ignore pointed questions from President \n     Clinton, whose personal representative in Manila is Mr. \n     Negroponte. Despite the State Department's support of Mr. \n     Negroponte, the president can't possibly want someone of this \n     ilk representing the U.S. abroad.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Ambassador Negroponte's reports to his superiors in the \nState Department resulted in the Congress being misled as to the scope \nand nature of gross human rights violations that were committed by \nBattalion 316, an elite U.S trained unit of the Honduran military \ninvolved in some of the worst human rights abuses in Central America.\n  In a letter to The Economist in 1982, Ambassador Negroponte wrote, it \nis simply untrue that death squads have made appearances in Honduras.\n  This is from our Ambassador to Honduras at the very time death squads \nwere openly operating in Honduras under Battalion 316. Yet he said it \nis untrue that they have made an appearance in Honduras.\n  We now have history. We now know Mr. Negroponte was not telling us \nthe truth.\n  From 1981 to 1984, over 150 people disappeared in Honduras, including \nan American priest, Father James Carney. His body has never been \nrecovered. All indications at that time pointed to Battalion 316. There \nhad been reports that they interrogated him and he was severely \ntortured and killed. I am not suggesting Ambassador Negroponte was \nresponsible for Father Carney's disappearance. What I am saying, \nhowever, is Ambassador Negroponte turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to \nthe human rights abuses in Honduras during his watch. During that \nperiod, Ambassador Negroponte was in very close contact, perhaps almost \non a daily basis, with GEN Gustavo Alvarez, the Commander in Chief of \nthe Honduran military, and the architect of Battalion 316.\n  For Ambassador Negroponte in 1982 to say it is simply untrue that \ndeath squads have made appearances in Honduras--this is going to be our \nAmbassador to Iraq at this time?\n  In 1989, during a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on his nomination to be Ambassador to Mexico, Ambassador \nNegroponte was questioned about the human rights violations by this \nelite battalion which became known as Battalion 316. His response was \nthat he had ``never seen any convincing substantiation they were \ninvolved in death-squad type activities.'' Yet, as a Baltimore Sun \narticle pointed out, the evidence was all around him, including in his \nown embassy. A diplomat who tried to write a truthful human rights \nreport was ordered to remove the damaging information, and Mr. \nNegroponte was the Ambassador at that time.\n  Mr. President, the Baltimore Sun, in 1995, devoted a series of \narticles on what happened in Honduras and what happened in terms of Mr. \nNegroponte's involvement at that time. For the benefit of those who \nmight want to read the Record and catch up on Mr. Negroponte's past and \nwhat he did while he was Ambassador to Honduras, I commend these \narticles to them.\n  Mr. President, I think it should be clear to all of us why human \nrights questions and concerns should be at the forefront of today's \ndebate and why someone with the background of Mr. Negroponte is not the \nright person to send to Iraq, because it is going to come out, it will \ncome out about Mr. Negroponte's involvement with Battalion 316. It will \ncome out about Mr. Negroponte's efforts in Honduras to suppress \ninformation Congress needed at that time. It will come out that Mr. \nNegroponte was untruthful to his superiors at the State Department. It \nshould be clear to us why he should not go there at this time.\n  We are shocked and shaken by the pictures of abuse against Iraqis at \nthe hands of U.S. personnel. Our image as a country is at stake. But it \nis not just our image, it is the very essence of our Nation, our \nfundamental respect for human rights, our fundamental respect for the \ndignity and worth of each individual, the essence of what we are trying \nto tell the world, that we are for freedom, that we are for individual \nliberties, that we oppose torture in all its forms. There is no reason \nwhy people should be tortured in prisons, and we should not be involved \nin it.\n  The photographs we have seen also have a personal association for me. \nWhen I first saw these pictures, I was taken back in time--34 years to \nbe exact--to 1970, July of 1970, when I was a staff person in the House \nof Representatives, and I was sent with a commission to Vietnam.\n  We had heard all these reports about these tiger cages in which \npeople were brutally tortured, killed. Our State Department denied \ntheir existence, our military denied the existence of them; these were \nall just Communist conspiracy stories.\n  Well, I had heard enough about them and others had heard enough about \nthem that I began to look into it, and because of some luck, because of \nthe courage of Congressman William Anderson of Tennessee, \nand Congressman Augustus Hawkins of California, a young man by the name \nof Don Luce, and the bravery of a young Vietnamese man who gave us the \nmaps on how to find this prison, we were able to uncover the notorious \ntiger cages on Con Son Island.\n\n  Fortunately, I had a camera. Fortunately, I had a hidden tape \nrecorder. Because when I came back and we reported on this, we were \ntold they were not that bad. Well, then LIFE magazine published my \npictures and the world saw how bad they really were. North Vietnamese, \nVietcong, and civilian opponents of the war in South Vietnam were all \nbunched into these tiger cages, in clear violation of human rights, \nfundamental human rights, and in clear violation of the Geneva \nConvention. We had been asking the North\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\nVietnamese to abide by the Geneva Convention in terms of their \ntreatment of our prisoners in North Vietnam. Yet, here we were \ncondoning, supervising, the very same kind of abuses of people, in \nclear violation of the Geneva Convention.\n  Well, then I was told, well, as to what these people were telling \nme--because the interpreter was pro-Communist--that he was telling me \nthe wrong things, because I did not speak Vietnamese, you see. I did \nnot speak Vietnamese, and they said the person interpreting for me had \na bias toward the Communists, so I could not believe what I was being \ntold. So they sent another group over to hear all these glowing \nreports. What they did not know at the time is that I had a hidden tape \nrecorder. No one knew that except me. I tape recorded everything that \nwas said.\n  I was fired from my job. I was told I would never again work in the \nU.S. Congress because of my actions in letting these pictures out and \ntelling the truth about what was happening on Con Son Island. I was \nbrought before a congressional committee and was charged that what I \nwas reporting was false because I did not speak Vietnamese, and that my \ninterpreter was a well-known ``Communist sympathizer.'' But I had my \ntape recorder and I taped everything that was said.\n  I turned it over to the Library of Congress to transcribe, and they \ntranscribed every single word. Not only what I had been saying was \nconfirmed, but there was even more on the recording that was not \ninterpreted for me, more evidence of the cruel, torturous conditions in \nthese tiger cages, how people had been tortured and killed, and how we, \nthe U.S. Government, had provided not only the funding but the \nsupervision for these prisons.\n  So when I saw these pictures from Iraq, it brought back Con Son \nIsland and the tiger cages. I thought we had learned our lesson. Yes, \nwar is not a nice thing. War is terrible. But that is why we have \nGeneva Conventions. That is why we have these international treaties. I \nthought we learned after Con Son and the tiger cages that we ought not \nto be involved in those things, that we ought to make sure whoever runs \nthese prisons, whoever has charge of prisoners of war, treats the \nprisoners according to the Geneva Convention. Yet here we are back \nagain--34 years later--and we see the same kinds of things happening in \nthis prison.\n  I do not know who took those pictures. I read in the paper today it \nwas a young man and that he may be in some serious trouble. Well, \nwhoever took those pictures, I want them to know they have a friend and \nan ally in this Senator from Iowa. I will do whatever I can to ensure \nthat no harm in any way comes to them, that they are able to speak out \nwithout fear of any reprisal about what they saw and what went on in \nthose prisons.\n  We have to let the sunlight in--the best disinfectant. Let's show it \nfor what it was. Let's show what happened there. And let's tell the \nworld, once again, that we are going to make sure we have in place \npolicies, programs, things that will never let this happen again.\n  The lead editorial in this morning's Washington Post made it very \nclear when they said:\n\n       Beginning more than two years ago, Mr. Rumsfeld decided to \n     overturn decades of previous practice by the U.S. military in \n     its handling of detainees in foreign countries. His Pentagon \n     ruled that the United States would no longer be bound by the \n     Geneva Conventions; that Army regulations on the \n     interrogation of prisoners would not be observed; and that \n     many detainees would be held incommunicado and without any \n     independent mechanism of review. Abuses will take place in \n     any prison system. But Mr. Rumsfeld's decisions helped create \n     a lawless regime in which prisoners in both Iraq and \n     Afghanistan have been humiliated, beaten, tortured, and \n     murdered--and in which, until recently, no one has been held \n     accountable.\n\n  I agree with those who want a full investigation. I believe we should \ninvestigate. But I don't want to see this just pinned on a few soldiers \nat the bottom. Yes, they have to be held responsible, too. No military \nperson has to follow an illegitimate order of anyone placed in \nauthority above him or her. These were illegitimate orders. If they \nwere ordered to do such things, who gave those orders? Who supervised \nit? How far up the chain of command did it go?\n  The bottom line is, the Constitution of the United States puts a \ncivilian in charge of our military. It is that civilian, by his or her \nactions, statements, policies, programs, that filter down to that \nprivate, that sergeant out in the field. Mr. Rumsfeld, because of his \nactions and his statements and his policies during his tenure as \nSecretary of Defense, is ultimately responsible. That is why I have \ncalled today for his resignation. If he doesn't resign, the President \nof the United States should dismiss him forthwith.\n  Seeing no one else asking for time on the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I have an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Because of what has happened, and for our country, we \nspeak of patriotism a lot, patriotism of our brave soldiers and airmen \nand seamen in Iraq and around the world, the patriotism of those in our \ncountry who fight for justice, fight for those less fortunate. \nPatriotism takes on a lot of different forms. I think Mr. Rumsfeld has \nto show some patriotism. He has to put the good of his country above \nhis own self-interest and his own self-esteem. It is time for him to \nrecognize that we need a new Secretary of Defense to change the \npolicies and the programs that Mr. Rumsfeld instituted, that, as the \nWashington Post editorial said, led to this kind of a situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial in the Washington Post \nthis morning, May 6, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 6, 2004]\n\n                     Mr. Rumsfeld's Responsibility\n\n       The horrific abuses by American interrogators and guards at \n     the Abu Ghraib prison and at other facilities maintained by \n     the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan can be traced, in \n     part, to policy decisions and public statements of Secretary \n     of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. Beginning more than two years \n     ago, Mr. Rumsfeld decided to overturn decades of previous \n     practice by the U.S. military in its handling of detainees in \n     foreign countries. His Pentagon ruled that the United States \n     would no longer be bound by the Geneva Conventions; that Army \n     regulations on the interrogation of prisoners would not be \n     observed; and that many detainees would be held incommunicado \n     and without any independent mechanism of review. Abuses will \n     take place in any prison system. But Mr. Rumsfeld's decisions \n     helped create a lawless regime in which prisoners in both \n     Iraq and Afghanistan have been humiliated, beaten, tortured \n     and murdered--and in which, until recently, no one has been \n     held accountable.\n       The lawlessness began in January 2002 when Mr. Rumsfeld \n     publicly declared that hundreds of people detained by U.S. \n     and allied forces in Afghanistan ``do not have any rights'' \n     under the Geneva Conventions. That was not the case: At a \n     minimum, all those arrested in the war zone were entitled \n     under the conventions to a formal hearing to determine \n     whether they were prisoners of war or unlawful combatants. No \n     such hearings were held, but then Mr. Rumsfeld made clear \n     that U.S. observance of the convention was now optional. \n     Prisoners, he said, would be treated ``for the most part'' in \n     ``a manner that is reasonably consistent'' with the \n     conventions--which, the secretary breezily suggested, was \n     outdated.\n       In one important respect, Mr. Rumsfeld was correct: Not \n     only could captured al Qaeda members be legitimately deprived \n     of Geneva Convention guarantees (once the required hearing \n     was held) but such treatment was in many cases necessary to \n     obtain vital intelligence and prevent terrorists from \n     communicating with confederates abroad. But if the United \n     States was to resort to that exceptional practice, Mr. \n     Rumsfeld should have established procedures to ensure that it \n     did so without violating international conventions against \n     torture and that only suspects who truly needed such \n     extraordinary handling were treated that way. Outside \n     controls or independent reviews could have provided such \n     safeguards. Instead, Mr. Rumsfeld allowed detainees to be \n     indiscriminately designated as beyond the law--and made \n     humane treatment dependent on the goodwill of U.S. personnel.\n       Much of what has happened at the U.S. detention center in \n     Guantanamo Bay is shrouded in secrecy. But according to an \n     official Army report, a system was established at the camp \n     under which military guards were expected to ``set the \n     conditions'' for intelligence investigations. The report by \n     Maj. Gen. Antonio M. Taguba says the system was later \n     introduced at military facilities at Bagram airbase in \n     Afghanistan and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, even though it \n     violates Army regulations forbidding guards to participate in \n     interrogations.\n       The Taguba report and others by human rights groups reveal \n     that the detention system Mr. Rumsfeld oversees has become so \n     grossly distorted that military police have abused or \n     tortured prisoners under the direction of civilian \n     contractors and intelligence officers outside the military \n     chain of command--not in ``exceptional'' cases, as Mr.\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\n     Rumsfeld said Tuesday, but systematically. Army guards have \n     held ``ghost'' prisoners detained by the CIA and even hidden \n     these prisoners from the International Red Cross. Meanwhile, \n     Mr. Rumsfeld's contempt for the Geneva Conventions has \n     trickled down: The Taguba report says that guards at Abu \n     Ghraib had not been instructed on them and that no copies \n     were posted in the facility.\n       The abuses that have done so much harm to the U.S. mission \n     in Iraq might have been prevented had Mr. Rumsfeld been \n     responsive to earlier reports of violations. Instead, he \n     publicly dismissed or minimized such accounts. He and his \n     staff ignored detailed reports by respected human rights \n     groups about criminal activity at U.S.-run prisons in \n     Afghanistan, and they refused to provide access to facilities \n     or respond to most questions. In December 2002, two Afghan \n     detainees died in events that were ruled homicides by medical \n     officials; only when the New York Times obtained the story \n     did the Pentagon confirm that an investigation was underway, \n     and no results have yet been announced. Not until other media \n     obtained the photos from Abu Ghraib did Mr. Rumsfeld fully \n     acknowledge what had happened, and not until Tuesday did his \n     department disclose that 25 prisoners have died in U.S. \n     custody in Iraq and Afghanistan. Accountability for those \n     deaths has been virtually nonexistent: One soldier was \n     punished with a dishonorable discharge.\n       On Monday Mr. Rumsfeld's spokesman said that the secretary \n     had not read Mr. Taguba's report, which was completed in \n     early March. Yesterday Mr. Rumsfeld told a television \n     interviewer that he still hadn't finished reading it, and he \n     repeated his view that the Geneva Conventions ``did not \n     precisely apply'' but were only ``basic rules'' for handling \n     prisoners. His message remains the same: that the United \n     States need not be bound by international law and that the \n     crimes Mr. Taguba reported are not, for him, a priority. That \n     attitude has undermined the American military's observance of \n     basic human rights and damaged this country's ability to \n     prevail in the war on terrorism.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are all upset about what happened. Our country was \nfounded on the principles of democracy, the inalienable rights of \nindividuals. We were right to condemn Saddam Hussein for his state-\nsponsored torture in Iraq. We are right to condemn anyone, whether it \nis in Uganda or those who led the Rwandan massacre, the generals who \nnow run Burma, or those who set up the Soviet gulags during that long \ncold war where so many were tortured and killed by the Soviets. We have \nalways been right to speak out against those and to do what we can to \nuphold the inalienable rights of individuals. We are not perfect. No \ncountry is; no individual is. But our obligation is to make sure that \nwhen this country makes a mistake, we right it. We don't try to cover \nit up. We don't try to excuse it. We bring it out, show it for what it \nis, and then institute policies, programs, procedures to make sure that \nhuman rights abuses under our watch will never happen again.\n  The bravery of our men and women in Iraq, under intolerable \nconditions, is a source of pride to all of us. As Senator Kennedy said, \nwhat has happened with these pictures, these terrible human rights \nabuses, I believe, has to pain our wonderful young men and women in \nuniform more than it pains us. Most of them, I am sure, are as abhorred \nby this as we are. I know they are wondering how something like this \ncould have happened. It has to be demoralizing for our military as it \nis demoralizing for us. That is why 34 years ago, when the pictures of \nthe tiger cages came out, it led to reforms. I believe it helped lead \nto the end of that terrible conflict in Vietnam and brought our troops \nhome.\n  I hope these pictures, as awful as they are, about what happened in \nthe Abu Ghraib prison, will now provoke us to act, to straighten out \nthe system, to make sure this does not happen again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe that our President has to apologize to the \nIraqi people. He went on television yesterday. As I understand from all \nthe articles I read, he gave a slight slap on the wrist to Secretary \nRumsfeld and said he still supported him. I am sorry. Sometimes it \ntakes a big person to admit wrong and to apologize. I believe that is \nwhat we need to do for the Iraqi people, to let them know, not by words \nbut by deeds, that this does not reflect who we are as a people. We are \nbetter than that. We are bigger than that.\n  Because of what has happened, because of the pall this has cast over \nour involvement in Iraq, for those reasons and for the history of John \nNegroponte and what he did during his tenure in Honduras during a time \nof gross violations of human rights, he should not be the highest \nranking diplomat in Iraq. I suppose the skids are greased for him to \nget this appointment. But I don't think there are too many here who \nremember Mr. Negroponte and what he did in Honduras, but I don't \nforget. I don't forget what happened there. I don't forget that Mr. \nNegroponte was one of those individuals closely aligned with General \nGustavo Alvarez and Battalion 316. I don't forget that it was Mr. \nNegroponte who turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the human rights \nabuses in Honduras at that time.\n  So to send Mr. Negroponte to Iraq would send entirely the wrong \nmessage at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nunder the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 5 minutes using the time that Senator Levin had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at 5 o'clock we are going to vote on \nwhether to confirm Mr. Negroponte to be our Ambassador. I want to make \nclear a couple of points. I voted against Mr. Negroponte for the very \nissues Senator Harkin talked about in his history when he was in Latin \nAmerica, during what I believed to be a massive coverup of human rights \nabuses, which was very troubling. When Mr. Negroponte went there, there \nwas a meeting with him and I said: You are now in a new job, and \nalthough I am not voting for you, I want to work with you. We did work \ntogether on a treaty banning child soldiers. He worked very well with \nus on that. There were times when I called him to talk about issues of \nconcern and he was very accommodating.\n  I am going to vote for him today to give him another chance at a job \nthat is so dangerous and so worrisome, because we have a policy in Iraq \nthat is not working. He is willing to go there. I give him tremendous \ncredit for that and I give credit to his family. I also think his ties \nwith people in the United Nations, as we try to get more nations \ninvolved, could be helpful. I am not sure, but it could be helpful.\n  I want to express my reservation, now that we see on the agenda of \nthe United States of America one of the worst scandals I think we have \nseen in a very long time--this prison scandal, which has such enormous \nramifications. As one of my colleagues said, it has undone a thousand \ngestures of kindness and goodness our troops have demonstrated to the \nIraqi people and to the people of Afghanistan.\n  People say, Senator, you should not vote for Mr. Negroponte because \nnow we have this other human rights scandal. Well, I feel Mr. \nNegroponte knows we are watching everything now. America has a way of \ngetting to the truth. The other day I made a speech about making sure \nthat truth will not be a casualty of this war. We need to know the \ntruth. I can tell you, I have never seen anything uglier.\n  When the press came to me and asked how I am going to vote for Mr. \nNegroponte, I said I want to give him this opportunity. I also feel we \nought to be looking to the Commander in Chief right now.\n  It isn't Mr. Negroponte who is responsible for what has gone on here. \nIt\n\n[[Page S4968]]\n\nis, in the end, the Commander in Chief, and I wish this Commander in \nChief would do what others of both political parties did and step up to \nthe plate and admit it. We all make mistakes. God knows I have made \nmany. We do not like to admit them because it shows our fallibility, \nperhaps our lack of wisdom or experience. But in the end, you have to \ndo that.\n  There have been so many mistakes made since this Iraq situation \nturned into the nightmare that it is--and let me put it right on the \ntable because I do not come to this table without a certain point of \nview. I did not vote to go it alone in this war. I worried about going \nit alone in this war. Now we have to ask ourselves, whether we voted \nfor it or against it, what do we do now? Of course, that is the \nimportant question. And what mistakes have been made? There are so many \nmistakes.\n  The military campaign was brilliant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for an additional 2 minutes per side, and I will \nfinish up. Excuse me, I ask if I can have an additional 5 minutes from \nleader time, and then I will finish up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, 5 minutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, and I will be done.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I see Senator McCain here, one of our \nheroes in America. He is my chairman and friend. I went over to him one \nday--I don't know if he remembers this. I was so worried about this \nwar, and he said something that turned out to be true. He said: It will \nbe over in 2 weeks. He was right, in essence. It was maybe a little \nlonger. That first military campaign was brilliant. And I said: But, \nSenator, I am worried about how many we are going to lose.\n  He said: It's going to be OK, Barbara.\n  He was right. But there wasn't a plan in place after that, and we all \nknow that. Yet when the President was asked by the press, Did you ever \nmake any mistakes, couldn't he think of that one?\n  Dick Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nBiden, Senator Hagel, Senator Kerry, Senator Dodd, Senator Chafee, \nmyself, and others on the Foreign Relations Committee came together and \nsaid: Where is the plan? We said that before the first shot was fired. \nSo that was a mistake.\n  Then when the President landed on the carrier and he said major \ncombat was over, ``Mission Accomplished'' behind him, that was a \nmistake.\n  Then when the world said--after that moment, we had them in our hands \nthat day, the whole world when the President landed on that carrier: \nCan we help you in Iraq? The President said: If you did not go in with \nus, you cannot rebuild; you are not getting anything. So the spoils of \nthe war were not going to be shared with anyone except those who went \ninto Iraq. It was a mistake in the end. We would have had everyone in \nthere with us. It would have been different.\n  When the United Nations building was blown up, an opportunity to say \nthen and show leadership that this has turned into a war against terror \nand the terrorists are here now--and by the way, they were not before. \nWe know that from State Department documents. They are there now. We \nhad an opportunity to say: United Nations, you have been attacked; come \nwith us. We did not do that.\n\n  Now this horrific vision in these prisons. I heard one commentator \nsay: What about the vision of the Americans who were slaughtered and \nhung on the bridges? Yes, sickening, horrifying, hellish. We cannot go \ndown that road because this is America.\n  When I was growing up, I knew America was different. This editorial \nthat ran today in the Washington Post opened up my mind because I did \nnot call for anybody's firing. I think the Commander in Chief is \nresponsible, and he has to decide who he is holding responsible. This \nis an interesting editorial. It said, When did the trouble start? It is \nwhen Don Rumsfeld, and I assume with the permission of the President, \nsaid: We are not going to pay any attention to the Geneva Convention. \nNone of these rules are going to apply. And now what has happened?\n  We don't know all the details, but if it is true, and we do not know \nthat yet, what we see in the paper--and these are real photographs--I \ndo not know that for sure, but if it is true, what we are seeing is \nsomething that has stained this country, that has burdened this country \nand scarred this country, that has undermined everything in which we \nall believe, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Greens. It does not \nmatter what party; it is about America.\n  I think it is mistake after mistake after mistake after mistake after \nmistake. What do we do now? I think Joe Biden has great ideas on that. \nHe says the Iraqi people have to want democracy as much as we want it \nfor them. I do believe it is time to test that. We are sending our \npeople into a caldron. We cannot keep going down this course. We have \nto modify it and change it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be allowed 2 additional minutes to finish up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as usual, my friend is very generous of \nspirit.\n  Stay the course, modify the course, change the course--we need to \nchange the dynamics of this. Some have suggested tearing down the \nprison. I think that might be an excellent idea to show our remorse, \nour sorrow, and our outrage. They say a picture is worth a thousand \nwords. These pictures say terrible things, and we by our actions have \nto undo those pictures.\n  My understanding is that a lot of these people who were conducting \nthemselves in this atrocious fashion were kids. They were never \ntrained. They did not understand. They were told: Just do whatever you \nhave to do to get people to talk.\n  I do not know if that is all true. We will get to the bottom of it. \nBut one thing I do know is, you do not stay on a course when it is not \nworking. We have lost over 700 of our beautiful people, some young, 18, \n19, some 30, 40 years old leaving behind children. Some 3,000 plus have \nbeen wounded. And why doesn't Paul Wolfowitz know these numbers? What \nis wrong with him that he doesn't know these numbers? It is wrong. \nThese are lives. These young people are not just some faceless, \nnameless cutout of a soldier.\n  Mr. President, I am so filled with sadness. Every time I come to the \nSenate floor to read the name of Californians who have died--I know \nthey are the best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My word to them is: You are the best, and we will get to \nthe bottom of this.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his generosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from California. I do \nremember our conversation. I also remember she and I discussed the fact \nthat the post-conflict era was going to be extremely difficult. She \nmade a very balanced statement today, and I thank her for that as we \nall go through this very difficult time in the history of our country.\n  Mr. President, we will be having a hearing tomorrow with Secretary \nRumsfeld, and after that hearing, a lot of us, I hope, will be better \ninformed, not just members of the committee, but others will be better \ninformed as to the dimensions of this terrible situation which we have \nseen so graphically demonstrated on the abuse of human rights.\n  I also am convinced again that the sooner we get this issue resolved \nand move forward and make sure it never happens again, it is very \nimportant because we have to go about the business of winning this \nconflict. We cannot let this terrible situation, as tragic as it is, \ndivert us from our purpose of winning this conflict which we cannot \nafford to lose. We have plenty of time to debate and discuss that in \nthe future.\n  I also would like to comment on my friend John Negroponte. I have \nknown John Negroponte ever since he was ambassador to Mexico, where he \ndid an outstanding job. He has held a broad variety of positions in \nboth Republican and Democrat administrations. I believe he will perform \nadmirably in the\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\nposition for which the President of the United States has nominated \nhim.\n  There probably would have been a lot less discussion about Mr. \nNegroponte's qualifications if it had not been for the difficulties we \nare experiencing in Iraq at the moment, but I would also point out it \nalso lends some urgency to getting this highly qualified, patriotic \nAmerican in position as we prepare to turn over the government of Iraq \nto the Iraqi people, which I think all of us are in agreement should be \ndone as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                                 Sudan\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the situation in Sudan. Before I \ndo, often citizens, opinion leaders, and people who are viewed with \nsome respect by the American people have, unfortunately, the \nopportunity or the obligation to say: Never again. We said ``never \nagain'' after the Holocaust. We said ``never again'' after the \nslaughter of 800,000 innocent people in Rwanda, and we have said \n``never again'' on a number of occasions where acts of genocide have \ntaken place.\n  We are seeing a situation in the Sudan where I do not want us as a \nnation or as individuals to look back and say some years from now, \nafter these innocent people are being ethnically cleansed and victims \nof a genocidal plan of orchestrated atrocities, that we would say never \nagain without us attempting to do what we can to stop what is happening \nin the Sudan as we speak.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the brave Americans serving in Iraq \nand with the Iraqi people we have liberated, but at the same time the \nsituation in Sudan is dire and it is getting worse.\n  I applaud Senator Brownback and Senator Feingold for introducing a \nresolution on this situation, and I am proud to consponsor it. I would \nlike to take a few moments to describe what the world faces today in \nSudan.\n  The region of Darfur, in western Sudan, is one of the most strife-\nridden places on Earth. The largely Arab Sudanese government has teamed \nwith the janjaweed, a group of allied militias, to crush an insurgency \nin Darfur. This is not the same as the conflict between the Sudanese \ngovernment and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement in the south, \nbut rather a separate, brutal conflict. The methods that the government \nand the janjaweed have employed to put down the insurgents are nothing \nshort of horrific. they are not only targeting rebels, but civilians as \nwell.\n  Reports emerging from Darfur indicate that the government and the \nmilitias are killing civilians, engaging in widespread rape, abducting \nchildren and adults, looting civilian property, deliberately destroying \nhomes and water sources, and forcing villagers into government-run \nconcentration camps. The government continues to block access to the \nregion for international humanitarian organizations and ceasefire \nmonitors.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the words of a student from the \ntown of Jorboke. He told Human Rights Watch:\n\n       I was at the well with my animals, about half a kilometer \n     from the village, when the planes came. . . . The Antonovs \n     came first, they were very high, like small birds, and they \n     dropped eight bombs around Jorboke. We have two wells and \n     both were hit, the others landed outside the village. . . . \n     The MiGs came about fifteen minutes later and they bombed two \n     of the houses in the village. I heard later that the \n     janjaweed came and looted and burned the rest of the village, \n     but I had left by then; my family put me on a camel to come \n     out to Chad.\n\n  A recent article in the New York Times reported an Antonov pilot \nordering a ground commander: ``Any village you pass through you must \nburn. That way, when the villagers come back they'll have a surprise \nwaiting for them.''\n  My colleagues heard correctly. The government of Sudan is actually \nusing Russian made Antonov bombers and MiG fighters to kill the \ncivilian population. They are not simply attacking military targets but \nare focusing on civilian targets such as water wells, granaries, \nhouses, and crops.\n\n  Jan England, the UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs \ndescribes the situation in Darfur as a ``scorched-earth'' policy of \nethnic cleansing in Darfur, and Andrew Natsios, Administrator of USAID \ndescribed it last week as ``the worst humanitarian disaster in the \nworld right now.'' The cost to the local population has been enormous. \nIn the last year alone, possibly up to 30,000 people have been killed \nand another million people have been displaced. Many of the displaced \nare farmers, who have been unable to plant their crops. Famine looms.\n  As we stand here today, a nominal cease fire is in place, but there \nis little evidence that the government and its allied militias are \nhonoring the agreement. Refugees continue to pour across the border \ninto Chad, fleeing for their lives.\n  If any of this sounds familiar, it should. Just weeks ago we \ncommemorated the 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. Just weeks \nago we wrung our hands and said, ``If only we knew what was to come, we \nwould have acted.'' We should have acted. But the international \ncommunity remained silent and idle, and 800,000 Rwandans lost their \nlives, under the most horrible circumstances.\n  This cannot happen again. We do not yet face a Rwanda-type situation \nin Sudan, and must ensure that we never do. The situation in Darfur \noffends America's values, and threatens our interests. The continued \nflight of refugees into Chad, the tenuous peace between Eritrea and \nEthiopia, as well as the ongoing conflicts in Somalia could further \nescalate if we allow Sudan to go up in flames.\n  Now is the time to act to stop the killing in Sudan before it becomes \ngenocide. I am encouraged that President Bush has spoken out against \natrocities in Sudan, and that the State Department and USAID have been \nvery engaged. But we must do more. As the rainy season approaches and \nthreatens to hinder the delivery of aid and medicine, we are running \nout of time.\n  The United States must first make clear to the Government of Sudan \nthat its behavior and the actions of its allied militias are totally \nunacceptable. If the government believes that it will get a free pass \nin Darfur in exchange for brokering peace with rebels in the south of \nthe country, it is sorely mistaken, as the administration has rightly \nmade clear. We must maintain all sanctions related to human rights \nviolations until real progress is made in Darfur, and consider other \nways we can increase pressure on the government.\n  The international community must also join with us in pressuring the \nregime. The situation in Darfur should be no more acceptable to \nresponsible European and African governments than it is to the American \npeople. The United Nations Security Council must condemn, in the \nstrongest terms, the gross abuses of international humanitarian law and \nhuman rights in Darfur. It should further demand that the Sudanese \ngovernment immediately disarm and disband its militias, allow full and \nunhindered access to Darfur by humanitarian agencies and ceasefire \nmonitors, and allow all displaced persons safe passage back to their \nhomes. The Secretary General should report back to the Security Council \nwithin weeks, noting the degree to which the Government of Sudan is \ncomplying with these demands. At that point, if necessary, the Security \nCouncil should consider stronger action under Chapter VII authority.\n  In the meantime, we must examine whether and what size international \ncontingent it would take to stop this disaster. If troops are required, \nwe should figure out how to get troops, possibly African troops, on the \nground. If we need financial and logistical support, the United States \nand others should provide it.\n  Some will say that this is going too far, that we face other, more \nimportant crises around the world. Dealing with ethnic strife is never \neasy, and it is all the more tempting to turn our heads when Sudan \nseems a far-off, obscure place in Africa. Yet 10 years ago, we looked \nthe other way when the public was unaware of the war between the Hutu \nand the Tutsi in Rwanda. In 1998, President Clinton apologized for our \nlack of action. I do not want to stand on the Senate floor 10 years \nfrom now and remark about the hundreds of thousands of innocent \nSudanese who perished under our watch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the critical \nimportance of moving ahead on many of the pending nominations for the \nambassadorial and foreign affairs post, and to speak to\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\nJohn Negroponte, who has become a good friend, someone whom I admire \ntremendously.\n  I do commend the Senator from Arizona for his statement on the Sudan. \nI opened this morning earlier today with the resolution at the time it \nwas approved. The Sudan is a country I am in every year, and throughout \nthe southern Sudan. I have had the opportunity to be there at least \nonce a year for the last 6 years. Again, the atrocities that are going \non in Sudan must be condemned, and the Senate is speaking loudly, \nthrough the voice of Senator McCain and so many others over the course \nof today. I commend the leaders, both of the sponsors of the bill, and \nthe bipartisan support for that resolution.\n  I mentioned the ambassadorial and foreign affairs posts because we \nneed to pay attention not just to the future of Ambassador Negroponte, \nbut also the many others today because we do have a whole range of \nqualified individuals who are going to be in very important posts--\nexcept there is one little block, and the block ends up being a huge \none, right here in the Senate. They are ready. They have been fully \nvetted and approved, with strong support of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. There have been bipartisan votes. There have been unanimous \nvotes. It is now time to act on a whole range of these ambassadorial \nposts.\n  Chairman Lugar, on the Senate floor just a few hours ago, eloquently \nnoted that foreign governments take notice when the American Embassy \npost remains vacant. They basically look at the post and they see back \nin America that nominees have been put forward, but the fact the Senate \nhas not said yes, which we ultimately will do, sends a strong signal to \nthose countries as if the United States doesn't put the emphasis or \ncare quite as much about that country. It might be interpreted as a \nfeeling of declining interest in that country. We should not allow it \nto happen. Really, we must not allow that to happen. It takes action \nhere in the Senate.\n  I am very hopeful we can open up this whole gate that is blocking so \nmany of these nominees. We absolutely must have strong diplomatic \nrepresentation and support for our policies in order to fight global \nterror, to defeat global terror, to further our economic interests \naround the world, to advance our interests and bring freedom and \ndemocracy to the millions of people who yearn for it. Like our \nmilitary, our diplomatic corps is a part of a national security team.\n  I know most of my colleagues, indeed, all of my colleagues would not \ndeny our military the leadership they need in the time of war. I ask my \ncolleagues to remember the similar and very important role that our \nambassadors play. That important role is advancing our national \nsecurity and foreign policy interests. Our embassy teams serve on the \nfront line of the United States of America. Our Foreign Service \nofficers and embassy personnel literally put their lives at risk each \nand every day.\n  It was just in 1998, in Tanzania, in Kenya, that a number of our \nembassy staff were killed in the al-Qaida attack. They paid the \nultimate price for freedom.\n  The Constitution gives us responsibility, it gives us a critical role \nin the appointment of ambassadors. But the advise and consent power is \nnot only a right of this body but it is a responsibility of this body. \nAs I have said many times before, I take that responsibility very \nseriously. In this time of war, America needs to have full diplomatic \nrepresentation abroad. We are at war. We need to be represented fully \nabroad.\n\n  The nomination of John Negroponte is pending today, and hopefully \nshortly, we will be voting on his nomination. I have had the \nopportunity to visit with him recently and to grow to know him over the \nlast several years. I think there is no individual more qualified to \ntake on that difficult task--and we all know it is going to be \ndifficult--as Ambassador to Iraq. Ambassador Negroponte has served this \ncountry for over three decades. He is one of the most qualified \ndiplomats to ever serve this Nation. He has been confirmed by this body \nseven times before.\n  On June 30, as we all know, the Coalition Provisional Authority turns \nover Iraqi sovereignty to the Iraqi people. We have seen it play out in \nthe last several days, the last several weeks. It is a difficult time \nin Iraq. It is perhaps the most critical moment in the fight to bring \nfreedom to that war-torn nation.\n  As we all know, Ambassador Negroponte will be charged with \nimplementing those policies in Iraq. He will be responsible for leading \nand protecting a team of over 1,700 embassy personnel.\n  It is a critical time of conflict in Iraq and indeed throughout the \nMiddle East. It is in this critical time that we need Ambassador \nNegroponte at his post as soon as possible. The future of Iraq depends \non our ability to make good decisions right now.\n  As Chairman Lugar pointed out, we have a number of other nominations, \n30 nominations pending on other important posts, right now pending \nthroughout Europe, throughout the Middle East, in Africa and throughout \nthe world. I hope with the final confirmation today of Ambassador \nNegroponte we can open up what would be a floodgate to these other 30 \nnominations.\n  It is not the time to make political statements on either side of the \naisle as an excuse for holding up these nominations. The risks are too \ngreat at this moment in history. I strongly urge my colleagues to \napprove Ambassador Negroponte shortly, and all of the other pending \nnominations as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the issue of the \nconfirmation of the nomination of John D. Negroponte to be ambassador \nto Iraq.\n  I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. During my short time in \nthis esteemed body, I have had the opportunity to listen to, to engage \nin conversation, and to question Ambassador Negroponte on a number of \noccasions. He is an extraordinary man to whom this Nation owes a debt \nof gratitude for his service in the past and whose confirmation should \nswiftly be approved so he can continue with the distinguished career he \nhas in Government.\n  His Government career started in 1960 at the age of 21 when he \nentered the Foreign Service. He has 37 years of experience at the \nDepartment of State. He has clearly played a leadership role in \nAmerican foreign affairs. That leadership is needed today and certainly \nhe can bring that skilled leadership to the challenges he will face as \nAmbassador to Iraq.\n  He has served on four continents at the highest levels. Of course, he \nis serving as Ambassador presently to the U.N., Permanent \nRepresentative of the United States to the United Nations. He served \nthis country five times in ambassadorial positions, including \nAmbassador to the Philippines, Ambassador to Mexico, Ambassador to \nHonduras in 1977, in 1979 as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for \nOceans and Fishery Affairs, with the rank of Ambassador. His service to \nthis country covers an extraordinarily wide spectrum of regions and \nfunctions. He has received numerous commendations, including two \nPresident's Meritorious Service Awards, an honorary doctorate from \nAdamson University in the Philippines, the Homeric Award from the Chian \nFederation, and on and on.\n  He truly is an extraordinary man. He brings the right vision for what \nAmerica needs in Iraq. His vision of the role of ambassador is \ndifferent from what we have now with Ambassador Bremer. Whereas the CPA \ntoday is the ultimate political authority in Iraq, the Embassy will be \nin a supportive, as opposed to a commanding, role. He understands and \nbelieves a U.S. mission will support democratization and rule of law, \neconomic reconstruction and security and counterterrorism.\n  He believes the U.N. role does not come at the expense of United \nStates influence or interests but, rather, the efforts will be \ncoordinated and complementary. That is what we need in an ambassador. \nThat is the nomination we have before the Senate. I hope there is\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\na resounding voice of support from this body. It sends out the right \nmessage to the world as to the kind of individual we want working with \nthe government of Iraq after the transfer of sovereignty on June 30.\n  I am thrilled Ambassador Negroponte is willing to continue his \nservice, a difficult service. He brings the right skills to the task. \nThe skills certainly are needed.\n  These are challenging times in Iraq. There is no question about that. \nIn those times of challenge, oftentimes in this great free land of \nours, folks have different opinions and different perspectives. Those \nare often played out in the Senate or in the House Chamber on the other \nside of this magnificent Capitol Building.\n\n  With dissent come tough, probing questions that make our Nation \nstronger, make it freer, and democracy more durable. I have great \nrespect for those who dissent, to offer a different perspective than \nme. Certainly the challenge in Iraq, the war in Iraq is evoking a great \ndeal of concern in different perspectives. There is a lot of 20/20 \nhindsight. It is easier to be a critic. But dissent is not a validation \nof one's position. On the contrary, one can be just as easily wrong in \ntheir dissent as they may be right.\n  I will say while American lives are on the line, those who dissent \nmust choose the moments to determine whether their dissent will help \nmake this Nation stronger or freer or if it will undermine the very \nfoundation of what holds us together.\n  I said it before and I will say it again, these days we are observing \na mixture of Monday-morning quarterbacking, in some cases, political \nopportunism, exaggeration, which threatens to deprive us of perspective \nand resolve when we need it the most.\n  There are challenges in Iraq. We are all reeling over the photographs \nwe saw of the treatment of some prisoners in an Iraqi prison. It is not \nwhat America is about. We rejected that. The President rejected it. The \nmilitary has rejected it and will hold those responsible.\n  At the same time, as we speak today, men and women are still in \nuniform fighting for freedom, fighting against terrorism. This \nPresident, our President, did not ask for a war on terror. September 11 \nhappened. We have come to understand that no longer could we escape \nterrorism, that our shores did not protect us, that we had to be \nvigilant. We had to resolve and take the battle to the enemy. We have \ndone that.\n  War is never pretty. War is never something clean and concise. At \ntimes, bad things happen. Lives are lost. But in this case, we should \nnever forget the underlying purpose. The underlying purpose is America \nis in a war on terrorism.\n  There are people who hate us because we enjoy freedom, because we \nrespect freedom, because of who we are, because of what democracy is \nall about. There are folks who will go to great ends to make sure \ndemocracy never takes hold in Iraq, who will do everything they can to \ndestabilize what we are trying to accomplish, to make it not happen.\n  But Americans have understood--even if we disagreed on the original \npurpose of going in, et cetera--that when our men and women in uniform \nare in battle, we stand with them.\n  I have grown fond of Teddy Roosevelt, for many reasons, because of \nthis, one of my favorite quotations:\n\n       It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out \n     how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could \n     have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is \n     actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat \n     and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short \n     again and again, because there is no effort without error or \n     shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great \n     devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause. . . .\n       Let me reiterate the worthiness of the cause we have \n     undertaken.\n\n  This morning, like many of my colleagues, I awoke to an article in \nRoll Call in which one of the Members of the Democratic minority in the \nHouse has decided that comments he made in private should be trotted \nout to be heard by the entire world.\n  His comments were that the war in Iraq is ``unwinnable.'' In private \nconversation those words are troublesome enough, but his willingness to \nallow those comments to be put in the public domain for partisan \npolitical purposes is not only outrageous but it is indecent.\n  Over the course of the last several days, we all have been horrified \nby the images of prisoners being tortured in Iraqi prisons. They are \nshameful, they are reprehensible, and they should make all of us who \nare fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters say this is not what \nAmerica is about. And we have said that. There are not enough apologies \ntoday to be given to the Iraqi people for that, but we have done that.\n  But today, as American blood is shed in the cause of freedom and \nliberty across the world, a Member of Congress' utterances of a war as \n``unwinnable'' does not just demoralize American soldiers, I fear it \nemboldens America's enemies.\n  Imagine being on a sports team that is losing badly to their opponent \nand hearing one of the leaders of the winning team all of a sudden say \nthe game is unwinnable for them, even though they control almost every \naspect of the game.\n  To those thugs and monsters who killed with Saddam and now kill \nwithout Saddam, the ``unwinnable'' jersey on their back has just been \nput on ours by a Member of Congress. I find that so troublesome.\n  Every day in Iraq, and in most of the country in Iraq, things are \ngoing on in which people are getting their lives together. Their \nschools are operating and their hospitals are operating. The city is \noperating, with a city council. Twenty-some million people are going \nabout their lives. There are areas in which there is conflict, but the \ncountry is operating, is moving forward. Oil production is back to the \nway it was, just about at prewar levels.\n  There are 130,000 American soldiers there, and they are doing great \nthings. When you talk to them, when you talk to the folks who come \nback, they tell you morale is high. They believe in the mission. When \nan elected Member of the Congress stands up and says, ``I don't believe \nin the mission. We can't win the mission,'' something is wrong--not \nwith the mission, not with those who are putting their lives on the \nline, who believe in the mission. Something is wrong with uttering that \nkind of statement.\n\n  Shameful. Outrageous. It demands the collective condemnation of all \nof us that we should give comfort to the enemy because of those seeking \nto score partisan political points.\n  There is an election coming up on November 2. We all know that. There \nis no way to avoid it. But because of that, it does not mean we put \ngood common sense behind us. It does not mean that everything that goes \non gets caught up in a political perspective and a political battle to \nmake points for those who are for or those who are against.\n  There is one thing about this country that I have always believed and \nI have always seen: that in times of difficulty, America comes \ntogether. I think what has been so uplifting about what we have seen in \nregard to the situation in Iraq is that, though there may be debate \nover the nature of the policy, there may be debate over a range of \nissues, there has been little or no debate about what our young men and \nwomen are doing in Iraq and how well they are doing it and how proud we \nall are of their courage, of their fortitude, of their commitment. To \nundermine that in any way, to talk about it being unwinnable, is \nsomething that I find difficult or impossible to fathom.\n  It is time this awful language of defeatism in our Nation's Capitol \ncomes to an end. It is time America comes together, as we do in times \nof war, to stand with our men and women on the front line, to stand \nwith those who are willing to give the ultimate sacrifice--and many \nhave--and to say to them: We appreciate what you are doing. We \nappreciate your commitment. We appreciate your service. We appreciate \nyour courage. And we know that America will prevail. We know that \njustice will prevail. We have faith. We have faith in what you are \ndoing and your ability to get it done. Shame on those who would say \notherwise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4972]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are here this afternoon debating the \nnomination for the position of Ambassador to Iraq, the nomination of \nAmbassador-nominee Negroponte, a career diplomat who probably has as \nlong and good a record in the United States as any person who has \nserved in our Foreign Service.\n  He started in 1960 representing the United States. He has had an \namazing array of important posts, including being Ambassador to the \nPhilippines and Honduras and Mexico, and serving in a variety of other \ninternational organizations.\n  I hope, at the conclusion of our debate today, the Senate will, in \nfact, confirm the nomination of Ambassador-designate Negroponte.\n  We need the very best in Iraq. It is a challenging situation. There \nis no doubt about that. We need somebody of his caliber there. I am \ndelighted the President has found it possible to find such a good \nperson to be the first ambassador to this newly freed country. I hope, \nas I said, we will be able to confirm him quickly and that he will be \nable to assume his post.\n  I think a lot of the Members have found this as an opportunity to \ndiscuss the larger issue of the war in Iraq and how it is going and \nparticularly in light of the events of the recent days regarding the \nrevelations of the treatment of certain prisoners in Iraq. I think it \nis appropriate we all reflect on that, but I also think it is important \nwe keep it in perspective.\n  I just gave a radio interview in which the questioner asked questions \nthat suggested maybe the wheels were coming off the wagon, that the \nentire effort might not be worth it; that one of our colleagues in the \nHouse had indicated that maybe we are losing the war and we ought to \nrecognize that right now.\n  I want to focus a little bit on that because, as we have a new \nambassador about to assume the position there, he might rightly ask the \nquestion, What am I getting into here if we are about to lose a war? \nAnd the question is, Are we? And, of course, the answer is, No, we are \nnot. I think it would be well for Americans to stop and think before \nthey talk in those terms because the mere discussion of the issue in \nthose terms gives solace and encouragement to our opponents.\n  Unlike a war that we fought in the past--you could choose your \nexamples--this war on terrorism includes components that have a lot to \ndo with psychology, with what the enemy believes he can accomplish \nusing asymmetric force against far superior forces of the allied \ncoalition. Therefore, it is important what the enemy reads into what we \nare saying about the war ourselves. That is why, in effect, the floor \nof the Senate and the media are other fronts in the war.\n  When we ask what we can do to help our troops, one thing we can do is \nthink clearly about this and speak in a constructive, positive way, \nwhich is not to say we should never express disagreement with each \nother or with the administration or offer constructive suggestions \nabout what to do better. All of that is fair game in a democracy and \nmakes us what we are and makes for a better conduct of any kind of \noperation, including a military one. But there is a way to do it that \ndoes not give encouragement to the enemy.\n  When you begin to suggest that because of what a very small handful \nof Americans did to some Iraqi prisoners, that it somehow suggests we \nare losing the war, we have gone way off track. I realize most people \nare not saying that. I hope they don't. That is the kind of expression \nthat will be the beginning of the end of our effort to conduct the \nhearts and minds part of this war on terror which is almost in some \nrespects as big a part of it as is the military conquest we were so \nsuccessful in achieving in Iraq.\n  How should we be conducting ourselves? We are part of this war \neffort. We are not carrying a gun. But people listen to what we have to \nsay. The terrorists take away from what we say either encouragement or \ndiscouragement.\n  I return to the memo we intercepted from a fellow by the name of \nZarqawi. He was sending a memo to his fellow terrorists connected with \nal-Qaida saying: We have a real problem here. The Americans are winning \nin Iraq. They are defeating our brothers, and we need more allies. We \nneed people to pour into Iraq to assist us. I fear we are losing the \nbattle because we can't get enough help and the Americans are too \ntough. They are winning the country over, and before long they are \ngoing to have a new government set up here and we will have lost this \neffort.\n  That was this terrorist's assessment of the situation. I like that \nassessment. What it shows is the planning and execution of our military \neffort and the followup of the military effort after we took Baghdad \nand had conquered the country, that that has largely succeeded. For \nmost of the country we know it has.\n  We have two pockets of significant resistance with which we are \ndealing. There the tension is between going in and doing collateral \ndamage or trying to negotiate, which is what we are being urged to do \nby people on the ground, Iraqis who, after all, are making a point that \nthey might have some idea about how to do this since they know the \nfolks involved and it is their country. They are going to have to take \ncare of this in the future. So we are paying attention to what they \nsuggest. We are trying to walk a careful line in dealing with these two \nsituations.\n  But by and large, the point is, the country has been pacified. There \nhas been so much constructive accomplished there in terms of getting \nthe country's infrastructure back to work, getting oil production \ngoing, getting the schools and hospitals back up to speed, all of the \nother aspects that have begun to return the country to normalcy, that \nwe tend to forget all of the good and tend to forget that the security \nof the country has largely been obtained when we see on the nightly \nnews only one thing and that is the latest explosion that killed either \nan American soldier, perhaps, or innocent Iraqis, because a lot of the \npeople who are being killed are Iraqis themselves. That is the bad \nnews.\n\n  Notwithstanding the news that we get all of the time, the terrorists \nare saying: We are about to be beat here because the Americans and the \nother allies have been able to marshal the military power to subdue our \nbrothers. Without new reinforcements, we are likely to lose this \nbattle.\n  That is a nice assessment. It gives us encouragement that if we \ncontinue on this path, we will prevail. We have a strategy laid out to \nturn authority over to the Iraqis to govern themselves on June 30 and \nproceed to have elections in the country next January. Hopefully, we \nwill continue to consolidate the security and so on. We are aware of \nthose things.\n  Therefore, it is especially distressing when people who are important \npeople in America, perhaps elected officials, speak out on television \nand suggest that, because of these most recent events, somehow we can't \nwin this battle; We can't win this war; We can't continue to \nconsolidate the gains we have made, continue to provide security, \ncontinue to help in the reconstruction of the country, and continue on \nthe path of turning it over to the Iraqis so they can freely govern \nthemselves.\n  Let's take each of those points. First, no one in America condones or \nin any way expresses anything but disgust for what we have seen on \ntelevision and what we have been reading about. It is un-American to \ntreat people the way these Iraqi prisoners were treated. It doesn't \nmake any difference what they might have done. Americans don't do that.\n  The President today, in meeting with King Abdullah, publicly said he \nwas sorry for this. He was also sorry that a lot of people in the world \nwould take this incident as manifesting what Americans and America are \nall about. He said that bothers him, and it obviously bothers all of us \nbecause we know that is not what we are about. The question is, This \naberration, as it has been described, should that in any way suggest to \nus that we can't win this conflict? I fail to see a connection.\n  I understand that among a lot of Arabs and, frankly, the rest of the \nworld, including in the United States, people are appalled. But anyone \nwith an open mind who has any understanding of the United States and of \nAmericans understands that this is not\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\nthe way Americans act and, in point of fact, that we have a system \nwhich encourages reporting of such incidents and which immediately \nensures that the perpetrators will be dealt with in an appropriate way.\n  It is my understanding--and we will find out a lot more about this as \ntime goes on--that the day after the report of the incident the inquiry \nbegan which resulted in military action, court-martial action being \ntaken against several of these perpetrators, and subsequent to that, \naction has been taken against several people and that there are some \nthat are still pending to be resolved. It is also my understanding that \nwithin the same month of January, a command had already been set up to \ninvestigate whether this was endemic or widespread, whether it really \nwas an aberration and, to the extent that it demonstrated that there \nwere flaws in our system that permitted this to occur, that they be \nfixed, and that things have been implemented to ensure this will not \nhappen again.\n\n  I suspect as we are briefed on all of this we will learn a lot more \nof the detail, and we might be more comfortable with the way the \nmilitary has handled this. This is what America is all about.\n  There is some fault, not only for the people who actually did what we \nhave seen but also for the way it was handled. What I regret is that \nmany in the political world have tended to focus on this. I would hope \nthat opponents of the President would not seize upon this to try to \ngain partisan advantage. It is something that reflects on the entire \ncountry. It is not a Democratic or Republican kind of issue.\n  There have already been calls for the resignation of Secretary \nRumsfeld. This, obviously, would not help the President politically, \nbut is it appropriate? The Secretary will be presenting open testimony \ntomorrow before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He will tell his \nstory. Until he does, I think it would be wise for people to withhold \ntheir judgment. Since we have not even been briefed on the issue--and \nthat is one thing people complain about--would we have a right to call \nfor somebody's resignation before we have even heard what they had to \nsay or been briefed? Is that an American way to do things or is it an \nexpression of partisanship?\n  I suggest to the extent it might be the latter, people should hold \ntheir fire and wait until the facts come in, and we can discuss this in \na nonpartisan and a constructive way rather than a way that might be \nmisread by our enemies, because the more this kind of criticism occurs, \nthe more the enemy may take from it that America is divided and we no \nlonger have the commitment or the will to see this conflict to an end; \nthat therefore if they continue to try to nip away at us the way they \nhave been, they will be able to drive us out, and they will have the \ncountry left to them to resume the kind of rule that Saddam Hussein \nexerted in that country for decades.\n\n  We cannot allow that to happen. I think there is a legitimate \nquestion about when the people in the policymaking part of the \nGovernment--and that includes the Assistant Secretary, Secretary of \nDefense, National Security Council, the President, and Vice President--\nbecame aware of things like the existence of photographs and other \nthings which, if made public, would certainly significantly detract \nfrom our effort. These policymakers would clearly have understood that \nis the kind of thing that can undo countless hours of good work by \nthousands of military and non-military personnel in the country. Just \none incident like this can undo all of the good that literally hundreds \nof people do.\n  We have all seen the acts of kindness as well as bravery by our \ntroops. We have seen soldiers helping kids in school--saving a little \nchild in one case and a woman in another case--from being in the line \nof fire, one of whom had been wounded. There are countless Americans \nacting unselfishly and, frankly, selflessly, putting themselves in \ndanger to help Iraqi people. That is a message that obviously needs to \nbe conveyed, but all of that is, in a sense, forgotten the minute you \nhave an incident like this, especially with the photographs showing \nthis.\n  I can understand how someone who committed these atrocities, \nunthinkingly, would have no idea about how this might affect the entire \nwar effort when it becomes known, but people higher up certainly would \nhave that sense. It was important that they get this information so \nthey could then decide what to do with it. Undoubtedly, in America, \nordinarily, we understand that the best way to deal with bad news like \nthis is to deal with it in an open, honest fashion. I suspect that had \nwe been able to do that, a lot of the outcry here might have been \naverted. That might have been included in briefing Members of Congress. \nBut if the Secretary of Defense didn't even know of the existence of \nthe photographs, it is kind of hard to brief Congress about it.\n  I suggest that the bottom line on this point is that we find out what \nthe facts are by asking the people directly. Let's stop condemning them \npublicly and calling for their resignation and stop assuming facts we \ndon't know.\n  During a radio interview that I just had, the questioner asked me \nabout a certain situation. I said: I don't know that to be true. Do \nyou? He said: No, but that is what we have heard. Let's see what the \ntruth is, and we can act in a calm, compassionate, and firm way with \nthose who did wrong.\n  My final point is that in the fog of war a lot goes wrong. Individual \npeople make bad judgments. Americans are just as prone to that as \nanybody else. There is a lot of pressure and emotions run high, and it \nis certainly possible for people to do wrong. One of the candidates for \nPresident this year talked about atrocities he committed, or saw \ncommitted, in another war in our history. It happens. It is not right, \nand people should be called to account for it when it happens.\n\n  But let's remember, too, that everything in war is not coming up \nroses every day, and that there will be days of bad news. If you stop \nto think about World War II, for example, or about Korea, or any other \nwars we have fought in, you can find some very bleak days, days when \nAmericans were being pushed off the Korean peninsula, days when we were \nbeing pushed off Omaha Beach, or times when we were making no progress \nand were taking thousands of casualties on the Pacific islands. Our own \nprisoners were horribly mistreated, and there must have been a sense \nthat this may not be worth the effort.\n  Americans understood the stakes and we persevered. In war there are \ngoing to be times that are bad. We understood that. Sometimes they are \ncaused by enemy action and sometimes by mistakes we ourselves might \nhave made. This is one of those times when we have a real problem \nbecause of mistakes that Americans made. But we have the capacity as a \nNation to correct those mistakes if we will do that in a constructive \nway. That is the key. But if we do it in a partisan way, in a \ndestructive way, we will only play into the hands of our enemies, who \nare looking for that kind of signal so they can succeed in their \neffort.\n  As we conclude debate on the nomination of a critical position at \nthis time in our history, the ambassadorship to Iraq, it is good to \nreflect on these issues. The Ambassador will have a very difficult job. \nI hope as we consider his nomination and how to support him when he \nassumes this role, we will all agree it is important to do so in a \nconstructive way, always giving him our best judgment, but not \nundercutting him with premature judgments or actions that might be \nconstrued as political and might be misunderstood by our enemy.\n  If we conduct ourselves in that way, I am confident that, despite the \nfact there will be days we feel very challenged in this country and, as \nthe President said, things we are very sorry for, nonetheless, because \nof the kind of people and Nation we are and the values and principles \nfor which we are fighting, we will in the end prevail, and we will \nprevail not only to the benefit of Americans and our national security, \nbut for the cause of freedom of people throughout this world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding the \nnomination of Mr. Negroponte to be the Ambassador to Iraq.\n\n\n                        The Republic of Georgia\n\n  Before I speak on that, I want to draw the attention of my colleagues \nto something that happened, on a very positive note, in the Republic of \nGeorgia, one of the former Soviet Union\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\ncountries. It was reported today that one of the breakaway regions, \nAjaria, has voluntarily come back into Georgia. The people have thrown \nout, vanquished kind of a local thuggish dictator, Aslan Abashidze, who \nhad ruled this region for about 10 years. Thousands of Ajaris are now \nout in the streets, bringing Georgia back together, throwing out this \nguy who had been really a ruthless local, small-scale dictator in the \nregion, and bringing the people back together of Georgia.\n  This doesn't get the publicity of Georgia's ``rose revolution'' of \nlast November, but the people are rising up and saying they want \ndemocracy, they want to be part of this country. We need a change in \nleadership. They have done it by nonviolent means. It is inspiring to \nread about and to see that has taken place and that the Georgians who \nwe are working with and supporting are getting this done. A number of \npeople celebrating this victory are waving Georgian flags and American \nflags. A number of places in the world would not be standing free if it \nweren't for us, and they appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, now speaking on Iraq and Mr. Negroponte's nomination \nto the position of Ambassador of the United States to Iraq, he is an \neminently qualified individual. I have worked with him in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. He worked in Central America, and he has been our \nrepresentative in the U.N. He is the exact type of person we need to \nhave in the region. He will take us from being the occupying power to a \nsupporting role and not a governing role in Iraq. He understands that \nin a great way. Mr. Negroponte has great relationships around the world \nand he is a very wise man. I think he will do an excellent job for us.\n  We all lament what has taken place in the Iraqi prisons and the \nproblems and images that created. But more than the moral outrage this \nhas generated, these terrible acts by a few do a great disservice to \nthe men and women who have already lost their lives in the effort to \nfree Iraq and help the people of Iraq to govern themselves.\n  I had a closed town hall meeting with soldiers at Fort Reilly. They \nhad recently returned from Iraq--about 300 Army men and women who had \ncome back and served for an extended stay in Iraq. To a person, they \nwere positive about the events that have taken place overall in Iraq. \nYes, there have been problems and, yes, this is war. But they would \ntalk about helping the children; they would talk about opening schools; \nthey would talk about power services being brought back to levels \nhigher, to pre-Saddam levels in that country. They would talk in \nglowing terms about what they are getting done on building a free, \nopen, democratic Iraq.\n  Yes, problems, yes, difficulties, and, yes, lost American lives. We \nhave had 37 people stationed at Fort Reilly killed in this conflict.\n  We have had a number of Kansans, as there have been people from all \nover the Nation, who have given their lives for the freedom of the \npeople of Iraq and security for the people of American. We should not \nlet the actions of a few do disservice to so many who have given their \nlives in this great and worthy cause.\n  The damage done to our credibility in Iraq and the Middle East is \ngoing to be difficult to rebuild, but we must do that in earnest. \nPeople must be held accountable, especially those in the chain of \ncommand with direct control over the prison system. Perhaps it is time \nthis prison that has such a terrible legacy in Iraq in the Saddam era \nsimply be closed, torn down, and never used as a prison again.\n  Let's keep in mind why we are in Iraq. I met with Jalal Talabani. He \nis one of the key leaders of the Iraqi Governing Council. He is a \ngentleman with whom I worked over the years as we moved forward in this \ncountry to confront the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.\n  Let me give a very brief history lesson. He was involved in the Iraqi \ncoalition, the diaspora. Actually, he is from the Kurdish part of the \ncountry, so he was in country. He has been involved in that group for \nsome period of time seeking the United States to come forward and \nsupport the liberation of Iraq.\n  I remind my colleagues, in 1998, we passed the Iraq Liberation Act \nwhich called for regime change in Iraq. That was signed into law by \nPresident Bill Clinton who supported it. Mr. Talabani was involved in \nthat effort from the outset. The Kurdish region has self-governance and \nhas had it for the past 10 years and is doing remarkably well. He \nreminded me of a poll recently taken by CNN that had the Kurdish people \nsupporting America and George Bush by over 95 percent and thankful for \nwhat is taking place, the liberating of their country and their region.\n  He also said this to me: It is shameful to us that we as Iraqis are \nsitting down and not taking on the role of governing and security \nwithin our country while American soldiers are being killed.\n  He said: It is our duty--the Iraqis' duty--to fight the terrorists, \nand we must do this as soon as possible.\n  I agree, exclamation mark, and we have to move in that direction. For \nyears, the people of Iraq suffered under the brutal dictatorship of \nSaddam Hussein. There will be a trial sometime soon, hopefully this \nyear, of Saddam Hussein. The world will see the atrocities, the \nhundreds of thousands of people buried in mass graves as a result of \nthis man's rule.\n  Yet few--except for some countries in the region, Kuwait and Israel--\ndare to denounce Hussein for what he did to his own people. Especially \nthose countries we call our allies in the Middle East, Egypt and Saudi \nArabia, have failed to assume the moral leadership to tell about the \nSaddam Hussein regime. We stepped into this void to do what others were \nunwilling to do. We did so grudgingly because going to war is never an \neasy decision for any country, particularly for America.\n  Even before the Iraqi war resolution in 2002, we spent years \nsupporting the passage of one resolution after another at the U.N. to \nmake clear that the Iraqi regime was an outlaw regime condemned by the \ninternational community. We engaged the American people. After a \nthorough debate in the Senate regarding the risk, this Congress \noverwhelmingly voted to give the President the legal authority to go to \nwar in Iraq. We decided as a nation we did not want America to \ncompromise its moral authority by avoiding the demands of leadership. \nWe sought freedom for the Iraqis and for that freedom to spread \nthroughout the Arab world, and we desired security for Americans.\n\n  It is a heavy burden. At critical moments in world history, we have \nnot hesitated to carry this burden places far from home. Wherever we \nwent, our men and women in uniform inspired others, bringing hope and \nfreedom to millions.\n  I can quote a young man from Union Town, KS, who died in Afghanistan. \nI talked with his mother about his death and his service. He died at 21 \nyears of age. His mother said: He e-mailed me home, and he said:\n\n       I would rather die for a cause than of one.\n\n  How better do we summarize it than that? He put his life on the line \nso others in Afghanistan, on the other side of the world, can be free.\n  On the interrogations, I understand interrogations are necessary in a \nwar against a merciless enemy. But we have a long and honorable \nmilitary tradition that is certainly not reflected in the photos from \nthe Iraqi prison. Let's be guided by the moral courage to acknowledge \nour mistakes and to change what needs to be changed, and we will, and \nthat is our pledge to the world. We need to behave better, be more \nhumble, and understand that the war in Iraq, and the broader war on \nterrorism, is also a war of ideas and values.\n  Those who threaten our soldiers, our diplomats, and even ordinary \nAmericans, as happened on 9/11, believe in hateful ideas. We do not \nagree with those ideas. We need to help the people of Iraq and others \nin the Middle East understand this war of ideas; that it is not \nsomething we can do for them, they must do it for themselves. Only the \npeople of Iraq and the millions of Arabs who yearn for freedom can do \nthat.\n  We must continue in our effort to give the Iraqis self-rule and free \nelections. These are our aspirations for the Iraqi people, and they are \ntheir aspirations as well. It is up to them to have the courage to move \non, to realize these aspirations in a free nation that will bring \ndemocracy to their country and to the Middle East.\n  We have in Ambassador Negroponte the chance to start a new chapter. \nOn\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\nJuly 1, sovereignty will pass to the Iraqis. Ambassador Negroponte has \nenormous responsibility, and judging by his background, I cannot think \nof anybody better qualified to do this.\n  In his capacity as the Ambassador to Iraq, I know he understands his \nrole to be fundamentally different from that of Ambassador Bremer. \nWhereas the CPA is the ultimate political authority in Iraq, the \nEmbassy will be in a supportive, not commanding, role. His role is to \nprovide support in democratization and rule of law, religious freedom \nand tolerance, economic reconstruction, and security and \ncounterterrorism. His mission will be to further cooperation with the \nU.N., the international community, and independent Iraqi electoral \nauthorities, and all aspects of election preparation, which is critical \nfor elections for a transitional national assembly, no later than the \nend of January 2005.\n  He will need to assist the U.N. in establishing an independent \nelectoral commission, an electoral law, and a political parties' law, \nencourage Iraqis to establish effective governing institutions in \nBaghdad and the provinces, as well as a myriad reconstruction efforts. \nThis will be a critically important area because he will be responsible \nfor holding these projects to the highest standards of financial \naccountability. He has the responsibility to the American people that \nthe money for Iraq will be spent without waste and fraud, and in this \ncontext, he will need to encourage Iraq's new leaders to choose sound \neconomic policies and enforce high standards of integrity in public \nadministration.\n  Ambassador Negroponte will also need to play a key role in building \nand strengthening the capacity of Iraqi security services to deal with \nboth domestic extremists and foreign terrorists so that they patrol and \ndeal with terrorists in their country and our troops are garrisoned. He \nshould continue to bolster the role of a robust multinational force, \nbut mostly build up the Iraqi force.\n  Finally, he should make sure the role of the U.N. does not come at \nthe expense of U.S. influence or interest, but rather the efforts be \nwell coordinated and complementary.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has a big job. He is up to it, and I support \nhis nomination to be Ambassador for the United States in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 80 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are on the Negroponte nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today in full support of the \nPresident's nominee to be our first ambassador to the new Iraq, \nAmbassador John D. Negroponte. This is the most important nomination \nfor an ambassador that we have considered in several decades.\n  This moment is historic.\n  We are asked to approve the President's choice for an ambassador to a \ncountry whose previous leadership was an enemy to America, to its \nneighbors and to its own people. That dictatorship, the brutal and \nbloody regime of Saddam Hussein, was removed by force, by a coalition \nof nations led by this country, in a military campaign where we still \nface, every day, bloody resistance from the remnants of Saddam's \nBa'athis regime, his criminal associates, and the international \njihadists who have joined forces with the tattered remnants of the Arab \nworld's bloodiest regime.\n  We are engaged in a conflict we cannot, and will not, lose and the \nPresident has shown that our military determination is matched by our \npolitical determination to return this country to its people, beginning \nwith the opening of an American embassy on July 1 of this year.\n  That we are providing our advice and consent on this ambassadorial \nnomination demonstrates that this President is dedicated to returning \nsovereignty to the Iraqi people. Under the President's direction, \nAmbassador Bremer and the Coalition Provisional Authority, working with \nthe international community, now represented by U.N. Special Envoy \nLakhdar Brahimi, have listened to Iraqi leaders and are holding to the \ndeadline of June 30 for the transfer of authority.\n  That transfer of authority and the return of sovereignty require that \nthe U.S. political presence be transferred from the office of the \nadministrator, held by Ambassador Bremer, to a U.S. embassy, to be led, \nif this Senate approves, by Ambassador Negroponte.\n  Jerry Bremer and John Negroponte are two of the finest diplomats ever \nto serve this country. Their contributions throughout their careers \nreveal skill and dedication that will set the standards for our \ndiplomatic corps for generations to come.\n  I truly hope that Ambassador Bremer, when his historic mission is \nover with the CPA, will continue to play a leading role representing \nour country to the world.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has represented our country to the world on \nmany fronts, serving as ambassador in the Philippines, Mexico and \nHonduras. Most recently he has served as permanent representative to \nthe United Nations, where he has been as our ambassador since September \n18, 2001.\n  There are those who charge that this administration has been unduly \nunilateral, caustic to coalition-building, and dismissive of \nthe diplomacy necessary to winning the war on terrorism that erupted on \nour land on September 11, 2001.\n\n  Frankly, that charge, now becoming a theme in a campaign year, leaves \nme baffled.\n  It reveals deeply flawed thinking, and deeply flawed perception.\n  Diplomacy cannot be measured by outcomes as expected by the \nmultilateralists. This is a definition of diplomatic success that \nbecomes a euphemism for subjugating national interest to international \nveto.\n  The citizens of Utah reject this thinking, and they are correct. And \nI believe the rest of the country does as well.\n  If diplomacy cannot be measured by multilateral consensus, it should \nnot be shunted by unilateral arrogance. To suggest, as many on the left \nseem to do these days, that this administration has ignored diplomacy \nis to, in my opinion, ignore the facts.\n  This administration has been, in my opinion, extraordinarily engaged \nin the international community.\n  No President since the founding of the United Nations has been as \nrespectful, solicitous and encouraging of the United Nations as has \nPresident Bush. That he has done so without ever sacrificing the \nfundamental sovereignty that rests in our Constitution makes him no \nless remarkable for the very public appeals he has made directly to the \nUnited Nations.\n  On November 10, 2001, fewer than 2 months after the most catastrophic \nterrorist attacks on our homeland in the history of the Republic, \nPresident Bush traveled from Washington to speak before the U.N., where \nhe recognized:\n\n       The United Nations has risen to this responsibility. On the \n     12th of September, these buildings opened for emergency \n     meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council. \n     Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood \n     condemned by the world. And I want to thank you for this \n     strong and principled stand.\n\n  Less than a year later, on the day after the first anniversary of \nSeptember 11, President Bush traveled from the White House to address \nthe General Assembly again, where he declared:\n\n       The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the \n     authority of the United Nations, and a threat to peace. Iraq \n     has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of \n     defiance. All the world now faces a test, and the United \n     Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council \n     resolutions to be honored and enforced, or cast aside without \n     consequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its \n     founding, or will it be irrelevant?\n\n  The President answered the question:\n\n       The United States helped found the United Nations. We want \n     the United Nations to be effective, and respectful, and \n     successful. We want the resolutions of the world's most \n     important multilateral body to be enforced.\n\n  Critics of this administration have declared that our doctrine of \npreemption, not a doctrine new to this administration, is incompatible \nwith a desire for international consensus.\n  This is simply not true.\n  For a nuanced perspective, may I recommend a review of none other \nthan Secretary General Kofi Annan's words,\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\nin his address of October, 2003 before the General Assembly? In that \nspeech, he was expected to denounce the doctrine of preemption. But \nwhile he stood by the principle of collective action enshrined in \narticle 51 of the U.N. Charter, he recognized, as the honest man he is, \nthat states which were threatened had to respond, and that if the \nUnited Nations were to retain its legitimacy in the 21st century, it \nwould have to develop mechanisms to promptly address the threats of \nthis new century.\n  In my view, this was a recognition, by the Secretary General of the \nUnited Nations no less, that in dealing with Iraq, 12 years and 14 \nresolutions without resolve could not be the way the United Nations \nretained its relevancy in addressing the security challenges we face \ntoday.\n  In that same week, President Bush addressed the General Assembly yet \na third time. And I note that no President of the United States has \naddressed the General Assembly three times in one term. He declared:\n\n       The Security Council was right to be alarmed about Iraq. \n     The Security Council was right to declare that Iraq destroy \n     its illegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The \n     Security Council was right to vow serious consequences if \n     Iraq refused to comply. And because there were consequences, \n     because a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace, and \n     the credibility of the United Nations, Iraq is free and today \n     we are joined in the General Assembly by representatives of a \n     liberated country.\n\n  John Negroponte, as ambassador to the United Nations, stood by the \nPresident during those three historic addresses to the international \ncommunity.\n  Today, the President has chosen our current ambassador to the United \nNations, John Negroponte, to be the first U.S. ambassador to an Iraq \nliberated from tyranny.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has worked with the United Nations through this \nmost historic of times. During this time, he worked closely with U.N. \nSpecial Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi on supporting Afghanistan after our \nforces deposed the Taliban. Ambassador Brahimi's efforts to guide the \ntransition in Iraq from the Coalition Provisional Authority to \nsovereignty under an interim government has, as my colleagues know, the \nsupport of President Bush and his administration.\n  Ambassador Negroponte understands this. In his statement before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, he said:\n\n       The prospect of legitimacy that the United Nations can \n     bring to the process of political reconciliation is a point \n     of crucial interest in both the region and the broader \n     international community. With an expanded United Nations role \n     in the political arena, I believe that it will be easier to \n     generate the international support that the successful \n     rehabilitation of Iraq requires. Secretary General Annan's \n     and Ambassador Brahimi's contributions may well open the door \n     to creative thinking about ways in which the international \n     community, as well as the Coalition, can further contribute \n     to the process of rehabilitating Iraq, both politically and \n     economically.\n\n  I want to be clear that a vital United Nations role does not come at \nthe expense of the United States' influence or interests. Our efforts \ncan be well coordinated and complementary; there is ample evidence \nacross a broad range of situations that a strong partnership with the \ninternational community, including the United Nations organization, is \nin our strategic interest.\n  I hope my colleagues recognize that in supporting this nominee, we \nare supporting a man of exceptional experience, a man who represents \nthe best thinking by this administration on the challenges we still \nface in Iraq. He is also a very good man, a good father, a good \nhusband. He is an example to us all.\n  Let us be honest: The challenges in Iraq remain large.\n  Our engagement there is historic, and our commitment to support this \nengagement until we achieve success must remain strong.\n  As all of my colleagues, I have been shocked by the reports out of \nAbu Ghraib prison in the past weeks.\n  I have been shocked and I have been disgusted.\n  I join the people of Utah, and the good citizens throughout this \ncountry, in expressing how appalled we all are at the barbarous acts we \nhave witnessed. In the prison that Saddam Hussein used to torture \nIraqis, a few Americans have engaged in acts that demean Iraqis and \nbesmirch the honor of Americans in uniform.\n  Every day, members of the American military are risking their lives \nin Iraq, in order to bring about a better society for the Iraqi people.\n  In combat, American military, the best trained in the world, have, \ntime and again, exercised restraint of force in order to minimize \ncivilian casualties. Sometimes that restraint has resulted in \nincreasing the risk to our soldiers. That a handful of American \nsoldiers committing brutalities in one of Saddam's reclaimed prisons \ncould occur is worthy of all of our outrage--not least because we are \nproud of the honor and decency and sacrifice offered by the vast \nmajority of our military in Iraq everyday.\n  We must expose what went on in Abu Ghraib prison. We must conduct \nfull investigations, and follow those investigations wherever they \nlead. Those who committed crimes must and will be held accountable. \nRespect for the Iraqi people demands this, as does respect for the \nhonor of all Americans in uniform, and all Americans who support them.\n  The security situation in Iraq is still hostile. We face enormous \nchallenges, challenges we will meet. We have learned in recent days \nabout the President's request for appropriations to fund our historic \nmission. This will lead to further debate, as it should.\n  Our duty as legislators is to render democratic scrutiny to the most \nimportant issues before this government.\n  If you want to support the transition to the first stage of Iraqi \nsovereignty, as the President has committed to do by the end of June, \nif you want to support continuing our appeal to the international \ncommunity to join in the historic cause of rebuilding Iraq, and if you \nwant to support this President, as he asserts his constitutional \nprerogative to conduct diplomacy at this most critical time in the \nhistory of our foreign policy, you must support his superb selection of \nJohn D. Negroponte to be the first Ambassador to an Iraq free of \ndespotism.\n  He is certainly going to have my vote. I have met him in various \nnations around the world. I have seen him in action in diplomacy. I \nknow what a brilliant man he is, I know what a good man he is, I know \nwhat a fine man he is, I know what a good family man he is, and I know \nwhat he has meant to the diplomatic corps in this country, and I know \nwhat he has meant at the United Nations.\n  I support him fully, and I hope every other Senator in this body will \nsupport him as well. There may be some who do not, but if they don't, \nthey just plain do not know the man.\n  This is not an easy position. This is a position which will take a \ngreat deal of courage, a great deal of diplomacy, a great deal of \ncommon sense, a great deal of genius. This is the fellow who can \nprovide all that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President. I do appreciate the opportunity to \ndiscuss my very good friend, John Negroponte, in support of his \nnomination to be the United States Ambassador to Iraq. John and I have \nknown each other since 1977 with his appointment as Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State for Oceans and Fisheries Affairs with the rank of \nAmbassador. Because he handled several fisheries negotiations of vital \ninterest to my state, John was a frequent visitor to Alaska. In 1978, \nJohn negotiated a breakthrough agreement with the Government of Japan \nwhich provided crucial protection for Alaskan salmon stocks from \nJapanese high seas fishing fleets. This agreement provided countless \nbenefits to the Alaskan fishing community which endure to this day.\n  I have also had the pleasure of working with John in his subsequent \nassignments: as Ambassador to Honduras; as Assistant Secretary for \nOceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, as \nAmbassador to the Philippines and more recently as U.S. Ambassador to \nthe United Nations. In each situation, I was able to witness\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\nfirst hand his ability to manage large and complex diplomatic missions \nand to observe his effectiveness and sensitivity in dealing with his \nforeign counterparts.\n  Educated at Yale, he speaks five languages fluently--something that I \nconsider a true asset for this position.\n  I believe President Bush, on the recommendation of Secretary of State \nPowell, has chosen extremely wisely and well in his selection of John \nto be our Nation's representative in Iraq. I also believe that at this \npoint in time in our Nation's history, it is vital to have John at the \nhelm in Iraq--we will need his expertise to help guide us through the \nnext few months. I can tell you without any question, this man is one \nof the most distinguished public servants that I have had the honor of \nknowing and serving with. I know his family and I know this man.\n\n  With the unfortunate development we have recently had in terms of the \nconduct of some of the people involved in the prisons in Iraq, I am \nconfident that John Negroponte is the man necessary to be there, in \nIraq, to represent our Government. He will represent us well, and we \nwill be very well served by his confirmation.\n  I urge the Senate to quickly confirm John Negroponte as our \nAmbassador to Iraq. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, may I inquire of the time allocation for \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I request permission to use 5 of those minutes and be \ninformed when 4 minutes have been used of the time allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, like you, I sit on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and I reviewed the nomination of this experienced diplomat, \nour U.N. Ambassador, John Negroponte. I, too, both in the Foreign \nRelations Committee and on the floor, will have voted for his \nconfirmation.\n  I do that, acknowledging, however, there are legitimate questions \nthat can be raised about previous concerns in his tenure as an \nambassador in Honduras, and human rights violations which are so \nimportant in the context of some of the things that are of great \nconcern to us today.\n  But more troubling to me is the context in which this confirmation is \nactually being considered.\n  The reality is, once again we are doing something on the fly. We are \nrushing to confirm an ambassador to maybe the most important choice and \nrole we have. In and of itself, it is indicative of the crisis we have \nin Iraq--frankly, the mess Ambassador Negroponte will be walking into.\n  If the administration--I am very troubled about this--sticks with an \narbitrary, artificial June 30 deadline, Ambassador Negroponte's job \nwill begin in less than 2 weeks with little or no definition about what \nhe will be doing. There are no secure or thoughtful political or \nsecurity plans in place. We do not know who will be making those \njudgments, how those people will be chosen, their role, or what the \ntrue definition of sovereignty in the context of this June 30 transfer \nwill be all about. We do not know how they will be selected. We do not \nknow what the role of the Ambassador will be with regard to those \nindividuals. It is very unclear what sovereignty means.\n  By the way, put into the most dramatic terms today, what is the role \nof the new ambassador with regard to what is happening to the prison \nguards? Who will be responsible for that? Sovereignty questions are \ntotally unclear. We still do not have a structure for our forces and \nhow they fit in and what we do going forward and what is the \nrelationship with the United Nations.\n  This is a real problem. We continue with failed and confusing \npolicies. They are true with regard to the U.S. Ambassador. But they \nreflect the basic incompetence we have seen with regard to our crippled \noccupation from the start, some might even say our crippled war from \nthe start, because we executed this with real questions about what the \njustification was with regard to weapons of mass destruction in \nrelation to al-Qaida. We have continued it with poor planning, or no \nplanning, with regard to the occupation that has been in place.\n  Right from the start, there were questions about what the force \nstructure needed to be on the ground. We have heard over and over again \nthe warnings General Shinseki gave us, several hundred thousand troops, \ndismissed out of hand by the Pentagon. The administration has refused \nto talk about the cost of this occupation and what the cost to the \nAmerican people will be, aside from the tragedy of the loss of life. \nWhen there have been predictions, they have been so far off base it has \nmade no sense in the context of reality.\n  The administration promised or thought we would be greeted as \nliberators. We have been anything but that. Seventy percent of the \nIraqi people believe we are occupiers. There has been serious \nresistance with the insurgency. By the way, history would have shown \nthat would be the indication that would occur in the Middle East. But \nwe dismissed every single outside expert, Member of Congress, who might \nhave raised any questions about it and emphasized we had a coalition of \nthe willing that was anything but a serious coalition.\n  Ninety percent of the cost, 90 percent of the troops, 90 percent of \nthe effort, or more, were all American. It is an American occupation. \nThe administration continues with these failed policies. As we go \nforward, I certainly think we see it very clearly in the lack of \nclarity with regard to this tragic situation we see now with regard to \nthe administration of prisons and detainees. The fact is, no matter \nwhat we do, every time the administration executes one of these \npolicies, there is a flip-flop.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The idea that we were not going to have the U.N. \ninvolved; now we have the U.N. involved. We were going to have de-\nBaathification; and then we have reentry of Baaths. The issue of \ndeployment of troops.\n  I am supportive of this Ambassador, but it is high time we get a \nconsistent, thoughtful policy that is vetted with more than a few, \nnarrow interests inside the Pentagon and maybe inside the White House. \nWe need to have a real discussion about the direction of our policies \non occupation and transition of political power and sovereignty. It is \ntoo costly.\n  In the context of this series of events that all Americans are \nrepulsed by, we need to stand back and say it is time to be thoughtful \nand fully vet the kinds of policies we are going to put in place \nbecause this is a long-term project.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to talk briefly about Ambassador \nJohn Negroponte and support his confirmation to be the United States' \nfirst ambassador to the free and democratic Iraq. Not only will he be \nthe first ambassador to the free and democratic Iraq, but he will be \nthe first ambassador to Iraq since the first Gulf War in 1991.\n  Ambassador Negroponte is one of the most experienced diplomats in the \nState Department. His experience is necessary for this job because he \nwill be assuming one of the most challenging and important positions \nthe State Department has ever had.\n  Throughout his career in the State Department, Ambassador Negroponte \nhas been stationed at eight different posts covering most parts of the \nworld. While he has not been previously stationed in the Middle East, I \nhave no doubt in his ability to handle the task ahead. His experience \nrepresenting the United States at the United Nations since September 11 \nand serving in nations like Vietnam and Honduras during periods of \nturmoil will guide him during Iraq's transition to democratic self-\ngovernment.\n  Many challenges lie ahead for Iraq, including holding orderly \nelections, establishing government bodies, reconstructing \ninfrastructure and the economy, and securing the country. The United \nStates will be a partner for Iraqis throughout the coming challenges.\n  Critical to the successful transition to a sovereign Iraq is the \nparticipation of the international community. Ambassador Negroponte has \nearned respect among his colleagues while representing the United \nStates at the United Nations. He will do a fine job\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\nworking with other nations to help Iraq flourish under the rule of \nIraqis.\n  In summary, I believe President Bush has made a fine choice in \nnominating Ambassador Negroponte. I support his nomination and \nencourage my colleagues to swiftly confirm him to this vital position.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof John Negroponte to be our U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. When he takes his \noath of office, Ambassador Negroponte will be our first ambassador to \nIraq since the Gulf War of 1991.\n  I have had the pleasure of meeting with the ambassador many times \nover the last 3 years. He was a member of the Foreign Service from 1960 \nto 1997 and he is currently serving as the U.S. Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations. His leadership there has been \nexemplary as he has provided our country with a strong voice and a \npresence at the United Nations that has been vital during these \nextremely difficult times. His experience at the United Nations gives \nhim a great deal of insight into the thinking of the international \ncommunity that will be invaluable in his new role in Iraq.\n  Soon Iraq will be welcomed back into the family of nations and the \nrights and freedom so cherished by the people of our nation will become \na part of daily life in Iraq. Given our history in the region, I am \ncertain my colleagues understand the wisdom of appointing an \nexperienced diplomat with an informed opinion and a vision for the \ninstallation of a new government and the birth of a new nation of Iraq.\n  During our consideration of Ambassador Negroponte's nomination, I \nhave heard some of my colleagues express their concerns about recent \nevents in Iraq. That is understandable, because these are concerns we \nall share about this sensitive region of the world. We must not, \nhowever, allow those legitimate concerns to be politicized and used as \na club against the President and his efforts to stabilize Iraq and \nintroduce democracy there. Our soldiers' lives are on the line and we \nowe them every consideration while they are in harm's way.\n  Before anyone says I am being overly sensitive to the rhetoric of a \ncampaign year, let me share with you a few of the details about what \nhappened during a trip I took in April when I was able to visit wounded \nU.S. soldiers at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Before \nwe met them, I was anticipating they would need some encouragement and \nwe should try to lift their spirits after all they'd been through. The \nopposite turned out to be the case. They encouraged me and strengthened \nmy spirit and resolve to see this through to the end. Every one of \nthem, these brave men and women, said to me--``We are making a \ndifference in Iraq. We know the people there. We know our job. We are \ndoing our job and the people are responding to what we are doing. We \nare making a difference and we want to go back there with our comrades \nso we can finish the job.''\n  I don't believe anyone knows better than those who are serving on the \nfront lines--those actually doing the work and living the dangers of \nlife in a war zone every day. We have made a difference in Iraq. We \nhave removed a brutal dictator from power and we are working with the \nIraqi people to build a nation based on democracy and freedom. We are \ncontinuing to make a difference every day in the schools we help to \nbuild and operate, in the infrastructure we continue to improve and \nrepair, and in the sovereignty of the people of Iraq which continues to \ncommand our deepest respect. We will continue to make a difference \nthrough democratization and the rule of law, economic reconstruction, \nand security and counterterrorism. By supporting all these areas, our \ndiplomatic, civilian, and military personnel will make a lasting \ndifference in the lives of the Iraqi people and they will, through \ntheir efforts have literally changed the world.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will remember that when we speak here on the \nSenate floor, our words are heard by those brave men and women \noverseas. Our words are heard by their families and their friends who \nmake it possible for them to serve our Nation so well. They are also \nheard by our enemies who look to twist and distort our open discussions \nto make it appear that we have lost our will to see this through to the \nend. We must remember that fact each time we speak. If you wonder how I \nknow if what I say is true, I can share my sources with you--our U.S. \nsoldiers. They have asked me more than once: How come everything sounds \nso bad back home when it is improving in Iraq? We keep hearing this \nrhetoric which is based on the fight to win a presidential election, \nand it has nothing to do with what is happening in Iraq. Nonetheless, \nit has an impact on the morale and safety of our troops.\n  I have spoken here on the Senate floor about the importance of \nsupporting our troops. I noted that we must remember to pray for our \ntroops. When we do, I think we should also be praying for the \nopposition as well. We should pray that the hearts of those we fight \nwill soften, and they will realize the role they are playing in the \nworld and in Iraq. It is not too late for them to join us in the effort \nto build a better Iraq for all its people. Praying can make a \ndifference, and it is up to all of us to do that every day. It is \nsomething we can do that is real and it has real power. With our faith, \nand our belief in our cause because it is just, we will continue to \nprovide the brave men and women who serve in our armed forces, their \nspouses and their families with the support and encouragement they need \nand deserve by keeping them in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  We also need to pray for those few soldiers at Abu Ghraib whose \nactions were severely misguided as well as those who suffered the shame \nand humiliation of those acts. I have heard many speak today about \ntearing down this prison facility, and that is a good idea. Let's rid \nthe world of this terrible prison and do it completely so that it will \nnever house or harm another Iraqi.\n  I hope that people in the United States and throughout the world will \nremember that these deeds do not represent the character of any but a \nfew misguided American soldiers. This should not be the image that the \nworld has of our troops because it is not the truth. I am pleased that \naction is being taken immediately to address this situation. Charges \nare being levied, investigations are continuing, and changes are being \nmade to the prison administration. We are blessed to have a truly \nexceptional military force whose image should not be tarnished by the \nactions of a few.\n  We have a job to finish in Iraq and we must not shy away from \ncompleting it. The more rapidly the people of Iraq are able to stand on \ntheir own, the sooner our troops will be able to come home. We have \nundertaken a job, and we cannot afford to fail to complete the task at \nhand.\n  I have often heard it said that exceptional times call for \nexceptional people to lead us through them. We must have someone in \nIraq who is able to fully represent the United States at the time the \nCoalition Provisional Authority transitions out of the country. As the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee stated this morning, we \ncannot expect to wake up the morning on July 1 and have a fully \nfunctioning U.S. Embassy. The time to plan for that day is upon us and \nI encourage my colleagues to join me in taking the first vital step by \nsupporting Ambassador Negroponte's nomination. With the confirmation of \nthis exceptional individual, we will ensure that we have a strong U.S. \nvoice on the ground and the right person in charge who will show the \nworld the level of our commitment to Iraq. It will also underscore our \ndetermination to make life better for Iraqis for generations to come. \nIt is a dream we share with the Iraqi people and, with the right people \nin charge, it is a dream that will come true.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to express my great admiration of \nour brave Montana servicemen and women in Iraq, Afghanistan and \nelsewhere in the world. These brave men and women have put their lives \non hold and on the line. Their families and their communities--our \ncommunities--support them. These Montanans and all American soldiers \nare in our thoughts and prayers. We want them to come home quickly and \nsafely.\n  We need a plan to bring their mission in Iraq to conclusion. And we \nneed the administration to communicate that strategy clearly to the \nworld, and to our brave troops.\n  I am deeply troubled by the allegations of abuse of Iraqi prisoners. \nI was\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\nhorrified by the images we have seen over the last week. Our nation, \nwhich our men and women are serving with such honor, must lead by \nexample if we want to win the global ``war of ideas''.\n  Although we know the vast majority of our men and women in uniform \nare serving honorably, these allegations of abuse demonstrate that we \nare not giving our troops all of the support that they need.\n  These images of prisoner abuse are not at all consistent with the \nprinciples I know our men and women in the Armed Forces hold clear. Our \nmen and women went to Iraq to protect this Nation, to make the world a \nsafer place. They have performed admirably under harsh conditions, \nsometimes with insufficient equipment, because they believe in their \nmission. I believe in them and I will continue to make sure that they \nget the support they need.\n  What our troops need now more than ever is visionary leadership. They \nNeed to know what their mission is and when that mission has changed. \nThey must be trained for that mission and given all of the resources \nthey need for it, be it body armor or bottled water.\n  In order to win the war of ideas and make the world safer, we must \nshare our vision of how to win the global war on terrorism. Sharing the \nvision to win means building effective, lasting partnerships with not \njust other countries and governments, but international institutions. \nThe whole world benefits from a stable Iraq. The U.S. needs to work \ntogether with other nations to share the risk and responsibility U.S. \nforces face today.\n  Sharing our vision of how to win the war on terrorism also means \nensuring exemplary leadership for every private first class in the \nUnited States armed services. We want to ensure that the unconscionable \nactions of a few misguided soldiers do not endanger the mission of the \nthousands who work day in and day out to fulfill that vision.\n  This is why I supported the President's nomination of Ambassador \nNegroponte to be Ambassador to Iraq. This administration must \ndemonstrate that it has not only the determination but also the vision \nto win the war on ideas that the war on terror truly has become.\n  Now is the time when we must share our vision with the troops who \nserve with dignity and honor, with the American people and with the \nworld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair how much time \nremains on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 5 minutes and the majority \nhas 60 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in a moment I will ask for a quorum call \nand then shortly after that, ask unanimous consent all time be yielded \nback and we proceed to the question on Ambassador Negroponte.\n  For the moment, having given a clear signal, I suggest the absence of \na quorum and ask the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are about to vote. I had an opportunity \nto speak earlier today. Let me conclude and then yield back whatever \ntime remains by saying Mr. Negroponte is a serious diplomat with \nsignificant experience. When he appeared before our committee, he \nimpressed me that he was more likely to be straightforward and \nunequivocal in answering our questions.\n  I will end where I began. I quite frankly think we owe him and his \nwife a debt of gratitude for being willing to take on what, without \nexception, in my view, is the most difficult and, at this moment, most \ndangerous job in U.S. diplomacy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Mr. Negroponte, notwithstanding that \nthey may feel, as I do, that this administration's policy on how to \nhandle the circumstance in Iraq has been seriously wanting.\n\n  Do not confuse the lack of a coherent policy, from my perspective, \nanyway, with a lack of competence and ability of Ambassador Negroponte. \nI urge a yes vote on Ambassador Negroponte.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate again the assistance of the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Biden, and, for that matter, all members. Many of the members \nof our committee, of which the distinguished Chair is a member, have \nspoken today, and have indicated they plan to support John Negroponte, \nas I will.\n  I think one reason why the committee has this feeling is that we \nappreciate the fact he has been forthcoming in response to our \nquestions. He understands the gravity of the situation and its \ncomplexity. He does not have a doctrinaire point of view, but clearly \nrecognizes the political realities in Iraq, in this country, and in our \ninternational relations.\n  As a part of his responsibilities at the United Nations, even as we \nspeak, he is working with other nations on behalf of the best ideals of \nour country, and is attempting to bring to the people in Iraq the full \npossibilities that might come from much more intense and favorable and \nconstructive relations with the United States and its allies.\n  I was impressed in our hearing with Ambassador Negroponte, that he \nhas been there many times before, in the sense of very difficult \nsituations, tortuous circumstances, dangerous predicaments, ways in \nwhich he had to work with the elements of whatever administration he \nserved, that may or may not have agreed with his point of view, but at \nthe same time, through his experience and the gravity he brought to the \nissue, he was persuasive and effective.\n  Finally, I conclude by saying John Negroponte is not any more certain \nthan Senator Biden or I am of precisely what is going to happen day by \nday in Iraq. It is a day-by-day story. And that is not all bad, in the \nsense that sometimes we make improvements day by day. Sometimes we are \nable to listen to the evidence, try to take a look at the rest of the \nworld, talk to other people, consult more broadly.\n  But the fact is, I believe Ambassador Negroponte is prepared to \nconsult. He is prepared to talk. He is prepared to open up. He is \nresponsive to our committee, to the Senate and, I believe, to the \nCongress and, therefore, through us, to the American people, the people \nwe serve.\n  The final point I want to make in this debate is I believe Members of \nthe Senate are not unreasonable, I believe members of our committee are \nnot unreasonable, in asking for discussion and consultation during \nthese very difficult times, because the support of all of us--Democrats \nand Republicans, Americans--is going to be required.\n  I appreciate, on very short notice, the preparation for the hearing \nof the Ambassador. But I had the feeling he did not need much notice; \nthat, as a matter of fact, he has been thinking about these issues for \na long time. His responses indicated a degree of both maturity but, \nlikewise, willingness to listen that I found very appealing and \nreassuring.\n  I encourage Members to vote for him so he might proceed to his \nduties.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the \ntime available on our side and ask that the Chair pose the question.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof John D. Negroponte, of New York, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and \nPlenipotentiary of the United States of America to Iraq.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, today the Senator from Nebraska and I are \nintroducing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I will read it because I \nthink it is appropriate at this time, when all of us are tremendously \nfrustrated about what has gone on in a certain Iraqi prison.\n  Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Abu Ghraib prison must be \ndemolished to underscore the United States' abhorrence of the \nmistreatment of prisoners in Iraq.\n  Whereas the Abu Ghraib prison was used by Saddam Hussein to execute \nand torture thousands of men, women and children;\n  Whereas Saddam Hussein and his Special Security Organization oversaw \nthe execution of thousands of prisoners;\n  Whereas Abu Ghraib prison is notoriously known as a death chamber by \nthe Iraqi people;\n  Whereas the Abu Ghraib prison is arguably the largest and most feared \nprison in the Arab world;\n  Whereas it is widely known that one of Saddam's sons, in one day, \nordered the execution of 3,000 prisoners at the prison;\n  Whereas the recent reports of the atrocities and abhorrent \nmistreatment of Iraqi prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison are un-\nAmerican, do not represent our values, and have sent the wrong message \nabout the United States intentions in Iraq;\n  Whereas the American people will not tolerate the mistreatment of \nIraqi prisoners;\n  Whereas the American people view this prison as a symbol of evil, and \nwhere past cruel torture and mistreatment occurred;\n  Whereas the American people would like to rid the world of this evil \nplace where past and, unfortunately currently reported mistreatment has \noccurred;\n\n  Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate \nthat the Abu Ghraib prison, also known as the Baghdad Central Detention \nCenter, be completely demolished as an expression and symbolic gesture \nthat the American people will not tolerate the past and the current \nmistreatment of prisoners.\n  We are offering this sense-of-the-Senate resolution today because we \nbelieve it is a profound and clear expression of the American people's \nconcern and it is a sense of this Senate that we do not accept the \ntreatment that has gone on there of Iraqi detainees.\n  I yield the floor now to my colleague from Nebraska for a similar \nexpression, and I send this resolution, as proposed, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague from Idaho for this \nopportunity to express our outrage at the behavior of Saddam's henchmen \nand for the disgust we have for what some misguided soldiers apparently \ndid in conjunction with the trust they had imposed on them in \nconjunction with prisoners.\n  We cannot erase what has been done. We can apologize for it. We can \nexpress our outrage. We can say to the American people and to the \npeople of the world, this is not our way and we do not condone it, but \nwe cannot change it and we cannot erase it. I think what we can do is \nmake the broadest statement we possibly can symbolically by leveling \nthis prison.\n  It seems as though the demons of the Saddam regime carried on in the \ndisguise of Americans who under ordinary circumstances would not have \nbeen conducting themselves in this way.\n  I do not believe in those ghosts, but I do believe the message that \ncan be sent is a very strong one: We do not condone this kind of \nbehavior. The very behavior we went to eradicate needs to be eradicated \nonce again. Those who are criminally responsible must be held to the \nletter of the law, and those who are responsible in the chain of \ncommand must also be held to the highest standards of our military.\n  I think we can say to the Iraqi people more than we are sorry, which \nwe are, more than we wish it had not occurred, that we stand with them \nto eradicate this kind of behavior once and for all, at least in that \nprison. Perhaps symbolically it will help all recognize this kind of \nbehavior is unacceptable anyplace in the world.\n  I have traveled with my colleagues to various parts of the world, to \nSouth Korea, the Baltics, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and those photos do \nnot represent those men and women who serve our Nation honorably or \nshare the values we Americans hold dear.\n  This prison was the tool of a violent, repressive regime. It is as \nmuch a symbol of Saddam's regime as the statues honoring him throughout \nIraq. It is even more so in many respects because it represents the \ntruth of what his rule was. Just as those statues were torn down, so \nshould this prison be torn down. This place has become a symbol of \nabuses and atrocities first under the regime and now sadly with the new \nacts committed by our troops. We need to make a clean start. What \nhappened in that prison is not American. It does not represent our \nvalues, and we need to let the rest of the world know in the most \nvisible way possible that these acts which were committed in that \nprison are not the American way and not the way America conducts \nitself.\n\n  We need to make a break from the past. We need to level this prison. \nThe symbol of atrocities, this home of abuses, should stand no longer. \nLet that be our stand, to tear down the prison, to hold those \naccountable who have engaged in such activities as we have held Saddam \naccountable, and let us move on so we can say to the people of the \nworld, this is a new start, a break from the past. Let us join with the \nIraqi people in building a new Iraq, one that is founded not on the \nabuses\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\nof Abu Ghraib but on the hope for tomorrow. We can share the values \ntogether to eliminate abuse, to eliminate these atrocities and to set \nthe record straight for the rest of the world.\n  I yield back any time to my colleague from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his support of this \neffort.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is the time \ncontrolled? How is the time yielded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would like to ask a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I probably should not be getting into this because I have \nnot looked at it, but it seems that the sense of the resolution is the \nprison should be destroyed. I do not think it was so much a problem \nwith the prison as it was with people who ran the prison. It is not the \nphysical plant that caused the problem. It is the people who were \nrunning the prison.\n  If we do demolish a prison, are we not going to have to build another \none? It seems to me what we ought to be advocating is not the \ndemolishing of the prison but the replacement of the people who were \nrunning the prison with professional people who understand how to treat \nprisoners.\n  The problem is not the physical plant. The problem is the people \nrunning it. I am sort of concerned if we demolish the prison we are \ngoing to have to end up building another one because we are going to \nhave prisoners who are going to have to be dealt with over there.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Louisiana makes an excellent point. There \nwill be a need for a prison to detain people. This is a very large \ncomplex. It is also phenomenally symbolic of the evil of Saddam Hussein \nwhere within those walls literally thousands of Iraqis were killed. It \nwas known as the death center. Symbolically what we do is very \nimportant. Tragically, what we have done or allowed to happen is very \nimportant. I think what the Senator from Nebraska and I are saying is, \nlet us look at the death chambers themselves and tell the Iraqi people \nthose chambers will no longer stand. I believe that is an important \nexpression. Words are one thing; actions are clearly another. I believe \nsymbolically what we say today, or what the Senate of the United States \ncould say and should say, is important.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, my response to my friend from \nLouisiana is if this had been a prison, I would say let us continue it \nas a prison and change simply the administration, the prison guards. \nBut it was never a prison. It was a place of abuse and atrocity, a \ndeath chamber for thousands and thousands of Iraqi citizens. So it is \nnot a prison, and it never was converted into a prison, apparently not \neven during the time that we have been able to administer it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. With the explanation I think that clears up a great deal \nof my concern, and I intend to support it. I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. How much time is left under the control of the Senator from \nIdaho?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. REID. I yield our 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to this debate by my \ncolleagues. We can join in the debate as to whether the destruction of \nthe building is an appropriate symbol of our shame and outrage at what \nhappened to the Iraqi prisoners. The fact is, after the invasion, this \nSaddam Hussein torture chamber or prison was extensively remodeled by \nthe U.S. taxpayers. Tearing it down will, as the Senator from Louisiana \nsuggests, result in the need to build another at the expense of the \nU.S. taxpayers.\n  If this symbol, though, can move us any closer to expressing our \nsense of outrage and shame to the people of Iraq and to the Arab and \nMuslim nations around the world, then that expense, as far as I am \nconcerned, is money well spent. I am open to that suggestion.\n  I would like to reflect for a moment on the larger issue that has \nbeen raised, not just in this Chamber today but around the world over \nthe last several days. As a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, yesterday I spent several hours in a hearing with \nrepresentatives of our military and civilian agencies involved in Iraq, \nwhere we poured over every gruesome, grisly, sickening detail of this \nabuse of Iraqi prisoners. I cannot disclose what was said in that room. \nWhat I am about to say is based exclusively on those public \npronouncements and things that have been available in the press. I want \nto make that clear at the outset.\n  I will tell you about yesterday. I can't remember a sadder day in my \nservice in Congress than the time I spent in that intelligence room. To \nthink any human being would do that to another person is unthinkable. \nTo think that an American would be involved in that is something I \nnever would have believed. And to imagine that someone wearing the \nuniform of our country would have been in some way associated with that \nactivity is something I would never, ever have accepted. Yet it is a \nreality, and the reality is it was not one isolated incident. It was a \nseries of incidents involving the killing of prisoners, the sadistic, \nwanton, and blatant mistreatment of prisoners, and it is something \nwhich, sadly, this United States of America must face up to.\n\n  I am glad the President of the United States went on Arab television \nyesterday to express his personal feelings about how terrible these \nevents were, and to make it clear that America does not accept this \nconduct. I wish the President had extended an apology to the Iraqi \npeople and all who were offended by this shameful episode. It would \nhave been an easy thing for him to do. It would have expressed a sense \nof humanity and a sense of justice, which we expect of an American \nPresident. He did not. I wish he had.\n  But now we have to ask ourselves how should we, as a people, react to \nthis? I am going to suggest one way we should not react to this. I have \nin my hand a transcript from a syndicated radio program of May 4, by \nRush Limbaugh. Oh, he is well known around Washington, around the \nworld. I want to read what Mr. Limbaugh said in reaction to this \nscandalous episode involving the torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners.\n  His caller, on May 4, asked as follows:\n\n       It was like a college fraternity prank that stack up naked \n     men.\n\n  And Mr. Limbaugh replied as follows:\n\n       Exactly. Exactly my point! This is no different than what \n     happens at skull and bones initiation and we're going to ruin \n     people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military \n     effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because \n     they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired \n     at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, \n     these people, you ever heard of emotional release?\n\n  Rush Limbaugh said in describing the sadistic torture of Iraqi \nprisoners. And then Mr. Limbaugh, in his infinite wisdom, went on to \nsay:\n\n       You ever heard of need to blow some steam off?\n\n  Rush Limbaugh. I am embarrassed that this man, who supposedly speaks \nfor so many people in America and is listened to faithfully by so many \npeople in America, would be so callous, so insensitive as to make those \nstatements. Trust me, they will be repeated, not just on the floor of \nthe Senate, but around the world by our enemies as an indication that \nwe are not taking this seriously.\n  President Bush struck the right note yesterday. We are taking this \nextremely seriously, and we should. The reason is obvious. What \nhappened in those prison cells was a complete breakdown of leadership, \na complete breakdown of discipline. It is clear that some are being \nheld accountable for it already, and the investigation continues. Some \nof my colleagues have come to the floor and said this investigation \nshould go all the way to the top. I will keep an open mind on that \nissue. I want the Secretary of Defense to have his day in court, his \nmoment to explain when he learned of this and what he did about it; \nfrankly, what action he took to avoid this from occurring.\n  But there are several things I think we should keep in mind. No. 1, \nthe men\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\nand women of this reserve unit who were called on to run this prison \nrepresented a military police unit without training in detention and \ncorrections.\n\n  There is never an excuse for this inhumane and barbaric conduct but \nthe fact is, time and again since we invaded Iraq, we have given \nassignments to our men and women in uniform, assignments that they were \nnever trained to do. We have asked them to establish civil order in \nIraq when they were trained to invade and defeat an enemy. We asked \nthem to be traffic cops and university security. We have asked them to \nguard museums. We have asked them to do things that were beyond their \nskill and beyond their training, and this is another example.\n  Second, let me tell you this. We cannot ignore the reality that the \npeople we are still holding in detention, because of the war on \nterrorism, are the next questions to be asked by the world. If this \nhappened in Iraq at the Abu Ghraib prison, what is happening at \nGuantanamo Bay? We have to be prepared to answer those questions. We \nhave to be transparent and open in our treatment of these prisoners, \nand we have to accept the obvious. We have held and detained hundreds \nof people without charge, without benefit of counsel, and without \ncommunication, in some cases for more than 2 years. There reaches a \npoint where the United States needs to either charge these people with \nwrongdoing or release them.\n  We are going to be asked by the world: If Abu Ghraib was a scandal, \nhow are you treating the other detainees and the other prisoners who \nare involved as well?\n  We should accept the reality, too, that what happened in this prison, \nsadly, is going to make our mission in Iraq that much more difficult \nand that much more dangerous for the brave men and women in uniform who \nstill serve our country so well as I speak. It has become a recruiting \nposter, the photos of this abuse and torture, a recruiting poster for \nthose who hate us around the world. Some would say we need to condemn \nit by resolution; we need to tear down the prison. All of these are \nimportant words and important symbols. But we need to do more. We need \nto try to establish bridges of communication and bridges of \nunderstanding with Arab States and Muslim states and the people who \nlive there who, in these images of torture, will believe they see the \nreal United States. That is not who we are. We are a caring people, and \nwe need to demonstrate that.\n\n  Beyond tearing down buildings, can we talk about building things up? \nCan we talk about investing our resources and talents in the United \nStates, to reach out, as the President has asked, in the global AIDS \nfight, to Muslim nations that are struggling, to reach out to \nstruggling countries, Muslim and otherwise, to provide school feeding \nprograms for children, to once again demonstrate to the world who we \nreally are? Blowing up a building is one thing, but building a life and \nbuilding a school and building a health clinic is another. It is clear \nevidence of who we are as an American people.\n  I look at the situation in Iraq today. It is much more troublesome \nthan it was even a week ago. In April, the bloodiest month in this war \nfor America since our invasion, we lost more troops, we suffered more \ninjuries than in any single period. I make it my responsibility to \ntry--and sometimes I cannot--to call every Illinoisan who has lost a \nsoldier. God bless them, every single one of them, so proud of their \nson or daughter, husband, wife, killed in this conflict. And they \nshould be proud. They have served our country. They should be proud of \nthe contribution a member of their family has made to this country.\n  However, this situation is getting perilously complicated and so far \nfrom the resolution we hoped for when we made the invasion of this \ncountry. Our war on terrorism is going to be complicated as well. We \nneed to develop a sound strategy for the Iraqi situation and for our \nwar on terrorism. We need to concede that many of the things that \nseemed so obvious and so easy have failed us so far.\n  We heard predictions early on that the Iraqis would greet us with \nopen arms, move toward democracy, and we would start turning over \ncontrol of the nation to them. It sounded like a great goal. Clearly, \nwe were wrong. It has not happened. It is not likely to happen soon.\n  The administration will ask for more money--$25 billion--to support \nour troops. Although I voted against this war, I will continue to vote \nfor every dollar this administration asks for to keep our troops safe \nand to bring them home safely. We must continue to ask the hard \nquestions: What is the strategy? What is the plan? Where is the \nleadership? How can we bring our troops home from Iraq with a mission \ntruly accomplished?\n  Sadly, today we are further from that goal than we were just a few \nshort days ago. I hope that during the course of the debate on this \nimportant resolution on the scandalous activity at the prison we can \nfind Senators of both political parties coming forward, trying to find \ncommon ground to reach our goal in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I take it we will be voting on a \nresolution with respect to the Saddam prison.\n  It strikes me, what I have just heard in the last few minutes, as a \ntypical copout from responsibility. We hide the deficit. We do not pay \nthe costs of the war. We hide behind all these other things. Now all we \nhave to do is remove the building, and if they cannot be aware of it, \nthey will not care.\n  This thing happened in January. What we have on foot is the exact \n``torture-gate,'' I guess you would call it. From January to May, we \nhave not heard anything about it. This Senator has not heard anything \nabout it. Now we have all of these ``whereas'' clauses, and this is \nwhat Saddam did, and it did not bother us. We did not put in a \nresolution about it. In fact, we went there and spent good money to \nclean it up and we put a prison there.\n  Maybe after we take some responsibility, then maybe this kind of \nresolution would be in order. The first act and the first reaction \nofficially of the Senate is going to be, let's tear down the building. \nThe building is not at fault. It is the people in the building who are \nat fault.\n  I will not be able to vote for this nonsense. I have never seen a \ncrowd that absolutely will not accept responsibility for the war, for \nthe costs of the war, the cost of government, and now the \nresponsibility here. Their first reaction is a lot of ``whereas'' \nclauses about Saddam and nothing about us, other than that is not our \nway of life, and everything else of that kind. Let's find out that is \nnot our way of life by fixing some responsibility in this Government. \nOnce that is done, bring on the ``whereas'' clauses about Saddam's \nprison.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4982-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4982-S4986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENSION OF EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the unemployment \ntrust fund issue that has us basically stalled on Senate business; the \nfact that several weeks ago we had an unemployment benefit amendment \nthat was part of the UC request for amendments to the FSC/ETI bill \ndone, and yesterday it was in the queue to be considered; then after it \nwas actually offered on the floor, after 10 minutes of debate and \ndiscussion, basically the amendment was pulled. Somebody objected to \nscheduling a vote on it.\n  For weeks we have been assuming there was a finite list of amendments \nand it was agreed that this amendment was going to be voted on. I don't \neven\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\nknow that we need to have more time to discuss it.\n  I know now that there are those on the other side of the aisle who \ndon't want to have a vote on it. Maybe leadership will be able to work \nout an agreement to have a vote. But when we have moved toward giving \nthe American people some hope that we were going to discuss \nunemployment benefits in support of those millions of workers who have \nlost their jobs, they find out now there may not be a vote at all.\n  I don't think it is surprising that the Dayton Daily News last month \nbasically said the GOP leaders were still dodging the jobless. That \nnewspaper, in a State with high unemployment, thought we were not doing \nour job here, that those on the other side of the aisle were still \ntrying to dodge the issue. I can tell you we are not getting a vote. It \ncertainly feels at this point in time as if somebody is dodging the \nissue.\n  I wonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or my \ncolleagues in general, have thought about the circumstances of the \nindividuals in this country and the tough times they are facing. I know \nwe see the face of the Iraqi people every night on television. Maybe it \nis too hard to put 1.5 million Americans who are unemployed on the 6 \no'clock news. But they still exist. They, too, are still struggling. \nThey, too, are looking for our support and help.\n  I want to share with you a letter I got from a constituent. It is \nposted to our Web site because we have had so many people responding \nand telling their stories. This one individual from my State said:\n\n       I am a 41 year old, recently divorced, with a 5-year old \n     daughter. I had worked for Nordstrom for over 22 years, when \n     I was suddenly without a job last August, and my unemployment \n     benefits just ran out, which put me into a bankruptcy \n     position. I only have minimal child support and no other \n     income at the moment.\n       I was earning $47,000 annually prior to my job elimination, \n     and had existing responsibilities based on that income, which \n     I can no longer pay since my benefits have been eliminated. \n     Being a single parent with a home and a 5-year-old to take \n     care of, I have never been in a more desperate position in my \n     life.\n       I want to work very badly. However, I have not been \n     successful in getting hired back at Nordstrom or any other \n     company. The IT market has declined, and my job was \n     eliminated due to 7-year restructuring of the IT Department, \n     which included the company's initiatives and achievements in \n     job elimination and head count reduction. Their objective was \n     to bring in contractors from India and use offshore \n     outsourcing IT services as well. In fact, for the last 3 \n     years, I have had to work with the offshore folks from India \n     that took the place of hundreds of my fellow employees who \n     were laid off over the last 7 years.\n       I don't understand how a company or a Government can say \n     that they are compassionate for the climate, but create it by \n     having Americans eliminated and replaced by foreign workers \n     in the U.S. workplace.\n\n  My constituent says:\n\n       If the benefits are not reinstated, then I will have to \n     seek getting other assistance until something comes up. All \n     the jobs I have applied for, I have either not been called \n     back, am under qualified, or over qualified.\n\n  This shows the humor of my constituent:\n\n       Most of the time, there are no numbers to follow up on, \n     since they are handled via an automatic online HR recruiter. \n     So I am not even sure if there are real people out there \n     really looking for someone to fill a position. I have between \n     2 and 3 viable job opportunities per week that I apply for. \n     So far, I have been interviewed only 5 times. At the time of \n     my unemployment, I thought it would only be a temporary \n     position. However, the jobs are just not out there and I am \n     required to make at least $30,000 annually, even after my \n     bankruptcy, to maintain my home and my daughter's day care \n     responsibilities.\n       I live in a small house that was built in 1947 and pay \n     roughly $1,100 in monthly payments on the mortgage. My car is \n     15 years old and in need of repair. My average bills are \n     $2,000 a month, which are hard to keep up with, health care \n     being so expensive. I don't want to lose my home, since that \n     would not be in the best interest of my daughter. Besides, I \n     don't think I could get much cheaper rent than what my \n     current mortgage is. My property is my retirement.\n       I am scared to death that I won't have anything to fall \n     back on after working this hard for the last 26 years of my \n     life. I don't quite understand why I can't get the extended \n     benefits until there are more jobs available, or at least \n     until the Government puts an end to the outsourcing of jobs \n     to foreign countries. I have even pursued reeducation to a \n     different field, but was told that I made too much income \n     last year, and it would take a cost of $10,000 for retraining \n     in the health care field.\n       Now, without unemployment benefits, because my benefits \n     have been exhausted, a student loan would not be funded. Do \n     you have any suggestions how I can get food stamps or aid or, \n     in the meantime, how I can find any kind of time line when we \n     might actually get a vote? I don't understand why the \n     President would not want to help his own first, before those \n     suffering in other parts of the world.\n\n  I think that letter sums it up. This is not somebody who hasn't been \nin the workforce. She was in the workforce 20 some years. This is not a \nperson who didn't have skills and didn't help her company actually try \nto modernize and improve productivity. She did that. It is not somebody \nwho is sitting around not trying to find a job. She is doing that, too. \nAs she clearly stated, she cannot find a job. So now she has been \nforced into a bankruptcy situation, is being threatened with losing her \nhouse, all because we are sitting on the Federal unemployment benefit \naccount of $13.3 billion and basically saying, even though this is a \nfund paid into by employers for this very purpose, in strong times of \neconomic downturn, we are not going to give her the assistance.\n  We are going to pass a FSC/ETI bill instead and give other tax breaks \nto a whole bunch of things--$2 billion for a green bond initiative that \nI say still probably will end up getting used for a Hooters Restaurant. \nThere is over $2.8 billion in here for another incentive program, a \ncredit for synthesized coal, which is a tax credit that is under \ninvestigation by another Senate committee--$2.8 billion. That is \nroughly the cost of what it could take to extend the unemployment \nbenefit program for another 6 months--a little more than $5 billion. \nYet we are very comfortable today in making a decision to give all \nthese tax cuts and tax breaks away, but we are not going to help the \nAmerican workers with a fund they have paid into. We are going to hold \nthat hostage as some sort of mark against our deficit, when it is a \ntrust fund they have paid into and, instead, we are going to pass a \nbill called a ``jobs'' bill without actually taking care of people that \nhave not gotten the support.\n\n  I am amazed we are in this situation. I think the Dayton paper had it \nright. People are dodging the jobless. They are dodging this issue.\n  Let's talk about the specifics. There are 1.5 million Americans who \nare certainly without help and assistance. This is 1.5 million \nAmericans who, as of December 31, exhausted their benefits such as the \nconstituent I just mentioned. They are going through the same situation \nshe is going through. They are trying to figure out, now that the State \nbenefits have expired, and there are very few jobs created--certainly \nnot in a fast enough time period--that they are going to have to be \nlike my constituent; they are making very tough choices. Because we \ndon't see those choices on the 6 o'clock news doesn't mean they are not \nhappening.\n  Let's look at some of the toughest parts of the country that have had \nto deal with this issue. You can say maybe not every State is in this \nsituation. Certainly different regions have been hard hit. Certainly \nthe Midwest has.\n  This chart shows the number of people in these States that have \nexhausted State benefits. They are still unemployed and they would be \nhelped by our Federal program. They would be helped by the $13 billion \nthat exists in a Federal account--if only this body and the other body \nwould say, yes, you can have access to it.\n  Illinois has almost 70,000 people, who are like the constituent I \nread a letter about, who need help and support. In other parts of the \nMidwest, Michigan has 66,000; Ohio, 42,000; Pennsylvania, 69,000, \nalmost 70,000 workers who qualify for health and assistance.\n\n  I do not even know that these people understand that the debate on \nthis proposal is being considered. I know many of my constituents do \nbecause they write to me all the time. These are not invisible people, \nand their problems are not invisible. In fact, the Presiding Officer's \nState of Texas has 95,000 exhaustees. That is the number of people in \nthat region of the country. In my part of the country, the Northwest, \nwe have one of the hardest hit economies, the highest unemployment \nrates for the last several years. We have 33,000 people who would \nqualify right now for this program if this body would just say yes.\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\n  What we really want to say is we know that job growth is going to \nhappen. In fact, last month there were 300,000 jobs created. The bottom \nline is, we have lost over 2 million jobs, and it takes a while to \nrecreate them. By that I mean it takes a while for the economy to \nrecover.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Analysis says it will take several \nmonths more of robust growth to whittle down the number of unemployed \nto a more typical size. The truth is, I think a lot of people are \nsaying: Oh, well, gosh, Friday we will have new numbers. Maybe we will \nhave another 300,000 jobs. Maybe we will have another 500,000 jobs, \nmaybe another 600,000 jobs created. To me, it does not matter if there \nare 600,000 jobs created in the month of April. It simply does not \nmatter if we have 1.1 million people who have already exhausted their \nbenefits.\n  Even if we have 600,000 jobs created in April, we will still have a \nmillion people who will not have access to the benefits they deserve. \nTo me, it is an issue of what are we going to do to sustain the economy \nwhile we are waiting for the job creation engine to restart.\n  A lot of people say: Oh, gee, the economy is actually getting better; \nproductivity has gotten better. My constituent helped her company be \nmore productive. Guess what. That, I am sure, added to the bottom line \nof that company. It probably added to the bottom line that got passed \non to shareholders. But did it help my constituent actually get a job \nor get a new career? No, it did not. She is not asking for us to give \nher a job. She is only asking for what she and her employer already \npaid into, an account that was created for these tough economic times \nonly to get some of those funds in the interim until new job growth and \nnew job availabilities are out there. I do not think it is an \nunreasonable request.\n  Some people have said: If you have 1.5 million people, and they have \nexhausted their benefits, what is the rate by which those people will \nactually find jobs? The Joint Economic Committee and the Center on \nBudget and Policy Analysis came up with a formula. Basically, they said \nabout 3 percent of those 1.5 million people would find a job each week.\n  Some people say: Maybe we will think about unemployment benefits for \n7 weeks. Maybe we will say let's give people 7 weeks of benefits for \nanother 60 days, and let's figure out how that helps. We did the \ncalculation. After 7 weeks, using this 3 percent of people finding a \njob each week, which is the number that is used in both good and bad \neconomic times, it is an average, after 7 weeks of benefits, 458,000 \npeople would find jobs. So after 7 weeks, those 1.5 million \nexhaustees--those are people who have already exhausted their State \nsupport but are still jobless--how many of these people would have a \njob? Basically, 450,000 of them would have a job.\n\n  The issue is, after 450,000 of them would get employed after 7 weeks, \nwe still would be looking at 1.1 million people without a job, without \nsupport, being in the same situation as my constituent of bankruptcy, \npotentially losing her home and in a desperate situation.\n  Let's be realistic. We are not going to solve this by saying here is \n7 weeks of unemployment. It is not going to happen. This economy will \nget better. It will. But it is going to take a while. You cannot \nrecreate 2 million jobs overnight. You cannot.\n  The good news is, when you have a Federal program, which the UI trust \nfund is, at $13 billion, you can use a little bit of those funds to \nhelp those people in the meantime and actually generate stimulus in the \neconomy. For every dollar we give these unemployed workers, it \ngenerates $2 of stimulus. Who is helped by my constituent basically \nhaving to declare bankruptcy and maybe not able to make mortgage \npayments? Who is helped by that? She is not, but neither is the bank \nand not the businesses with which she does business. Certainly her 5-\nyear-old daughter who would rather have a home is not receiving any \nbenefits.\n  If we adopted my proposal, a 6-month extension with 13 weeks of \nbenefits, after that 6 months, the account, which was $13.3 billion, \nwould still have $9 billion in it. So the account will be a very \nhealthy account at the end of that period. Yes, we would pay money out \nto those individuals, but the account is continually paid into by other \nemployers. That is the way it works. That is why it is a healthy \naccount today, and it will remain healthy under the Cantwell-Voinovich \nproposal.\n  This is a bothersome debate to me in the sense of why are we having \nthis discussion when we have a healthy account? We know what the \nindividual problems are. We know people need to have support and \nassistance. We know even after a short plan, 1.1 million people will \nstill be unemployed. Why don't we just do this? Is it because we are \nusing the money for something else, and we do not have it available to \nus? Is it that we believe the economy is so much better that even a few \ntrickling of jobs at 300,000 or another 300,000 announced on Friday is \nsomehow going to solve our problem?\n  I do not think that is what other people have said. In fact, Alan \nGreenspan said recently before two different committee hearings that \nthe unemployment extension benefit is a good idea largely because of \nthe size of the exhaustees, the number of people who exhausted the \nbenefits, those 1.5 million people. We have the chief economist for our \ncountry basically saying this is a good idea based on the fact we have \n1.5 million people, and they are not going to be back in the workforce \ntomorrow. They are not going to be back in the workforce from the April \nnumbers or the May numbers or the June numbers. So who are we kidding? \nThe economy is not going to be that red hot to take care of 1.5 million \npeople tomorrow.\n  The question is, What do we want to do about it? I think BusinessWeek \nsaid it best. They basically said the Senate must act. The Senate must \nbridge the gap that will help the economy cross over this extended \nvalley of almost nonexistent hiring. They just said that on March 22--\nnonexistent hiring. Let's not fool ourselves. Americans know it; that \nis, if you poll them and ask them the question, Is the country going in \nthe right direction or the wrong direction, they say the wrong \ndirection because they know that we do not have job creation happening.\n  So it is up to us to make a decision. I know my colleagues are saying \nwe do not want to have a vote. Somebody, in one of the afternoon \njournals, basically said, on the GOP side, that even having a \nstandalone vote on my amendment is a nonstarter.\n  I am hoping wiser heads will prevail and that people will come to \ntheir senses and say: Let's have a vote on this issue. Let's find out \nwhere the Members of the Senate stand on getting their constituents' \nsupport in tough economic times.\n  Let us see where the Members of the Senate stand on following the \nadvice of Alan Greenspan who says doing unemployment benefits would be \na smart idea given the number of exhaustees. Let us find out where the \nSenate stands on having a solution to the issue of whether individuals \nshould have access to the money they have paid into a $13.3 billion \naccount through their employers.\n  Let us find out where the Senate stands on giving a solution on \nwhether they think the economy is recovering fast enough or whether \nthey want to help people in the times when economic recovery is still \nslow.\n  I hope we come to some resolution of this issue. I hope my colleagues \nwill listen to their constituents and heed the words they are saying \nabout the tough economic times we are seeing. It may not be on the 6 \no'clock news, it may not be on the front page with four or five other \nstories as is the situation in Iraq and the Middle East, but there is \nstill a struggle for Americans and their struggle deserves the help and \nsupport of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Who yields time? The Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. We are not under any controlled time now, are we? Is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to address some of the comments \nthat\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\nwere made by the Senator from Washington State. The proposal to extend \nunemployment insurance benefits is something the Senator from \nWashington has been attempting to have passed for some time now. The \narguments have been that there are a lot of people unemployed in the \ncountry who have been unemployed for long periods of time and therefore \nwe need to have not just normal unemployment benefits but we need to \nhave extended unemployment benefits.\n  For the last several months, I have gotten up on the Senate floor to \nrefute some of the arguments that have been made by the Senator from \nWashington, and I want to not only reiterate some of those points but I \nwant to go a little bit further today.\n  One of the points I have been making is that back when the Democrats \ncontrolled the House, the Senate and the White House, the unemployment \nrate in the country was almost a full percentage point higher than it \nis today. At that time, the three bodies working together, in control, \nonce again, by the Democrats, thought that the economy had come out of \nthe recession and had recovered to the point where the extension of the \nunemployment benefits was not necessary. So they terminated the \nprogram.\n  Well, the unemployment rate in the country is almost a full \npercentage point less today--now when Republicans control the House, \nthe Senate, and the White House. We have recovered from a recession and \ntoday, enjoy an unemployment rate that is almost a full percentage \npoint lower than what it was back in the 1990s when the Democrats were \nin control, when they stopped the temporary extension program. That is \nthe situation we are facing today.\n  Nationwide, unemployment is 5.7 percent. Economists used to argue \nthat this kind of an unemployment rate was full employment. I am one of \nthose people who believe we can do better than we are doing today. In \nfact, in my State we are at about 4.4 percent. In some of our counties \nin our State we are at about 3-percent unemployment. So I think we can \ndo better. In fact, in the JOBS bill that we have before us today, we \nhave provisions in the bill that would create a couple of million jobs.\n  The one I authored, called the Invest in the USA Act, according to \nindependent economists, will increase the GDP of this country by 1 \npercent and will produce 660,000 jobs. This is a conservative estimate. \nSo I believe in creating jobs. It is not that people do not feel bad \nthat people are unemployed, but instead of giving them a check for \nbeing unemployed we want to give them a job so they are no longer \nunemployed.\n  The Senator from Washington has an amendment that she has been trying \nto get enacted, and she changed her amendment slightly. Her State was \none of the highest unemployment States in the country. So my colleagues \ncould understand why she was pushing for this. In the last couple of \nmonths, her State's economy has improved. Her State's unemployment rate \nhas been dropping precipitously, so much so that to qualify as a high \nunemployment State for some of the extra funds under her amendment, she \nhad to redraft her amendment to adjust the figures in such a way that \nher State would qualify. Under her previous amendments, the State of \nWashington would not qualify because the economy is improving in her \nState.\n  When President Bush was elected, he inherited an economy that was in \nrecession. There is no argument about that. We had three straight \nquarters of negative growth. By anybody's definition, that is a \nrecession. It takes time to come out of that. We have had economic \npolicies put into place, including two rounds of tax cuts, that have \nhelped spur our economy onward to where we are creating jobs and to \nwhere the economy is starting to fire on all cylinders.\n\n  We still have work to do, and I think all of us in this body would \nagree that. But let's look at some of the employment figures.\n  This chart shows what I was talking about earlier in the State of \nWashington. Starting in April of 2001, their unemployment rate was a \nlittle above 6 percent. We can see, over the last couple of years, it \nhas gone up fairly significantly. It plateaued in October 2003, and \nsince then it has fallen drastically. This is the home State of the \nauthor of the amendment, and that is why her State, under her old \namendment, would basically no longer qualify as a high unemployment \nState.\n  I want to address the issue of the two surveys that measure \nunemployment. One is called the household survey and the other is \ncalled the payroll survey. The household survey measures not only \npeople on payrolls but it is a better measure of the economy because it \nalso measures those who are self-employed.\n  For instance, in the last 2 years we have seen this incredible \nphenomenon known as eBay. I think most people are familiar with eBay. \nThere are 430,000 people who now make a full-time living on eBay. Try \nto conceptualize that. Ten years ago, we could not even have imagined \nit. The payroll survey, the most common one that people quote about \njobs being produced or eliminated, does not reflect a single one of \nthose people who are now supporting themselves full time by doing \nbusiness on eBay. The household survey does count them.\n  Anybody who goes out and starts their own business, once they hire \nsomebody that individual is counted in the payroll survey. Well, even a \nlot of the small businesses are not counted for some time under payroll \nbut they are counted in the household survey. It is a more accurate \nreflection of the current employment situation in our country.\n  In the past, the payroll survey and the household survey, the reason \nwe did not worry about really talking about the differences between \nthem is because they paralleled each other. For the last 20, 30 years \nthey literally went up and down at about the same rate. Over the last 2 \nto 3 years, though, our economy has been changing. Today we are living \nin a high-tech information age. Things such as eBay didn't exist \nbefore. Thus, over the last 12 to 24 months the payroll survey has \nshowed a loss of jobs while, according to the household survey, a \ncouple of million jobs have been produced.\n\n  We hear the other side saying under President Bush a couple of \nmillion jobs have been lost. Well, that is if you include only the \npayroll survey. If you include the household survey, we are at the \nhighest level of employment in the history of the United States--the \nhighest level of employment in the history of the United States. We \nhave the most people actually employed, self-employed or employed by \nsomebody else, that we have ever had in the United States.\n  Unemployment insurance was set up to be a hand up. The longer and the \nmore generous the benefits are, the less incentive there is for \nsomebody to go out and get a job. We know that and can prove that.\n  During times of high unemployment, during times of recession, we \nextend the Federal program so those who have fallen on hard times in a \ntough economy, can get assistance. Those jobs may not be out there, so \nwe extend the program an extra 13 weeks, sometimes 26 weeks, and we \nallow the States to extend it even further.\n  But when the economy is growing, is it really necessary to extend \nthose Federal unemployment benefits? Not only is it not necessary, does \nit, in fact, inhibit somebody from taking the initiative, No. 1, to \neither create their own job, to become that entrepreneur on eBay or \nwherever else they are going to create the job, or, No. 2, to do what \nit takes to go out and find a job?\n  By the way, sometimes that requires moving. We have a very fluid \neconomy today. Sometimes it requires changing careers. Today, the \naverage American changes careers--not jobs, careers--three times. \nAgain, a reflection of our changing economy. That is one of the \nreasons, if the other side of the aisle is so interested, as they say \nthey are, in helping people, let's make sure the Workforce Investment \nAct that was passed unanimously in the Senate actually is finalized \ninto law instead of using procedural maneuvers to block it. That would \ntrain an additional 900,000 people in the United States to help find \nthose new jobs that are being created.\n  In most places that you travel around the United States, if you would \nask how the economy is, a year ago there was a lot of pessimism. People \nwere really unsure. You go out there now and there is a lot of \noptimism.\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\nPeople are hiring and manufacturing orders are up. All the economic \nindexes we see in virtually every category are up, including the \npayroll survey for the last 3 months, and we expect to have fairly good \nemployment numbers coming out tomorrow. The jobless claims that came \nout today were the lowest level we have seen since the year 2000, \nagain, another good piece of economic news.\n  That is why I think it is the right thing to do, to not further \nextend the temporary extended unemployment benefits program. It already \nexpired in March.\n  We have heard a lot from the other side of the aisle about deficits \nand how much of a threat deficits are to the current economy and the \nfuture economy of the United States. I agree with that. In fact I, by \nthe National Taxpayers Union, was rated No. 1 as the biggest deficit \nhawk in the Senate. I am very concerned with deficits. My votes match \nmy rhetoric.\n  Extending the unemployment insurance benefits cost $1 billion a \nmonth, which is added to the deficit. That is deficit spending. A few \nof the proposals we have heard from the other side would make it a $2 \nbillion-a-month program. So if people care about the deficit, if they \nbelieve that it is something we should not be adding on to, as the \nSenator from Washington is trying to do by adding back in the extension \nof the unemployment benefits, then they should not support her \namendment.\n\n  To sum this up, the facts are, the economy is growing, and growing \nstrongly. Yes, we can do better. I will admit that. I want to see us do \nmore. Pass the JOBS bill that is in front of the Senate today that the \nSenator from Montana, the ranking member on the Finance Committee, and \nthe Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the committee, have put \ntogether. They put together a bill that will create jobs in America. \nThat is part of doing better. There are many other things we can do.\n  I believe it would actually do harm to the economy, by adding $1 \nbillion a month to the deficit and discouraging those people who are \ncurrently on unemployment, if we were to continue extending the TEUC \nprogram for weeks and weeks, and months, instead of giving people the \nincentive to go out and find the jobs that are being created in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, earlier today, during the Negroponte debate, \na number of my friends from the other side of the aisle expressed \nconcern that some ambassadors were pending on the Executive Calendar. I \nthink concern is a very light word. I think we could use words such as \nthey expressed outrage--concern. I wish to comment on this because I \nthink it was misguided. Perhaps they didn't have the right information.\n  One of the most unfortunate charges I heard was that the Democrats \nhave ensured that there were vacancies in U.S. Embassies in countries \nrepresenting 700 million people.\n  Another unfortunate charge was that we were hamstringing the war on \nterrorism by not having confirmed ambassadors that the Foreign \nRelations Committee just found time to report out last week.\n  Again, we were criticized because we were hamstringing the war on \nterrorism because, after action taken by the committee last week, we \ndidn't do floor action within the next few days. I think anyone who \nunderstands Senate procedure knows acting on work of a committee within \na very short period of time doesn't happen very often. What I mean by \nthat is a matter of weeks.\n  I hope if these Senators think these people were needed so urgently, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee should have moved a little faster--or a \nlot faster.\n  But this really is not the issue, because all my colleagues know the \nrecord does not support these accusations--and that is what they are. \nLater tonight we will confirm 20 ambassadors. We have already voted for \nAmbassador Negroponte. His nomination was completed with nearly record \nspeed, given he was only nominated by President Bush last week.\n  As to the charge the Democrats have kept several American Embassies \nvacant, we have been told there are 10 embassies the State Department \nhas said are currently vacant. Of these 10, the President has chosen to \nfill only 5 of them. Out of 10, half of those the President has not \nsent names.\n\n  Tonight, we will confirm ambassadors to fill Nigeria and Serbia. The \nonly reason we have Serbia tonight is last week Republicans objected to \nconfirming this qualified Foreign Service officer. We also wanted to \nconfirm the new Ambassador to Nepal tonight, but there was an \nobjection, I am told, by our Republican friends that would prevent the \nSenate from ensuring that this very qualified career Foreign Service \nofficer will not be confirmed. The remaining two vacancies, Sweden and \nFinland, need to be filled, of course. These are going to be political \nappointees because they did not fill out the term they committed to \nserve.\n  The facts that were propounded by my friends on the other side of the \naisle about ambassadors not being appointed simply is without any basis \nof fact. We will confirm two tonight. We have 10 that are unfilled. The \nPresident has not even sent five of the names to us. I repeat: Two of \nthem we are going to fill tonight. We have five vacancies. A third we \nwill fill tonight, we would not have needed to do that but for an \nobjection by the Republicans last week over that very qualified person. \nThen, of course, I indicated the person to go to Nepal is being \nobjected to by the Republicans also.\n  We have two vacancies, then: Sweden and Finland. The reason those are \nvacant is because they were political appointees and the people decided \nthey wanted to come home early.\n  We are doing the very best we can. There are a lot of places that \npeople could place blame, but certainly not in the case of appointment \nof ambassadors because the facts do not support the allegations that we \nhave been slowing up the ambassadors.\n  I am happy to see the two managers of the bill in the Senate. We are \ncautiously optimistic we will be able to complete in the near future \nthe very important FSC bill, the JOBS bill. While the two Senators are \nin the Senate, I say publicly how much I appreciate their work on this \npiece of legislation. This committee they are responsible for running, \nthe Finance Committee, is as important if not more important than any \nother committee in the Congress. They work well together. This is a \nvery complicated bill. There have been a lot of political sideshows \nthat have gone on during the pendency of this legislation, as happens \nin all complex bills. We might get lucky later tonight and work out an \narrangement to complete this bill in the near future, probably early \nnext week.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to the two Senators. They are both \nexperienced. Both come from relatively sparsely populated States, like \nthe State of Nevada. The Founding Fathers set up the Constitution so \nthat the Senate was not determined by how many people are in a State \nbut, rather, that it is a State. There is no better example of what the \nFounding Fathers had in mind than these two fine men who run this most \nimportant committee. I express my appreciation for the good work they \ndo and have done on this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, I am rising this evening in support of \nS.\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\n1637. This is legislation, sponsored by Senator Cantwell and myself, to \nextend the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Program for \nanother 6 months. The TEUC Program provides additional unemployment \ncompensation benefits to individuals who have exhausted their initial \neligibility without finding new employment. It covers those individuals \nwho may find themselves out of a job, once it takes effect.\n  This program is absolutely critical to thousands of people in the \nUnited States of America, many of them who live in my home State of \nOhio. The Congressional Budget Office recently reported that for the \npast 2 years, the exhaustion rate for unemployment benefits has been \nhigher than at any time in recent history. During calendar year 2003, \n43 percent of UI recipients exhausted their entitlement to regular \nbenefits.\n  This is best depicted by this chart that I have here this evening. \nThe bottom line shows the unemployment from a period of 1972 up to \n2004. The top line shows the exhaustion rate of benefits. You can see \nduring this period of time we had exhaustion in benefits, then it goes \ndown, then we come out to the 2003-2004 area and you can see that means \nthese people have been unemployed for a much longer period than is \ntraditional in a recessionary period.\n  Many of those out there today are still in great need. They need \nthese unemployment benefits in order to keep going, paying their \nmortgages, and giving them some time so they can gain new skills for \nthe jobs that we hope are going to be available to them.\n  In my own State of Ohio, over 31,000 individuals have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits since the Temporary Extended Unemployment \nCompensation Program ended in late December. Without additional \nassistance, these families face severe financial difficulties until \nthey are able to regain employment.\n  Many of my colleagues believe the recent declines in overall \nunemployment and the continuing decline in initial unemployment claims \nindicate there is no further need for a TEUC. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. As CBO's recent report indicates, long-term \nunemployment has actually continued to increase, even though short-term \nunemployment has been declining.\n  Part of the problem we face is that many of our assumptions regarding \nrecessions, economic recovery, and job creation are more suited for the \n1950s than the 21st century. Traditional economic analysis tells us \ncompanies lay off workers during a recession and rehire them to the \nsame jobs during a recovery. Workers may have collected unemployment \nduring a limited period of time, but they have not lost a job and \nusually return to their former workplace with no need to seek new \nemployment.\n  Unfortunately, the current recession has not followed this pattern. \nInstead of existing companies laying off employees and later rehiring \nthem, many corporations have permanently eliminated positions or even \ngone out of business. This has particularly been hurtful in the \nState of Ohio, where manufacturing has been hit by international \ncompetition, litigation costs, and high energy costs. We have lost some \n17.5 percent of our manufacturing jobs in the State of Ohio.\n\n  Companies like Rubbermaid, in Wayne County, Worchester, OH, one of \nthe most successful companies that Ohio has ever had, a company that \nwas written up in Fortune magazine, just closed down--1,200 jobs, in \nWorchester, OH, a small Ohio city in a small county, Wayne County. \nThankfully, new companies and new types of jobs are emerging to replace \nthose that are lost; however, many of the workers who were displaced \nduring the recession have difficulty qualifying for these new jobs. \nUsually they have to retrain and it is not uncommon they have to \nrelocate. Quite often, middle-aged factory workers find themselves \ncompeting with younger, better educated workers for jobs in the \ntechnology sector.\n  Also, many times jobs are lost in older urban communities, but the \nreplacement technology or service sector jobs are created in distant \nsuburban areas that require long commutes or changing residences. \nFamilies who are dependent on two incomes may find it difficult to \nlocate employment for both wage earners at the same location. \nConsequently, either the husband or the wife may be unemployed for much \nlonger than in previous recessions.\n  This is precisely the situation we are facing in Ohio. We have lost \nmanufacturing jobs in older communities such as Youngstown and \nCleveland and southeast Ohio. Most of these job losses reflect plant \nclosings or permanent downsizing. These jobs are gone and they are not \ncoming back. They are gone. They are finished.\n  Meanwhile, some areas of the State are picking up service sector jobs \nand have unemployment rates as low as 3.9 percent. Unfortunately, \nexpanded financial service jobs in suburban Columbus are not much help \nto an unemployed tool and die maker in Toledo, OH. It is all very well \nto talk about the bright new economy that will generate plentiful \nemployment at high wages for the knowledge workers of the future. \nHowever, we still have a responsibility to assist the semiskilled \nmanual laborers being displaced by the demise of the old manufacturing \neconomy. Many of these workers can and will retrain. Some will, however \nreluctantly, relocate. All of them will require time to make these \nchanges.\n  Recently, Chairman Greenspan has recognized the need to extend \ntemporary unemployment benefits. Secretary Snow has recognized the need \nto extend temporary unemployment benefits. Our President recognizes \nthat we need to extend temporary unemployment benefits. It is time for \nCongress to extend these benefits.\n  The program was designed specifically to give long-term unemployed \nindividuals the time they need to readjust to changing economic \nrealities. The recent report from the CBO clearly indicates the \ncontinued need for this program. Consequently, I call upon my \ncolleagues to offer a helping hand to workers from that old economy, \nwhile we welcome the rise of the new economy. We can afford to help \nwith this transition, and it is the right thing to do.\n  I know there are many of my colleagues from States that do not have \nthe problem we have in my State, and they don't understand the urgency \nof the passage of this legislation. I think we owe it to these people, \nto these families. Some of them live in my neighborhood in the city of \nCleveland. I have lived in the same house since I was mayor of the city \nof Cleveland, since 1972. I live in a middle-class neighborhood. I have \na neighbor across the street who has been unemployed and his benefits \nhave been exhausted. He needs help. I see these people in the grocery \nstore and they talk to me about it.\n\n  I think some of our colleagues who are opposed come from States where \nthings are fine, things are wonderful. But I think part of the \nresponsibility we have as Senators in the United States of America is \nto look after the needs of the entire country. If I were in a position \nwhere things were wonderful in my State and they weren't good in some \nother State and they needed some help in unemployment, then I would be \nsupportive of that because I think it is the proper thing for us to do.\n  The other thing about this program that a lot of my colleagues do not \nunderstand is that, even though this money is coming from the Federal \nTreasury, the money ultimately is repaid back to the Treasury from the \nunemployment compensation fund that is supported by a tax on our \nbusinesses in our State. This happened when we had the last recession \nin the State of Ohio.\n  I am urging my colleagues to open their eyes to the pleas and the \nneeds of so many of our fellow Americans who need that extra help at \nthis time for themselves and for their families.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is good news from Georgia this \nmorning. In a second bloodless revolution in that country, former \nSoviet official and Ajaria troublemaker Alan Abashidze fled into exile \nafter thousands of opponents--including some from within his own police \nand military forces--took to the streets to demand change.\n  Abashidze's hasty departure is a great victory for the people of \nGeorgia and their leaders, particularly President Saakashvili and Prime \nMinister Zhvania. By seeking a non-violent solution to the crisis in \nthe breakaway region of Ajari, Saakashvili and Zhvania demonstrated \npatience in the face of Abashidze's hostile provocations--designed to \nspark a military conflict.\n  Reports of the celebrations in the streets of Batumi are inspiring, \nparticularly those of reformers waving American flags along side their \nown country. I want to remind my colleagues such symbolism is a reality \nin Iraq, where Georgian soldiers serve alongside U.S. and Coalition \nforces.\n  My message to the people of Georgia is clear: America will continue \nto stand with them as they champion the cause of democracy. We will \ncontinue to help them build a country--and institutions--dedicated to \nthe furtherance of freedom and the rule of law.\n  Once again, democracy triumphs in Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4988-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4988-S4989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MILLION MOM MARCH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend moms from across the country \nwill converge on Washington to join in a march remembering gun violence \nvictims and urging President Bush to support commonsense gun safety \nlegislation. I am proud to support the moms, and I know my colleagues \nwill join me in commending these women for their leadership.\n  On Mother's Day, moms will gather on the west lawn of the U.S. \nCapitol to bring their ``Halt the Assault'' message to the front door \nof Congress. These women have come to Washington to urge Members of \nCongress to support sensible gun safety legislation. Their leadership \nis desperately needed on this issue, and I applaud all of the moms who \nwill make this journey for their commitment. After the march, the moms \nwill spend Monday visiting our offices and urging us to support \ncommonsense gun safety legislation.\n  One of the moms attending this Sunday's events is Barb Case, \nMichigan's Million Mom March President. Mrs. Case has been a member of \nthe Michigan Million Mom March since it first started in 2000. She will \nbe leading as many as 500 Michigan moms to Washington. The Michigan \nmoms will be marching in memory of the 120,000 people who have been \nkilled by a firearm, including more than 13,000 children and teens, \nsince 2000. Mrs. Case, along with other moms in Michigan, have united \nwith State and local leaders to implement community efforts to address \nthe tough issues surrounding gun violence in my home State of Michigan. \nAnd, Barb has organized Michigan's moms trip to Washington every year \nsince the first march took place in 2000.\n  This year's marchers are focused on the renewal and strengthening of \nthe assault weapons ban, holding gun manufacturers accountable for \ntheir products, requiring background checks on all gun purchases, \nreinstating the 5-day Brady waiting period for all gun purchases, and \nincorporating safety standards into gun design.\n  Michigan's moms, just like millions of moms from across the country \nwant an America where their kids are safe from gun violence. Again, I \ncommend all of the mothers coming to Washington this weekend for their \nhard work and commitment to the issue of gun safety and I hope all of \nmy colleagues will remember these efforts when the Senate considers gun \nsafety legislation in the coming months.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Detroit Free Press, \nwhich discussed the issue of gun violence and this Sunday's march, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Detroit Free Press, Apr. 29, 2004]\n\n                  Work Toward Peace This Mother's Day\n\n                          (By Desiree Cooper)\n\n       Sometimes, society's assault on your humanity can be so \n     fierce, you have to throw down the gauntlet and say, ``This \n     means war.''\n       That's what happened to two women more than 140 years ago. \n     One was Anna Reeves Jarvis, a West Virginia Methodist \n     pastor's wife. She established Mother's Day Work Clubs to \n     improve the health of Appalachian women and children. But as \n     Civil War casualties mounted, she converted the clubs into \n     nursing squads, determined to save the lives of all \n     soldiers--both Confederate and Union.\n       Abolitionist Julia Ward Howe, author of the ``Battle Hymn \n     of the Republic,'' also had become war-weary. When the \n     Franco-Prussian War began on the heels of the Civil War, she \n     started rallying women for a national Mother's Day for Peace. \n     Together, the nurse and the poet began the antiwar holiday \n     that we know as Mother's Day.\n\n\n                      not about daisies and dinner\n\n       We've long since forgotten that Mother's Day was a social \n     movement. But this year, Endolyn Chapman and her daughter \n     Tonisha will hark back to the roots of the holiday and \n     celebrate it on May 9 at the Million Mom March in Washington, \n     DC.\n       Neither woman has ever seen herself as political. Tonisha, \n     19, just registered to vote last week. But, like Jarvis and \n     Howe, violence has spurred their fight for peace.\n       ``The last time I saw my father, he was driving away as I \n     was coming home,'' said Tonisha, remembering the even on \n     April 5, 2004.``I wanted to stop and chat with him, but he \n     just waved and drove off.''\n       That night, 44-year old Steven Chapman went to Detroit's \n     Sa-Mari Hand Car Wash on Wyoming and 6 Mile.\n       ``Four men wearing ski masks robbed the place,'' said \n     Endolyn, who'd been married to Chapman--a former college \n     football player who stood 6 feet 6 and wore a size 18 shoe--\n     for nearly 20 years. ``My husband pleaded for his life. He \n     was in a seated position when they killed him.''\n\n\n                     how will you commit for peace?\n\n       Tonisha has tried to comfort her mother, taking her out on \n     her parents' anniversary. Endolyn, too, has tried to move on, \n     even though her husband's killers remain at large.\n       Then she read an article about the Million Mom March's Halt \n     the Assault rally to urge Congress to renew the assault \n     weapons ban.\n       ``There is no reason why anyone would need an assault \n     weapon,'' Endolyn said. ``You can't hunt with one. I decided \n     that we'd go to the march because we don't ever want another \n     family to go through what we've been through.''\n       Million Man Marchstate president Barb Case said, ``So many \n     women have been touched by the suffering of others and want \n     to do something to change the world.'' She estimated that \n     about 500 people from Michigan will attend the march. ``This \n     is a powerful way for them to get involved.\n       And what better day to demonstrate that power than Mother's \n     Day.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, tens of thousands of women will come \nto Washington this Mother's Day weekend to spread the word about the \nurgent need to renew the Federal assault weapons ban.\n  I thank these women, and their families and friends who will join \nthem, for their effort to focus the American public on the fact that we \ncould lose this important law unless Congress and the President renew \nthe ban soon.\n  I ask these committed Americans to do everything they can do to help \nsave the assault weapons ban. They should write the President and urge \nhim to help renew the ban. They should write Senate Majority Leader \nBill Frist and Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and urge them to \nbring the assault weapons ban up for a vote. They should make their \nvoices heard until the ban is renewed.\n  Time is running out. The Federal assault weapons ban will expire on \nSeptember 13 of this year if Congress and the President do not act. \nThis means that AK-47s, TEC-DC 9s, Street Sweepers, and dozens of other \ntypes of military-style assault weapons will once again flood the \nstreets of America. We cannot afford to let this happen. We owe the \nAmerican people more than that. It is just that simple.\n  Assault weapons pose a grave threat to all Americans, but most \nespecially to law enforcement officers on our city streets.\n  Just last month, I spoke at the funeral of San Francisco Police \nOfficer Isaac Espinoza, who was shot and killed by a gang member armed \nwith an AK-47 and a 30-round clip. Officer Espinoza took three shots in \nhis back as a gunman fired 15 rounds in just seconds, giving Officer \nEspinoza and his partner, who was also shot, no time to seek refuge.\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\n  Officer Espinoza was a bright young star in the San Francisco Police \nDepartment, and he had a promising future and loving family. Now that \nfuture is gone. His wife Renata is without a husband. His beautiful 3-\nyear-old girl Isabella is without a father.\n  And Officer Espinoza is far from the only law enforcement officer \ngunned down in his prime by an assailant wielding an assault weapon.\n  A recent study by the Violence Policy Center stated that one in five \npolice officers killed in the line of duty is killed with an assault \nweapon.\n  That study listed a number of officers gunned down by assault \nweapons, and I would just like to list a few examples because if we let \nthe assault weapons ban expire, we can expect many more of these \nincidents.\n  On January 10, 1999:\n\n       Officer James Williams was killed with a MAK-90 or SA85 \n     7.62mm rifle. Officer Williams was among a group of officers \n     who were searching for a rifle that had been discarded by the \n     occupants of a vehicle that was involved in a chase with \n     police. While they were searching for the rifle, a gunman \n     opened fire from a nearby overpass, killing Officer Williams. \n     Chad Rhodes was arrested and charged with special-\n     circumstances murder, attempted murder, three counts of \n     firing an assault weapon, and possessing an assault weapon. \n     Rhodes pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was \n     sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\n  On June 12, 1999 in Orange County, California:\n\n       Sheriff's Deputy Brad Riches was killed with a MAK-90 or \n     SA85 7.62mm rifle. Deputy Riches was sitting in his patrol \n     car outside a 7-Eleven when his police cruiser was riddled \n     with assault weapon fire. The 7-Eleven clerk said that a \n     customer told him he was carrying an AK-47-style assault \n     rifle to shoot a police officer. Maurice Steksal was \n     convicted on November 19, 2002 of the first-degree murder of \n     Deputy Riches.\n\n  And there are many, many more. But the list would be far longer if \nthe assault weapons ban were not in place, because more of these guns \nwould be out there. They would be easier for criminals to get and to \nuse, and more officers would be killed.\n\n  Indeed, these shootings underscore the fundamental danger assault \nweapons pose to our society.\n  The good news is that the Senate has gone on record in support of \nextending the ban on military-style assault weapons. In a bipartisan \nvote in March, the Senate approved a straight 10-year renewal of the \ncurrent ban as an amendment to a bill being pushed by the National \nRifle Association giving gun manufacturers and dealers protection from \ncivil lawsuits.\n  But in a bizarre twist, the NRA scuttled its own bill to prevent the \nextension from becoming law. This is the power of the NRA.\n  In over a decade as a U.S. Senator, I have encountered no lobby \nstronger than the gun lobby. I am convinced that if the NRA is going to \nbe defeated, it will be by the mothers and fathers of this Nation--\nparents who want a future for their children free of the violence and \nbloodshed sparked by the vast overproliferation of guns throughout our \ncountry.\n  These are the people who came together in the first Million Mom March \n4 years ago, and these are the people who will come together again this \nweekend.\n  These people will stand firm and say: Enough is Enough. Now is the \ntime to protect our families from assault weapons. There cannot be any \nturning back.\n  Over the past decade, we have had a chance to examine the assault \nweapons ban and to determine if it works and enjoys support.\n  The results are in.\n  The ban works. Recent Department of Justice records indicate that the \nuse of banned assault weapons in crimes has declined measurably--by 65 \npercent in one analysis--since the measure took effect.\n  The men and women of law enforcement across the Nation support the \nban because, on the front lines, they know it protects them and makes \ncommunities safer. The Fraternal Order of Police endorses another 10 \nyears, as does almost every other major law enforcement organization, \nincluding chiefs of police all across the Nation.\n  No weapons have been confiscated from legitimate gun owners. In fact, \nthe bill specifically protects 670 shotguns and rifles used for \nhunting.\n  Almost three-fourths of the American people, and two-thirds of gun \nowners, support renewing the ban.\n  In fact, a recent University of Pennsylvania Annenberg poll found \nthat 71 percent of all Americans support renewing the assault weapons \nban; 64 percent of people in homes with a gun supported extension of \nthe ban; and even 46 percent of people in NRA households support \nextending the ban, contrary to claims by NRA leadership that its \nmembers are universally against this proposal.\n  Some in the Senate opposed the ban a decade ago, fearing it would do \nlittle to reduce crime, and could threaten the constitutional rights of \nlaw-abiding gun owners and hunters.\n  Now, 10 years since that vote, America has seen just the opposite: \nthe ban has made our streets safer, it has protected law enforcement \nofficers, and in no way has it diminished legitimate gun owners' \nrights.\n  Moreover, we all know that the world has dramatically changed since \n1993. September 11, 2001, has taught us many lessons; among them that \nterrorism lurks in our own cities and communities. Given today's \ndangers, it defies logic to let suicidal terrorists, gang members and \nothers simply walk up to a counter and buy these weapons for potential \nattacks.\n  Assault weapons pose a fundamental danger to law enforcement and our \nsociety, and we will continue to work to extend the ban in the Senate. \nThe assault weapons ban is too important to let die.\n  The bottom line is this--what is the argument for letting these \nbanned guns back on the streets?\n  Who is clamoring for newly manufactured AK-47s?\n  Who is clamoring for new TEC-9s?\n  These are guns that are never used for hunting. They are not used for \nself-defense, and if they are, it is more likely that they will kill \ninnocents than intruders.\n  These guns--and everyone knows it--have but one purpose, and that \npurpose is to kill other human beings. Why would we want to open the \nfloodgates again and let them back on our streets? There is simply no \ngood reason.\n  For a number of years now, President Bush has indicated that he \nsupports renewing the assault weapons ban for another decade. But he \nhas not lifted a finger to help. Ultimately, however, the voice of the \nWhite House will be pivotal in determining if the ban is ultimately \napproved by Congress and signed into law.\n  Now is the time to renew a sound law for another 10 years.\n  We do this in the memory of Officer Espinoza and all the other police \nofficers shot and killed with assault weapons.\n  We do this on behalf of all the women who are marching on Washington \nthis weekend.\n  And we do this to keep our communities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4989-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Robert Martin was found lying outside an abandoned school in Ashburn, \nGA, with head injuries from a blunt object. Martin was wearing a dress \nat the time. Press reports indicate that Martin had been beaten and \nharassed before because of his perceived sexuality.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4989-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4989-S4990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE NEED FOR NATIONAL ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Electricity Reliability Act of 2004, S. 2236. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation and I hope that the Senate acts \non this bill soon. Although we cannot agree on the comprehensive energy \nbill that has been before the Senate, we can agree on\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nmany provisions in the bill. Mandatory reliability standards are a \nperfect example of what we all agree should be part of our national \nenergy policy.\n  Our citizens deserve a reliable, safe power grid. This is one of the \ncountry's most pressing energy needs. We have to do all that we can to \nprevent blackouts like the one that hit the east coast and Midwest last \nAugust and the Electric Reliability Act of 2004 takes a crucial step \ntoward that goal. The bill grants the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission--FERC--the explicit authority to create mandatory electric \nreliability standards. FERC can also approve the formation of electric \nreliability organizations, which will, subject to FERC review, enforce \nthese standards. Strong and enforceable electric reliability standards \nwill help ensure that our citizens and businesses do not have to worry \nabout their respective lives and livelihoods being disrupted by \nblackouts.\n  In fact, a joint investigation by a United States-Canadian task force \nfound that the lack of mandatory reliability standards contributed to \nthe August 14, 2003, blackout. This massive outage affected 50 million \npeople in eight U.S. States and parts of Canada. The task force report \nfound that an Ohio-based utility and regional grid manager together \nviolated at least six reliability standards on the day of the blackout. \nExamples of the reliability violations that contributed to the blackout \nincluded: not reacting to a power line failure within 30 minutes, not \nnotifying nearby systems of the transmission problems, failing to \nanalyze what was happening to the grid, inadequately training \noperators, and failing to adequately monitor transmission stations. \nSince the industry is largely self-regulated, violations of these \nvoluntary reliability standards carry no penalties. This legislation \nwould hold utilities accountable for reliability violations.\n  Let's act now and pass this legislation before we face a blackout \nlike we saw last summer. We should work together to pass the elements \nof the broader energy bill that are necessary and widely supported. I \nurge my colleagues to support Senator Cantwell's bill and to join me in \nasking that this legislation come to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4990-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OFFICER STEPHAN GRAY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

On April 15, 2004, Stephan Gray, age 34, became the first \nofficer to be killed in the line of duty in the history of the Merced \nPolice Department. Stephan is mourned by his wife Michelle Gray and \ntheir three children: Landess, 13; Isaiah, 5; and Cameron, 3.\n  Officer Stephan Gray died in the line of duty while protecting the \ncommunity that he cherished. Officer Gray worked for the Merced Police \nDepartment for seven years, where he was assigned to the Gang Violence \nSuppression Unit and the Special Operations Unit. Officer Gray was well \nknown for going above and beyond the call of duty, distinguishing \nhimself as a dedicated and brave officer through his many heroic \nefforts and accomplishments. During his tenure with Merced Police \nDepartment, Officer Gray received a commendation for assisting in the \ncapture of a dangerous criminal street gang member and for saving the \nlife of an eleven-month-old infant who was not breathing. Officer Gray \ndevoted himself to making the streets safer for the people of Merced.\n  Stephan Gray was also a loving husband, father, and son. He enjoyed \nplaying catch with his son, Isaiah. He loved to sing and dance and was \nan avid scuba diver and tropical fish enthusiast.\n  My heart goes out to his wife, his daughter, his sons, and the \ncountless others whose lives he touched. I want them to know that \npeople across California share their grief as we also salute the gift \nof his life and work.\n  A gallant officer is gone, but he will not be forgotten.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month and to pay tribute to the struggles and \nenormous contributions of Asian Pacific Americans to our Nation's \nhistory and culture.\n  Each May since 1978, we have honored the rich heritage and countless \nachievements of the many Asian Pacific Americans in our country. The \nmonth of May was aptly chosen in order to commemorate both the arrival \nof the first Japanese immigrants in 1843, and also the completion of \nthe Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, which was constructed in large \npart by Chinese laborers.\n  ``Freedom for All, a Nation We Call Our Own'' is the theme for this \nyear's celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. This \nphrase beautifully encapsulates the great journey of Asian Pacific \nAmericans to achieve the American dream and rings especially true \nduring these uncertain times at home and abroad.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces, many of whom are from the APA \ncommunity, are proudly serving all over the world to secure our \nhomeland. Currently, thousands of young Asian Pacific Americans are \ndefending our country, joining the ranks of over 300,000 APA veterans \nwho have served in the name of freedom.\n  One such veteran is my esteemed colleague, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, \nwho began his career in public service during World War II where he \nserved in the Army's 442d Regimental Combat Team. The famed ``Go for \nBroke'' regiment of Japanese American soldiers courageously defended \nour country abroad even as their families endured unjust internment at \nhome.\n  This is just one of the many achievements made by Asian Pacific \nAmericans in the face of adversity. Despite discriminatory laws such as \nthe Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Alien Law Act of 1920, and the \nforced internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, Asian \nPacific Americans have forged ahead to become a very successful and \nfast-growing segment of American society.\n  Today, over 13 million Asian Pacific Americans reside in the United \nStates. Whether through academics, technology, the arts, or business, \nthe impact of the APA community is felt in virtually every aspect of \nour society.\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that Asian Pacific American \nfirms alone account for 2.2 million American jobs and generate over \n$300 billion in revenue. In California alone, Asian Pacific Americans \nown over 12 percent of all businesses, making them a significant force \nin the State's economy.\n  Asian Pacific Americans are also gaining an increased presence in \nFederal, State, and local governments. Throughout my career, I have had \nthe distinct honor of working with many extraordinary Asian Pacific \nAmerican leaders such as Senators Inouye and Akaka of Hawaii, Secretary \nof Transportation Norman Mineta, and Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao. \nEach of these public servants can function as an inspiration to all \nAmericans.\n\n  But even as we celebrate these achievements, we must continue to \naddress the struggles and hardships experienced by certain segments of \nthe APA community.\n  In California, we have large populations of Southeast Asian and \nPacific Islanders who have recently sought refuge in our country as a \nresult of war and civil unrest. As these newcomers to America pursue \ntheir dreams and goals, we need to remember the challenges they face \nand stay vigilant against discrimination and hate.\n  That is why I believe one of the most significant contributions of \nAsian Pacific Americans to our Nation is their role as our neighbors. \nAmerica draws its strength from diversity. The presence of Asian \nPacific Americans in our communities further adds to the vibrancy of \nthe American landscape.\n  The strength of diversity is evident in my home State of California, \nwhere close to one-third of the entire Asian Pacific American \npopulation lives.

Over the past 3 days, I have discussed the need to honor \npublic servants, especially Federal workers, during Public Service \nRecognition Week. I thought back to last week when I participated in \nthe nomination hearing for David Safavian, who has been nominated to \nserve as the Administrator for the Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy. This position serves as the gatekeeper for the Government's \ncontracts. Much of our discussion with Mr. Safavian centered on making \nsure that Federal employees have the right to protest competition \ndecisions and that agencies have adequate funds to compete to retain \nwork in-house.\n  Some of the concerns expressed at our hearing stemmed from what I \nconsider to be misguided principles set forth under the President's \nManagement Agenda, which required agencies to implement quotas that \ncould have resulted in the contracting out of up to one-half of all \nFederal work. Congress, in a bipartisan manner, voiced its opposition \nto this government-wide approach of contracting out quotas through \nprovisions in the Fiscal Year 2003 Transportation, Treasury, and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Act. In response to this action and \nothers, the administration dropped this approach in favor of agency-\nspecific plans. With the recent policy reversal of the administration \non contracting quotas, I had hoped that the change would have resulted \nin a fairer approach to the contracting out of Federal work. Therefore, \nI was disappointed that a February 2004 report on competitive sourcing \nby the General Accounting Office, GAO, Congress's independent auditor, \nfound that agencies have focused more on following OMB guidelines on \nthe number of positions to compete at the expense of achieving savings \nand improving performance.\n  As the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Financial \nManagement Subcommittee and the Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, \nI understand that without adequate management structures, management \ninformation systems, and program review structures, government \ncontracts will not realize savings for the American people. This has \nbeen proved time and again by GAO. Contract management and acquisitions \nhave long been identified as high-risk areas. As such, we must ensure \nthat Government contracts are awarded only to responsible parties who \ngenerate cost-savings throughout the life of contracts. To counter cost \noverruns and stop erroneous and improper payments, agencies need the \nresources to improve the speed and accuracy of contract data \ncollection.\n  The GAO report also noted that six out of the seven agency offices \nexamined had only one or two employees overseeing outsourcing \nactivities. More must be done to make certain that agencies have the \npeople, skills, and technologies needed to oversee $230 billion in \ncontracts.\n  The key to achieving success requires strengthening the Federal \nGovernment's acquisition and contract management workforce. We must \nrecognize that this corps of professionals make decisions every day \naffecting how hundreds of millions of Federal dollars are spent. For a \nnumber of years now, the acquisition workforce has been drastically \ndownsized and many of those remaining are eligible to retire.\n  Whether we are discussing quotas or the acquisition workforce, \nconcerns about competitive outsourcing within the Federal Government \nare essentially about accountability. Approximately 2 million Federal \nemployees and another 8 million private sector employees work for the \nGovernment on grants and contracts. This situation raises concerns \nabout who is ultimately responsible for contracted work. It also draws \nattention to the long-term implications of competitive outsourcing, \nboth in terms of money spent, efficiencies gained, and the retention of \ninstitutional knowledge and experienced Federal employees.\n  As we near the end of Public Service Recognition Week, I want to \nthank our acquisition workforce for their efforts in managing \nGovernment contracts. I also urge my colleagues to support efforts to \nincrease and train the acquisition workforce and implement the systems \nand structures needed to ensure that Government contracting is \ntransparent, accountable, cost effective, and fair to Federal workers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4991-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER THOMAS STEINER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, flags were flown at half-staff recently in \nmemory of Thomas J. Steiner, a California Highway Patrol, CHP, officer \nallegedly killed by a teenager who wanted to impress a gang. Officer \nSteiner was 35 years old and left behind a wife, Heidi, and two \nchildren, Bryan and Justin. I am honored to stand before my colleagues \nto memorialize this dedicated officer.\n  On Wednesday, April 21, 2004, shortly before 3 p.m., Officer Steiner \nexited the Pomona South Courthouse after testifying in traffic court. \nBefore he could get to his patrol car, shots were fired at the officer \nfrom behind the wheel of a car. Officer Steiner died at a local \nhospital later that evening. An arrest was made in the case.\n  Thomas Steiner died because he wore a uniform. Our law enforcement \nofficers know the dangers and demands of their profession, but despite \nthe daily challenges they face, they commit themselves to protecting \nothers and do so selflessly. A five-year CHP veteran, Officer Steiner \nclearly exemplified the very best. CHP Chief Mike Brown told a news \nsource that Steiner ``loved being a cop. He loved putting on the \nuniform. He wore it with pride.'' CHP Commissioner D.O. ``Spike'' \nHelmick called Steiner a ``quiet family man always ready to help.'' \nSteiner was also known as a mentor to newcomers to the department. He \nwill be deeply missed by all those privileged to have known him.\n  Officer Steiner's murder sent shockwaves through the community. \nSteiner was known as a solid officer and devoted family man. Whether \ndrinking his morning Gatorade at the station or bottle-feeding his baby \non the homefront, Officer Steiner's goals seemed to be simple: to do \nhis job well and be a good husband and father.\n  As the community reflects on the life and memory of Officer Steiner \nwith a very heavy heart, I salute his legacy as a dedicated officer and \nfamily man, and extend my deepest condolences to his entire family and \nto his friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4991-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4991-S4992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE EFFORTS TO ATTACH THE ENERGY BILL TO S. 150, THE INTERNET TAX BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to explain my votes on two \namendments that were offered to S. 150, the Internet access tax bill \nthat the Senate debated last week. I was pleased to support the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, No. \n3050. I support the renewable fuels title of this amendment and the \nmeasures that increase the supply of ethanol. I also support language \nto consolidate the number of reformulated gasoline blends. I have \nworked closely with Congressman Paul Ryan in an effort to reduce the \nnumber of Federal reformulated gasoline blends and increase gasoline \nsupplies. In recent years, fuel supply shocks such as pipeline problems \nand refinery fires have contributed significantly to gasoline price \nspikes in southern Wisconsin. Chicago and southeast Wisconsin use a \nspecialized blend of reformulated gasoline to meet Federal Clean Air \nAct requirements that is not used elsewhere in the country. When \nsupplies of this type of gasoline run low, Wisconsin is unable to draw \non supplies of gasoline from other areas.\n  I could not, however, support the amendment offered by the Senator\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, No. 2051. This so-called ``scaled down'' \nversion of the energy bill consists of 900 pages and contains many of \nthe worst provisions of the H.R. 6 conference report that failed to get \ncloture last fall. The entire Wisconsin congressional delegation voted \nagainst the bill last fall, and I cannot support the amendment either.\n  In addition to its fiscal implications, I am deeply concerned that \nthe amendment repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act. This \ncritical act protects consumers against abuses in the utility industry. \nRepeal of PUHCA would leave ratepayers vulnerable and spur further \nconsolidation in an industry that has already seen a number of mergers. \nFurthermore, the bill does not protect consumers from Enron-style \nelectricity trading practices and market manipulation. The Senate \nrecently went on record in support of an amendment by Senator Cantwell \nto bar such abusive practices and I am disappointed that the Domenici \namendment fails to include similar protections.\n  Also the amendment has serious environmental impacts. For example, \nthe amendment undercuts the Clean Air Act by postponing ozone \nattainment standards across the country. This issue was never \nconsidered in the House or Senate bill, but it was inserted in the \nenergy conference report. This rewrite of the Clean Air Act is not fair \nto cities like Milwaukee that have devoted significant resources to \nreducing ozone and cleaning up their air. And as asthma rates across \nthe country increase, this provision could severely undercut efforts to \nsafeguard the air quality of our citizens.\n  In addition to undermining air quality protection, the amendment \nallows for siting of transmission lines in national parks, grants \nexemptions from the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act for oil \nand gas companies, and pays oil and gas companies for their costs of \ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  I am also concerned that the taxpayers would pay $2 billion in \ntransition assistance for MTBE manufactures. MTBE is found in all 50 \nStates, and high levels are affecting drinking water systems all over \nthe Midwest, including 5,567 wells in 29 communities in Wisconsin, even \nthough the State only used MTBE gasoline for the first few weeks of the \nphase I program that began in January 1995.\n  This amendment also fails to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. The \nSenate energy bill contained a requirement that power companies provide \nat least 10 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like \nwind and solar power. The technical term is a renewable portfolio \nstandard. The amendment doesn't contain any renewable portfolio. \nstandard. There's no doubt that we can and should do better on \nrenewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.\n  For these reasons, I supported the Daschle amendment that contained \nthe energy bill's renewable fuels title, but I opposed the Domenici \namendment. I appreciate the need to develop a new energy strategy for \nthis country, and I hope that Congress will pass the portions of the \nenergy bill legislation that have widespread support so that we can \naddress the pressing energy needs of our country in a sensible way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4992-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDWIN COLODNY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Edwin \nI. Colodny, a native son of Burlington, VT, as this year's recipient of \nthe Burlington Business Association's Nate Harris Award. This award is \nconferred annually on an individual who exhibits the enthusiasm and \ndedication to maintain and improve the economic vitality of the \nBurlington region. Ed has supported the Burlington and greater Vermont \ncommunity in so many ways that all Vermonters owe him a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Ed was born in 1926 in Burlington and graduated from Burlington High \nSchool in 1944. He went on to receive an A.B. degree from the \nUniversity of Rochester in 1948, and an LL.B. from Harvard Law School \nin 1951. From 1975 to 1991, Ed was president and chief executive \nofficer of US Airways, Inc. and was also president and chief executive \nofficer of US Airways Group from 1978 to 1991, and chairman of the \nboard from 1978 to 1992.\n  More recently, Ed served as the interim president of the University \nof Vermont and interim president and chief executive officer of \nFletcher Allen Health Care, Vermont's premiere medical treatment \nfacility, during critical change periods at both institutions. Ed also \nserved as chairman of the board of Comsat Corporation, a leading \nprovider of global satellite and digital networking services, which \nmerged into Lockheed Martin Corporation.\n  I have admired the breadth and depth of Ed's business experience and \nhis ability to collaborate with all partners involved in complex \nmatters. His career-long dedication to fair and equitable treatment for \nworkers and a desire to look for winning solutions to problems has set \nhim apart from many of his peers. He understands the dynamics of a \nhealthy business climate while maintaining a respect for the different \nneeds and expertise of other participants.\n  Ed works tirelessly for the well being of Vermont and its people. He \nnow serves as chair of a Vermont committee to clean up Lake Champlain, \none of Vermont's natural jewels. He continues to sit on numerous non-\nprofit boards such as Vermont Law School, Shelburne Museum, Vermont \nSymphony Orchestra, Vermont Mozart Festival and he is of counsel to the \nlaw firm of Dinse, Knapp & McAndrew in Burlington, VT.\n  There are a very few people in this world who have given so much and \nasked so little in return. I hope Ed Colodny knows that his years of \nservice have not gone unnoticed. This award shows how much he is \nappreciated, even though it is impossible for us to fully recognize his \nmany contributions.\n  I am so proud to stand here and tell you about such a great \nVermonter. I wish him my deepest congratulations for an award he so \ngreatly deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4992-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE LIFE OF ELLIOTT MARANISS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to Elliott Maraniss, a journalist whose work invariably \nserved the cause of justice. Though he passed away on May 1, his work, \nand his commitment to the community he served, will leave an indelible \nmark on our State.\n  Maraniss, who rose to become editor of Madison's Capital Times \nnewspaper, first made his mark in Wisconsin as a reporter for that \npaper, with award-winning investigative stories about river pollution, \ncontroversy at the UW-Medical School, and a UW-Madison boxing scandal. \nHe went on to serve as city editor, managing editor, and finally \neditor, a post he held from 1978 until he retired in 1983. As an editor \nhe was known for being a mentor, for spotting talented new reporters, \nand for caring deeply about his staff.\n  His leadership and integrity in the newsroom were legendary, and it \nwas on those qualities, as well as his journalistic skills, that he \nbuilt his outstanding career.\n  His commitment to justice was lifelong, and he inspired many others \nthrough his work. A World War II veteran, he saw injustice firsthand in \nthe still-segregated Army, where he served as captain of an all-\nAfrican-American unit. Later in life he entered the political realm, \nworking for Milwaukee Mayor Henry Maier after retiring from the Capital \nTimes.\n  I extend my condolences to his wife, Mary, and to his family and \nfriends. His passing is a great loss for all those who knew him, and \nfor everyone who understands the powerful contributions that \njournalists can make when they are fiercely committed to the truth, and \nto the cause of justice. So today I join his many family and friends in \npaying tribute to his memory. He will be long remembered for his \noutstanding service to the Capital Times and to his community, and for \nhis many contributions to the State of Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4992-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4992-S4993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DEPUTY JOHN PAUL SANDLIN: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to honor and share with my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nthe memory of a remarkable man, Reserve Deputy John Sandlin of Solano \nCounty, who died Friday, April 23, 2004. Deputy Sandlin spent almost 50 \nyears working to protect his fellow citizens, serving a distinguished \ncareer in the Navy and as a volunteer deputy with the Solano County \nSheriff's Office. Deputy Sandlin was killed in the line of duty when \nhis patrol car spun out of control during a recent pursuit.\n  John Sandlin was the devoted husband of Dr. Kay Talbot and the proud \nfather of three daughters, Lizabeth, Lori and Susan. He was also the \nproud grandfather of seven grandchildren.\n  Deputy Sandlin compiled a remarkable record in community policing \nwith the Solano County Sheriff's Office, becoming its second most \nhighly decorated officer. He spent 20 years as a volunteer reserve \ndeputy who patrolled the streets most Friday nights for the past \ndecade. Last May, he earned the Sheriff's Office Distinguished Service \nMedal and the Purple Heart. Sheriff Gary Stanton said of Deputy \nSandlin, ``We lost a brother--a man who has been part of our department \nfor 20 years.''\n  Before joining the Solano County Sheriff's Office, John served in the \nNavy for 22 years. He became a nuclear power instructor, served in the \nSubmarine Service, and was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for \nsaving another's life. He attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander \nwhile on active duty.\n  John Sandlin also spent 14 years at Westinghouse Electric Corporation \nas a Senior Mechanical Engineer and Documentation Manager. During his \ncareer at Westinghouse, he was sworn in as a reserve deputy sheriff \nwith the Solano County Sheriff's Air Squadron. He earned the 1990 \nCommunity Service Award for his dedication to law enforcement and drug \nsurveillance activities with the Solano County Sheriff's Department.\n  After retiring from Westinghouse, he soon entered the patrol field \ntraining program in the Sheriff's Office and began to work on the \nground, patrolling the streets to protect his community.\n  John Sandlin died doing what he loved to do--providing protection for \nhis community. He was a natural leader, a compassionate mentor, and an \nenthusiastic, charming and very well-liked member of the Sheriff's \nOffice. We will always be grateful for Deputy Sandlin's heroic service \ndefending our Nation and our freedoms, and protecting his \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4993-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARD HONOREES\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I recognize Meghan Pasricha \nand Andrew Bell for being selected as two of the Nation's top youth \nvolunteers in the ninth annual Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. \nThis is an extraordinary honor. More than 24,000 young people across \nthe country were considered for this recognition each year.\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, created by Prudential \nFinancial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals, NASSP, constitutes America's largest youth \nrecognition program based exclusively on volunteerism. The awards are \ndesigned to emphasize the importance that our Nation places on service \nto others and to encourage young Americans of all backgrounds to \ncontribute to their communities.\n  Meghan Pasricha was named as one of America's top 10 youth volunteers \nfor 2004. Selected from more than 2,000 applicants, she received \n$5,000, an engraved gold medallion and a crystal trophy from her \nschool, Sanford School. In addition, she will have $25,000 in toys, \nclothing and other juvenile products donated in her name to needy \nchildren in the area by Kids in Distressed Situations, Inc.\n  Meghan Pasricha, 18, of Hockessin, is a senior at Sanford School. \nMeghan started an antitobacco club at her school that has since \ndeveloped into a full-blown campaign to educate young people across the \ncountry and overseas about the hazards of smoking. When Meghan heard \nthat her State legislature was considering a ban on indoor smoking, she \npaid close attention. After learning that most smokers start before \nthey turn 18, Meghan founded the Anti-Tobacco Action Club at her \nschool. With a grant from the American Lung Association and the \nDelaware Health Fund, she recruited a core team of volunteers, led \nmeetings, planned a year-long series of antitobacco activities, created \ntraining and presentation materials, and conducted 12 tobacco awareness \nworkshops for school and youth groups. She also set up a tobacco \neducation booth at a school health fair, published a newsletter and \nhelped other Delaware schools start tobacco education programs. And by \nwriting newspaper articles and speaking publicly, she helped mobilize \nyouth support for the enactment of one of the Nation's toughest indoor \nsmoking bans.\n  On a visit to India, Meghan observed how young people there are \ntargeted by tobacco sellers, so she trained a group of youth advocates \nto raise awareness in a number of villages. Later, Meghan presented her \nproject at the World Conference on Tobacco in Finland, and worked with \nyouth advocates from nine other nations to prepare a World Health \nOrganization Youth Action Guide and video. ``I am convinced that a \nsingle person, even if young and inexperienced, can become a catalyst \nfor change,'' she said. ``Young people are often told that they are \n`leaders of tomorrow.' I urge young people to become leaders today.''\n  Andrew Bell of Seaford was selected as one of Delaware's top youth \nvolunteers for 2004. He received a $1,000 award and was congratulated \nby Academy Award winning actress and comedian, Whoopi Goldberg. He also \nreceived an engraved silver medallion and a trip to Washington, DC, for \nthe program's national recognition events.\n  Twelve-year-old Andrew, a sixth grader at Sussex Academy of Arts and \nSciences, helped collect shoes, socks, and shoelaces for needy orphans \naround the world. Andrew started the project by writing letters to the \nfour elementary school principals in his hometown of Seaford, asking \nthem for permission to collect donations in their schools. He wrote \narticles for his school newsletters, created handouts and brochures \nexplaining the purpose of his project, decorated collection boxes for \neach of the four schools, and solicited donations from local department \nstores. Some 300 pairs of shoes, 83 pairs of socks and 15 pairs of \nshoelaces were collected for this effort. From there, the items were \nsent to the Buckner Orphan Care facility in Texas. The items were then \ndistributed worldwide to orphans in need. Andrew felt that this project \nwas important because ``many children on Earth are poor, and not very \nmany people are trying to help them.''\n  Today, I rise to congratulate Meghan and Andrew. These youngsters \ninspire examples of community spirit and leadership. They serve as role \nmodels not only to their peers, but to all of us, as well as to the \npeople they have touched through community service. They represent the \nState of Delaware at its very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4993-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4993-S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ALAMEDA CORRIDOR TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY'S EARLY LOAN REPAYMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

He has been an ordained priest \nfor 38 years. Throughout his years as a pastor, Father Deatrick served \nas chaplain at St. Xavier High School as well as Bellermine University \nwhere he also served as the Bellermine Knights baseball coach. He has \nremained a steadfast baseball fan throughout the years and attends the \nNational spring training camp in Florida when he gets the opportunity.\n  Father Deatrick has been the pastor at St. Martha for 11 years.

Mr. President, on May 1-3, 2004, over 1,200 \nstudents from across the United States visited our Nation's Capital to \ntake part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution. This program, administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation and funded by the Department of Education, was developed \nspecifically to educate young people about our great Constitution and \nBill of Rights.\n  I am proud to announce that students from East Brunswick High School \nin East Brunswick, NJ, won first place in this prestigious academic \nevent. After winning the statewide competition, these outstanding \nstudents demonstrated superior knowledge of the U.S. Constitution \nduring the national competition.\n  The 3-day We the People competition is modeled after Congressional \nhearings. First, the students are given an opportunity to exhibit their \nknowlege before a panel of adult judges while they evaluate, take, and \ndefend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their \ntestimony is followed by questions designed to probe the students' \ndepth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional \nknowledge.\n  This innovative program continues to be one of the best antidotes to \napathy and cynicism in our Nation. Numerous evaluations and independent \nstudies have validated the effectiveness of the We the People program \non students' civic knowledge and attitudes. The program helps students \nto develop an increased understanding of the institutions of \nconstitutional democracy and the fundamental principals and values upon \nwhich they are founded. It also teaches students the skills necessary \nto participate as effective and responsible citizens.\n  I commend the students from East Brunswick High School on their \nexceptional achievement--their accomplishment is truly inspiring. I \nwish them the best of luck in learning and advocating the fundamental \nideals that identify us as a people and bind us together as a \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4994-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4994-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S4994-5", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2315.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. \n101 et seq.) to establish a Geospatial Management Office within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to establish and maintain geospatial \npreparedness for homeland security purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homeland \nSecurity Geospatial Information Act of 2004 which would create a \nGeospatial Management Office within the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS). Geospatial information is a critical component of effective \nplanning for homeland security.\n  My interest in homeland security geospatial information developed out \nof my efforts to ensure support for pre-disaster mitigation programs, \nsuch as Project Impact. Project Impact was started by FEME in 1997 to \nhelp communities become disaster-resistant by preventing damage and \nloss of life and property during a disaster and reducing recovery time \nand costs afterwards.\n  Geospatial technologies, such as satellite imagery and aerial \nphotography, provide data that create the maps and charts that can help \nprevent a disaster from occurring or lessen the impact of an \nunforeseeable event by equipping first responders with up-to-date \ninformation. In the event of a terrorist chemical attack, knowing which \nway a contaminated plume will travel can save lives. Similarly, the \ndamage of a natural disaster, such as wildfire, can be lessened by maps \nthat help predict which areas will be in the path of the blaze.\n  My own State of Hawaii is vulnerable to hurricanes, torrential rains \nand flooding, tsunamis, droughts, earthquakes, and even wildfires. Four \nyears ago, flooding on the islands of Hawaii and Maui caused \napproximately $20 million in damage to private and public facilities. \nIn order to predict floods more accurately, local officials need \ncurrent, interoperable data on water levels and surrounding \ninfrastructure so that accurate maps predicting the flow of water can \nbe created on demand. Accurate maps are also critical for swift and \nsafe evacuation procedures.\n  All levels of government are more effective and efficient when \nemploying geospatial technology, especially in the area of homeland \nsecurity. Its uses include, but are not limited to: disaster early \nwarning and mitigation, border monitoring, criminal investigations, \npublic health protection, and critical infrastructure oversight.\n  In the past, geospatial information management has been done in a \npiecemeal fashion. Domestic geospatial data procurement and sharing is \npoorly coordinated and managed. According to a 2003 study by Cary and \nAssociates, a geotechnology consulting firm, the Federal \nGovernment spends $5 billion per year on geospatial goods and \ntechnologies. This figure does not include the amount being spent by \nState and local agencies, which some experts estimate is two to three \ntimes that of the\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nFederal Government. It is also estimated that at least half of the \ngovernment's geospatial spending is going towards redundant activities.\n\n  During a House Government Reform hearing in June 2003, Mark Forman, \nthen the Administrator of the Office of E-Government and Information \nTechnology, admitted that the Office of Management and Budget had no \nidea how much money federal agencies spend on geospatial procurement.\n  The Administration's current solution to this problem is Geospatial \nOne-Stop, an online portal where organizations and individuals can \naccess geospatial information developed by Federal, State, and local \nagencies. While Geospatial One-Stop is a good sharing tool, it helps to \nreduce government redundancy only if agencies voluntarily access data \nfrom it instead of procuring the data themselves. With no one keeping a \nclose eye on an agency's geospatial spending, there is no incentive for \nit to utilize this tool.\n  The legacy agencies that make up DHS had traditionally managed their \nown geospatial procurement. But many of the homeland and non-homeland \nsecurity missions of DHS complement each other. Sharing maps and data \nreduces redundancy, provides savings, and ensures better information \nfor disaster response.\n  Currently, the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) is working to \nbreak down this geospatial stove piping within the Department by naming \na Geospatial Information Officer. However, there is no single office in \nDHS officially responsible for geospatial management, and therefore, no \ncorresponding budget. In the present structure, the Geospatial \nInformation Officer does not have the authority to compel the five DHS \ndirectorates to cooperate with his efforts. The entire agency should \nmake geospatial coordination a priority.\n  A geospatial management office needs to be created and codified \nwithin DHS. A congressionally mandated office would give the Geospatial \nInformation Officer more authority with which to do this job.\n  The Office of Geospatial Management has the potential to \nsignificantly increase the quality of the resources homeland security \nofficials rely on by reducing redundancy and improving the quality of \ngeospatial procurement. But in order to do this it needs authority and \nfunding.\n  This office would also serve as a mechanism for coordinating with \nState and local authorities. Much of the geospatial information \navailable today is created at the state and local levels. Centralizing \nthis information will make it more widely available to first responders \nand other homeland security officials.\n  The Homeland Security Geospatial Act of 2004, will address these \nneeds by: creating the Office of Geospatial Management under the CIO; \ngiving this office the responsibility for managing DHS geospatial \nactivities and coordinating with State and local officials on \ngeospatial initiatives that pertain to homeland security; and naming \nthe Department as member of the Geospatial One-Stop Board of Directors, \nwhich will give DHS a role in coordinating federal geospatial \nactivities.\n  We can improve the Department's mission of protecting America, while \nmaximizing the funds. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Graham of South Carolina):\n  S. 2392. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nrequire candidates to stand by their printed and Internet advertising, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Political \nCandidate Personal Responsibility Act,'' together with my colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Lindsey Graham. This bill would extend the \nsuccessful model of the ``Stand By Your Ad'' provision--which requires \ncandidates for Federal office to take explicit personal responsibility \nfor TV and radio ads--to additional types of media, including the \nInternet, that today aren't covered.\n  Although the elections of 2004 are still months away, the onslaught \nof political advertising has already begun. As the election nears, with \neach passing day, political ads become more and more prevalent.\n  But something is different this year. Two things, actually.\n  First, as anyone who watches television has probably noticed, this \nyear political ads feature a personal statement by the candidate saying \n``I'm so-and-so and I approved this message.'' The candidates are \ntaking full personal responsibility, clearly and publicly, for the \nadvertisements put out by their campaigns.\n  This is the direct result of the ``Stand By Your Ad'' provisions \nincluded in the McCain-Feingold campaign reform law. As the author of \nthe original ``Stand By Your Ad'' amendment, together with my good \nfriend Senator Collins, I'm proud of the effect our new requirement is \nhaving on the tone of radio and TV campaign ads. Already, in the first \nelection cycle where it applies, it's making a real difference.\n  The reason is simple. The public is turned off by aggressively \nnegative attack ads--and candidates know it. So when candidates have to \nassociate themselves in a personal manner with their ads, they are \ngoing to be extra careful about the tone. A nasty or controversial \nattack can backfire, leading to negative perceptions of the candidate \nwho approved it.\n  In short, candidates are thinking twice about the tone of the ads \nthey put on the air. Representatives of national, non-partisan campaign \nreform groups such as Common Cause, the Campaign Legal Center, \nDemocracy 21, and the Center for Responsive Politics have all been \nquoted in the press as saying that there has been a noticeable shift \naway from the overly negative attack ads of the past.\n  The second change this year is that Internet communications are \ncoming into their own as a vehicle for political advertising. Americans \nare spending more time online--plus many now have Internet connections \nand computing power that enables them to view video that matches the \nquality of television. Political campaigns have taken note, and have \nmade major strides in tapping into the tremendous potential of the \nInternet for reaching large numbers of people at low cost.\n  According to press reports, the Presidential campaigns already have \ne-mailed links to campaign videos to literally millions of people. \nThese Internet-based communications can spread like wildfire, because \neach recipient can easily forward them to others. Moreoever, Web videos \noften attract attention from the news media, so the message sometimes \nends up getting carried on television as well.\n  Political messages are also starting to appear on websites that carry \nbanner or pop-up ads. It has been estimated that politicians will spend \nan estimated $25 million this year on online ads.\n  The rise of Internet-based ads is not just a flash in the pan--it's a \ntrend that is sure to continue.\n  I have a long history of supporting the Internet, e-commerce, and \nInternet-based innovation. In politics as in so many other areas, the \nInternet brings exciting opportunities--in this case, to create new \navenues for democratic dialogue and engagement in the political \nprocess.\n  But I don't believe that the Internet should be allowed to become a \nvehicle for political candidates to sidestep existing campaign rules \nand engage in mudslinging without accountability.\n  The problem is, the scope of the ``Stand By Your Ad'' provisions is \nlimited. They only apply to television and radio ads. Internet \ncommunications are not covered. Nor are communications such as \nnewspaper ads or mass mailings.\n  Already, there are clear signs that highly negative ads are migrating \nto the Internet--in part because the ``Stand By Your Ad'' requirements \ndon't apply there. Here are a few recent press headlines:\n  ``Political Attack Ads Already Popping Up on the Web.''\n  ``Presidential Ad War Hits the Web--Harsh Attacks Leveled Online, \nWhere TV Rules Don't Apply.''\n  ``Political Smears Thrive Online.''\n\n  The ads these articles talk about aren't just ordinary text messages \nsent through e-mail or posted on a website.\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nOften, they are full, professionally produced videos, equal in quality \nto anything you might see on TV--and therefore packing the same \nemotional impact as a well crafted TV ad. But instead of using \nbroadcast, satellite, or cable, they are e-mailed to thousands or even \nmillions of Internet users.\n  So today, I am introducing the ``Political Candidate Personal \nResponsibility Act.'' You could also call it ``Stand By Your Ad II.'' \nThe basic idea is that what works for TV and radio should work for \nother types of communications as well. Candidates wishing to distribute \nnegative campaign materials via the Internet or the mail should be held \njust as accountable as they are now for ads they put on the air.\n  Specifically, the bill would require that campaign communications \nsuch as audio or video ads transmitted over the Internet, newspaper \nads, brochures, bulk mailings, bulk e-mail, and prerecorded telephone \ncalls--if they mention another candidate for the same office--must \ncarry a ``Stand By Your Ad'' disclaimer stating that the candidate \npersonally approved the message. For Internet audio or video and \nprerecorded phone calls, the requirements would be identical to those \nthat now apply to radio or television. For printed materials, whether \npaper or electronic, a picture of the candidate would be required to \naccompany the statement.\n  I believe that forcing candidates to take personal responsibility \nalso forces them to think long and hard about releasing the types of \naggressive negative attacks that have been growing all too common \nduring election seasons. This is important, because when people get \nturned off by the electoral process, voting and public involvement \nsuffer. Decreasing the amount of negativity in our political campaigns \nmay help reduce some of the cynicism about politics, and bring more \npeople back into the process.\n  I say to my colleagues, Stand By Your Ad is working. So let's take \nthe next step and extend this success to campaign communications \ngenerally. Let's build on the good work we've already done in getting \ncandidates to take responsibility for what they say.\n  And yes, I'm Ron Wyden, and I stand by this statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve aviation security; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat is intended to help the Transportation Security Administration \n(TSA) improve our Nation's aviation security system. All of us continue \nto have real concerns about our Nation's security given the threats \nthat we face, and aviation continues to be a focus of those that want \nto do us harm.\n  I, first, want to acknowledge the work of Senators McCain and \nHollings. We all have spent a lot of time thinking about the problems \nof our aviation system, and the threats our country faces in today's \nenvironment. Their support and thoughts have enabled all of us to put \ntogether a better piece of legislation, and we share a common goal--a \nbetter, and more secure, aviation system.\n  We began this process right after 9-11, but more needs to be done. \nMost of us understand that improvements have been made, but it has now \nbeen three years and we must complete the job. This bill, the Aviation \nSecurity Advancement Act, will move us further toward completion of \nthis task.\n  When terrorists hijacked airlines and used them as weapons of mass \ndestruction against our nation, the American people saw firsthand that \nwe were quite vulnerable to an unseen enemy, and that our way of life \nwas threatened in a way it had never been before. National security \nimmediately became the primary focus of our government, and many other \nprivate entities, as everyone understood that another failure of this \nmagnitude would be a devastating blow to the country.\n  In response to 9-11, Congress passed P.L. 107-71, the Aviation and \nTransportation Security Act or ATSA, which federalized the airport \nsecurity screener workforce and required an expansive strengthening of \naviation security in the U.S. As a frequent flier, I believe that the \nvast majority of travelers are confident in the new security regime and \nfeel that we are much safer than we were under the system that existed \nbefore. This confidence is borne out through increasing passenger \nlevels that are fast approaching those prior to the terror attacks in \n2001. With an increased volume of passenger flow and aircraft traffic \nwill come further challenges for aviation security. The Aviation \nSecurity Advancement Act is intended to help TSA foster a higher level \nof security than currently exists and focus on additional tasks that \nneed to be addressed in this rapidly changing environment.\n  Yet I continue to be completely frustrated by the progress we are \nmaking with respect to screener effectiveness. Testimony before our \nCommittee, public reports and recent editorials, all tell us that we \ncan not rest until the effectiveness of screeners is improved. In \naddition, new technologies need to be deployed to help them do their \njobs. We can not spend billions of dollars on a system and have it \nbarely measure up to pre-9-11 days.\n  The Aviation Security Advancement Act takes needed steps to bolster \naviation security and provides TSA the financial and physical support \nneeded to close numerous loopholes in the current security regime. In \nresponse to\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nthe increasing use of aviation by the traveling public, this \nlegislation standardizes the Federal screener workforce and requires \nTSA make efforts to improve the efficiency of passenger screening to \ninsure individuals are processed in a faster, more secure manner. To \naddress shortcomings in cargo security, the bill would overhaul all-\ncargo aviation security by implementing recommendations developed by \nthe Aviation Security Advisory Committee and by funding a new grant \nprogram to pursue technological improvements that will help secure \nfreight on all-cargo and passenger aircraft. The bill also seeks to \nincrease the efficiency of baggage screening by funding capital \nsecurity projects at airports across the country, while providing money \nfor the research and development of advanced screening machines, and \nmandating a schedule for in-line placement of Explosive Detection \nSystems rather than various alternative means now practiced at many \nairports.\n  In addition, the bill would mandate improvements to a number of other \nsectors of aviation security where I feel more needs to be done. Among \nthese efforts would be increased support for the Federal Air Marshal \nprogram, airport perimeter security, and intelligence information \nsharing. It also authorizes funding for TSA to develop a biometric \ncenter of excellence to focus on definitive identification of travelers \nand employees which I believe could have a dramatic impact on the speed \nof passenger screening while providing greater security for the entire \nsystem.\n  It is clear that we need to take more action to improve the security \nof our skies. The Aviation Security Advancement Act will be a big step \nin the right direction. I appreciate the support of Senators McCain and \nHollings and urge my colleagues to co-sponsor the bill so that we can \nmove it through the Committee quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 37. A bill to acknowledge a long history of official \ndepredations and ill-conceived policies by the United States Government \nregarding Indian Tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on \nbehalf of the United States; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  MR. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce before this \nbody a joint resolution that seeks to address an issue that has long \nlain unresolved. That issue is our Nation's relationship with the \nNative peoples of this land.\n  Long before 1776 and the establishment of the United States of \nAmerica, this land was inhabited by numerous nations. Like our Nation, \nmany of these peoples held a strong belief in the Creator and \nmaintained a powerful spiritual connection to this land. Since the \nformation of the American Republic, there have most certainly been \nnumerous conflicts between our Government and many of these Tribes--\nconflicts in which warriors on all sides fought courageously and in \nwhich all sides suffered. However, even from the earliest days of the \nRepublic, there existed a sentiment that honorable dealings and \npeaceful coexistence were preferable to bloodshed. Indeed, our \npredecessors in Congress in 1787 stated in the Northwest Ordinance, \n``The utmost good faith shall always be observed toward the Indians.''\n  Many treaties were made between this Republic and the American Indian \nTribes. Treaties, as my colleagues in this Chamber know, are far more \nthan words in a page. Treaties are our word, our bond. Treaties with \nother governments are not to be treated lightly. Unfortunately, too \noften the United States of America did not uphold its responsibilities \nas stated in its covenants with the Native American Tribes. Too often, \nour Government broke its oaths to the Native peoples.\n  I want my fellow Senators to know that this resolution does not \ndismiss the valiance of our American soldiers who bravely fought for \ntheir families in wars between the United States and different Indian \nTribes. Nor does this resolution cast all the blame for the various \nbattles on one side or another. What this resolution does do is \nrecognize and honor the importance of Native Americans to this land and \nto our Nation--in the past and today--and offers an official apology to \nthe Native peoples for the poor and painful choices our Government \nsometimes made to disregard its solemn word.\n  This is a resolution of apology and a resolution of reconciliation. \nIt is a first step toward healing the wounds that have divided us for \nso long--a potential foundation for a new era of positive relations \nbetween Tribal governments and the Federal Government. It is time--it \nis past time--for us to heal our land of division, all divisions, and \nbring us together as one people.\n  Before reconciliation, there must be recognition and repentance. \nBefore there is a durable relationship, there must be understanding. \nThis resolution will not authorize or serve as a settlement of any \nclaim against the United States, nor will it resolve the many\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nchallenges still facing the Native peoples. But it does recognize the \nnegative impact of numerous deleterious Federal acts and policies on \nNative Americans and their cultures.\n  Moreover, it begins the effort of reconciliation by recognizing the \npast wrongs and repenting for them.\n  Martin Luther King, a true reconciler, once said, ``The end is \nreconciliation, the end is redemption, the end is the creation of the \nbeloved community.'' This resolution is not the end. But, perhaps it \nsignals the beginning of the end of division and the faint first light \nand first fruits of the creation of beloved community.\n  I have worked with the chairman and ranking member of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, Senator Campbell and Senator Inouye, in the crafting \nof this resolution, I also reached out to the Native Tribes as this \nbill was being formed, and I continue to receive helpful and supportive \nfeedback. I ask that my colleagues in this Chamber, and those in the \nHouse of Representatives, join together in support of this important \nresolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 37\n\n       To acknowledge a long history of official depredations and \n     ill-conceived policies by the United States Government \n     regarding Indian Tribes and offer an apology to all Native \n     Peoples on behalf of the United States.\n       Whereas the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited \n     the land of the present-day United States since time \n     immemorial and for thousands of years before the arrival of \n     peoples of European descent;\n       Whereas the Native Peoples have for millennia honored, \n     protected, and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       Whereas the Native Peoples are spiritual peoples with a \n     deep and abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia \n     their peoples have maintained a powerful spiritual connection \n     to this land, as is evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       Whereas the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a \n     new chapter in the histories of the Native Peoples;\n       Whereas, while establishment of permanent European \n     settlements in North America did stir conflict with nearby \n     Indian Tribes, peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions \n     also took place;\n       Whereas the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of the Native Peoples \n     in their vicinities;\n       Whereas in the infancy of the United States, the founders \n     of the Republic expressed their desire for a just \n     relationship with the Indian Tribes, as evidenced by the \n     Northwest Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins \n     with the phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be \n     observed toward the Indians'';\n       Whereas Indian Tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened and grew, including \n     invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on \n     their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific \n     Coast;\n       Whereas Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts;\n       Whereas the United States Government violated many of the \n     treaties ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements \n     with Indian Tribes;\n       Whereas this Nation should address the broken treaties and \n     many of the more ill-conceived Federal policies that \n     followed, such as extermination, termination, forced removal \n     and relocation, the outlawing of traditional religions, and \n     the destruction of sacred places;\n       Whereas the United States forced Indian Tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Indian Removal Act of 1830;\n       Whereas many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (1) during the execution of the official United States \n     Government policy of forced removal, including the infamous \n     Trail of Tears and Long Walk;\n       (2) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (3) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       Whereas the United States Government condemned the \n     traditions, beliefs, and customs of the Native Peoples and \n     endeavored to assimilate them by such policies as the \n     redistribution of land under the General Allotment Act of \n     1887 and the forcible removal of Native children from their \n     families to faraway boarding schools where their Native \n     practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       Whereas officials of the United States Government and \n     private United States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the \n     unlawful acquisition of recognized Tribal land, the theft of \n     resources from such territories, and the mismanagement of \n     Tribal trust funds;\n       Whereas the policies of the United States Government toward \n     Indian Tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian \n     Tribes have contributed to the severe social ills and \n     economic troubles in many Native communities today;\n       Whereas, despite continuing maltreatment of Native Peoples \n     by the United States, the Native Peoples have remained \n     committed to the protection of this great land, as evidenced \n     by the fact that, on a per capita basis, more Native people \n     have served in the United States Armed Forces and placed \n     themselves in harm's way in defense of the United States in \n     every major military conflict than any other ethnic group;\n       Whereas Indian Tribes have actively influenced the public \n     life of the United States by continued cooperation with \n     Congress and the Department of the Interior, through the \n     involvement of Native individuals in official United States \n     Government positions, and by leadership of their own \n     sovereign Indian Tribes;\n       Whereas Indian Tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       Whereas the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to the Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       Whereas Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and that among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND APOLOGY.\n\n     The United States, acting through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     the Indian Tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors the Native Peoples for the \n     thousands of years that they have stewarded and protected \n     this land;\n       (3) acknowledges years of official depredations, ill-\n     conceived policies, and the breaking of covenants by the \n     United States Government regarding Indian Tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     offenses and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the offenses of the \n     United States against Indian Tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land by \n     providing a proper foundation for reconciliation between the \n     United States and Indian Tribes; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian Tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian Tribes within their boundaries.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISCLAIMER.\n\n       Nothing in this Joint Resolution authorizes any claim \n     against the United States or serves as a settlement of any \n     claim against the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S5003-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5003-S5004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 353--DESIGNATING MAY 2004 AS ``OLDER AMERICANS' \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 353\n\n       Whereas today's older Americans are living longer, \n     healthier, and more productive lives than any other time in \n     our history, and;\n       Whereas older Americans exemplify the theme of ``Aging \n     Well, Living Well'' by continuing to give their time to our \n     communities, their knowledge to our children, their \n     experience to our workplace, and their wisdom to all of us, \n     and;\n       Whereas there are now more than 50,000 people in the United \n     States 100 years old or older, and;\n       Whereas more than 47 million Americans are now 60 years old \n     or older, and;\n       Whereas the opportunities and challenges that await our \n     Nation require our Nation to continue to commit to the goal \n     of improving the quality of life for all older Americans;\n       Whereas it is appropriate for our Nation to continue the \n     tradition of designating the month of May as a time to \n     celebrate the contributions of older Americans and to \n     rededicate its effort to respect and better serve older \n     Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 2004, as `Older Americans Month';\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\n       (2) commends the President on the issuance of his \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe such month with appropriate ceremonies and activities \n     that publicly reaffirm our gratitude and respect for older \n     Americans.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nhonoring May as Older Americans' Month.\n  I am here today to celebrate May as Older Americans' Month. Since \n1963, May has been the official month during which we pay tribute to \nthe contributions of our 47 million older Americans. It is during this \nmonth that we, as a Nation, recognize older Americans for their \nservice, hard work and sacrifice that helped assure us the freedom and \nsecurity which we continue to cherish.\n  This year's theme of ``Aging Well, Living Well'' reflects the \nlifestyle and attitude of today's older Americans. Not only should we \ntake this time to show our appreciation and respect for America's \nseniors, but also to acknowledge that seniors of today and tomorrow \nwill continue making significant contributions to our communities \nthrough their wisdom and experience, in the workplace, in civic \nleadership and in our homes. They gave, they give, and they will \ncontinue to give to this country.\n  I am committed to working hard on behalf of our seniors. As the \nChairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, we have pursued an \nambitious agenda. The committee has examined issues including the \nMedicare law, long-term care policy, internet fraud, Social Security, \nassistive technology, the Older Americans Act, and healthy aging.\n  In addition, this year I believe we have special reason to celebrate. \nLast year, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, \nand Modernization Act of 2003. I am especially pleased that we are now \nable to provide prescription drug benefits to those seniors most in \nneed. This is an important step in putting Medicare on a more modern \nand secure footing as the 77-million-strong Baby Boomer generation \nmoves closer to retirement age.\n  Our commitment to America's seniors must continue beyond this one \nmonth of special recognition. With re-authorization of the Older \nAmericans' Act on the horizon, we have an opportunity to focus on the \nneeds of today's seniors, and the challenges that the baby boomer \ngeneration will bring. It is also an opportunity to design an act that \npromotes seamlessness and one that works well with other programs and \ninitiatives to promote non-institutional care, maximizing successful \noutcomes, and empower older Americans to optimize autonomy and \nindependence and one that promotes ``Aging Well and Living Well.''.\n  Seniors are living longer, healthier, and more productive lives than \nany other time in our history. In the tradition of Older Americans' \nMonth, I am submitting a resolution in the Senate calling on the people \nof the United States to observe the month of May 2004 as Older \nAmericans' Month and to encourage all Americans to promote awareness \nthrough ceremonies, programs, and other activities that promote \nacknowledgment, gratitude, and respect for American seniors.\n  I ask all of you to celebrate with me Older Americans' Month this \nMay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 354--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE ABU \n   GHRAIB PRISON MUST BE DEMOLISHED TO UNDERSCORE THE UNITED STATES' \n          ABHORRENCE OF THE MISTREATMENT OF PRISONERS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n       Whereas the Abu Ghraib prison was used by Saddam Hussein to \n     execute and torture thousands of men, women, and children;\n       Whereas Saddam and his Special Security Organization \n     oversaw the execution of thousands of political prisoners;\n       Whereas the Abu Ghraib prison is notoriously known as a \n     death chamber by the Iraqi people;\n       Whereas the Abu Ghraib prison is arguably the largest and \n     most feared prison in the Arab world;\n       Whereas it is widely known that one of Saddam's sons, in \n     one day, ordered the execution of 3000 prisoners at the \n     prison;\n       Whereas the recent reports of atrocities and abhorrent \n     mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison are \n     un-American, do not represent our values, and have sent the \n     wrong message about the United States' intentions in Iraq;\n       Whereas the American people will not tolerate the \n     mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners;\n       Whereas the American people view this prison as a symbol of \n     evil, and where past cruel torture and mistreatment occurred;\n       Whereas the American people would like to rid the world of \n     this evil place where past, and unfortunately current \n     reported mistreatment has occurred; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the Abu \n     Ghraib prison, also known as the Baghdad Central Detention \n     Center, be completely demolished as an expression and \n     symbolic gesture that the American people will not tolerate \n     the past and current mistreatment of prisoners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 355--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n           COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. DASCHLE) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 104\n\n       Whereas knowledge, wisdom, and children are the greatest \n     assets of a democracy;\n       Whereas books enable one generation to pass on its \n     knowledge and wisdom to the next;\n       Whereas learning to read is one of the greatest privileges \n     the Nation extends to its children;\n       Whereas children most often choose mysteries as their \n     favorite books;\n       Whereas the Mystery Writers of America sponsors Kids Love a \n     Mystery, an outreach program designed to bring mystery \n     writers and children together to encourage literacy and the \n     love of reading; and\n       Whereas the Mystery Writers of America recognizes the value \n     in celebrate the importance of reading for children: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Kids Love a Mystery is a program that helps promote \n     literacy and reading and should be supported and encouraged; \n     and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation encouraging \n     the people of the United States and interested groups to \n     promote Kids Love a Mystery with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S5004-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5004-S5005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3119.

The Taiwanese Ministry of \n     Foreign Affairs also donated $200,000 in relief aid to the \n     Salvadoran Government.\n       [(8) The World Health Assembly has allowed observers to \n     participate in the activities of the organization, including \n     the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, the Order of \n     Malta, and the Holy See in the early 1950's.\n       [(9) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations.\n       [(10) Public Law 106-137 required the Secretary of State to \n     submit a report to Congress on efforts by the executive \n     branch to support Taiwan's participation in international \n     organizations, in particular the WHO.\n       [(11) In light of all benefits that Taiwan's participation \n     in the WHO can bring to the state of health not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, Taiwan and its \n     23,500,000 people should have appropriate and meaningful \n     participation in the WHO.\n       [(12) On May 11, 2001, President Bush stated in a letter to \n     Senator Murkowski that the\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\n     United States ``should find opportunities for Taiwan's voice \n     to be heard in international organizations in order to make a \n     contribution, even if membership is not possible'', further \n     stating that the administration ``has focused on finding \n     concrete ways for Taiwan to benefit and contribute to the \n     WHO''.\n       [(13) In his speech made in the World Medical Association \n     on May 14, 2002, Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n     Tommy Thompson, announced ``America's work for a healthy \n     world cuts across political lines. That is why my government \n     supports Taiwan's efforts to gain observership status at the \n     World Health Assembly. We know this is a controversial issue, \n     but we do not shrink from taking a public stance on it. The \n     people of Taiwan deserve the same level of public health as \n     citizens of every nation on earth, and we support them in \n     their efforts to achieve it''.\n       [(14) The Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan, in \n     response to an appeal from the United Nations and the United \n     States for resources to control the spread of HIV/AIDS, \n     donated $1,000,000 to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria in December 2002.\n       [(15) In 2003, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory \n     Syndrome (SARS) caused 73 deaths in Taiwan.\n       [(16) Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has \n     reemerged in Asia with strains of the influenza reported by \n     the People's Republic of China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, \n     Pakistan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos.\n       [(17) The SARS and avian influenza outbreaks illustrate \n     that disease knows no boundaries and emphasize the importance \n     of allowing all people access to the WHO.\n       [(18) As the pace of globalization quickens and the spread \n     of infectious disease accelerates, it is crucial that all \n     people, including the people of Taiwan, be given the \n     opportunity to participate in international health \n     organizations such as the WHO.\n       [(19) The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     acknowledged during the 2003 World Health Assembly meeting \n     that ``[t]he need for effective public health exists among \n     all peoples''.\n       [(b) Plan.--The Secretary of State is authorized to--\n       [(1) initiate a United States plan to endorse and obtain \n     observer status for Taiwan at the annual week-long summit of \n     the World Health Assembly in May 2004 in Geneva, Switzerland;\n       [(2) instruct the United States delegation to the World \n     Health Assembly in Geneva to implement that plan; and\n       [(3) introduce a resolution in support of observer status \n     for Taiwan at the summit of the World Health Assembly.\n       [(c) Report.--Not later than 14 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     report to Congress in unclassified form describing the action \n     taken to carry out the plan described in subsection (b).]\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Taiwanese Ministry of \n     Foreign Affairs also donated $200,000 in relief aid to the \n     Salvadoran Government.\n       (8) The World Health Assembly has allowed observers to \n     participate in the activities of the organization, including \n     the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, the Order of \n     Malta, and the Holy See in the early 1950's.\n       (9) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations.\n       (10) Public Law 106-137 required the Secretary of State to \n     submit a report to Congress on efforts by the executive \n     branch to support Taiwan's participation in international \n     organizations, in particular the WHO.\n       (11) In light of all benefits that Taiwan's participation \n     in the WHO can bring to the state of health not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, Taiwan and its \n     23,500,000 people should have appropriate and meaningful \n     participation in the WHO.\n       (12) On May 11, 2001, President Bush stated in a letter to \n     Senator Murkowski that the United States ``should find \n     opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in international \n     organizations in order to make a contribution, even if \n     membership is not possible'', further stating that the \n     administration ``has focused on finding concrete ways for \n     Taiwan to benefit and contribute to the WHO''.\n       (13) In his speech made in the World Medical Association on \n     May 14, 2002, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy \n     Thompson announced ``America's work for a healthy world cuts \n     across political lines. That is why my government supports \n     Taiwan's efforts to gain observership status at the World \n     Health Assembly. We know this is a controversial issue, but \n     we do not shrink from taking a public stance on it. The \n     people of Taiwan deserve the same level of public health as \n     citizens of every nation on earth, and we support them in \n     their efforts to achieve it''.\n       (14) The Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan, in \n     response to an appeal from the United Nations and the United \n     States for resources to control the spread of HIV/AIDS, \n     donated $1,000,000 to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria in December 2002.\n       (15) In 2003, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory \n     Syndrome (SARS) caused 84 deaths in Taiwan.\n       (16) Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has \n     reemerged in Asia, with strains of the influenza reported by \n     the People's Republic of China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, \n     Pakistan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos.\n       (17) The SARS and avian influenza outbreaks illustrate that \n     disease knows no boundaries and emphasize the importance of \n     allowing all people access to the WHO.\n       (18) As the pace of globalization quickens and the spread \n     of infectious disease accelerates, it is crucial that all \n     people, including the people of Taiwan, be given the \n     opportunity to participate in international health \n     organizations such as the WHO.\n       (19) The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     acknowledged during the 2003 World Health Assembly meeting \n     that ``[t]he need for effective public health exists among \n     all peoples''.\n       (b) Plan.--The Secretary of State is authorized to--\n       (1) initiate a United States plan to endorse and obtain \n     observer status for Taiwan at the annual week-long summit of \n     the World Health Assembly each year in Geneva, Switzerland;\n       (2) instruct the United States delegation to the World \n     Health Assembly in Geneva to implement that plan; and\n       (3) introduce a resolution in support of observer status \n     for Taiwan at the summit of the World Health Assembly.\n       (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan at the \n     Summit of the World Health Assembly.--Not later than 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, and not later \n     than April 1 of each year thereafter, the Secretary of State \n     shall submit a report to the Congress, in unclassified form, \n     describing the United States plan to endorse and obtain \n     observer status for Taiwan at the annual week-long summit of \n     the World Health Assembly (WHA) held by the World Health \n     Organization (WHO) in May of each year in Geneva, \n     Switzerland. Each report shall include the following:\n       (1) An account of the efforts the Secretary of State has \n     made, following the last meeting of the World Health \n     Assembly, to encourage WHO member states to promote Taiwan's \n     bid to obtain observer status.\n       (2) The steps the Secretary of State will take to endorse \n     and obtain observer status at the next annual meeting of the \n     World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 349\n\n       Whereas May 17, 2004, marks the 50th anniversary of the \n     Supreme Court decision in the case of Brown v. Board of \n     Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954);\n       Whereas in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. \n     537 (1896), the Supreme Court upheld the doctrine of \n     ``separate but equal'', which allowed the continued \n     segregation of common carriers, and, by extension, of public \n     schools, in the United States based on race;\n       Whereas racial segregation and the doctrine of ``separate \n     but equal'' resulted in separate schools, housing, and public \n     accommodations that were inferior and unequal for African-\n     Americans and many other minorities, severely limited the \n     educational opportunities of generations of racial \n     minorities, negatively impacted the lives of the people of \n     the United States, and inflicted severe harm on American \n     society;\n       Whereas in 1945, Mexican-American students in California \n     successfully challenged the constitutionality of their \n     segregation on the basis of national origin in Westminster \n     School District of Orange County v. Mendez (161 F.2d 774 (9th \n     Cir. 1947));\n       Whereas in 1951, Oliver Brown, on behalf of his daughter \n     Linda Brown, an African-American third grader, filed suit \n     against the Board of Education of Topeka after Linda was \n     denied admission to an all-white public school in Topeka, \n     Kansas;\n       Whereas in 1952, the Supreme Court combined Oliver Brown's \n     case (Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 98 F. Supp. 797 \n     (D. Kan. 1951)) with similar cases from Delaware (Gebhart v. \n     Belton, 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952)), South Carolina (Briggs v. \n     Elliott, 98 F. Supp. 529 (E.D.S.C. 1951)), and Virginia \n     (Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 103 F. \n     Supp. 337 (E.D. Va. 1952)) challenging racial segregation in \n     education and determined that the constitutionality of \n     segregation in public schools in the District of Columbia \n     would be considered separately in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. \n     497 (1954);\n       Whereas the students in these cases argued that the \n     inequality caused by the segregation of public schools was a \n     violation of their right to equal protection under the law;\n       Whereas on May 17, 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education of \n     Topeka, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of Plessy \n     v. Ferguson, concluding that ``in the field of public \n     education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no \n     place'' and, on that same date, in Bolling v. Sharpe, held \n     that the doctrine of ``separate but equal'' also violated the \n     fifth amendment to the Constitution; and\n       Whereas the decision in Brown v. Board of Education of \n     Topeka is of national importance and profoundly affected all \n     people of the United States by outlawing racial segregation \n     in education and providing a foundation on which to build \n     greater equality: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors May 17, 2004, as the 50th \n     anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board \n     of Education of Topeka;\n       (2) encourages all people of the United States to recognize \n     the importance of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. \n     Board of Education of Topeka; and\n       (3) acknowledges the need for the Nation to recommit to the \n     goals and purposes of this landmark decision to finally \n     realize the dream of equal educational opportunity for all \n     children of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S5023-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5023-S5025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Con. Res. 102 \nand the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 102) to express the \n     sense of the Congress regarding the 50th anniversary of the \n     Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of \n     Topeka.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to speak on \nbehalf of the passage of S. Con. Res. 102, which honours the 50th \nanniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, Brown et al. v. \nBoard of Education of Topeka, Kansas et al.\n  As you may know, the history of desegregating our public school \nsystem started before Brown with such cases as Murray v. Maryland and \nSweatt v. Painter. But it was Brown v. Board of Education that caught \nfire and changed the course of Americas history and the way in which we \nview equality in the eyes of the law.\n  Before Brown, many States held and enforced racially segregated laws \nenforced, which was an atrocious practice. Many individuals cited the \n1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case, which sanctioned the separate but equal \ndoctrine, as the grounds for keeping school segregation legal.\n  Oliver Brown, a citizen of Topeka, KS, along with other individuals, \nfiled a lawsuit against the Topeka School Board on behalf of his 7-\nyear-old daughter, Linda. Like other young African Americans, Linda had \nto cross a set of railroad tracks and board a bus to take her to the \n``colored'' school on the other side of the city from where she lived--\neven though a school for white children was located only a few blocks \nfrom her home.\n  There were many notable African Americans who helped to bring this \ncase to the United States Supreme Court; however, none so famous as \nSupreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who valiantly defended the \nrights of not only Linda Brown and the other defendants in the case, \nbut of an entire race of individuals who were treated as second class \ncitizens.\n  On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court rendered its decision to rule \nracial segregation in schools unconstitutional. Further, the Supreme \nCourt found the ``separate but equal'' doctrine to be in violation of \nthe 14th amendment of the United States Constitution, which states, \namong other things, that, ``no State shall make or enforce any law \nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the \nUnited States.''\n  When the Court ruled, in 1954, that school segregation laws were \nunconstitutional, the Supreme Court demolished the legal foundation on \nwhich racial segregation stood. The Court's opinion, written and \ndelivered by Chief Justice Earl Warren, also served as a stirring moral \nindictment of racial segregation, and an eloquent challenge to America \nto cast off its prejudices and extend its promises of life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness to all citizens, regardless of race or \ncolor.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many individuals \nwho worked tirelessly to ensure that the 50th anniversary celebration \nof this case is recognized world wide. Most notably, I would like to \nthank Cheryl Brown Henderson, the Brown Foundation and the Brown v. \nBoard of Education National Historic Site for their steadfast and \nunwavering commitment to the legacy established by the Brown decision. \nI would also like to thank and commend the work of the Brown v. Board \nof Education 50th Anniversary Commission. Finally I would like to \nrecognize all of the cases that comprise the Brown decision.\n\n\n             Belton v. Gebhart (Bulah v. Gibhart)--Delaware\n\n  First petitioned in 1951, the local cases, Belton v. Gebhart and \nBulah v. Gibhart, challenged the inferior conditions of two African \nAmerican schools. In the suburb of Claymont, DE, African American \nchildren were prohibited from attending the area's local high school. \nIn the rural community of Hockessin, Delaware, African American \nstudents were forced to attend a dilapidated one-room schoolhouse and \nwere not provided transportation to the school, while white children in \nthe area were provided transportation and a better school facility. \nBoth cases were represented by a local NAACP attorney. Though the State \nSupreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, the decision did not \napply to all schools in Delaware.\n\n\n   bolling, et. al. v. c. melvin sharpe, et.al.--district of columbia\n\n  Eleven African American Junior high School students were taken on a \nfield trip to Washington, D.C.'s new John Phillip Sousa School for \nwhites only. The African American students were denied admittance to \nthe school and ordered to return to their inadequate school. in 1951, a \nsuite was filed on behalf of the students. After review with\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\nthe Brown case in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation \nin the Nation's capital was unconstitutional.\n\n\n                         briggs v. r.w. elliott\n\n  In Claredon County, SC, the State NAACP first attempted, \nunsuccessfully and with a single plaintiff, to take legal action in \n1974 against the inferior conditions African American students \nexperienced under South Carolina's racially segregated school system. \nBy 1951, community activists convinced the African American parents to \njoin the NAACP efforts to file a class action suite in U.S. District \nCourt. The court found that the schools designated for African \nAmericans were grossly inadequate in terms of buildings, transportation \nand teacher's salaries when compared to the schools provided for \nwhites. An order to equalize the facilities was virtually ignored by \nschool officials and the schools were never made equal.\n\n\n                             brown v. board\n\n  In Kansas there were 11 school integration cases dating from 1881 to \n1949, prior to Brown in 1854. In many instances the schools for African \nAmerican children were substandard facilities with out-of-date \ntextbooks and often no basic school supplies. In the fall of 1950, \nmembers of the Topeka, Kansas Chapter of the NAACP agreed to again \nchallenge the ``separate but equal'' doctrine governing public \neducation. On February 28, 1951, the NAACP filed their case as Oliver \nL. Brown et al. vs. The Board of Education of Topeka Kansas, which \nrepresented a group of 13 parents and 20 children. The District Court \nruled in favor of the school board and the case was appealed to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. At the Supreme Court level, their case was combined \nwith other NAACP cases from Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia and \nWashington, D.C., which was later heard separately. The combined cases \nbecame known as Oliver L. Brown et. Al. vs. The Board of Education of \nTopeka, et al.\n\n\n      davis, et. al. v. prince edward county board of supervisors\n\n  One of the few public high schools available to African Americans in \nthe State of Virginia was Robert Moton High School in Prince Edward \nCounty. Built in 1943, it was never large enough to accommodate its \nstudent population. The gross inadequacies of these classrooms sparked \na student strike in 1951. The NAACP soon joined their struggles and \nchallenged the inferior quality of their school facilities in court. \nAlthough the U.S. District Court ordered that the plaintiffs be \nprovided with equal school facilities, they were denied access to the \nwhite schools in their area.\n  I am encouraged and hopeful that the Nation will join with me and \ncelebrate this magnificent achievement in American History.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Brown is honored as the lead plaintiff in \n     the Topeka, Kansas case which posed a legal challenge to \n     racial segregation in public education;\n        Whereas by 1950, African-American parents began to renew \n     their efforts to challenge State laws that only permitted \n     their children to attend certain schools, and as a result, \n     they organized through the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People (the NAACP), an organization \n     founded in 1909 to address the issue of the unequal and \n     discriminatory treatment experienced by African-Americans \n     throughout the country;\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown became part of the NAACP strategy \n     led first by Charles Houston and later by Thurgood Marshall, \n     to file suit against various school boards on behalf of such \n     parents and their children;\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown was a member of a distinguished \n     group of plaintiffs in cases from Kansas (Brown v. Board of \n     Education), Delaware (Gebhart v. Belton), South Carolina \n     (Briggs v.

Res. 355) to authorize the production of \n     records by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation has been conducting an oversight inquiry triggered by \npress reports and court records suggesting that United States Olympic \nsport athletes may have used banned performance-enhancing drugs without \ndetection. As part of its inquiry, the committee obtained by subpoena \ndocuments from a federal criminal investigation regarding the alleged \nsale and distribution of such drugs to U.S. Olympic sport athletes.\n  After conducting a confidential review of the subpoenaed records, the \ncommittee held a closed hearing on May 5, 2004, to explore whether \ncurrent U.S. Olympic sport athlete drug-testing policies, resources, \nand authority are sufficient to deter such athletes from using banned \nperformance-enhancing drugs. The committee specifically considered the \nimplications of the potential participation in this summer's Olympic \nGames of U.S. Olympic sport athletes who may have used banned \nperformance-enhancing drugs. Representatives of the United States \nOlympic Committee and of the United States Anti-Doping Agency testified \nat the committee's hearing.\n  Both organizations have requested that the committee share the \nconfidential records it received in the course of its inquiry with the \nU.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which is the independent agency that enforces \nanti-doping rules for the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Olympic sport \nfederations. Both organizations have advised the committee that they \nview it as critical to the credibility and reputation of American sport \nthat the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency obtain timely access to these records \nto enable it to use them as evidence, if justified, in disciplinary \nproceedings prior to the selection of the U.S. Olympic team that will \ncompete in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n  This resolution would authorize the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee, acting jointly, to provide documents from the \ncommittee's inquiry to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in response to these \nrequests.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, we have had a number of discussions as to \nhow we might go about finishing the FSC/ETI JOBS bill. Unfortunately, \nwe have\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\nbeen unable to reach an agreement this afternoon and tonight. It \nappears it will be necessary to file cloture tomorrow. We will continue \nto discuss our options on Friday and early next week, but I do believe \nthat it is now time for us to finish this bill. I am disappointed in \nthe number of amendments that Members have indicated they intend to \noffer, many of which have nothing to do with the underlying bill.\n  At this point, I announce that no rollcall votes will occur on \nFriday, and all Members should be aware that the next rollcall vote can \nbe expected Monday evening. I will say more on Monday's schedule \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I noticed in the statement of the leader--I \nthink it was a fair statement--that many amendments have nothing to do \nwith the underlying bill, and he didn't designate that only Democrats \nwere contemplating amendments that may not be pertinent to the bill. I \nam disappointed we have not been able to complete this legislation, as \nI indicated earlier. We are very close.\n  I repeat very quickly, because I have said it before, we have four \ncontentious amendments. The total time we would take would be an hour \nand 35 minutes. We have the Made in America amendment by Senator \nFeingold; the Lautenberg amendment dealing with foreign subsidiaries \ndoing business with terrorist nations; the Corzine amendment dealing \nwith section 301, which is having the President enforce the trade laws; \nthen we had unemployment compensation. I am disappointed that we have \nnot been able to get to those because I think it is important that we \nare able to do this bill.\n  We are going to pass this bill. It is only a question of time. This \nbill is so important that we, the Congress, and the President cannot \nleave here without passing this legislation. This is a must-pass piece \nof legislation. It is only a question of how we get there. I think we \nwould have been better off dealing with these amendments and going on \nto something else.\n  The leader made a decision that cloture must be filed, and time will \nonly tell whether cloture will be invoked. We have heard there may be \nan opportunity to vote on at least one of the contentious amendments. I \nhope that is the case. That may make things a little better. Everybody \nhas tried hard and, in my opinion, it is not the fault of the managers \nof the bill. I know they have devoted a lot of time, energy, and effort \nto this most important piece of legislation. I understand where we are \nprocedurally. I understand what the leader has stated.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, in response, we have had a \nvery productive week. As I set out really 2 weeks ago, and again last \nFriday and Monday, I agreed that we would work hard every day this week \nand we would consider relevant amendments, and we would consider \namendments that may not be considered relevant on both sides of the \naisle, and we have indeed considered germane amendments that really \npertain to and are germane to the bill, and nongermane amendments. It \nis a matter of definition. We have done just that on Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday, and Thursday.\n  We have reached the end of the week, having cast votes on a number of \namendments and accepted others, working together. I, too, congratulate \nthe managers for working together and moving this bill forward.\n  At this juncture, we plan on filing cloture tomorrow, and that means \nwe will still, once cloture is obtained--I hope it is obtained--we \nstill will be considering germane amendments to the underlying bill. We \nhave had a productive week and considered a lot of amendments.\n  Although there is some disagreement about the best approach, I want \nto bring this to a close. We will have amendments in the early part of \nnext week and they will be germane amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/06/senate-section/article/S5026-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
