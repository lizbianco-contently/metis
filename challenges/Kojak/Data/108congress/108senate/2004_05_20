Madam President, I take a few minutes of the leader's \ntime to speak in morning business on one of the issues this week that \nhas\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\ndrawn, obviously, the attention of everybody across the country. It has \nhappened in Massachusetts where, 3 days ago, in keeping with the \nrulings of four Massachusetts Supreme Court justices last November, the \nState of Massachusetts started issuing marriage licenses to same-sex \ncouples, as thousands descended on the State.\n  This event has significant repercussions for all Americans. According \nto news reports, local officials across the State were giving licenses \nto all who requested them, without asking for proof of State residency. \nThis is in open defiance of Massachusetts law, which bars out-of-State \ncouples from marrying in the State if the union would be illegal in \ntheir home State.\n  Let there be no mistake about this. The stakes in this battle over \nthe future of our culture are enormous. This attempt by an imperious \njudiciary to radically redefine marriage by a few people is both a \ngrave threat to our central social institution and a serious affront to \ndemocratic rule in our Nation.\n  Our reaction to this threat hinges on not only the future of \nmarriage, which is a foundational unit for building a strong society, \nbut our future as a self-governing people as well--whether the people \nhere rule or a few on the judiciary. The actions of the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, to mandate \nhomosexual marriage, is simply the latest instance of arrogant judges \nriding roughshod over the democratic process and constitutional law \nalike, in a quest to impose a radical social agenda on America.\n\n  The decision in this case could not have been more radical. The court \ndeclared that our society's longstanding, historical understanding of \nmarriage as between a man and a woman was irrational or completely \nlacking a foundation in reason. As such, according to the court, the \nonly possible explanation for the State denying marriage licenses to \nhomosexual couples is prejudice, which the court compared with racial \nprejudice of the past that opposed interracial marriages. This analogy, \nof course, is false. It is misleading. The vast majority of African \nAmericans recognize that. The vast majority of all Americans recognize \nit. All America should have the right to marry whomever they choose, \nregardless of race. But while most Americans believe that homosexuals \nhave a right to live as they choose, they do not believe that a small \ngroup of activists or a tiny judicial elite have a right to redefine \nmarriage for the entire society and to impose this radical social \nexperiment on the culture.\n  Almost every benefit that is being sought can be attained through \ncontract or power of attorney. But let us be clear, this is not a \nbattle over civil rights. It is a battle over whether marriage will be \nemptied of its meaning in contradiction to the will of the people and \ntheir duly elected representatives.\n  This is a key issue. I look for this body to take up the issue in a \nconstitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a \nwoman. This is going to be a very difficult discussion. I hope we can \nhave a good, healthy discussion about the importance of marriage as a \nfoundational building unit in this society, a marriage between a man \nand a woman bonded together for life. That, indeed, is the best place \nto raise children according to all of our sociological data. This \ninstitution has been in disrepair for 40 years--has had difficulty for \na long period of time--but this is not the answer to curing it. This \nwill harm it.\n  While this is going to be a difficult debate and discussion for us as \na country, it is a valuable and important one for us to have. I look \nforward to this body, later this year, voting on a constitutional \namendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nyielding.\n  I want to talk a little bit about what has happened during the last 4 \nyears after the President assumed office, and after we have had a \nRepublican Congress.\n  I think there were problems within the world and within this country \nthat nobody wanted to admit were happening.\n  For example, when this President took office, the economy was going \ndown. The previous President--President Clinton--didn't want to admit \nthat, but it was a fact. And that is an accepted fact today which \neverybody understands.\n  Look at what the economy was doing when President Bush assumed \noffice. The economy was going down. This President and this Congress, \ninstead of putting the problem off to future generations and putting \nout a lot of rhetoric, did something. We cut the tax burden to \nstimulate this economy, and today the economy is doing much better. \nEmployment is growing. We have a strong economy; it is getting \nstronger. People are being productive. We are getting people into \nhomes. Right now, we have the highest home ownership rate in the \nhistory of this country, which means people of all races and ethnic \nbackgrounds are getting an opportunity to own a piece of America. That \nis where the strength of this country is.\n  Because of this President and this Congress working on those kinds of \nissues, there is a real difference in people's personal lives.\n  The other thing that was not recognized and which some people wanted \nto ignore is the fact that we are much more secure today than we were 4 \nyears ago. We didn't realize, 4 years ago, the threat that was \nhappening as far as America.\n  I recall an opportunity where I was interviewed on BBC. This was an \ninterview that happened a couple or 3 years back. There was an \nindividual on the other side who was from the Middle East.\n  He said: Senator, what you don't realize is that you have been at war \nin America for 5 years already because of what is happening in the \nMiddle East. They have already declared war on you.\n  If you look at it historically, we had a few terrorist attacks on \nsmall areas that were rather insignificant. We ignored them. Then we \nhad terrorist attacks on our embassies. We ignored them. We had a \nterrorist attack on Khobar Towers, and we ignored it. We had the attack \non the USS Cole, and we ignored that. Then we had the World Trade \nCenter in New York, and basically that was ignored. Finally, it took \nthe attacks by terrorists on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon of the \nUnited States for people to wake up, and this President and this \nRepublican Congress stepped to the plate and we dealt with those \nsecurity issues. We provided the money to make this a modern military. \nThis President said we needed a more modern military; that is, more \nmobile because times are changing.\n  Our threat is terrorism throughout the world. We need to be prepared \nto address that. This President and this Congress didn't put that off \nto the next generation. We didn't put it off until somebody else would \nmake a decision--some future Congress or some future President. We \naddressed that problem immediately. We got after it. We are continuing \nto get after it. We still have a concern.\n\n  I am excited about the fact that we are now talking about sovereignty \nfor Iraq where they are going to be their own leaders. That doesn't \nmean necessarily that we are going to have less involvement as far as \nthe conflict is concerned.\n  But we need a leader in this world who is trying to promote world \npeace. And we need a leader who is trying to secure the economic health \nof this country and the world, too.\n  If we look back at the accomplishments of the last 4 years, there is \na lot to be proud of. I am glad we had some real leadership in the \nWhite House. I am glad we had some real leadership in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate that took on those issues. They are not \neasy issues. They are difficult issues.\n  But the good message to the rest of the world is, America is stepping \nto the plate.\n  I am looking forward to continuing the fight and the work with my \nother Members to make sure we have a strong economy. That is a \nchallenge.\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\n  We need to make sure those tax cuts we provided are stimulating our \neconomy and economic growth; make that economic engine go so we have a \nfree market system which is working; and make sure those incentives are \nout there so Americans who work hard are justly rewarded and they can \nkeep the benefits of their hard work in their own pockets and it \ndoesn't have to be sent to the Federal Government for it to spend; they \nget to spend it themselves in their own communities to meet there own \nneeds. That means less government. It means we can rely more on \nindividuals to assume responsibility. We need to work to make sure we \ncreate opportunities for everyone.\n  That is the challenge we have ahead of us. Tax cuts are expiring. One \nof the challenges we are facing in the Senate is the budget deficit. We \nhave to be sure we reduce the deficit. Our economy is responding to the \ntax cuts. I don't think anybody can say tax cuts didn't help. We have \nto keep our country strong for our security.\n  We still have challenges, we recognize that. But we have to face up \nto those challenges and not push them off to future generations.\n  I happen to believe you have to stand up to terrorism. We learned the \nhard lesson. We learned if you ignore terrorism, it doesn't go away. We \nlearned that you have to stand up to the terrorists. If you do not, \nwith each success the recruitment of terrorist groups goes up. We saw \nthat. With each success, the terrorist groups get more money, they get \nbetter financing, and they are a greater risk.\n  I compliment this President. I am proud to be a part of a body which \nhas over the last 4 years made a difference in this country. That is \nnot to say we do not have a lot of challenges; we certainly have a lot \nof challenges. But we are off to a good start. We need to continue.\n  I look forward to working with this President for another 4 years \nbecause I think he has done a good job in leadership. I think this \ncountry needs him.\n  I think this Congress has some challenges ahead of it, and we need \ngood, strong leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we just heard a wonderful talk by \nthe President of the United States. He talked about our commitment and \nreminded us once again that our commitment to winning in Iraq is \neverything. There is no alternative. The President talked about the \ncommitment of winning the war on terrorism.\n  That means we must stabilize Iraq. We must begin to show the people \nin the Middle East what freedom, free enterprise, economy and jobs can \ndo, and an educational system that includes boys and girls, giving them \nhope for the future.\n  He reminded us of the commitment we must make to see the war on \nterrorism through. This is not going to be a war that goes exactly the \nway it was planned. Name for me a war that did. Name for me a war that \nwe said, Here is what is going to happen, and it happens just that way. \nThis is war. We have been attacked. Thousands of Americans have been \nkilled by fanatics. Nick Berg was assassinated on videotape in a brutal \nmanner by terrorism. This will continue to happen if we lose our \nresolve. There is only one way that we can lose; that is, for America \nnot to see this through.\n  It means winning the immediate war. It means stabilizing Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It means sowing the seeds of freedom and representative \ngovernment in those countries to show how it can be done where people \nhave not lived in freedom for years. We must see it through. But it \nmeans more than just the next year in which we have the big important \nwar on terrorism that we see evolve before our eyes. It means we are \ngoing to have to stick with it for 25 or 30 years because it is going \nto take that long to show education can give children hope for the \nfuture, so you will not be able to brainwash a child to think life is \nnot worth living, that the best thing one could do with their life is \nto give it up by killing other people in a suicide bomb.\n\n  The only way to warp children to believe a suicide bomb is their best \nhope in life is by failing to give them an education. An education \ngives them hope for a future, for a job, for a family, for a quality of \nlife that is worth living.\n  The President of the United States is laser-beam focused. He is \nfocused on winning the war on terrorism for the security of the \nAmerican people and for the ability for freedom to live throughout the \nworld. If America does not carry the beacon and the flag for freedom in \nthe world, who will? Who has the capacity and the will to do it? If \nfreedom dies in America, it will not flourish for very long anywhere \nelse on Earth. That is why the President is so focused on the security \nof our country by finding and winning the war on terrorism.\n  We see people wringing their hands, asking, What can we do. We see \nthe assassination of Nick Berg on videotape and we ask, What can we do \nto get out of this. We can make sure the violent death of Nicholas Berg \nis not in vain, that the hundreds of Americans who have died in this \ncause do not die in vain, that they are dealing with an America that \nhas the leadership to stand up for our country and our security and our \nfreedom and see it through. That is what the President of the United \nStates is doing for our country today. We must not lose focus.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by \nDavid Brooks from the New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 18, 2004.]\n\n                   In Iraq, America's Shakeout Moment\n\n                           (By David Brooks)\n\n       There's something about our venture into Iraq that is \n     inspiringly, painfully, embarrassingly and quintessentially \n     American.\n       No other nation would have been hopeful enough to try to \n     evangelize for democracy across the Middle East. No other \n     nation would have been naive enough to do it this badly. No \n     other nation would be adaptable enough to recover from its \n     own innocence and muddle its way to success, as I suspect we \n     are about to do.\n       American history sometimes seems to be the same story \n     repeated over and over again. Some group of big-dreaming but \n     foolhardy adventurers head out to eradicate some evil and to \n     realize some golden future. They get halfway along their \n     journey and find they are unprepared for the harsh reality \n     they suddenly face. It's too late to turn back, so they \n     reinvent their mission. They toss out illusions and adopt an \n     almost desperate pragmatism. They never do realize the utopia \n     they initially dreamed about, but they do build something \n     better than what came before.\n       This basic pattern has marked our national style from the \n     moment British colonists landed on North American shores. \n     Overly optimistic about the conditions they would find, the \n     colonists were woefully undercapitalized, underequipped and \n     underskilled. At Jamestown, there were three gentlemen and \n     gentlemen's servants for every skilled laborer. They didn't \n     bother to plant enough grain to see them through the winter.\n       But they learned and adapted. Settlement companies were \n     compelled to send more workers, along with axes, chisels, \n     scythes, millstones and seeds. Eventually the colonies \n     thrived.\n       Centuries later, it was much the same. The guides who aided \n     and fleeced the pioneers who moved West were struck by how \n     clueless many of them were about the wilderness they were \n     entering. Their diaries show that many thought they could \n     establish genteel New England-style villages in short order. \n     They leapt before they looked, faced the shock of reality, \n     adapted and cobbled together something unexpected.\n       And it is that way today. We are tricked by hope into \n     starting companies, beginning books, immigrating to this \n     country and investing in telecom networks. The challenges \n     turn out to be tougher than we imagined. Our excessive \n     optimism is exposed. New skills are demanded. But nothing \n     important was ever begun in a prudential frame of mind.\n       Hope begets disappointment, and we are now in a moment of \n     disappointment when it comes to Iraq. During these shakeout \n     moments, the nay-sayers get to gloat while the rest of us \n     despair, lacerate ourselves, second-guess those in charge and \n     look at things anew. But this very process of self-criticism\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\n     is the precondition for the second wind, the grubbier, less \n     illusioned effort that often enough leads to some acceptable \n     outcome.\n       Today in Iraq local commanders seem to be allowed to try \n     anything. We are allowing former Baathists to man a Falluja \n     Brigade to police their own city. We are pounding Moktada al-\n     Sadr while negotiating with him. There is talk of moving up \n     elections so when an Iraqi official is assassinated, he is \n     not seen as a person working with the U.S., but as a duly \n     elected representative of the Iraqi people.\n       Some of these policies seem incoherent, but they may work. \n     And back home a new mood has taken over part of the political \n     class. The emerging responsible faction has no time now for \n     the witless applause lines the jeering jackdaws on left and \n     right repeat to themselves to their own perpetual self-\n     admiration and delight. Even in a political year, most \n     politicians do not want this country to fail.\n       There are, for example, members of Congress from both \n     parties who feel estranged from this administration. They \n     feel it does not listen to their ideas. But in this troubled \n     hour, they are desperate to help. If but a call were made, \n     they would burst forth with intelligent suggestions: about \n     Iraq, about political tactics, about getting additional \n     appropriations.\n       Remember, the most untrue truism in human history is that \n     there are no second acts in American life. In reality, there \n     is nothing but second acts. There are shakeout moments and \n     redundantly, new beginnings. The weeks until June 30 are \n     bound to be awful, but we may be at the start of a new \n     beginning now.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 12 minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5896-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5896-S5897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, again this morning I will talk about \nenergy. I hope I have an opportunity each week until we come to our \nsenses and pass an energy bill to remind the American people one of the \nreasons gas prices are spiraling, one of the reasons we are skeptical \nabout our future is the tremendously high price of crude oil.\n  That will never be reduced until America makes a commitment, until \nthe people of the world and the producers of oil understand the United \nStates of America is not going to sit by and do nothing. We are going \nto have a comprehensive policy with one objective. That is to produce \nmore alternatives that can be used by the American people to satisfy \nand supply their energy needs. That means we want to do more to produce \nnatural gas, not sit idly by and let the demand increase and soon be \ndependent on foreign countries for natural gas.\n  The occupant of the Chair comes from a State that has an abundance of \nnatural gas. But we have to bring it to the lower 48 States. The Energy \nbill which we propose, that the other side of the aisle for the most \npart defeated, had a powerful provision which will bring natural gas \nfrom Alaska. It also had a provision that will get the maximum amount \nof natural gas from our sources in America.\n  The price of gas in California this week averaged $2.27; in San \nFrancisco, it hit $2.79; in Brooklyn, it was $2.49. Each time our \ncitizens pump a gallon of gas in their cars, they should remember a \nmajority of the Senators in this body, led by the Republicans, has been \ntrying to pass a comprehensive energy legislation package. They are \nblocked each time by a filibuster led by the other side of the aisle, \nthe Democrats, who, for some reason, find an excuse on every energy \nbill we propose. Either this must be changed, that must be changed, or \nthis must be added--until we end up with nothing.\n  Fellow Senators, the Energy bill is not a silver bullet to lowering \nthe price of gasoline. It does, however, set forth a plan for the \nfuture. The Energy bill will increase domestic oil and natural gas \nproduction that helps balance supply with our growing demand. The \nEnergy bill does a number of technical things. It removes a 2-percent \noxygenate mandate that will make it easier on refineries to make \ngasoline that can be traded between regional markets. The Energy bill \naddresses the proliferation of boutique fuels. There are a number of \nState-specific gasoline reformulations that make refining more \nchallenging and make marketing inefficient. We can go on and on.\n  This bill provides basic research in hydrogen power. Many ask, How \nare we going to get ourselves off of this tremendous demand for \ngasoline and crude oil derivatives? One is hydrogen power. How do we do \nthat without an energy bill that sets a policy of spending the research \nmoney on hydrogen power with the automobile manufacturers to come up \nwith a solution?\n  We try, as part of a comprehensive energy bill, I said, try as we \nmay--we cannot satisfy the other side of the aisle. I wonder if they \nreally want an energy bill. I am beginning to think it is their way or \nno way. They might even think the President of the United States might \nbe helped too much with an energy bill. I hope that is not true.\n\n  The benefits are being denied to the American people. Some people \nwant to kick the political football around and they hope they can score \na touchdown. We are actually going to score in higher energy prices--\nand higher energy prices hurt the economy. I am a football fan. But \nthat is one touchdown I don't want to see scored.\n  Right now we are focusing on high gasoline prices. High gasoline \nprices are tied to the price of oil. What has been making the price \nclimb? We know there is huge demand in the world led by China, which is \ngobbling oil like you would think there was no end to the supply. In \naddition, there is a risk factor being built into the price because of \nterrorism and the vulnerability of oil production. There is a risk \nfactor that is causing those who produce and sell it on the world \nmarket to not go rock bottom but to go as high as they can because they \nare afraid of terrorism.\n  We have to be hopeful that the cartel and those who are producing \noil, who are listening to our President, some of whom have been friends \nof America, we are hopeful they will see the light of day, that this \nprice they are forcing on the world is not good for them, either; it is \nbad for their friends; it is bad for the world. Ultimately, it is not \ngood for the producing countries.\n  Our President is taking a leadership role with reference to the \nenergy-producing countries. He is trying to cajole, to talk to them, to \nwork on them so they will increase production and hopefully bring down \nthe price of oil. Some want to embarrass the President by offering \nresolutions directing him to do what he is doing. Some want to use the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve as if that reserve, which is there for \nemergencies, could, in fact, help with these high oil prices. The last \ntime we tried, it affected gasoline prices by 1 cent. Do we want to \nreduce the emergency oil we have and then find in a few months the \nterrorists do something and we are short of oil and then we have a real \nproblem because of it? SPR was for that kind of situation.\n  Perhaps people forgot the last time Iran cut a little bit of the \nsupply to the world, America was affected in a dramatic way. That \ncaused us to build SPR so we could never be immediately cut off and \nimmediately forced to have our economy disrupted by a challenge from \noutside. Why do we want to risk that when the consequences will be very \nlittle?\n\n  Maybe some think they can blame an economic downturn, because of high \nenergy prices, on President Bush. They will not succeed. President \nBush's economic policy has brought America from a recession to a \nvibrant, growing economy. Its gross domestic product increases are the \nhighest in 20 years--not 2 years, not 5 years, in 20 years. So they are \nnot going to deny that by filibustering an energy bill.\n  But I can tell you, the purpose of debating in the Senate is to let \nthe American people know who is responsible for what. And I don't know \nwhat to do. We have tried everything with reference to getting an \nenergy bill. Maybe we ought to ask the Democrats to sit down and talk \nabout what they need. I am not sure we could get anything out of that \nbecause I am not sure they know. Because it seems to me anything we try \njust cannot get anywhere because one group or another, principally on \nthe other side of the aisle, seems to find fault; and there we go, we \nget nothing done.\n  Now, we have some who want to investigate the oil companies because \nof the prices. I have, in this statement, a list of the investigations \nthat have occurred and who has done them. They are powerful, neutral \nbodies that have done them. They did one for California because their \nprices went skyrocketing. Nobody can find collusion or\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nprice fixing. What has happened is the world demand is monstrous, and \nthe cartel and others that are not part of it want to hold supply down \nto let prices go up.\n  And what do we do? We sit here in the U.S. Congress, wring our hands, \nand complain and worry and talk about President Bush needing a plan. \nLook, he gave us a plan. If you want to argue about how he did it, go \nahead, but look at it and see what it will do. For the most part, the \nthings in that plan are exactly what America needs. We need to maximize \nour own production of oil. It will not be sufficient, but we can do \nsome things. We need to maximize the production of natural gas. We need \nto maximize the potential use of coal. We need to build every \nalternative into our national plan. Wind energy and solar energy need \nthe incentives that are required. And, yes, in the end we have to put \nsome incentives in to get started with nuclear again. But we do not \nhave to have all of these. We need the basics. You cannot even get \nthose done.\n  So from my standpoint, I hope we will quit blaming, quit wringing our \nhands, quit talking, especially on the other side of the aisle, about \nwhat we need to do, when, in fact, they are denying the very things \nthey say we need to do by not voting for the things they are talking \nabout. In fact, I think we could go through the Record and find that \nmany on the other side have gotten up and made speeches about what we \nneed to do, and you could go down and tick them off, and most of them \nare in the Energy bill. Most of the things they talk about are in the \nEnergy bill, but for some reason they would rather talk about it than \nvote for it. They would rather talk about it than offer amendments and \nget the thing going.\n  I think what we ought to do soon is offer a bill and offer a \nunanimous consent suggestion that we put it up here and we have 10 \namendments on each side and then we proceed to vote. I think that would \nbe a fair way to handle the energy crisis of America. It would say, \nquit fooling around. You get 10 amendments. That ought to be enough to \nget your purposes out there. We get 10. Then it is over with, and we \nvote. But I am sure if you tried that, every excuse in the world would \nbe forthcoming. Nobody will say: We need an energy bill. Let's do \nsomething. They will say: Oh, no, it doesn't have this. There is a \nchance, a risk we will get hurt. They won't take care of this and they \nwon't take care of that and we will get nowhere.\n\n  So I close by saying I was also privileged to hear the President \nspeak this morning. The Senator from Texas talked about it. I, frankly, \nhave nothing but admiration for his fortitude, his strength, and his \ndetermination. I think if the United States and its people can quickly \nassess the blame with reference to the prisons and get on with letting \nour President and the military people stabilize Iraq and let them begin \nto decide their future as free people who do not have to worry about \ngetting killed, the sooner we can let that happen, the sooner America \nwill be back on the right track. But I am not sure that everybody in \nthis country wants to get that over.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I close by saying I would hope that as \nwe prepare to go out for recess, everybody in this body will examine \ntheir conscience, examine their positions, and that maybe they can come \nback and say: Let's sit down. Let's get an energy bill. Let's get the \nmaximum kind of flexibility for production of alternatives in this \ncountry. Let's see if we can't make the American electric energy grid \nmore powerful, stronger, more reliable, and see that it can grow and \nprosper.\n  It is our future. How we energize it is our challenge. We cannot do \nit with natural gas alone. We have to have alternatives. That is what \nwe had proposed. We must decide that we are going to try. I chose this \ncommittee--left the Budget Committee--because I knew how important this \nwas, but, frankly, I never thought there would be so many people who \nwanted to make it so hard for us to get an energy policy as has \nhappened. I could not believe it, as a veteran Senator. Frankly, I am \namazed there are still those on the other side who want to blame \nsomebody, want to tell us what we ought to do but do not want to vote \nfor anything.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, as Senator Domenici prepares to leave \nthe Senate floor, I thank him for his tenacity and his earnest desire \nto lead us to a balanced energy policy. I think he knows there are \nplenty of us on this side who do want to reach the right balance, and I \nhave enjoyed trying to provide a little bit of that balance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5897-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nDemocratic side be given an additional 10 minutes of morning business, \nwith the time equally divided between Senator Carper and myself. Before \nthe Chair acts on this request, I am told it has been cleared by the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for \n30 seconds?\n  Mr. CARPER. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I say to the Senator, I heard your \nremarks, and I do want to say to the Senator, that while I do not know \nyour overall feelings about an energy bill, I will say on a couple of \nvery difficult issues that I think are very important that were \ncontentious--and many people on your side did not think we ought to \ndo--you stood tall because you understand that we need diversification \nand you are not afraid to make votes. And I thank you for that.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, on a brighter note, with respect to energy policy, a \nweek or so ago we passed a major bill called FSC/ETI. Some people call \nit the JOBS bill or a trade bill. But provisions of the Energy bill \nwere incorporated in that legislation, important provisions that \ninclude incentives for renewable forms of energy--solar, wind, \ngeothermal--and incentives to encourage people to buy more energy-\nefficient vehicles, hybrids, fuel-cell vehicles, to make them more \naffordable, to get more of them out on the road, and using less \ngasoline and diesel fuel, and also incentives for us to begin \nconverting to a greater use of what I call biofuels--ethanol--and \nsomething we do in Delaware a lot on the Delmarva Peninsula where we \ntake soybean oil and mix it with diesel fuel.\n  They were able to do something good for the environment and actually \nreduce significantly our use of diesel-powered vehicles.\n  While it is still mid-May, we have a fair amount of time to go before \nwe finish here. Before we finish, I hope we will find common ground on \nthe rest of the energy policy, and that it is also respective of our \nenvironment and the clean air concerns we have, and gives the States \nthe ability to recover damages for their drinking supply that has been \ndamaged by MTBE.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5897-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5897-S5899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GUEST CHAPLAIN RABBI BERNHARDT\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I express to Senator Biden my appreciation \nfor his inviting a wonderful woman, a rabbi from Delaware, to come here \nto be our guest Chaplain, and to say how pleased we are, all of us, to \nwelcome Ellen Bernhardt. She gave the invocation about 40 minutes ago. \nI told her it was one of the best invocations I have heard in the 3 \nyears I have been privileged to be a Senator. It was as good as any I \nhave heard. We thank you for not only coming to bring the blessing of \nthat invocation, but to remind us about what really matters.\n  I also thank her for just what she does in Delaware. She has been a \nrabbi, I think, about 17 years. She is a native of Philadelphia. For \nthe last 11 years or so, she has run a school in Delaware which is, I \nbelieve, the only Jewish day\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nschool in our State. We have a lot of schools, but only one Jewish day \nschool--Albert Einstein Academy. There are youngsters in kindergarten, \nfrom age 5, up to the sixth grade. While it is a Jewish day school, it \nis nondenominational because whether the students happen to be Jewish \nor not, they can attend that school. I was kidding earlier about how \nmost of them are Baptists. Actually, I don't think that is the case. \nThat gives you the flavor of the nondenominational school. I have been \nprivileged to know a number of the kids who go there. They get a \nwonderful education and start for their lives and go on to do great \nwork.\n  We have been joined today not only by Rabbi Bernhardt, but also by \nthree of her children and her husband. We are so privileged that she \nlives in Delaware and that she provides great leadership on the \neducational side, and also for a lot of us on the spiritual side, \nwhether we happen to be Jewish or not. Welcome.\n  Again, to my friend, Joe Biden, I thank him for making it possible \nfor her to be here today.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, Delaware is a small State and everyone \nseems to know everyone else. We know just about everyone in the State. \nYou can't go to the grocery store, church, synagogue, or mosque without \nrunning into people you know. We go to each other's events. It is a \nlittle like Alaska--small. Alaska is gigantic, but the population is \nsmall. We go to each other's gatherings, and we are affected by each \nother's achievements and each other's milestones, and we are affected \nby each other's losses. Sometimes the closeness gets us in trouble, but \nI would not change it for the world.\n  It has been an honor and a pleasure to represent my State and to have \nthe pleasure over the years to invite several members of our clergy to \ncome and be guest Chaplains.\n  Rabbi Ellen Bernhardt is our guest Chaplain today. As Senator Carper \nsaid, she is finishing her 11th year at the Albert Einstein Academy in \nWilmington, not far from where I live. The academy is open to all \nstudents, although it is the only Jewish day school in our State.\n  It has been a pleasure visiting the school on a number of occasions. \nOver the years, we have spent a fair amount of time in fundraising \nevents together, sharing the dais, and attempting to see to it that the \nschool remains vibrant. That has been going on, actually, before the \nrabbi was running the school. But the fact is, her dedication, talent, \nfaith, and deep abiding commitment to her students and her work in my \nState has touched many people in our community. For that, we are all \nvery grateful.\n  I believe I speak for all my colleagues when I say thank you for your \nthoughtful, inspirational invocation this morning. We need it badly at \nthis moment in the United States. We are honored to welcome you to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I arrived here almost 32 years ago and I feel the same amount of \npride today that I felt then as I walk out on this floor. I know that \nsounds corny, but I really do. I am incredibly proud of this \ninstitution. I remember the first time I walked on the floor; my \ntemporary desk was the second from the end over there. I realized I was \nstanding next to the desk where Daniel Webster sat. I thought to \nmyself, it is the only time I actually thought, my God, what am I doing \nhere? In the last 31 years, some in my constituency have said: My God, \nwhat is he doing there? I have become accustomed to it. My impression \nat that time--and I don't know the rabbi's impression--was how small \nthis Chamber is. There is a closeness to it. It is a comfort. Anyway, I \nam proud we are able to share the floor with the rabbi today.\n  Let me say, my relationship and personal connection with the rabbi is \na quintessential example of the nature of the State of Delaware.\n  I happen to know that the rabbi grew up over her father's drugstore \nin Belfonte, which I frequented a lot. I went to St. Helena, a Catholic \ngrade school in Claymont. Everybody knew your father's drugstore. \nEverybody hung out in your father's drugstore. I am considerably older \nthan the rabbi. So we basically come from the same small neck of the \nwoods, the same small neighborhood.\n  The rabbi's father was a heck of a guy, by the way. As a kid and a \nmember of the Congregation Ades Kodesh Shel Emeth, Ellen would study \nafter school with her rabbi, Rabbi Leonard Gewirtz--a man I always \naffectionately referred to as literally ``my rabbi.'' He introduced me \nfrequently. He became my first tutor--literally, not figuratively--\nbecause of my interest in theology and the Holocaust. I remember \nspeaking up at a college, a rabbinical school in Philadelphia. I \nremember those big old thick shoes he used to wear, the kind that laced \nup the side and squeaked on a linoleum floor. I was speaking in this \nroom that was not very commodious for speaking; it was long and with \nlow ceilings, and the podium was in the middle. It was a shoal, \nactually. He came late and wanted to hear me speak. He opened the door \nand the congregation was seated and the door smacked against a pew. He \nwalked in and, as you know, he walked right up to the front and sat \ndown. It was kind of a tense moment. Everybody wondered who is this guy \nwalking in. I said, ``My rabbi has arrived.''\n\n  After speaking to this all-Jewish congregation, a group of ladies my \nmom's age, who were in an atrium that connected the shoal to the \nuniversity, the school--as I walked out, they were arguing. I could \nhear them saying: Yes, he is. No, he isn't. Yes, he is. A lady grabbed \nme by the coat and said: You said ``your rabbi. He had a similar \ninfluence on me--though much more profound to you but no less \nsignificant to me.'' He was a great man.\n  He was famous for his passionate sermons from the pulpit, his love \nfor Jewish education, his love for Israel and the community he served.\n  Rabbi Gewirtz was truly a spiritual leader and, as Ellen will tell \nyou, is the reason she decided to become a rabbi. We truly miss him, \nbut his spirit is with her today. I know he is looking down and is very \nproud. He was also proud of this place, proud of this country, proud of \nthe Senate. To have you here, I am sure, he is smiling.\n  There are a lot of other things I could and would like to say about \nEllen. As I said, we are very similar in the sense that we are truly \nproducts of our parents' upbringing and, knowing her story, it is no \nsurprise to me that she has devoted her life to Jewish education, \ncommunity service, and to her family.\n  Her grandparents came to this country by way of Ellis Island. Her \nentire mother's side of the family chose to remain in Eastern Europe \nand were tragically killed in the Nazi Holocaust.\n  Her extended family was conspicuously absent from her life. As one \ncan imagine, this had a profound effect on Rabbi Bernhardt and her \nfamily's life, priorities, and values.\n  Her father, Herman Gordon, was one of the many heroic members of the \nArmed Forces who chose to enlist in the Army Air Corps at the outset of \nWorld War II. Mr. Gordon served as a waist gunner on the Flying \nFortress B-17 bomber.\n  Based in England, his unit performed missions over France and \nGermany, clearing the way for our troops to land on the beaches of \nNormandy. On his 24th mission, his plane was shot down over Germany. As \na Jew, he became a prisoner of war in Germany for 9 months. The latter \n3 months of his imprisonment was spent marching at gunpoint on the \ninfamous ``death march''--a desperate move by the Nazis to relocate \ntheir POWs straight into the heart of Germany, out of the hands of the \nAllied forces which were closing in, which I always thought was a \nmetaphor for the insanity, the lust of Hitler and Nazi Germany. This \nnightmare all came to an end when Mr. Gordon's camp was liberated by \nGeneral Patton's army.\n  It is quite a story, quite a heritage, and quite a family. As my dad, \nwho passed away about a year and a half ago, would say: Girl, you have \ngood blood; you have real good blood.\n  I only hope our children and grandchildren develop an appreciation \nfor the sacrifices of so many Americans, such as Ellen's father, and \nthe thousands of soldiers who are currently serving abroad have done \nfor this country.\n  One of the reasons I am telling this story is to give my colleagues \nand constituents back home an insight into what motivates our guest \nChaplain this morning to energize her students, family, and friends to \nbetter the Delaware\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\ncommunity and to uphold our American values with the same patriotic \nzeal exemplified by her father.\n  Last year, for the fourth consecutive year, I submitted a resolution \nin the Senate to designate the week of Veterans Day as ``National \nVeterans Awareness Week.'' It explicitly underscores the need for our \nschools to develop educational programs to highlight the contributions \nof veterans in our country.\n  This past year, Ellen held a very moving ceremony. The school invited \nevery friend, relative, or neighbor of a student who served in our \nmilitary to come and speak at the ceremony in front of the entire \nschool and faculty about their experiences.\n  Madam President, included in the list of speakers was the mother of \nLT Scott Travis, a Wilmington native, a graduate of Brandywine High \nSchool and West Point, who is currently serving in Iraq.\n  The ceremony brought real people with real stories into the classroom \nand gave the kids a tangible sense of what it meant and what it means \nto sacrifice for one's country. The climax was when students pinned \nmedals on the veterans in attendance as a way to personally thank them \nfor their service.\n  That is the kind of school Ellen runs. That is the kind of person \nEllen is.\n  By the way, for the record, let me say that in my 31st year in the \nSenate, Rabbi Bernhardt is only the fifth guest Chaplain I have invited \nfrom Delaware, following in the footsteps of Father Jim Trainer from \nSt. Patrick's Church, Rabbi Kenneth S. Cohen from Congregation Beth \nShalom, and Father Robert Balducci from St. Anthony's Parish.\n  From where I sit, you are in good company and so are they.\n  I thank Rabbi Bernhardt for being here this morning. By the way, you \nshould be very proud of your son sitting behind me who is a relatively \nnew member of my staff.

In fact, in my \nremarks about are we better off now than we were 4 years ago, I was \ngoing to try to engage my distinguished colleague in a colloquy.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent there be 5 \nadditional minutes on both sides for morning business. That will allow \nthe Senator from Delaware to speak for 10 minutes. If my unanimous \nconsent request is granted, that would allow him to begin now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will need an additional \n10 minutes.

Madam President, I thank my friend from Florida who knows \nmuch more about what I am going to mention today. He and I worked on \nwhat I am going to talk about for some time. And that is--there are \nreports coming in that the home and offices of Ahmed Chalabi were \nraided today in Baghdad.\n  I do not have clear evidence yet as to whether they were raided by \nthe Iraqi government or by the CPA, but both the Senator and I have \nbeen incredible skeptics of this administration's reliance on this \nfellow, Ahmed Chalabi, who has been indicted, tried, convicted, and \nsentenced in Jordan.\n  For the last 2 years--although I have nothing personal against Mr. \nAhmed Chalabi--I have been urging this administration, particularly the \nSecretary of Defense, the Vice President, and Mr. Wolfowitz: Do not put \nour eggs into Mr. Chalabi's basket.\n  Mr. Chalabi is the President of the Iraqi National Congress. I was so \nconcerned about this that my friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, and I \nwere literally smuggled into northern Iraq about a month before the war \nbegan because we wanted to meet with the Barzani and Talibani clients \nin northern Iraq to determine what their attitude was, first, toward \nour invasion with Iraq--would they be with us? There were reports that \nthey would have been, but we wanted to find out firsthand.\n  And B, we wanted to find out whether Ahmed Chalabi spoke for them. \nThe leaders of both those clans said: We want to make it clear that the \nINC does not speak for us. We did form the INC with him, but he is out \nfor himself, not us.\n  I could never quite understand the incredible preoccupation of the \nadministration with Mr. Chalabi. I think that reliance has done us \ngreat damage in terms of establishing legitimacy.\n  Today's raid comes on the heels of an announcement earlier this week \nthat the Defense Department belatedly, after well over a year, has cut \noff the $340,000 monthly payment to the INC, headed by Mr. Chalabi.\n  Last month, I wrote to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \nDefense asking them to explain why we continue to pay Mr. Chalabi a \nmonthly stipend. The action was seen as sort of putting our thumb on \nthe scale--we say we want the Iraqis to decide their outcome, and here \nwe are pouring into one man, an outfit, $340,000 a month.\n  It is no secret Mr. Chalabi has long been the favorite of the \nPentagon civilians and the Vice President, although the CIA, the \nuniformed military, and the State Department have been adamantly \nopposed to him.\n  We recently had a meeting with the Secretary of Defense in a closed \nsession, but I am allowed to say this in public, and I raised the \nquestion of funds to Chalabi and the phrase--well, I guess I cannot \nquote exactly what the phrase was. I cannot quote the Secretary. But \nthe point is there has been a real difficulty in pushing back.\n  It has been clear for some time our close association with Mr. \nChalabi has damaged American interests in Iraq. Chalabi is the best \nknown figure in the Iraqi Governing Council, according to a poll taken. \nWe appointed him. By the way, a poll taken a couple of months ago in \nIraq shows that he is not only the best known member of the Governing \nCouncil, but he is also the least popular, with a negative rating of \nover 60 percent.\n  Chalabi, as my colleagues will recall, was flown in to southern Iraq \nliterally days before the statue of Saddam fell. It was actually during \nthe war; he was flown in to a portion of southern Iraq we had already \nconquered and passed. He had been flown in without the knowledge of the \nState Department and other senior officials. I guess he was going to be \nthe triumphant Shi'a\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nwho was going to march through the Shi'a territories heading up to \nBaghdad, except one thing, nobody liked him and nobody followed him.\n  I do not know what it took to get the message to this administration \nthat this guy was not helpful but this guy was hurting our legitimacy. \nAt that time, I rose in the Senate and said, what are we doing here? I \nthink my friend from Florida as well, if not here in the Senate, I know \nin our hearings, said, what are we doing this for? How are we saying we \nare liberating the Iraqis, we are going to let them choose their \ngovernment and we are flying in a handpicked guy?\n  Well, that sort of went south, figuratively speaking. It was clear we \nwere attempting to put him in a place to take over the reins of \nBaghdad. Toward the end of that year, he organized the militia, which \nwas implicated in instances of looting in Baghdad. The U.S. military \nwisely ordered the militia to disband, but there were some supporters \nhere saying it is okay for him to set up a militia.\n  We are trying to disband militias, and we wonder why we have so \nlittle legitimacy. This is not Monday-morning quarter-backing. If need \nbe, for the record, I will come back and lay out all the statements we \nmade 2 years ago about Mr. Chalabi, a year ago, 8 months ago, 10 months \nago, as recently as a hearing 2 days ago in the Senate.\n  It has done us serious damage. High-ranking civilians in the Defense \nDepartment continue to back Mr. Chalabi, despite numerous warnings \nabout his past dealings.\n  The King of Jordan made known his country's distaste for Mr. Chalabi. \nThey did not hide it. The Foreign Minister of Jordan came to me \npersonally and said, for God's sake, do not deal with this guy; do you \nnot understand he is going to hurt you?\n  Mr. Chalabi has been convicted on fraud charges stemming from a \nfailure of the Petra Bank which Chalabi headed. In recent months, \nChalabi has been moving closer and closer to the religious elements in \nIraq, apparently belying his claims to be a secular leader. His close \nassociation with hardliners in Iran, including Ayatollah Khamenei, has \nbeen a matter of mystery and some suspicion, but we continued to \nsupport him.\n  The reason for today's raid is not yet clear, although there were \nreports earlier this week that one of Chalabi's associates, the finance \nminister, is being investigated by Iraqi police for a scam involving \ngovernment vehicles. There have been other reports of corruption \nallegations as well.\n  I am not making a judgment on that at this moment. We will wait to \nsee. But I am making a judgment, did make a judgment, and will continue \nto make the judgment that Mr. Chalabi is hurting us, not helping us.\n  One other point; Mr. Chalabi's guys got in and got hold of a whole \nlot of intelligence data that was Saddam Hussein's. He refuses to give \nit to us. He refuses to turn it over to the U.S. military. He will let \nus see it but not keep it. And this is our guy. It is like our guy in \nHavana. You know, our guy?\n  I do not know what it takes. It is like taking a wombat and banging \nit up the side of the heads of some of these guys and the civilians in \nthe Defense Department.\n  This guy is bad news for the United States, whether the reason for \nthe raiding of his headquarters and his home relates to corruption or \nnot. We have tarnished our reputation by our association with this man. \nIt is time to begin recouping it by ending our efforts to foist an \nunpopular leader on Iraqis and supporting a process which will produce \nmore legitimate leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I was going to address the \ntopic, ``Are you safer than you were 4 years ago,'' but while we have \nthe distinguished Senator from Delaware in the Chamber, I want to \naddress a couple of issues with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The bottom line is it is a long time in coming. I hope \nthis means we have listened to the sounds of voices in this \nadministration. I say to my friend, we both know this: We have both \ntried to help this administration, but it is as though there is a San \nAndreas fault that runs down the middle of this administration, with \ntwo very different views of the world. One is held by Mr. Powell, the \nState Department, and the uniformed military, and the other being the \nVice President, the Secretary of Defense, and Mr. Wolfowitz, who are \nall fine, honorable, and decent men who have a very different view of \nthe world.\n  The view of their world which they have been promoting has turned out \nnot to be so accurate. I hope this is evidence of the fact the \nPresident is starting to listen to saner voices.\n  I facetiously said--nobody asked--if you had a baseball team and you \nhad somebody who batted zero and it came time to put in a pinch-hitter, \nare you going to look at the batting averages? It is time to look at \nthe batting averages, Mr. President. Listen to those folks in your \nadministration. There are some very good ones who have better batting \naverages, and I hope this is beginning that recognition.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to posit a couple of \nquestions to the distinguished immediate past chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 10 minutes.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I did not hear the request.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I did not have a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator wishes to pose questions to the \nother side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I apologize. I thought something was said about 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. How much time is allocated to this side on \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 22 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Is it my understanding this Senator would have \n10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Does that give the Senator from New York \nenough time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. All of my speech on ``are you better off now \nthan you were 4 years ago,'' I am going to save for another day. I want \nto take advantage of one of the most knowledgeable Members of the \nSenate. In thinking about the question of are you better off now than \nyou were 4 years ago, are you safer now than you were 4 years ago, I \nhave had the privilege of sitting at the knee of the former chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has taught me something \nabout two countries where we better keep a laser eye focused, namely \nIran and North Korea.\n  I ask the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, as I hold up this chart about suspected nuclear \nweapons in North Korea, are we safer now than we were 4 years ago?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Clearly we are not. That is not to suggest you are \nsuggesting it is not good Saddam is gone. I think we are, in a marginal \nsense, safer because he is gone. But I think the effect of what we have \nallowed to happen, or what has happened in the rest of the world, has \nliterally put us in more jeopardy.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then, Mr. President, indeed this is what the \nSenator from Delaware has constantly preached. He has been a Johnny-\none-note on how we ought to engage with other nations around this \nworld, through diplomacy, to better the protection of the United \nStates.\n  Is it the impression of the Senator from Delaware we have been \ndragging our feet with regard to North Korea, before we ever started \nengaging them in international and one-to-one discussions?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend--I will make two points \nhere. One is, it was not only the Senator from Delaware and Florida, \nbut also the Senator from Indiana, the Republican chairman, who pointed \nout we made a mistake by dismissing the policy of engagement of the \nlast administration. Even the Secretary of State of the United States \nof America, Mr. Powell, when Kim Dae Jong of South Korea\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\ncame, said we were going to continue engaging the North as Mr. Kim \nwanted us to and thought we should, as our Japanese friends thought we \nshould, and the President summarily stopped that. I think that was \nanother mistake.\n  I make another point about Iran. The neoconservative view of why we \nshould have gone into Iraq alone is it would teach a lesson to the \nother malcontents in the world such as the Iranians. They were going to \nsay, My God, look at the unilateral use of force; we better behave. I \npoint out what my friend knows well and we talked about. Prior to our \ninvasion of Iraq, Iran had a genuine democratic movement--not \nprowestern, democratic movement. It was the Majlis, their parliament, \n195 people. There was a genuine movement.\n  You had the mullahs and the apparatus and the clerics who controlled \nsecurity and controlled the intelligence apparatus, afraid of world \nopinion if they crushed that democratic movement.\n  What did they do? If, in fact, the neocons are correct, and having \n140,000 troops in Iraq was going to teach Iran a lesson, in the midst \nof our greatest show of force in Iraq, the clerics in Tehran would have \nbeen afraid to touch the democratic movement, for fear of world \nreaction.\n  Obviously they were not frightened by our show of force. There is no \ndemocratic movement left. For instead the clerics crushed it. They \ndisbanded it.\n  So that is another example of the two most dangerous states for the \nUnited States of America today if they spiral out of control--Iran and \nNorth Korea. Both present a greater threat to America today than they \ndid 3 years ago.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I further ask the distinguished \nformer chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee with regard to \nnuclear weapons and the acquiring of nuclear technology and the ability \nto make a bomb in Iran, are we safer today than we were 4 years ago?\n  Mr. BIDEN. As we both know, the details of that are classified, but \nwe are allowed to say, and I give you my opinion, and I believe it \nwould be the consensus of the intelligence community: No. We are not \nsafer.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I further ask my friend from \nDelaware, given the fact of what we have heard in the testimony in the \nForeign Relations Committee over the last week, and also in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee; given the fact my friend from Delaware and I \nhave had long conversations about not only do we not need to pull out \nof Iraq but we need to increase our troop strength in Iraq because the \nalternative would be unthinkable, for us to turn tail and run and \ncreate a vacuum which would be filled by terrorists, which would only \ngive succor and encouragement to the other radical elements in the \nregion, including Iran, does the Senator from Delaware think we are \nsafer now in our international diplomacy results than we were 4 years \nago?\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, we are not. But we could be if the President is \nwilling to not stay the course but change the course. There is an \nopportunity, if the President begins to listen to the correct voices in \nhis administration, to internationalize this, to bring in the major \npowers, to actually leave Iraq in December of 2005 with a \nrepresentative government which will have a positive impact on the \nregion over time. It is still possible, but the President must quickly \ncall a summit meeting of the major powers; quickly get them to agree to \nsign off on Mr. Brahimi's plan of a new government; quickly get NATO to \nagree to have a NATO-led multinational force, sanctioned by the United \nNations; and quickly, quickly demonstrate he understands the breadth \nand depth of the damage done by the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, bulldoze \nthat prison down, build a hospital in its place, release those \nprisoners who should not be there and keep the others in a different \nenvironment and open it up. He still can do this. But my friend knows, \nwe can't do it. Only one man, because of the majesty of his office, can \ndo it: the President of the United States. He can do it. I hope he does \nnot squander this last opportunity. I am hopeful he will not.\n  I believe he understands more now. I hope he begins to listen to the \nuniform military and Mr. Powell, what they have been counseling along \nwith you and I and Senators Lugar, Hagel, McCain, and others all along \nhere. There is still time. But I believe this is the last serious \nchance he has to get it right by June 30.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I certainly agree with the \nSenator from Delaware. I will ask a final question of him. Why does the \nSenator from Delaware, one of the most knowledgeable in this entire \nbody on international affairs----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Why, in his opinion, does the administration \ncontinue to resist the outreach of building consensus in the \ninternational community, to help us with problems such as Iraq and Iran \nand North Korea? Why is there resistance to that, I ask the Senator \nfrom Delaware?\n  Mr. BIDEN. First of all, I thank the Senator for his compliments that \nare excessive and not accurate, but I thank him nonetheless. But let me \nsay in a second, I took the time 4 years ago to ask my senior staff to \ngo back and get every major work written by the Straussians, the \nneocons, I mean it sincerely, and Tony Blinken, former National \nSecurity Agency, my chief guy, got together 11 or 12 books, the most \nseminal volumes written in the last decade by the neoconservatives. \nThese are honorable, bright, serious people--patriotic Americans.\n  If you read what they say, they mean what they say. What they say is \nthe value of America----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent it be charged to our \ntime and that we have 1 additional minute so the Senator can finish his \nanswer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The bottom line is the neoconservatives believe our power \nis enhanced by leveraging power. Meaning if we go alone without any \nhelp, the malcontents of the world go: Oh, my God, look at them, they \ndon't even listen to the rest of the world. They have this awesome \npower. We should listen to them.\n  It might work if we had an army of 12 million and a surplus of $500 \nbillion a year instead of an army that is one-twelfth and a deficit of \n$500 billion a year. It doesn't work.\n\n  Now ideology has run head on into reality. For ideologues, like all \nhonorable people, it is difficult to change. It is a little like me as \na practicing Roman Catholic denying the Trinity. You can't deny the \nTrinity and be a Catholic. It is not possible. They cannot acknowledge \nthey need the international community and stick to a thesis that has \nbeen theirs for the last 12 years. That is as quickly, succinctly, and \nas accurately as I can state it. As Samuel Clemens said: All \ngeneralities are false, including this one. I made a bit of a \ngeneralization, but I believe an accurate one.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, what we have gotten in a few \nminutes is a short course of what, in the opinion of this Senator from \nDelaware, and in the opinion of this Senator from Florida, we need to \ndo: Internationalize the effort, build a consensus, reach out, bring in \nan international force such as NATO, led by the American military, \nbring in a senior international diplomat, prepare Iraq for governing \nitself, and be prepared to be there for the long haul.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for his \npersistence to get to the truth, and my colleague from Delaware, who \nsuccinctly described our problem brilliantly in terms of the ideology \nof the neocons running into reality. I could not agree more.\n  Ever since I was in college in the late 1960s, I would say to my \ncolleagues, ideologues have bothered me. Anyone who thinks they have a \nmonopoly on truth, and there is only one way to see the world, always \ngets us into trouble. They can be ideologues of the far left, they can \nbe ideologues of the far right, they can be ideologues just on one \nissue. America is a place where we all\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\ncome together. It is a place of consensus.\n  I tend to believe in a strong and muscular foreign policy. I think \nthe war on terror is real. But by being so blind to the realities of \nthe world, those who are hawks should be more angry at some of the \nthings that have been done, as my colleague from Delaware outlined, \nthan those who are doves because we are going to need strength and \nfortitude to continue this war for decades.\n  I thank both my colleagues. I was privileged to listen to their \nerudite and illuminating explanation.\n  Over the last few days, we have been discussing the question: Are we \nbetter off than 4 years ago? We have been discussing mainly domestic \nissues the last few days. Today we are discussing it on national \nsecurity; are we better off than we were 4 years ago. I guess this \nmeans our safety. And there are pluses and minuses.\n  Certainly in the wake of September 11 and the horrible attacks--and \nnow that the September 11 Commission was in my city yesterday, I am \nliving them all over again and it shakes my insides to remember what \nhappened, to remember going the day after with my colleague, Senator \nClinton and Mayor Guiliani and the Governor, and seeing what happened--\ncertainly we have responded. It is good we have responded. Some do not \nwant to respond or find every response wrong, and you get caught in a \nquagmire of no response, which would be the worst response, in my \nopinion.\n  Having said that, I focus on two areas where we should be a lot \nbetter off than we were 4 years ago, where there is a large deficiency. \nOne I will touch on is Iraq. Again, as somebody who supported the \nPresident going into Iraq and supported the $87 billion, I am troubled, \ndeeply troubled, by the lack of planning, not just in the prisons but \nin the whole way the peace has been managed.\n  No one knows what is going to happen on June 30. We set a June 30 \ndeadline and then we have to fill in the blanks. What do we want to do? \nHow long does it take? The lack of planning has been troubling. It is \ntaking the great military victory we had in Iraq, a justified victory, \nand turning it into certainly less than a complete success in terms of \nwhat happened afterward.\n  So this inadequate planning, the ``go it alone'' attitude which my \ncolleagues discussed, means we should be a lot better off than we were.\n  The place I want to focus on in my remaining few minutes is homeland \nsecurity. It is a truism that has been stated before, but it is not \nirrelevant still. To win a war, to win a game, you need a good offense \nand a good defense. My colleagues talked about some of the problems on \nour team's offense. Let me talk about our problems on our team's \ndefense. We are better off than we were 4 years ago in terms of \nhomeland security. No question. Our guard was down, we know that. But \nwe are not close to where we should be.\n\n  What has happened is basically this: While this administration is \nwilling to fully fund the war on terror overseas--and we will get \nrepeated requests for more dollars, which we will support, provided \nthey are planned out and we see what they are doing with the money--we \nare totally short on homeland security. There are so many areas where \nwe are weak: Port security, rail security, computer technology, the \nborders, who is coming in and who is not.\n  What is frustrating is, we can solve all these problems. They are not \ntechnologically beyond our reach. We can have foreigners cross our \nborders free and clear and yet keep bad people out if we have the right \ncomputer systems and the right cards that we can give to foreigners \nbefore they come in.\n  We can make our rail and our ports far more secure. We can develop \ndevices that can detect explosives and biological and chemical weapons. \nWe can detect nuclear devices so, God forbid, if one is sent over here, \nwe will get it at the borders.\n  And why is the pace so slow? I will tell you why. Somehow the \npriorities in the White House are not to spend money on homeland \nsecurity. It is to talk about it. It is to do some photo opportunities. \nLet me share with the American people somebody who has been deeply \nconcerned and ahead of our task force on this side on homeland \nsecurity. Every time we ask for the dollars that are needed to tighten \none area--we say $10 is needed, and they say, We will give you $1.50.\n  An example, shoulder-held missiles. We know the terrorists have them. \nGod forbid, they smuggle 10 of them into this country, and on a given \nmoment take down a plane in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, \nSeattle, Denver, Boston, Miami. The mayhem. Of course, all the progress \nwe are trying to make on the economy would go right down the drain. No \none would fly for 6 months or a year.\n  We can arm every one of our commercial planes so they can avoid these \nshoulder-held missiles. Our military planes have them. Air Force One \nhas them. People on their own private jets, wealthy people, have them. \nWe are not doing it on our commercial planes. It is a slow walk.\n  We said take $8 billion to do the whole thing in 2 years out of the \n$80 billion we are spending on the missile defense system--which was \ndesigned to fight Russia and now Russia, thank God, or the Communist \nSoviet Union, is no longer our enemy. And they said no. They do not say \nlet's not do it, but they say let's spend $50 million and study it.\n  We know what is going on. I have spoken to people in the White House \nwho will talk to me privately and say they will not spend a nickel on \nhomeland security. Between the military and the idea of cutting taxes, \ncutting taxes, cutting taxes, you cannot do it all. And it seems to me \nhomeland security should be just as high a priority as helping our \ntroops overseas fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet there is \nnothing.\n  It hurts our localities. It is not just New York City, my city, \nwhere, obviously, we have a real problem. In Buffalo, Rochester, and \nsmaller places, Watertown, Jamestown, talk to the police and fire \ndepartments, and they are trying to do their job. They do not have the \ndollars to do it. So they stretch and do their best. But it is not \nbeing done right.\n\n  In place after place after place, we are only inspecting 2 percent of \nthe containers that come in on our ships. Two percent? Do you want \nthere to be a 2-percent chance that we stop someone from smuggling in \nsomething terrible? We have the technology to do it. It costs dollars. \nWe cannot do homeland security without the necessary resources to make \nit happen.\n  And every single time, the one place where we have done a good job is \non air security, to prevent people from smuggling weapons on the \nplanes. Even there we are not doing enough, but we have done better.\n  I give credit in one other place: In the biological area, we are \ndoing a B. It is not an A--it should be an A--but we are doing B. In \nalmost every one of the other areas we are at C's, D's, and F's.\n  Who in America would not spend dollars to make us safe so that, God \nforbid, another September 11 does not happen? No one. But, once again, \nit is the ideologues in the White House who say they hate spending \nmoney on domestic things. It is not just education or health care, it \nis homeland security.\n  So we are not as well off, we are not close to as well off as we \nshould be. We can do a lot better.\n  The bottom line is this: In area after area we should be far more \nsecure than we are. We have taken some steps in every area, but who \nwants to wake up one morning and say: What if? God forbid, there was a \nterrorist incident the day before, and we say: What if we had put the \ndetectors on the cranes and ports to avoid nuclear? What if we had made \nour ports secure?\n\n  Mr. President, I hope the administration will change its view on \nhomeland security and spend the dollars that are necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2400, which the clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2400) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2005 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand Senator Warner is on his way \nto the floor. I thought, in the meantime, I would make a few comments \non a very important section of the Defense authorization bill. Then the \nplan is to recognize Senator Graham of South Carolina. I believe he has \nan amendment he is working on.\n  As chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have the responsibility of overseeing a lot of nuclear \nprograms, one of the most important of which is nuclear cleanup. The \nDepartment of Energy is facing the potential collapse of its plan to \naccelerate risk reduction and cleanup of this Nation's nuclear weapons \nproduction legacy. I think we must act responsibly to give the \nDepartment the clarification it needs to complete cleanup of the sites \nin our lifetime.\n  In 1997, the Rocky Flats cleanup was expected to take until 2045, at \na cost of $17.1 billion. Now, working together, the State Government of \nColorado and the Department of Energy have developed a plan under which \nclosure is expected in 2006, at a cost of $7.1 billion. Key to our \nsuccess was the collaboration between the State and the Department of \nEnergy in devising the path forward.\n  The initiative to accelerate cleanup of the tank farms was proceeding \non a similar path in other States. The DOE had been working with each \nof the various host States to develop strategies for acceleration and \nclosure plans in the States of Washington and Idaho, as well as South \nCarolina.\n  We were so very successful in getting cleanup at Rocky Flats in \nColorado and saving billions upon billions of dollars for the taxpayers \nthat I was hoping we could put together a plan that would be working \nwell in cleanup efforts in those three States which still have \nconsiderable challenges ahead of them.\n  Last year, the Idaho District Court threw a monkey wrench in those \nplans. The court interpreted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to prevent \nthe plans that DOE and the States have agreed on from going forward, by \nstriking down a cornerstone of these plans, which was DOE's approach to \nclassifying the waste in the tanks.\n  It is not just the accelerated cleanup plans that were called into \nquestion, it is also the base plans that the Department of Energy had \nin place for years. Now in South Carolina and Washington, since the \n1980s, it has been clear that the cleanup plans have called for less \nradioactive tank waste being treated and disposed of onsite. Unless the \nlaw is clarified, these plans will not be able to proceed, and it will \nbe impossible to devise new ones.\n  It is our responsibility in the Congress and as members of the Armed \nServices Committee to clarify the law so as to allow the plans agreed \nupon by DOE and the States to proceed. I am convinced if we work \ntogether we can achieve the same kind of results on complex issues such \nas we achieved at Rocky Flats, where we accelerated cleanup by 40 years \nat Rocky Flats, significantly reducing risks to the public and workers \nand saving the taxpayers $10 billion.\n  If we do not get this problem solved at the nuclear sites in Idaho \nand Washington and South Carolina, what we are going to end up with is \na possible increase in additional costs of $86 billion. We simply \ncannot deal with those kinds of costs. And consider the stress that is \nin the Armed Services right now. So it means you just do not move \nforward with cleanup.\n  The Senators from those three States, I know, have been spending a \ngood deal of time trying to work out an agreement. It is called the WIR \nissue. In committee, we fenced off $350 million that was set aside to \ndeal with cleanup in those three sites and other parts of the country. \nWe did that so it would not get used in other parts of the bill because \nif you allow that money to go out, that means there is less money for \ncleanup. And those of us who have been pushing cleanup for years in the \nSenate would not want to lose that $350 million because it would be \njust hanging out there. So we fenced it off.\n  We adopted an amendment in committee that was proposed by Senator \nGraham to kind of get us out of committee and give the delegations from \nthose States an opportunity to negotiate and see if they could work out \nsome better provisions than what we left with out of committee. We \nsimply have to work out something. If we cannot get an agreement, maybe \nwe will have to step in to just work with those three States and see \nwhat other provisions we can move forward so the cleanup, at least, can \nmove forward.\n  I am very concerned that we do not stop cleanup. Cleanup is very \nimportant. It is something we need to move forward. The plan DOE had in \nmind was a plan that would have met performance standards that have \nbeen specified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. They are the ones \nwho have oversight for disposal of low-level waste. And the debate over \nwhether the grout used to stabilize residue should be included in \nconcentration areas is basically a red herring because the bottom line \nis, what we are doing here meets the requirements of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission.\n  So I am hopeful that on the floor of the Senate we can get this \nproblem further resolved than what we did in committee.\n  I understand Senator Graham might have an amendment he wants to bring \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot recognize other Senators.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3170\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. \n3170.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3170.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, reading of the amendment is \ndispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the treatment by the Department of Energy of \n                            waste material)\n\n       Strike section 3119 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3119. TREATMENT OF WASTE MATERIAL.\n\n       (a) Availability of Funds for Treatment.--Of the amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 3102(a)(1) for \n     environmental management for defense site acceleration \n     completion, $350,000,000 shall be available for the following \n     purposes at the sites referred to in subsection (b):\n       (1) The safe management of tanks or tank farms used to \n     store waste from reprocessing activities.\n       (2) The on-site treatment and storage of wastes from \n     reprocessing activities and related waste.\n       (3) The consolidation of tank waste.\n       (4) The emptying and cleaning of storage tanks.\n       (5) Actions under section 3116.\n       (b) Sites.--The sites referred to in this subsection are as \n     follows:\n       (1) The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \n     Laboratory, Idaho.\n       (2) The Savannah River Site, Aiken, South Carolina.\n       (3) The Hanford Site, Richland, Washington.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Allard and Crapo be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator \nAllard's comments. I will try to explain this amendment the best I can \nand as briefly as I can.\n  Several States played a very key role in winning the cold war by \nmaking sure we had a strong and effective nuclear deterrent. South \nCarolina is one of them, as are Idaho and Washington. They are States \nthat have cold-war legacy materials.\n  As Senator Allard suggested, the Federal Government has been working \nwith these sites for decades now. We spent billions of dollars--\nbillions and billions and billions of dollars--to clean up the cold-war \nlegacy that exists at the Savannah River site and other sites. To be \nhonest with you, we have spent a lot of money and have\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\ndone very little cleanup. From a taxpayer point of view, from an \nenvironmental point of view, the longer you put this off, the more it \ncosts, and the more damage that can be done.\n  I have an amendment that would allow $350 million that has been put \non the table by the Department of Energy to accelerate cleanup--$350 \nmillion has been put on the table in, I think, a very creative fashion \nto accelerate cleanup at these sites, putting new money on the table.\n  Here is a little history about what has gone on in terms of how DOE \nand the sites have been dealing with each other. There are 50-plus \ntanks of high-level waste in South Carolina as a direct result of \nwinning the cold war, cold war legacy materials. The State of \nWashington has certainly done its share in helping win the cold war. \nThey have a waste tank problem. Idaho has waste. These three States \nhave a problem. It is now time to create an environment to fix the \nproblem for each State.\n  Two years ago the State of Idaho entered into a cleanup agreement \nwith the Department of Energy, setting standards that the State of \nIdaho would agree to help remediate the environment and clean up the \nsites in Idaho so that we could move forward to have a new day in \nIdaho.\n  Washington has been negotiating with the Department of Energy to come \nup with acceptable standards for cleanup of the waste in tanks and \nother areas, and there are ongoing negotiations.\n  South Carolina, for over a year, has been negotiating with the \nDepartment of Energy about how to clean up 51 tanks that contain high-\nlevel nuclear waste. People in South Carolina want the waste cleaned \nup. They want it done in an environmentally sound manner, and people in \nSouth Carolina want it done sooner rather than later. They are \nconscious of the cost to the taxpayer.\n  All three States at some stage have negotiated with the Department of \nEnergy about waste in their particular States and how they can find \nagreement between the Department of Energy and the State to remediate \nthe site.\n  I am here to say, thankfully, that the Department of Energy and the \nState regulators in South Carolina have come up with a plan that will \nallow these 51 tanks, 2 of which have already been cleaned up, to be \ncleaned up and to close them, that is environmentally sound, in my \nopinion.\n  But it is just not my opinion. The people responsible for the \ngroundwater and the environmental safety of South Carolina, in \nconjunction with the Governor's office and the Department of Energy, \nhave come up with an agreement to allow these tanks to be closed. The \ntanks will be cleaned up in a manner that will save $16 billion \ncompared to the old plan, and it will allow the tanks to be closed up \n23 years ahead of schedule.\n  The issue is what is environmentally sound cleanup for the State of \nSouth Carolina and any other State that has this legacy material. No. \n1, no State should be forced to accept standards that they find \nunacceptable for the State in terms of their environmental needs. The \namendment I have authored and that is part of the base Defense \nauthorization bill ratifies the agreement that South Carolina has \nachieved with the Department of Energy. Under that agreement, my State \nregulators tell me that the permitting process of how you close up a \ntank and when you close up a tank and when a tank can be closed up is a \ncollaborative process between the State and the Department of Energy. \nThey feel they are protected. They have reached an agreement that the \nlast 1.5 inches of waste that is in the bottom of these rather large \ntanks can be environmentally remediated in a manner safe for South \nCarolina that would prevent people from unnecessarily risking their \nlives to go get that last inch and a half and save $16 billion.\n  What does it mean? It means that some things that were going to go to \nYucca Mountain don't have to go because to send them to Yucca Mountain \nis not environmentally necessary and it is not financially sensible. I \nhope other States can find a way to get there. I know Washington is \ntalking. I know Idaho had an agreement 2 years ago. All I am asking is \nthat South Carolina be allowed to execute this agreement that is good \nfor South Carolina and the Nation and will move forward and clean up in \na sound manner.\n\n  The amendment I am offering today doesn't deal with that issue. It \ndeals with the idea that the $350 million to clean up sites in \nWashington and Idaho, that the money due to Washington and Idaho shall \nbe spent on cleanup, that the Department of Energy cannot require \neither one of those States to enter into an agreement to get this \ncleanup money like we have in South Carolina.\n  My goal has been to do two things: that my State could reach a sound \nagreement with the Department of Energy to get it ratified for the best \ninterests of South Carolina--and the Nation--and not do anything in \nSouth Carolina that is going to harm any other State's ability to \nnegotiate on their terms and to reach an agreement that is sound for \ntheir State, and not to change any standards of what would leave South \nCarolina going to Yucca Mountain or any other repository. So this \nlanguage requires the Department of Energy to spend money to treat the \nwaste in South Carolina, Idaho, and Washington. It also allows the \nagreement to be financed in South Carolina.\n  I know there is some disagreement on this issue. I welcome the \ndebate. That is what the Senate is all about, having two sides of every \nstory. But this is not something we just came into lightly; this is \nsomething that has been going on between the Department of Energy and \nSouth Carolina for a very long time. Similar processes are going on now \nin Idaho and Washington.\n  I am asking this body to join with me to make sure that the \nDepartment of Energy spends the money to treat the waste in these three \nsites, and that we not bind any site by the agreement in South Carolina \nbut we allow the agreement between South Carolina and the Department of \nEnergy to be ratified. Not only is it good for my State, it is good for \nthis Nation if we can clean up these tanks in an environmentally sound \nmanner 23 years ahead of schedule and save $16 billion. That is my \nhope.\n  As to what is left behind, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has \nlooked at the 1.5 inches of material left in the bottom of the tank and \nhas classified it as waste incidental to reprocessing, which is a \nseparate category from high-level waste. The people in South Carolina \nwho regulate our environment and have an obligation to protect the \nState's groundwater and other environmental obligations have said that \nthis waste that is left can be dealt with in a sound manner, and to get \nthe 1.5 inches totally out would risk people's lives and would take \nunnecessary time and expense, and that we are going to secure these \ntanks in a way over which South Carolina would have control.\n  I didn't come to Washington to tell my State it is not a player in \ncontrolling its waste. I hope Washington will allow us who have these \nsites to work in a sound manner for the benefit of the taxpayers in the \nState and the Nation and for the environmental needs of our State.\n  That is what this is about. If we stay the old course and we never \nallow anybody to do anything other than the most extreme groups out \nthere in terms of what this is all about--and there is politics in \nevery issue, and there should be. There are some people who have an \nagenda that is not about the groundwater in South Carolina because they \ndon't live there. Some of them are very well motivated, but some of \nthem have an agenda to make cleaning up these sites very difficult, to \nthe point that they don't care what it costs, and they are not trying \nto get a fair standard. They want to make it take as long as it takes \nand spend as much money as is necessary and send everything to Yucca \nMountain and other repositories because they have an agenda that we \ndon't want to produce any more nuclear power and run out of places to \nstore fuel rods.\n  I don't want to be part of that agenda. I want to be a part of an \nagenda that allows each State that has these waste materials to be able \nto control their destiny, do it in a way that is safe for the State and \nmakes sense for the Nation. That is exactly what we have accomplished.\n  Idaho and Washington have tried to do the same thing we are doing. \nThey have tried to work with the Department of Energy to get an \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\nWe have been successful. I will never, as a Senator, leverage one of my \nsister States here to have to agree to something to which they don't \nwant to agree. That is not my goal.\n  I hope the Senate and the Congress will allow an agreement that has \nbeen negotiated to its full term to be approved and to help South \nCarolina save some money. I am ready to agree on a small time \nagreement, a large one, or whatever time agreement we can have on this \namendment, and have a vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator from South Carolina will yield, I wish to \nenter into a colloquy with him to make sure we have laid out this \ndebate.\n  First, we had a plan by the DOE to expedite cleanups of sites in \nSouth Carolina, Washington, and Idaho. Then we had a court case that \nwas litigated in the district court in Idaho. As a result of that, that \ncase is going to definitely be appealed to the Federal court of appeals \nand may even go as far as the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime, we \nhave some cleanup needs in these various States.\n  As I understand what the Senator's amendment would provide, we are \ngoing to keep our $350 million for cycling, which is vital, and it is \ngoing to say that the money is going to be available for treatment. But \nwe are not going to have any removal or anything from a contaminated \nsite, except for South Carolina. South Carolina has a plan that has \nbeen worked out with the State. The State is very comfortable with it. \nIt is a State-driven plan. We are trying to work out something where we \ndon't create a problem among the various States. We don't want this \nprocess to tie up South Carolina and, obviously, we want to see cleanup \nmove ahead in Idaho and Washington.\n  My concern, as chairman of the subcommittee, is that I don't want to \nsee taxpayer dollars wasted on a huge white elephant out there that \nwill add something like $86 billion to the cleanup budget, which we \ndon't have.\n  I hope we can work this out, and you are trying to work it out among \nyourselves. I hope I characterized it properly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. The Senator has done a good job \ncharacterizing it.\n  No. 1, this amendment makes the money flow for treatment. There is \nthe $350 million in committee with regard to the argument that there is \na fence built around it. If there is any concern about it, this \namendment knocks that fence down. The money has to be spent on \ntreatment of waste. There is a lot of waste to be treated. But it also \nallows for a disposal plan agreed to between South Carolina and DOE.\n  Other States, the Senator is right, have been negotiating and trying \nto find a disposal plan. We have just been successful, that is all. \nOther States have different needs and tank problems. We don't have \ntanks leaking as they do in Washington. Washington has different needs \nand concerns. I don't want to wait 23 years and allow these things to \nleak as we try to clean up the last inch and a half; I think that does \nmore damage than good.\n  This is where we do agree. DOE, by order 43.5, I think it is, tried \nto issue an internal order allowing them to unilaterally go into these \nStates and say: Here are the cleanup standards, take it or leave it.\n\n  Then you had a court case in Idaho where South Carolina joined as a \nfriend of the court, with an amicus brief, saying, no, we don't want \nthe DOE unilaterally telling a State to take it or leave it. That is \nwhy we joined as a friend of the court. We think that is a bad policy.\n  What we want to do, and what all three States have tried to do, is \nmake sure cleanup occurs in an environmentally sound manner, where the \nStates are involved. What we have been able to do in South Carolina is \nreach that agreement to have the waste stream cleaned up. What is left \nin the bottom of the tank we believe we can handle in an \nenvironmentally sound manner. Some people don't want us to do that. \nThat is not their agenda to accomplish that. It is my agenda that we \naccomplish that when and how we can.\n  We are not going to let the DOE unilaterally decide. That is what \nthis amendment is about. It doesn't allow the Department of Energy to \ntake money away from a site. They have to let the $350 million go. The \nlanguage in the bill, which Senator Allard helped me write and get \npassed, ensures that South Carolina is protected. Now we need language \nto ratify that agreement.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his hard work and \ndiligence. Certainly, I am glad he is a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with him on many issues.\n  I know there is a good deal of frustration on this particular issue. \nI recognize, in a public way, his dedication and hard work on this \nissue in trying to clean up this area. It is very important to his \nState and, hopefully, we can reach some kind of agreement in the \nensuing few hours on this debate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I say to Senator Allard, he has been a \nvery responsible subcommittee chairman here. This is a big deal for the \ncountry, to South Carolina, Idaho, and Washington, and any other State. \nIt is a huge deal. We need to make sure these sites are remediated and \nthe environment of each State is protected and that we get on with it \nand not give DOE unilateral authority to tell us what to do, and do it \nin a collaborative way.\n  We have achieved that in South Carolina. I think it would be \ninappropriate if Washington or Idaho could reach an agreement between \nDOE, and Idaho and Washington ran it by the NRC and they say, yes, we \nlike this agreement, we think it protects us, we would like to do it, \nand then somebody else says no, or they make up a reason of telling us \nno, which would prevent this from ever happening.\n  Now, we are going to disagree over some aspects of this. But here is \nwhere we do not disagree. The States are going to get the money, \nwhether or not they reach an agreement with DOE. We are not going to \nlet them do it unilaterally. We want to make sure every State has a \nright to negotiate an agreement on their own terms.\n  There is nothing in this amendment that is going to prejudice another \nState in terms of their ability to reach an agreement with DOE on their \nterms, if they can. I think this is a very important concept.\n  This is a pivotal time in our effort to clean up these sites. I say \nto my friend from Nevada and all those folks at Yucca Mountain, if I \nwere in Nevada, I would have the same concerns. I totally understand \nthat. But the rest of us have an obligation, too. I don't think it is \nfair just to make Nevada be the only one on the receiving end of what \nis fair and appropriate. If we can, in our individual States, in an \nenvironmentally sound manner, deal with some of this waste--an inch and \na half--not to send it to Yucca Mountain, not spend $16 billion and \ntake 23 years, I think we have some obligation to be part of the \nsolution.\n  Let it be said that South Carolina, from the regulator's side--their \nview is we have reached that agreement. I hope we can pass this \namendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have a letter from the Defense Nuclear \nFacilities Safety Board to the Secretary of Energy. It addresses the \ndisposal of waste as contemplated in section 3116. The last paragraph \nreads:\n\n       The Board believes that disposal of wastes as contemplated \n     in Section 3116 can be accomplished safely and should enable \n     efficient disposition of the radioactive waste. The Board, \n     under its statutory safety oversight mandate, will continue \n     to follow DOE's actions to ensure that activities related to \n     disposal of such waste are conducted safely.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     Secretary of Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Abraham: This is in response to the letter \n     of May 13, 2004, from the Assistant Secretary for \n     Environmental Management regarding the nuclear safety \n     consequences of proposed Section 3116 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (S. 2400). Section \n     3116 would permit certain radioactive residual materials to \n     remain in a facility (including a tank) at the Savannah River \n     Site.\n       Safe disposal of radioactive waste is essential to \n     preserving public health and safety. In 1994, the Board \n     issued Recommendation 94-2, Conformance with Safety Standards \n     at Department of Energy Low-Level Nuclear Waste and Disposal \n     Sites, which identified the importance of performance \n     assessments for ensuring safe disposal of radioactive \n     materials in shallow land burial grounds. Department of \n     Energy (DOE) subsequently\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\n     issued Order 435.1, Radioactive Waste Management, which \n     defines an acceptable process for conducting the required \n     performance assessments for DOE onsite waste disposal \n     activities.\n       During the period 1996 to 1997, the DOE at the Savannah \n     River Site undertook the closure of two high level waste \n     tanks. At that time, The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety \n     Board (Board) closely observed the undertakings and saw no \n     basis to determine that the remaining residual material \n     constituted a danger to the public. The closure process \n     involved transport modeling of the residual material left in \n     the tanks.\n       When conducted with appropriate rigor, a performance \n     assessment can provide a conservative estimate of potential \n     safety and health consequences. When these estimates meet \n     acceptable safety standards (i.e., DOE Order 435.1 or 10 CFR \n     Part 61 subpart C, Performance Objectives), it is reasonable \n     to conclude that the disposal action adequately protects \n     public health and safety.\n       The Board believes that disposal of wastes as contemplated \n     in Section 3116 can be accomplished safely and should enable \n     efficient disposition of the radioactive waste. The Board, \n     under its statutory safety oversight mandate, will continue \n     to follow DOE's actions to ensure that activities related to \n     disposal of such wastes are conducted safely.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John T. Conway,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have not had the opportunity to work \nwith my distinguished colleague. We have worked very closely together \non many matters, and I have the highest respect for him. It has really \nbeen a pleasure for this Senator to work with him as he has come over \nto the Senate.\n  Only yesterday on our way to a vote, I asked him about this issue \nbecause I heard about it from our colleague from the State of \nWashington, Senator Cantwell. He said he had a letter from the \nEnvironmental Control Division of the State of South Carolina.\n  I thereupon got in touch with the director of the DHEC of South \nCarolina, the Department of Health and Environmental Control. Mr. \nHunter said: Oh, no, we adamantly oppose any kind of reclassification \nof high-level to low-level.\n  I said: That is exactly what is being done.\n  He said: That is not what we understand. We know that Senator Graham \nhas been working with the Department of Energy, and we were led to \nbelieve we would have a signoff on it and his amendment would give us \nany kind of collaborative agreement, as characterized by the \ndistinguished Senator, that was worked out, and we could sign off on \nit.\n  On page 2 of the amendment, he refers to subsection A and subsection \nB--rather subsection A shall not apply to any other material otherwise \ncovered by that subsection that is transported from the State. Then \ndown in section D, in this section, the term ``State'' means the State \nof South Carolina. So referring to that particular section, what we \nhave is not a preemption, but really the preemption is invalid. That \nlanguage is, ``any such action may be completed pursuant to the terms \nof the closure plan of the State-issued permit notwithstanding the \nfinal criteria adopted by the rulemaking pursuant to subsection A.''\n  We had this in the Kentucky case with respect to the supremacy \nclause. We know this has already been taken to the 6th Circuit Court. \nThat does not protect the State of South Carolina at all. I know my \ndistinguished colleague wants to protect the State of South Carolina, \nbut I think he even knows now that language does not protect the State.\n  I asked: Where in the world did this all come from anyway?\n  He said: Oh, Senator, we have been working on it.\n  We have a brief filed on March 25, a certificate of a brief in the \ncase of the National Resources Defense Council v. Spencer Abraham. We \nwon the case, and it is up on appeal. On this appeal, we have signed \nthat brief, Samuel L. Finckley III, South Carolina Department of Health \nand Environmental Control--that was just a few weeks ago--stating the \nDepartment's position.\n  I have nothing from the Governor. I know Governor Sanford extremely \nwell. We traveled back and forth for 6 years when he was in Congress. I \nknow the one thing he is known for and that is protecting the \nenvironment. Governor Sanford does not approve of this. I understand \ninformally he told my distinguished colleague: If you can work out an \nagreement that protects the State of South Carolina, then we will go \nalong with it. That is not what is occurring with this amendment.\n  I have been in this game for 50 years. In 1955, I was the chairman of \nthe Regional Advisory Council on Nuclear Energy. We called it RACNE \nthen. It was a 17-State compact. We had all the dangers of nuclear \nemissions. We looked for places for permanent storage. At that time, in \nthe early fifties, they said--at that time, I was Lieutenant Governor--\nthey said: Governor, don't worry about it. This Savannah River site we \nare developing is twofold very dangerous for any kind of permanent \nstorage. One reason is this site is over the Tuscaloosa aquifer water \nsupply that comes down below Aiken County. More than anything else, \nthere is an earthquake fault from Calhoun, Orangeburg, into Aiken \nCounty. He said: We are not going to have anything stored here for over \n2 years.\n\n  Two years became 4, 4 became 8, 8 became 16, 16 became 32, and now it \nis some 50 years. It has been some 50 years and that problem has yet to \nbe solved.\n  We worked on the financial end of the problem, and we exacted 1/10th \nof one cent on a kilowatt of power sold by the various energy companies \nengaged in nuclear power, and that fund has some $13 billion in it. We \nare not worried about money. The Department of Energy went around--and \nthat is the case to which I am referring. They ran around and \nsurreptitiously said we are going to reclassify and call it low-level \nwaste, and that means we can save a lot of money and bother and use the \nmoney maybe on tax cuts. Don't worry about that fund because the power \ncompanies have sued on the particular fund. Otherwise, that fund has \nbeen built up, and there is plenty of money.\n  It is just not cleaning it up. They were trying to empty out the \nwaste and throw some sand and concrete on top of it. We found out in \nexpert hearings back in 1982, when we classified it as high-level \nwaste--the finest of experts came in, and that is where the \nclassification came, and that, my dear friends, is what should occur \nhere.\n  If there is some reason to reclassify, then let's come before the \nEnvironment Committee and the Energy Committee and let's have a hearing \nas has been provided for by my colleague, the distinguished Congressman \nfrom the 5th District, Congressman John Spratt, whereby on the House \nside they said, let's refer to the National Academy of Sciences, and we \nwill go about it in a deliberate way, and if the Energy Department \nwants it reclassified and has some authoritative source that will \nsupport their particular position, maybe the Congress itself will \nreclassify. But this has been classified by us, upheld in the courts, \nnow on appeal, and here they come around in a fancy little \nsurreptitious way on a Defense authorization bill and get the Graham \nlanguage in the bill that would not hold up in the State legislature \nwhere general provision would say it is unconstitutional.\n  When I heard about this going on, I looked to see if maybe this was \nunconstitutional, but it is not.\n  That can be done, and it has been done already. So there has been \nprecedent set for this. I can say categorically, the State in the last \n48 hours is in an uproar over this particular measure. They did not \nknow of any kind of special provision that was going to be put on for \none State in a Defense authorization bill. They resent it, they resist \nit, and they have asked me by advertisement and telephone calls to \nplease ``adamantly oppose,'' is the expression they have used.\n  This is all in the offing. We can see what my colleague has done. He \nhas put language on here so that when the deal is made with the Energy \nDepartment where apparently the State still would have a signoff--under \nthe supremacy clause, the Federal Government has got it--and it means \nabsolutely nothing, but it allows them to get the deal and lock the \nState in, and then we will start all the legal proceedings all over \nagain.\n  So I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this is no way \nto legislate high-level waste in the United States. I have worked with \nthe Department of Energy. We have the facility\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\ndown when Secretary Richardson--now the Governor of New Mexico--was in, \nand I have brought every particular benefit that I could possibly bring \nto this particular facility, but apparently the contractors want to \nmove ahead and certainly the Department of Energy wants to move ahead \nand not have to pay out the full sums. If they can get a precedent set \nfor the reclassification in a surreptitious fashion of this kind called \nlow-level waste, then it will set a precedent for the other States and \nwe have an environmental disaster in the offing because we will not be \nhere.\n  That is about the attitude around here, that if it can be handled in \na day's time, then let us forget about the future. This is a highly \ndangerous procedure. It is wrong for the State of South Carolina. It is \nwrong for the Nation. It is wrong for the Department of Energy.\n  I had misgivings when the Secretary of Energy came up for nomination. \nI remembered very clearly my debate with Spencer Abraham. He wanted to \nabolish the Department of Energy and abolish the Department of \nCommerce. I can see him over on that side of the floor right now. We \nhad a debate about that. I was sort of shocked that he would want to be \nSecretary of a Department that he wanted to abolish, but he is a good \nfellow. I got along with him, and I said, all right, I will cast a vote \nand keep my fingers crossed. But this is monkeyshines. We cannot go \nalong with this one.\n  If they want a reclassification--this is not a money problem, this is \na reclassification problem--then let us reclassify it in the orderly \nfashion in which we made the classification back some 22 years ago in \nthe Congress.\n  The House of Representatives says let us handle it that way, so let \nus handle it that way over in the Senate. If we want to give permission \nto have hearings and then change that law, that is fine business, let \nus do it in that fashion, but do not put a rider that says this is for \nthe interest of the State of South Carolina because it is not. It is \nnot in the interest of the United States of America.\n  I do not know how else we can solve this. I know the other States are \ninvolved. The Senator from Michigan on the Defense appropriations has \nbeen very alert on this particular measure. I am just a Johnny-come-\nlately to it, but it affects my State, and it affects an area that I \nhave been vitally interested in for over 50 years now. I have worked \nwith every particular facet that one can think of. Never has this \nSenator been contacted about this deal. I know the Governor, I know his \nposition on the environment, and I know he will not approve of this \none.\n  I can tell my colleagues right now that reclassifying high level as \nlow level, saying that we protect the State of South Carolina when we \nknow the legalistic wording is just that, legalistic wording, has \nalready been found ineffective by the highest court of the land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I came to the floor with the \nunderstanding that we are in a moment where we haven't been able to \nmove forward legislatively as far as the schedule goes. I wanted to \ntake a few minutes of leader time to comment on a number of specific \nissues.\n\n\n          Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yesterday I spoke about the Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act. This is a critical piece of health care \nlegislation. One in five Americans today suffers from a mental illness \nevery year. Many are now denied health care they need because of legal \ndiscrimination by their health insurers. Such discrimination often \ntakes a terrible toll on people with mental illness, their families, \nand all of us.\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\n  It is estimated that not treating mental illness costs our society \n$300 billion a year. The Wellstone bill will end that discrimination \nfor all Americans. It is modest, affordable, and urgently needed.\n  I mentioned yesterday people from across America were coming to \nWashington on June 10 for a rally in support of mental health parity \nand the Wellstone bill. The famous Wellstone green bus that Paul loved \nto campaign on is coming back here for that rally.\n  It is my hope the majority leader will agree to allow the Senate to \nvote on the Wellstone bill prior to the June 10 rally. I think it would \nbe a fitting tribute to Paul, and it would make a profound difference \nfor millions of Americans who live with mental illness.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daschle pertaining to the introduction of S. 2451 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                     commemoration of memorial day\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, in the Black Hill National \nCemetery, SD, SSG Cory Brooks was laid to rest.\n  A member of the South Dakota National Guard, Sergeant Brooks died in \nIraq in late April, and his friends and family gathered to remember his \nlaughter, his joyful spirit, and his love of country.\n  Among the mourners was a man Cory Brooks had never met, Pat Red Fox.\n  Mr. Red Fox came as a representative of the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe.\n  Six months earlier, the tribe had suffered the loss of PVT Sheldon \nHawk Eagle, who died when his Black Hawk helicopter collided with \nanother above Mosul.\n  The families of Sheldon Hawk Eagle and Cory Brooks had little in \ncommon on the surface.\n  But each passed along the values of service and patriotism to their \nchildren.\n  With pride and sorrow, each said good-bye as their loved ones were \nshipped overseas. And each prayed that Sheldon and Cory would complete \ntheir mission unharmed. Today, they are bound to one another in \nmourning.\n  And so to acknowledge this bond, this sacred bond that transcends all \napparent differences, the family of Sheldon Hawk Eagle sent Pat Red Fox \nto Cory Brooks' funeral with one of the most valued gifts in the Sioux \ntradition--a star quilt bearing the colors of our Nation, and the Sioux \nsymbol representing the immortality of the soul and the connection \nbetween the living and the dead.\n  During the upcoming recess, our Nation will commemorate Memorial Day \nwith a special unity, immediacy, and poignancy.\n  As we honor those who gave their lives for their country in \ngenerations past, young American soldiers today face mortal danger.\n  As we offer thanks for the sacrifice of families who suffered the \nloss of loved ones, hundreds of American families are today mourning \nthe deaths of their children, spouses, and parents.\n  For them, the cost of war and the price of freedom is not a thing of \nmemory. It is the inescapable fact of their lives. And their pain and \nshock reverberate throughout American communities.\n  All Americans stand together in awe of the courage of our soldiers, \nand in gratitude for their sacrifice.\n  But the urgency of this Memorial Day also serves to amplify and \nclarify our understanding of America's history.\n  Within the sacrifices of today's soldiers, we see a clear reflection \nof the sacrifice of those who came before.\n  Like our soldiers today, our veterans, too, left families behind. \nThey, too, woke up to uncertain dangers. They, too, saw their friends \nfall. Yet, knowing both their risks and their responsibilities, they, \ntoo, performed their duty each day. And many gave their lives.\n  Forty years ago, President Kennedy noted that no nation ``in the \nhistory of the world has buried its soldiers farther from its native \nsoil than we Americans--or closer to the towns in which they grew up.''\n  At our proudest moments, the American people have sent our sons and \ndaughters across the globe to fight for freedom.\n  Today, the honor of defending those who cannot defend themselves is \ncarried forward by young American soldiers. But their service is \ndoubled, for in addition to offering a chance for freedom to the Iraqi \npeople, they are renewing our understanding of the cost of war, the \nprice of freedom, and the immeasurable depths of American valor.\n  Seven hundred and ninety one Americans have lost their lives in Iraq. \nAnother 122 have died in Afghanistan during the course of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  As was true in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, South \nDakotans have volunteered for service in disproportionate numbers. And \nas before, South Dakota has borne a disproportionate share of loss. \nSeven of South Dakota's sons have lost their lives in this conflict:\n  CWO Hans GOO-Keye-sen, of Lead; PFC Michael DOOL, of Nemo; CWO Scott \nSaboe, of Willow Lake; CPT Chris SOUL-zer, of Sturgis; SP Dennis \nMorgan, of Winner; PFC Sheldon Hawk Eagle, of Eagle Butte; SSG Cory \nBrooks, of Philip.\n  For them and for the hundreds more who have lost their lives in \nservice to their country, America is united in sorrow, and in debt for \ntheir sacrifice.\n  But this sorrow, and this debt, is not unique to us. In many ways, it \nhas been the central experience of each and every American generation.\n  My father was an Army sergeant in World War II. He landed on the \nbeaches of Normandy with the 6th Armored Division on ``D Plus 1''--June \n7, 1944.\n  He was injured during the landing, and, as he was recovering, one of \nhis duties was sending word back to the States of those who had died so \ntheir loved ones could be notified.\n  That experience left my father with a profound sense of respect for \nthe sacrifices that freedom sometimes demands, and he passed that \nlesson on to his four sons.\n  When I was a boy, every Memorial Day, my parents would take my \nbrothers and me to the cemetery to pay our respects to the heroes who \nlie buried there.\n  Later in life, when I was in the service, I learned the lesson in a \ndeeper way, as friends of mine lost their lives in Vietnam.\n  The men whose names my father sent home from Normandy, the men whose \nnames are carved into The Wall in Washington, and all of the other \nnoble heroes we honor gave their lives to preserve our freedom.\n  We are in their debt--today and every day. Now a new generation of \nAmericans is called to battle--in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other \nareas around the world. And once again, they are answering the call, \nand making us proud.\n  In 1868, just three years after the end of the bloodiest conflict our \nNation has ever known, General James Garfield led the first observance \nof the holiday we now know as Memorial Day.\n  Standing among the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers alike, he \nsaid:\n\n       If silence is ever golden, it must be here beside the \n     graves of fifteen thousand men whose lives were more \n     significant than speech and whose death was a poem the music \n     of which can never be sung.\n       We do not know one promise these men made, one pledge they \n     gave, one word they spoke; but we do know they summed up and \n     perfected, by one supreme act, the highest virtues of men and \n     citizens.\n       For love of country they accepted death, and thus resolved \n     all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and virtue.\n\n  No words, no ceremony could add to the honor they won in their lives.\n  So this year, with the heroism of our soldiers so radiant, we must \nacknowledge that Memorial Day is not commemorated for the sake of those \nwho gave their lives, but for our own.\n  We remember their courage because within it lie the seeds of our own \ncourage.\n  We remember their sacrifice, because it shows us both the cost, and \nthe value, of freedom.\n  Memorial Day is not merely a time to remember those who died in \nuniform, but a time for each of us to rededicate ourselves to trying in \nour own way, in our own lives, to meet the the example of patriotism \nset by all the men and women who defend our Nation.\n  It is a time to rededicate ourselves to carrying forward the legacy \nthat has been passed down from one generation to the next.\n  As with the families of Sheldon Hawk Eagle and Cory Brooks, it is a \nlegacy that binds together every American.\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\n  It transcends borders and generations and all political divisions.\n  Above all else, it is this shared legacy, and the great gifts that it \nhas conferred upon our Nation, that we reaffirm on Memorial Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Rule of Law\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the core concept which has guided this \nNation for 200 years has been the rule of law. That is why we have a \nConstitution. That is why we have a judiciary. That is why we have a \nnational legislature, to make and revise the laws which rule our \nconduct, one and all, no exceptions. Therefore, no one, not the \nmightiest in his mansion, not the lowest begger on the street, is \nabove, beneath, or outside the law.\n  If a law is outmoded, has lost its utility, if it is obsolete, it is \nnot the place of any citizen, no matter how high or how low, to decide \nit must no longer be obeyed. That decision rests only with the Congress \nor with an interpretation by the Federal courts. That is the only place \nthat decision can rest.\n  Yet I have in front of me a memorandum written in January of 2002 by \nAlberto Gonzales, the White House counsel to President Bush, telling \nthe President of the United States that the Third Geneva Convention of \n1949 is obsolete, that the War Crimes Act, which we passed in 1995 \nmaking it a felony to commit a grave breach of that Convention, is \ninapplicable, and that as a result, prisoners captured on the \nbattlefield can be questioned using means that would violate the Third \nGeneva Convention.\n  I am not talking about members of al-Qaida. The Gonzales memo \nspecifically discusses members of the Taliban. It makes an extremely \nquestionable argument that the Taliban are not prisoners of war because \nthey were not the government of a state.\n  That argument is most disturbing. In the first place, it represents \nprecisely the kind of arguments which the drafters of the Third Geneva \nConvention tried to defeat, drafters who included representatives of \nthe United States. Those drafters repeatedly expressed their concern \nthat the German Government, the Nazi government during World War II, \nused trumped-up legalisms to avoid applying the 1929 POW Convention to \ncaptured prisoners. One of those arguments was that Polish prisoners \nwere unprotected because, according to the Nazis, Poland had ceased to \nexist as a state. That is precisely why articles 4 and 5 of the current \nConvention are written in such broad language with such inclusive \npresumptions.\n  I am equally disturbed by Mr. Gonzales's argument that because the \nTaliban were generally unrecognized as a legal government, they should \nnot be afforded the protection required for soldiers of a de facto \ngovernment. What particularly bothers me about that is the statement \nissued by the White House late in 2001 that the United States \nrecognized that the Taliban was a de facto government of Afghanistan. \nYou cannot have it both ways. Did Mr. Gonzales forget that statement? \nDid he ignore it or did he just not care that it squarely contradicted \nhis memo of January 25, 2002, made just days later?\n  When he sent that memo to the President, over the objections of the \nSecretary of State, Mr. Gonzales and everyone else involved in its \ndrafting and preparation sowed a bitter harvest. They sowed the seeds \nof solitary confinement, of sensory deprivation, of physical \nmistreatment, of violations of religious right, of legal rights, of \nrights against intimidations and threats and torture--all grave \nbreaches of the Third Geneva Convention. They sowed the wind, and now \nwe are reaping their whirlwind caused by that memorandum from the legal \nrepresentative of the President of the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3170\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Graham amendment.\n  It is almost unbelievable that we are on the DOD authorization bill, \na very important bill that we need to discuss and move forward, as it \nsupports a lot of important things for our troops, and our military \nstrategy. But somehow the other side of the aisle and the Department of \nEnergy think they can sneak in language to this Defense authorization \nbill that would allow the reclassification of hazardous, high-level \nnuclear waste and basically call it incidental waste. Basically it \nwould reclassify nuclear waste that is in existing tanks in my State, \nin South Carolina, in Idaho, and in New York, and basically say that \nwaste can be covered over with cement, with sand, and could be grouted. \nBasically, it says we can take high-level nuclear waste and grout it--\ngrout it.\n  For most Americans, grout is something they see in their bathroom, \nnot something they do with nuclear waste. Yet this is what we have \nbefore us in the underlying Department of Defense authorization bill. \nIt is a shame. It is a shame that this body would allow such a \nsignificant change, really a change to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act on \nhow nuclear waste is classified in this country, without public debate, \nwithout a public vote, without a public hearing, even without \nlegislation discussing that change. Yet the other side of the aisle \nthinks they can come at 1 o'clock in the afternoon and offer an \namendment to change 30 years of policy, and that in the blink of an \neye, they are going to get a vote on changing that policy without \ndiscussion.\n  The underlying bill is flawed. As far as I am concerned, it has made \nthe whole DOD bill radioactive itself. Why do they play politics on an \nissue that is so important to our country? Why do they try to sneak \nthrough a change that ought to be debated in public in full daylight, \nwith people weighing in on what is appropriate science?\n  Mr. President, if I sound as if I am a little upset about this \nunderlying bill and the fact that it has this sneak attack language to \nreclassify high-level nuclear waste, you are right.\n  Fifty-three million gallons of nuclear waste reside at the Hanford \nnuclear reservation in the State of Washington.\n  This Senator wants to see that waste cleaned up. I do not believe \nthat can happen by pouring cement on top of it and putting sand in \nthose tanks and all of a sudden now say we have cleaned up waste. \nNowhere has that policy been promulgated as sound science.\n  This is a picture of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and one of its \nreactors in proximity to the Columbia River. My constituents in \nWashington State already know the 53 million-gallon tanks of nuclear \nwaste are leaking, and there are toxic plumes that have already gained \naccess to the Columbia River. So, yes, Washington State wants the tanks \nto be cleaned up. They want the material that has been part of the \nnuclear mission of this country removed from the tanks, the tanks \ncleaned up, the ground cleaned up, the plumes removed to the best \npossible extent, in order for us to go on with our mission and our life \nat the Hanford Reservation.\n  What we do not want is somebody to come in and say all of a sudden \nthese underground storage tanks that exist below ground should be taken \nand cement poured on top of them and that means they are cleaned up.\n  It is amazing to me because when I think about the Hanford project \nand what I think it meant to our country, these were men and women in \n1943 who started on a mission to produce a product that would help us \nwin the war. In less than 2 years, they had the world's first reactor \ngoing and they produced plutonium that provided a very valuable tool \nfor our country. Those men and women did their job.\n  Now we have been left with the aftermath of that and we should handle \nit in the same professional way those men and women did, by cleaning up \nthe waste and recognizing that these tanks are leaking and they are \ncausing hazard to the environment. The appropriate way to clean them up \nis by making sure the material is removed and that that material is \nplaced in a more permanent storage. That is exactly what science has \nbeen saying. Yet my colleagues believe that in this underlying bill, \nthe Defense authorization, it\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\nwas somehow appropriate, in a closed-door session, with no public, no \npublic testimony, no public witness to this language, no bill saying \nthey were going to put this in the DOD bill, they can now sneak through \nthis policy.\n  Well, thank God some people in America are paying attention because \nthey are starting to respond. I will share some of that with my \ncolleagues. For example, the Idaho Falls Post Register basically said \nthose on the other side are choosing the wrong side.\n  What happened in this case is the Department of Energy--maybe I \nshould stop for a second and give some of my colleagues a little \nreminder of how we got to this point, because everybody thinks \nreclassification of waste is something that belongs to the States. It \ndoes not belong to the States. It belongs in the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct that was passed in 1982. That was passed by Congress, after much \ndebate. It went through the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and \nthe EPW Committee. They had a discussion about what nuclear waste \ncleanup should be. They have the authority.\n  So when the Department of Energy recently said ``let us accelerate \nthe cleanup of waste, let us do it faster, we have an idea, instead of \nremoving all of the material from these tanks we can just pour cement \nand sand on top of it and somehow we can get this done quicker and \ncheaper''--I am sure everybody in America agrees that pouring sand \nand cement on top of the waste that is there instead of cleaning it up \nis cheaper. But no one says it is safer and no one says it satisfies \ncurrent law in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n\n  That is why when the Department of Energy tried to use an order \nbasically reclassifying waste, saying, ``let us try this accelerated \ncleanup, let us try this notion of grouting and see if it, in fact, is \nthe way we can do this.'' The courts have said the Department of Energy \ndoes not have that authority to reclassify the waste; the definition \nlies within the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and DOE was not consistent \nwith that act.\n  So what did the Department of Energy do when they lost that case? \nYes, it is on appeal. They can go through the appeal process. But \ninstead of coming to Congress and asking for public hearings on \nchanging the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, saying, ``listen, we think some \nwaste that ought to be able to be reclassified,'' they have snuck \nlanguage into the DOD authorizing bill.\n  Let me be clear again. Sneaking in language is having a closed-door \nsession, without public debate, without public scrutiny, without a \nhearing on the change in this reclassification.\n  Now all of a sudden we are presented with this bill and people think \nwe ought to move ahead without removing this radioactive language that \nis in the DOD bill, which I say has no business being here. If people \nwant to debate this policy, let us debate it in the broad daylight of a \nhearing and discuss what hazardous waste is and the changes to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act that might be appropriate.\n  I guarantee, if somebody wants to change the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, that bill would not go to the Senate Armed Services Committee. It \nwould be a policy that was debated by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and by the EPW Committee. It is not the Armed Services \nCommittee's jurisdiction to change the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. This \nunderlying bill basically will put in place language contradictory to \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  What are newspapers around America saying about this? Basically, the \nIdaho Falls Post Register says, ``if the courts are uncooperative, try \nblackmail. That is what DOE is doing by holding $350 million in cleanup \nfunds, including $95 million for Idaho's national engineering and \nenvironmental laboratory.\n  They go on to say, ``if blackmail fails, start cutting deals in \nsecret with Congress. DOE found an ally and behind closed doors in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee won a provision in the Defense \nauthorization bill that would allow DOE to reclassify the high-level \nSavannah River waste.''\n  I think they said it best when they said the view from Boise is more \naccurate, and that Kempthorne, the Governor, believes the measure \n``would wreck Idaho's position in the court by setting a precedent in \nshort order, it would undermine the State's landmark decision.''\n  It goes on to say: ``Why would you reward DOE for its heavyhandedness \nagainst the State by passing something in the committee with the \nthinnest of claims to jurisdiction? If the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nneeds revision, do so in the open. Hold hearings. Conduct them in \ngermane committees. What is going on here is not science, it is bare-\nknuckle politics.'' That is from the Idaho paper.\n  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer said a similar thing: ``The Senate \nshould halt the nuclear waste plan.'' Why? Because the bill gives the \nDOE the reclassification authority and withholds funds, and that this \nis a scheme to reclassify, hoping the States will cave in. It is not a \ngood idea.\n\n  What did the Idaho Statesman say? Well, basically in a headline that \nsaid ``State Cleanup Faces An All or All Proposition,'' it said: ``We \nexpect the Feds to clean up and move out all the highly radioactive \nliquid waste now stored in Idaho. No haggling, no shortcuts. Our \npolitical leaders need to hold firm even when politicians in other \nStates are willing to cut deals.''\n  What did the Spokesman Review in my State say? I thought the \nSpokesman Review had an interesting take. They said: ``For example, let \nus say the next step would be to persuade the affected parties and the \npublic there is scientific consensus on this matter. Without that, \nthere will be no hope of political consensus. The U.S. Department of \nEnergy believes leaving some waste behind is a good idea but is trying \nto slip this in as a seismic policy shift in the Defense authorization \nbill without comment or without congressional debate.''\n  I think these newspapers have it right. In fact, another newspaper in \nmy State, the Tacoma News Tribune, said: ``It was bad enough that the \nU.S. Department of Energy was trying to carry out illegal, quick, and \ndirty disposal of the Nation's most dangerous radioactive waste. Now a \nSenate committee is helping the Department circumvent the law.''\n  I think these newspapers are on to it. The Buffalo News, in their \neditorial, called it ``A Dangerous Game.''\n\n       The Federal Department of Energy is trying to use \n     administrative sleight of hand to avoid its responsibilities \n     in the cleanup of nuclear waste at West Valley and several \n     other sites. DOD is trying to downgrade the threat of nuclear \n     waste altered in this bill. The department argues that the \n     waste should be classified as high level based only on how it \n     originated, not on what they are. But what they are still is \n     bad. It's still radioactive and it's still a Federal \n     responsibility.\n\n  That is from the Buffalo News.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have all those editorials \nprinted in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Buffalo News, May 10, 2004]\n\n Dangerous Games--Federal Effort To Bury Nuclear Wastes at West Valley \n                           Is Unconscionable\n\n        The federal Department of Energy is trying to use \n     administrative sleight of hand to avoid its responsibility in \n     the cleanup of nuclear waste sites at West Valley and several \n     other states.\n        This contemptible effort involves downgrading the threat \n     of nuclear waste, thereby allowing the government to bury \n     that dangerous material at West Valley and other sites \n     instead of shipping it to a permanent repository as called \n     for in a 1982 law.\n        Fortunately, New York Sens. Charles E. Schumer and Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton recognized this downgrading for what it was, a \n     threat to West Valley and surrounding areas from the \n     possibility of future leakage of this radioactive material. \n     After they protested the legislation, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a \n     Republican from south Carolina who introduced the bill that \n     would have allowed the DOE to downgrade the threat of nuclear \n     wastes, altered his bill. It now will apply only to the waste \n     remediation project at Savannah River, S.C.\n        But that doesn't remove the danger. The House, essentially \n     led by Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, still has to \n     consider the DOE legislation. That cannot be a comforting \n     thought to residents living near West Valley.\n        The department argues that the wastes should be classified \n     as ``high-level'' based only on how they originated, not what \n     they are. But what they are is still bad, still radioactive \n     and still a federal responsibility.\n        Decades of expensive cleanup progress have improved safety \n     at West Valley, but the work is far from over. The \n     radioactive liquid wastes from a nuclear fuels reprocessing \n     effort have been solidified into safe glass logs, which were \n     supposed to be stored elsewhere. But the anticipated long-\n     term storage facility at Yucca Flats is years from \n     completion.\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\n     Tanks and residual wastes still remain at West Valley, and an \n     underground plume of water is contaminated with radioactive \n     strontium. Covering wastes with concrete won't help that.\n        The 600,000 gallons of West Valley wastes have their \n     counterpart in nuclear weapons production wastes at other \n     sites--53 million gallons at Hanford on the Washington-Oregon \n     border, 34 million gallons at Savannah River near Aiken, \n     S.C., and 900,000 gallons at the Idaho National Engineering \n     and Environmental Laboratory.\n        West Valley is the only site where the state shares the \n     cost of cleanup.\n        Those costs may run into the tens of billions of dollars \n     over decades, but the mess remains a federal issue. At West \n     Valley, the risk includes not only the site's land but water \n     drainage that flows into Buttermilk Creek, Cattaraugus Creek \n     and Lake Erie. Trace amounts of that radioactivity have been \n     tracked as far as Buffalo.\n        The DOE also is threatening to withhold $350 million in \n     cleanup money from military-related cleanup efforts unless it \n     gets a change in the definition of what constitutes high-\n     level waste. That bit of weaseling does the department no \n     credit. These sites were created by the federal government, \n     and the federal government should not be allowed to walk away \n     from them.\n        Acceptable cleanup at West Valley involves removal of all \n     wastes and dismantling and removal of the contaminated \n     structures that were used to process and store them. The \n     government cannot be allowed to escape that responsibility \n     through administrative trickery.\n        If the federal government truly could end a problem by \n     renaming it, we'd already be at ``mission accomplished'' in \n     Iraq.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Idaho Falls Post Register, May 19, 2004]\n\n                        Choosing the Wrong Side\n\n       Why would Idaho's two U.S. senators support the Department \n     of Energy against their own state?\n       You'll have to ask them.\n       A big vote is coming up--possibly today or tomorrow--in the \n     Senate.\n       Idaho has a lot at stake.\n       The outcome is expected to be close.\n       Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne is on the right side.\n       Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo intend to be on the wrong \n     side.\n       At issue is nearly 1 million gallons of high-level \n     radioactive wastes stored in Idaho. The Hanford nuclear site \n     in Washington has 53 million gallons. Savannah River in South \n     Carolina had 37 million gallons.\n       Federal law says that waste may be collected and stored in \n     a national repository. DOE wants to reclassify it, leave some \n     material behind and save a few bucks.\n       But it can't get a judge to go along. Last year, U.S. \n     District Judge Lynn Winmill ruled DOE couldn't do that on its \n     own. DOE appealed.\n       If the courts are uncooperative, try blackmail. DOE is \n     withholding $350 million in cleanup funds--including about \n     $95 million for the Idaho National Engineering and \n     Environmental Laboratory.\n       And if blackmail fails, start cutting deals--in secret--\n     with Congress. DOE found an ally in freshman Sen. Lindsey \n     Graham, R-S.C. Behind closed doors in the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee last week, Graham won a provision in the \n     Defense authorization Bill that would allow DOE to reclassify \n     high-level wastes at Savannah River. Another provision allows \n     DOE to continue holding cleanup funds hostage in Washington \n     and Idaho until the accede to DOE's demands.\n       Fortunately, the House version contains none of this \n     mischief. So even if the Senate goes along, there's still \n     hope a conference committee will reject it.\n       Craig and Crapo say they're willing to defer to Graham on \n     something they believe affects only his state--as long as the \n     cleanup funds are kicked loose. They also believe Graham will \n     be appreciative down the road when Idaho needs his help.\n       The view from Boise is the more accurate one, however. \n     Kempthorne believes the Graham measure could wreck Idaho's \n     position in the courts by setting a precedent. In short \n     order, it would undermine the state's landmark 1995 \n     settlement with DOE, which requires the agency to clean up \n     the INEEL and ship wastes out of the state.\n       That's not to say Idaho isn't willing to negotiate. But no \n     governor can surrender unilaterally to DOE demands without \n     unraveling the 8-year-old truce that ended the statewide \n     battle over the INEEL, its future and the waste issue that \n     has raged for more than a decade.\n       Politically, two states are weaker than three. If South \n     Carolina cuts a private deal on waste, Washington and Idaho \n     are left to fight on their own.\n       And why would you reward DOE for its heavy-handedness \n     against the states by passing something in a committee with \n     the thinnest of claims to jurisdiction? If the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act needs revision, do so in the open. Hold hearings \n     and conduct them in the germane committees--Energy or \n     Environment and Public Works.\n       What's going on there isn't science. It's bare-knuckle \n     politics.\n       So as early as today, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., will \n     offer a motion to strip Graham's language from the defense \n     bill. She has the support of Graham's colleague, Sen. Ernest \n     Hollings, D-S.C. But it's going to be close, and the Idaho \n     delegation could make the difference.\n       Does Graham may have more to offer Craig and Crapo than \n     Idaho voters?\n       Maybe. Craig is in the second year of a six-year term. \n     Crapo just got re-elected to a second term. Although the \n     election isn't until November, Idaho Democrats have forfeited \n     the race.\n       Just the same, both Idaho senators ought to reconsider.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 18, 2004]\n\n                 Senate Should Halt Nuclear Waste Plan\n\n       Senators should halt the Bush administration's Department \n     of Energy's attempts to boss everyone around on nuclear waste \n     policy and end run the federal courts.

A federal judge \n     already has overruled the department's attempts to reclassify \n     the waste in order to save money and leave it at the sites.\n       Legitimately, Energy has filed an appeal. But is has shown \n     horrid judgment with attempts to dictate changes in federal \n     law to evade its responsibility, blackmail states into \n     accepting the waste and free itself of state controls.\n       Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has put language into a \n     defense authorization bill to give the department much of \n     what it wants. The bill would authorize reclassification of \n     the waste in his state and let DOE withhold $350 million in \n     cleanup money for Hanford and other sites until their states \n     cave in to reclassification schemes.\n       Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., is leading a fight against \n     the plan. Tank waste at Hanford threatens to pollute the \n     Columbia River. Environmental groups rightly complain about \n     rewriting the waste law in a defense bill without public \n     hearings.\n       The Senate should strip Graham's amendment from the bill. \n     The Energy Department needs to clean up nuclear waste fully, \n     not evade public accountability.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Idaho Statesman, May 11, 2004]\n\n               State Cleanup Faces All-or-All Proposition\n\n       Idaho's political leaders need to hold the Department of \n     Energy to a simple standard.\n       We expect the feds to clean up and move out all the highly \n     radioactive liquid waste now stored in Idaho. No haggling and \n     no shortcuts. Our political leaders need to hold firm even \n     when politicians in other states are willing to cut deals.\n       About 900,000 gallons of high-level radioactive waste sit \n     in underground tanks in the Eastern Idaho desert, above an \n     aquifer that provides water for many Idaho farms and \n     communities.\n       After decades of nuclear defense work in states like Idaho, \n     it's time for the Energy Department to fully clean up the \n     sites that helped produce the implements of the Cold War.\n       Unfortunately, the Energy Department has been more \n     interested in cutting corners than in cleaning up. The agency \n     wants to clean up most of the waste but leave a fraction of \n     it in the tanks, sealed with grout.\n       The Energy Department has been trying to foist off less-\n     than-clean cleanup as adequate and cost-effective. B. Lynn \n     Winmill, an Idaho federal judge, ruled last year that the DOE \n     plan violated federal law. Since then, the Energy Department \n     has pushed the idea in Congress, and it may have a taker. \n     With the help of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Energy \n     Department now has language in a defense bill limiting its \n     cleanup obligations in South Carolina, where 34 million \n     gallons of waste are stored at its Savannah River Plant.\n       The language covers only South Carolina, not Idaho. Still, \n     it could set an alarming precedent, and could put pressure on \n     Idaho's political leaders to cave to the federal government.\n       In Idaho, cleanup should be non-negotiable. Idaho has the \n     law and Winmill on its side and has in hand a binding \n     agreement with the feds mandating the tank cleanup. Then-Gov. \n     Phil Batt reached a comprehensive waste cleanup deal in 1995, \n     and Idaho voters ratified it a year later.\n       The deal gives Idaho leverage--but only if state officials \n     and the Idaho delegation hold the feds to every word of it. \n     Especially the word ``all.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Tacoma News Tribune, May 10, 2004]\n\n            Fix Energy Department, Not the Law It's Breaking\n\n        It was bad enough that the U.S. Department of Energy was \n     trying to carry out an illegal quick-and-dirty ``disposal'' \n     of some of the nation's most dangerous radioactive waste. Now \n     a U.S. Senate committee is helping the department circumvent \n     the law.\n        The law in question is the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which \n     Congress passed in 1982. Among other things, this act \n     requires the federal government to safely dispose of high-\n     level nuclear waste in a deep underground repository. The law \n     quite explicitly specifies that the radioactive byproducts of \n     plutonium creation--a category of waste all-too-abundant at \n     the Hanford Nuclear Reservation--must be buried in such a \n     repository.\n        Despite what the law says, the Energy Department has other \n     plans. Hanford's high-\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\n     level wastes are presently being stored on site in steel-\n     walled tanks, many of which have leaked dangerous \n     radioisotopes into the surrounding soils. The department does \n     intent to encase most of the wastes in these tanks in glass \n     cylinders, which will be buried. But it also wants to leave \n     significant quantities on site. Naturally, the idea is to \n     save money.\n        The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, however, doesn't say, ``Bury \n     what's convenient, and don't spend too much trying to get the \n     rest.'' It says, ``Bury it, bury it all, and bury it deep.'' \n     A federal judge in Boise last year called the Energy \n     Department on its scheme, ruling that the leave-it-in-place \n     plan would violate the law.\n        Laws, however, can be altered. That is what Sen. Linsey \n     Graham (R-S.C.) is now trying to do, so far with success. At \n     this behest, the Senate Armed Services Committee last week \n     amended a defense bill with a measure that partially exempts \n     the Energy Department from the requirement that all high-\n     level waste be sent to a repository.\n        The amendment applies only to South Carolina wastes, but \n     it's a scary precedent for this state. The Energy Department \n     has already made clear its desire for an incomplete cleanup \n     at Hanford, the nuclear contamination capital of America.\n        If Congress attempts to relax the disposal standards in \n     Washington as well, the state had better be given \n     consultation rights and veto power over whatever plan the \n     Energy Department comes up with. The department simply cannot \n     be trusted to act in the interest of Washington and its \n     environment.\n        As for Graham, his constituents in South Carolina ought to \n     be giving him an earful about the prospect of living in \n     perpetuity with the world's most lethal garbage.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Spokesman-Review.com, May 9, 2004]\n\n                     Debate Needed on Nuclear Waste\n\n        For the sake of argument, let's say leaving some lethal \n     waste buried at nuclear weapons sites is a good idea, because \n     the cost benefits outweigh the risks.\n        The next step would be to persuade affected parties and \n     the public there is a scientific consensus on the matter. \n     Without that, there would be no hope of a political \n     consensus. The U.S. Department of Energy believes that \n     leaving some waste behind is a good idea, but it is trying to \n     slip this seismic policy shift into a defense authorization \n     bill, without public comment or congressional debate.\n        Last year, DOE tried to get House-Senate conferees on an \n     already passed energy bill to accept this change. But that \n     bill has bogged down. Now it has found an opening in a bill \n     that otherwise has nothing to do with energy matters. U.S. \n     Sen.

This is just the \n     latest DOE maneuver to shut states out of the decision-making \n     process, which is in direct conflict with the 1989 Tri-Party \n     Agreement.\n        DOE has been trying to reclassify some ``high-level'' \n     waste as ``low level'' for two years, but the states, \n     Congress and the courts have said no. A federal judge's \n     ruling sent DOE back to Congress to get the law changed. Such \n     a change would have enormous implications for sites such as \n     the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the Idaho National \n     Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, both of which are \n     near major rivers. DOE previously announced a plan that would \n     redefine as ``low level'' 53 million gallons of waste at \n     Hanford and 900,000 gallons at INEEL.\n        Idaho and Washington are against reclassifying the waste. \n     Said Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington: ``Trying to rename \n     high-level nuclear waste doesn't change the fact that it is \n     still dangerous, toxic, radioactive sludge that needs to be \n     cleaned up.''\n        Critics say another danger in allowing such waste to be \n     reclassified and permanently buried where it sits is that it \n     paves the way for the importation of any other waste DOE \n     deems to be ``low level.'' Hanford could be a dumping ground \n     for another state's waste. The National Academy of Sciences \n     has concluded that the best approach is to bury nuclear waste \n     deep underground. Since that conclusion, Yucca Mountain in \n     Nevada has been chosen as the national repository.\n        Without a scientific or political consensus, it is \n     unconscionable for DOE to seek such a major change on such an \n     important matter, especially in the absence of an open \n     debate. The agency needs to stop the repeated end-runs and \n     make a good-faith effort to involve all affected parties if \n     it sees the need for change.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, let's go back for a second to what this \nissue is as it relates to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and what the \nunderlying change in this bill does. That is the question at hand.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle hope we can get rid of \nthis issue in one afternoon--again, without public debate, without the \nscrutiny of changing the definition of highly radioactive waste. They \nthink we should just pass what is in the underlying bill. It has only \nseen the daylight because of the objections of myself and other \ncolleagues and the scrutiny of the press. That is what has gotten them \nnow to offer the amendment on the floor. The amendment on the floor is \nnot sufficient to strike the language relating to the reclassification \nof waste.\n  So what is the issue? In 1982, when we passed the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act--I wasn't here but other Members were--basically we came up \nwith a definition. We said:\n\n       Highly radioactive material resulting from the processing \n     of spent nuclear fuel, including the liquid waste produced in \n     the reprocessing. . . .\n\n  That is what this reactor did for us in World War II. It basically \nprocessed spent nuclear fuel and that liquid waste was then stored in \ntanks still at Hanford.\n\n       That the solid material derived from such waste that \n     contains fission products in sufficient concentrations. . . .\n\n  So that is what we said high-level radioactive waste was. We went on \nto add to the definition:\n\n       Highly radioactive material that the Commission says is \n     consistent with the law requires permanent isolation.\n\n  That is what we said in 1982, that the spent fuel from these reactors \nrequired permanent isolation. That is what the current law says. The \ncurrent law says spent fuel requires permanent isolation. That means \nyou have to remove it from the tanks that are there, because the tanks \nare leaking and you cannot guarantee permanent isolation.\n  So the tanks have started to be cleaned up and the process for \ncleaning them up is underway. But now the Department of Energy wants to \nsay, ``let's have a new definition of that.'' In fact, in the \nunderlying DOD bill, in section 3116, it basically says:\n\n       High-level radioactive waste does not include radioactive \n     material resulting from the processing of spent nuclear fuel.\n\n  How about that? One change in the DOD bill and billions of gallons of \nwaste in my State is no longer high-level radioactive nuclear waste. \nJust like that, changing the definition. Yes, it says the Secretary can \ndetermine whether various hurdles have been scaled, but that is \ncontradictory to the current law in the 1982 act.\n  I remind my colleagues this is an act that was passed through this \nbody after hearings, after discussion. I think the process may have \ntaken more than a year. It took more than a year to define high-level \nradioactive waste. Yet now we want to pass the DOD authorizing bill \nwith this change in it and basically say, ``let's go ahead and \nreclassify nuclear waste.''\n  I am not for reclassifying nuclear waste without a debate and a \ndiscussion and, frankly, the notion that this underlying bill would \nreclassify it in such an inappropriate fashion, to say you could \nsomehow call this grouting and that this would be a sufficient way to \ndeal with the country's nuclear waste, is incredible. It is incredible \nthat this is the scam being used on the American public just to get \nthis process in place.\n\n  Let's go through some of the history, because as I said, I think this \nis really sour grapes by the Department of Energy, which has tried to \nget this policy pushed through and has not been successful. In fact, in \n2001, basically, the Department said that they would re-create a better \ncleanup process. But, they said, we obviously have to get States to \nagree.\n  They came to us in Washington State and we said: We have an agreement \nwith you about the level of waste that is going to be cleaned up under \nthe requirements of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, so we don't really \nknow what you mean by reclassification. At that time they refused to \nsay that they meant they would clean up 99 percent, or all that was \ntechnically possible, of this waste.\n  So we in Washington State said: Listen, it doesn't sound like you \nhave a serious plan for reclassifying waste when you just want to call \nit a different name. That is not an appropriate process. In fact, \nWashington State decided not to do that.\n  Wisely enough, the Idaho court basically said DOE didn't have that \nability, they didn't have the ability to reclassify that waste. That is \nexactly why they are trying to sneak this language in today, because \nthey would like to\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\ncontinue to say that they can move ahead on a plan that, sure, would \nsave money, but who wants to save money by leaving nuclear waste in the \nground, where it is leaking into the Columbia River or the Savannah \nRiver, or other areas of the country?\n  If somebody thinks this is an issue that affects the State of \nWashington, or affects just Idaho, or affects South Carolina--it \ndoesn't. These are bodies of water, with the potential of nuclear waste \nin them, that flow through many parts of our country. To pass \nlegislation without debate on changing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is \nan incredible statement, that people are willing to override 30 years \nof law just to do that.\n  There are other issues I think we need to talk about. I am very \npleased the Governor of Idaho, Governor Kempthorne, issued a release \nsaying:\n\n       Federal legislation undermines the cleanup that was to take \n     place in Idaho, at the Idaho facility.\n\n  In fact, Governor Kempthorne has said his opposition to the \nlegislation that was passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee is \nbecause it allows the Secretary of Energy to withhold an estimated $95 \nmillion from cleanup funds, which is part of the debate we are going to \nhave on the underlying amendment. But then he goes on to say:\n\n       I recognize the need to ensure public confidence in how we \n     manage nuclear waste. This legislation would be a huge step \n     backwards, reinforcing public fears about our Nation walking \n     away from nuclear cleanup obligations. I am also concerned \n     this legislation will negatively impact DOE's compliance with \n     the 1995 court settlement case in Idaho.\n\n  I think Governor Kempthorne, who has to deal with this, just as \nGovernor Locke does in the State of Washington, has realized what a bad \ndeal this is for Idaho. He realizes the underlying language, when it \ntries to reclassify waste, is a danger.\n  I find it interesting that we will forget the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, no problem. We will write our own rule about what hazardous waste \nis. We will come up with our own definition.\n  The states of Washington, Idaho, Oregon, South Carolina, New Mexico, \nand New York filed into the court case and in their amicus brief said:\n\n       DOE cannot ignore Congress' intent . . . by simply calling \n     [high level] waste by a different name.\n\n  South Carolina joined that case. South Carolina went to the courts, \nput its name on a brief, objecting to the DOE attempt to reclassify \nhigh-level nuclear waste by issuing an order.\n  Why all of a sudden are we now going to listen to one State tell us \nthey have the right to decide they are going to keep nuclear waste in \ntheir State and they are going to call it something else? Nuclear waste \nthat reaches the Savannah River does not affect just South Carolina, \nand a definition in statute that conflicts with the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act does not just affect South Carolina; it affects everyone. \nThat is not the way to legislate, by sneaking it in without having full \npublic debate about this issue and the obligations we have for nuclear \nwaste cleanup.\n  What has the Atomic Energy Commission said? Basically, it said in \n1970 that over the life of these tanks, basically you have a problem. \nBasically, what you are saying when you assume that you will take those \nHanford tanks or Savannah River tanks or Idaho tanks or West Valley \ntanks, and you are going to leave material in them and somehow put \ncement over the top of them and everything will be okay--that is \ncounter to all the science we have had for 50 years.\n  The Atomic Energy Commission said ``over periods of centuries,''--\nguess what, that is what happens when you leave it in the tanks for a \nlong period of time; you are talking about centuries--``one cannot \nassure the continuity of surveillance and care which tank storage \nrequires.''\n  (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. CANTWELL. They are saying if you put in high-level waste, we \ncannot tell what will happen to that over a long period of time. That \nis why the decision was made to take it out and put it in a permanent \nstorage facility somewhere else, because these tanks do not have the \ncapacity.\n  The science says that once you do the grouting of this waste, \nunfortunately, your opportunity to do other things is much more \ndifficult. Once you have poured cement on the ground and solidified it, \nthe process of getting it out and retrieving it is made immensely more \ndifficult. In fact, the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research \nin 2004 said:\n\n       Grouting residual high-level waste in tanks that contain \n     significant quantities of long lived radionuclides . . . Is a \n     policy that poses considerable risk to the long-term health \n     of the water resources in the region.\n\n  This statement is from 2004. In 2004, people have said this grouting \ntechnique, which basically is storing this in the leaking position in \nunderground tanks, is a threat to the water resources of the region. \nThese tanks are not more than 7 miles from the Columbia River, not 7 \nmiles from one of the major water resources of the Pacific Northwest. \nIt already has a plume of nuclear waste that has reached the river. \nFortunately, it is at a level that we can contain today but only if we \ncontinue to clean up the tanks.\n\n  This proposal to pour cement and sand on top of it and just keep the \nwaste in the ground has not been proven as a secure way to keep the \nwaste intact and water resources clean. So what you are leaving us with \nin the Pacific Northwest--in Washington, in Oregon, in the tributaries \nfeeding in and out of the Columbia River and into the Pacific Ocean--is \nthe threat of 50 million gallons of nuclear waste not being cleaned up \nin a sufficient fashion and that waste ending up in the Columbia River. \nOr in the South Carolina, Savannah River. Governor Kempthorne said it \nright: this is a huge step backward because it reinforces the public \nfears about this process.\n  This Senator wants to have the nuclear waste cleaned up in our State. \nSome people may not understand the process, or some people listening to \nthis debate may even think this is somehow about four or five States in \nthis country. It is not about four or five States in this country and \njust about whether we will change the definition of high-level \nradioactive waste and what we will do about the definition.\n  That is what I am concerned about today in the underlying bill. This \nNation has a responsibility--as it had a responsibility in development \nof the reactors, the development of the plutonium, and the development \nof that product--this Nation has a responsibility for the cleanup of \nthose facilities. Oftentimes my colleagues forget about that \nresponsibility until it comes time to do the budget and people see the \nhuge amount of money that is spent on nuclear waste cleanup.\n  I would be the first Senator to say we have made mistakes in this \nprocess. It is mind-boggling to think prior to my coming here that at \none point in time somebody gave contracts to a company to produce \nvitrified logs, and they were not going to pay them until they made the \nvitrification work. Somewhere along the way people figured that would \nnot work, that the vitrification process was not underway and \noperating. But now we have been successful and vitrification is \nstarting to take place. That means we are taking the nuclear waste out \nof the ground and solidifying it into a glass log substance and that \nglass log substance will then go to permanent storage. So it will be in \na facility that can help store that product for an indefinite period of \ntime. That has been the plan. That is the plan on the books. That is \nthe plan of record.\n  But that is not what the DOE authorizing bill does. It says, ``no, \nlet's reclassify that waste and say that it is not high level. Let's \njust call it another name, let's call it grout and say it is okay to \nkeep in the ground, let it contaminate water, and let's keep the \nsavings from that unbelievable shortcutting of our responsibilities in \nthe cleanup process.'' I don't think that is something we want to do as \na body and government.\n  I would like to talk about how this legal process worked and why DOE \nis attempting to do this. What my colleagues seem to want to think \ntoday is that this is all about giving the State of South Carolina the \nability to negotiate with DOE what nuclear waste cleanup should be. In \nfact, as I said, in the underlying bill, instead of saying that high-\nlevel waste is something that needs to be retrieved, basically that \nspent fuel from reactors is something\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\nthat needs to be retrieved from tanks and put in permanent storage, \nbasically the DOE underlying bill says, no, high-level radioactive \nwaste resulting from fuel process can be reconsidered and considered \nfor a different kind of storage permanently in the tank. And that is \nsomething South Carolina and DOE can do together.\n  That is not what the cleanup partnership really is. The cleanup \npartnership is not about the State of South Carolina and the Federal \nDepartment of Energy interpreting the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in a new \nway by passing contradictory language.\n  Let's imagine for a second that we let the State of Michigan \ndetermine what the clean air standards are for the State of Michigan. \nLet's say that EPA and the State of Michigan decided, well, the clean \nair standards for Michigan are going to be at X level, and that somehow \nthat is OK for Michigan, but somehow we do not think that is going to \napply to the rest of the country.\n  Does anyone think that once it applies to Michigan, some other State \nis not going to say: How come you gave Michigan an exemption? They \ncontinue to pollute the air at a level that the rest of the country \ndoes not, which has a higher standard. We are talking about a recipe \nfor disaster in the courts and for predictability in the process. I \nthink it is very detrimental, where we are going with this legislation.\n  The court process that took place is now on appeal to the Ninth \nCircuit Court. We are still waiting for a decision. I think the \nappropriate thing for the Department of Energy to do, while they are \nwaiting for their decision on appeal, is to say they want to come to \nCongress and have hearings on changing radioactive waste definitions, \nthat they want to come and have a discussion about that.\n  I appreciate the fact the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, as this \nissue was discussed in the Armed Services Committee, understood the \ndangerous precedence of this language, and understood how important it \nwas to get the DOD bill done. He basically asked that they not include \nthat language in the bill.\n  Now, it was a closed-door session. I do not know what the real vote \nwas. I am sure it was a closely, hotly debated issue. But, really, what \nthey put in was section 3116, which would overturn 30 years of \ncarefully crafted laws and 50 years of scientific consensus related to \nthe cleanup of the Nation's radioactive defense waste.\n  As written, this provision--because it allows DOE to reclassify waste \nthat, as I said, for decades has been classified as high-level waste--\nbasically says the radioactive and chemical toxic components would stay \nthe same. So basically the same toxic level of waste is there, but we \nare just going to call it another name. I appreciate the fact that the \nSenator from Michigan tried to change this language and prevent it from \nbeing in the bill. Unfortunately, it is in the underlying bill before \nus.\n  The underlying bill before us also created a slush fund of $350 \nmillion. I find it intriguing. I love knowing a little bit about \nsoftware because when you share documents and you basically try to make \nchanges to documents, and you e-mail those around to everybody, you can \nlook at the text and see where the changes came from. It is very \ninteresting, this legislation was proposed by a member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. But when you check on who was really the \nauthor of the legislation, when you look at who was making the changes \nto the legislation, it was the Department of Energy.\n  The Department of Energy wrote the statute and basically submitted it \nto the committee, and tried to make it look like it was a Member's \nidea. This is coming straight from the Department of Energy, that lost \na court battle, and does not want to wait for an appeal, does not want \nto come here and fight their battle in the daylight, but wants to try \nto sneak language in a bill, in the hopes these people will blink on a \nThursday afternoon. Well, I am not prepared to have this bill move \nforward without having this discussion today about this change.\n\n  Now, what was DOE's great idea that they submitted through a member \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee? What was their wonderful idea? \nWell, besides reclassifying waste, they decided, ``well, let's create a \n$350 million slush fund that gives the Secretary of Energy the \nauthority to withdraw cleanup funds from the States of South Carolina, \nWashington, and Idaho--until they agree with our reclassification \nplan.'' Basically, it was to hold them hostage and blackmail them into \nagreeing.\n  As I said, when the State of Washington was offered this deal 2 years \nago, we said: ``We are not taking any deal unless we understand what \nyou are cleaning up and how you are cleaning it up. The fact that you \nthink you are going to reclassify and rename this is not good enough \nfor us. Let's see the details.'' When they refused to show us that they \nplanned on cutting cleaning up all this waste, we refused to accept the \ndeal. Now they are hoping they will buy off some other State.\n  If the Department of Energy really believes science is on their side, \nif it really believes this grouting technique works, if it really \nbelieves this is the process we ought to pursue, then come before the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, come before the EPW Committee, \nand debate a change to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the policy that \ndefines highly radioactive waste and how it should be cleaned up.\n  I think it is a tragedy, especially when you think about the good job \nthe people did at Hanford, the process by which these people speedily \ngot to the business of helping us in World War II, in the cold war \nyears, and providing us with help and support. They got the job done. \nThey did their job. Now it is our turn to do our job and clean this up.\n  When you are talking about 100 million gallons of highly radioactive \nwaste that is stored in 253 deteriorating tanks in all of these \nStates--as I said, at Hanford we have 53 million gallons of this tank \nwaste, about 60 percent of the whole national inventory. So 60 percent \nis in Washington State, along with other high level waste stored in the \nHanford 200-Area. That includes spent fuel and miscellaneous volumes \nthat contain high-level waste from offsite which are also buried in the \nground.\n  I am all for considering new technology and new ways to clean up \nwaste and to retrieve waste that is buried in the ground that is \nconsidered high-level waste, which may have come from other States or \nhave been basically brought to the Hanford Reservation. Some has been \ndumped on the Hanford Reservation and then has been part of the storage \nthere for some time, but that is a different issue.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act makes it very clear that spent nuclear \nfuel from reactors needs to be placed in a permanent isolated area. \nThat does not mean pouring cement in tanks and calling it incidental. \nIt is very clear about that. So we can talk about other technologies to \nclean up other kinds of waste, or we can come back and debate changing \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act. But because 67 of the 177 tanks that we \nhave in Washington State have already leaked 1 million gallons of waste \ninto the ground, that is 1 million gallons of nuclear waste, this \nSenator does not take this issue lightly.\n  DOE estimates that at Hanford, 270 billion gallons of ground water is \ncontaminated above the drinking water standards across 80 miles of this \nsite, and that plumes containing numerous toxins have reached the \nColumbia River.\n  I think we have another picture of the Hanford site. I encourage all \nmy colleagues, at some point in time, to go to the Hanford site. This \nsite is in Washington State, but this is a Federal responsibility. It \nis a Federal responsibility to clean up nuclear waste. It is not just \nthe province or jurisdiction of four or five States in the country. We \nspend budget money on this issue, and we need to get the job done.\n  You can see one scene of the Hanford reservation, which is almost as \nbig as--a third of the size--the State of Rhode Island. It is an \nimmense property. I know the senior Senator from Washington State has \njoined me, and she can tell you--because she was instrumental in \ngetting the Hanford Reach Monument created, preserving some of this as \na national monument for us. On the one hand we are preserving it as a \nnational monument and then deciding one day we are going to take high-\nlevel radioactive waste, rename it, let the plume that is already \nreaching the Columbia River to stay in the ground, and that somehow by \nputting cement\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\nand sand on it, we are all going to be OK.\n  Everybody wants to say how much cheaper that proposal is. I think \neverybody in America gets how cheap it would be to pour concrete and \nsand. What they want to know is whether it is safe, whether it is the \nright technology, whether it is going to stop the plumes or leaking \ntanks, whether you are going to change the current law first to get \nthere.\n  This is a beautiful, pristine area of our country that we can \npreserve, but only if we do the job we are responsible to do, as the \npeople who created the B reactor and created this facility were \nresponsible in doing.\n  To be irresponsible today by offering this on the DOD authorizing \nbill and thinking we are going to have a debate about it in a few short \nhours and change 30 years of law and 50 years of science is shameful. \nIt is shameful that we think we can have this kind of discussion in a \nfew hours and wrap up a decision. If people are so sure about their \nposition, then hold the public hearings and have the debate. Because \nthese tanks are leaking and one million gallons have already leaked in \nmy State. It is not something that is a tomorrow issue.\n  What about the science? Let's go back, so my colleagues are clear \nabout how we got here. Congress required DOE to clean up these sites \nand make it a priority, and they did that in that 1982 act. That act \nreflected science dating back to 1950, when the National Academy of \nSciences recognized that high-level radioactive waste, such as the \nwaste at Hanford, must remain isolated from human beings and the \nenvironment long enough for the radioactivity to decay. That is a long \nprocess.\n  That is why the Atomic Energy Commission, a precursor to the \nDepartment of Energy, also recognized something must be done to treat \nhigh-level radioactive waste in the tanks and at these DOE sites, and \nthey referred to ``over a period of centuries.'' As I said earlier, \nthis isn't a problem where you think about it for a few years or even a \ndecade. You have to come up with a solution for centuries.\n  Over a period of centuries, the Atomic Energy Commission wrote in \n1970, ``one cannot assure the continuity of surveillance of care with \nstorage tanks.'' Basically they said, you can't get it done with \nstorage tanks. So the science has not changed since then.\n  Yet there are provisions in this bill where DOE says, let's throw out \nthe science. And the provision in this bill would allow DOE to take 50 \nyears of science and leave an indeterminate amount of toxic sludge in \nthese leaky tanks and simply say: Mission accomplished. I think we have \nheard that statement before.\n  What science says is that grouting residual high-level waste in tanks \nthat contain significant quantities of long-lived radionuclides is a \npolicy that possesses considerable risk to the long-term health of the \nwater resources of the region. That is what science says.\n\n  The grouting proposal that is in this bill is a considerable risk. In \nthe State of Washington, we are very familiar with this. In Washington \nState, thank God our Department of Ecology has had strong reservations \nabout grouting and we have vocalized those. For us, because it is 50 \nmillion gallons of this highly radioactive waste, it would have to have \nbeen a plan for durability for 10,000 years. That is what you would \nhave to have. That is how radioactive the waste is.\n  What is bothersome is when people say an indeterminate amount, that \nis what DOE can decide. An indeterminate amount? The last 8 percent of \nthe waste in the tanks has 50 percent of the radioactivity. Think about \nthat. So we are saying in this underlying bill, go ahead, DOE. Leave an \nindeterminate amount in the tanks. Maybe they will say let's leave 10 \npercent. Maybe they will say, let's leave 5 percent. We know at 8 \npercent it is 50 percent of the radioactivity.\n  We think the grouting plan is something that is not the way to go. We \nset it aside in Washington State. We said that basically glassifying or \nvitrifying the waste was the way to go. That means that process of \nturning it into a glass structure so it is a solid structure and taking \nit to permanent storage was a better way to go.\n  As I said, in 2002, DOE wanted to use this accelerated initiative. We \nin Washington State had people come and talk to us about what \naccelerated cleanup was and what the schedule would be on high-level \nwaste. And we said: We want to understand how you are going to comply \nwith the agreements that are already on the table and with the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, with the triparty agreement, because this isn't the \nfirst time the Department of Energy has had debates with the State \nabout their responsibilities for cleanup.\n  I can't imagine that there is an OMB director or a DOE executive who \ndoes not come to that post and look at the numbers involved in cleanup \nand basically says: Boy, there has to be a way we can get this done \nquicker and cheaper. I am all about getting it done quicker, given that \nI have a million gallons already leaking and running into the Columbia \nRiver. I am all about quicker. But I am not about a plan that has not \nbeen verified by science, that has not had a hearing in a full \ncommittee as to this process and what it will mean.\n  Everybody gets the quick factor, but who said cleaning up nuclear \nwaste in America should be about doing it on the cheap? It is about \ndoing it the right way. As the Atomic Energy Commission said, it is \nabout keeping it out of the reach of humans for centuries.\n  Subsequently DOE has insisted upon researching new technologies for \nthe treatment of Hanford tanks, this new form of grout, cast stone, \nsteam reforming, and different forms of vitrification. In all, I think \nthere were three cases. DOE said they would still retrieve waste from \nthe tanks, but try to treat it and bury it in steel containers and \nlined trenches in the Hanford site.\n  I can tell you, even the new and improved grout was quickly rejected \nby the State of Washington and by other scientists.\n  According to the officials at the Washington State Department of \nEcology, grouting would have violated the State requirement that any \nalternative waste that was not performed at the vitrification objected \nto. And, in addition, the State found that this grouting would still \npose ground water risks and create leaching; furthermore, that this \nwould violate drinking water standards.\n  Even more interesting is the fact that the grouting was not to be \nfound more efficient. In some instances, grouting wasn't found to be \nany cheaper than other options of cleaning up the tanks. While \neverybody says that pouring cement and sand on this is a great way to \nclean up nuclear waste, most people figured out that leaking would \nstill happen and that nuclear waste would still need to be removed. \nThey figured out that it was even more expensive to remove than waste.\n  So those are the scenarios with which we are dealing. Those are the \nscenarios that have been discussed. This debate--whether we want to \nreclassify nuclear waste and call it low-level waste and say we are \ngoing to grout it--might be new to some of my colleagues in the Senate \nas to. But for the State of Washington, we already said this plan \nwasn't acceptable science, and that reclassification was something we \ndidn't think we should go along with, when DOE wasn't willing to give \nus a definition on how they were going to clean up the waste.\n  So this is very difficult because the tanks holding sludge and salt \ncake and hard heels--this would mean the waste in those tanks would not \nbe penetrated to remove and segregate the radionuclides. The hazardous \nmaterial would not be separated out and removed. It means those tanks \nwould not be thoroughly mixed without the right level of product. \nBasically, what they found is that grout, as engineered, is not an \noption that protects human health and the environment for such a \nsignificant portion of tank waste, when we don't know the definition, \nbecause it is an indeterminate amount of tank waste.\n  As I said, even the last 8 percent of tank waste includes 50 percent \nof the radioactivity. How do you know, by using this grouting process, \nthat you have successfully rendered this a nonhazardous substance? So \ngrout as an in-tank treatment for significant waste volume will be, as \nI said, probably more expensive than other routes when we find out that \nit is not successful.\n  The best science says is don't hold States hostage by reclassifying \nwaste\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\nand telling them we are not going to give them money for cleanup unless \nthey agree to our definition. This definition is something that the \nDepartment of Energy thinks they can come up with on their own. But the \ncourts have determined that DOE doesn't have that authority.\n  The courts have not sided in DOE's favor. The courts have not said \ndon't go ahead with cleanup. They didn't say you cannot move forward on \ncleaning up the tanks. The courts said: DOE cannot move forward on its \nplan of reclassifying waste and saying that it is a grout process and \nthat is going to work. It says you cannot move forward on that.\n  So back to the underlying bill and what happened in the Defense \nauthorization bill. There was an amendment that would enable the \nDepartment of Energy to exempt an intermediate amount of highly \nradioactive waste from regulation as high-level radioactive waste.\n  I am reading from legal counsel's interpretation of this underlying \nprovision in the DOD bill. This interpretation says the amendment would \nallow the Department of Energy to continue to store waste long thought \ndestined for deep geologic repository in existing storage tanks or send \nthem to waste isolation pile-up plants or low-level radioactive waste \nburial sites. It also would exempt the Department's handling of those \nwastes from the license and regulation by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. It will, in short, overturn the fundamental \nlegal principles that have governed the disposal of these wastes for \nthe past 30 years.\n\n  This legal briefing goes on to point out--which I think is very \nimportant--that for nearly half a century, when the DOE and its \npredecessors made plutonium for their nuclear weapons, they did so by \nirradiating uranium fuel, transforming it into plutonium, and \nreprocessing the spent fuel, as I showed in the picture with the \nreactor. And that became high-level radioactive waste. This is the term \ngiven to the plutonium spent fuel from the reactors was high-level \nwaste.\n  So what did the Nuclear Waste Policy Act say? In 1981, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act said: Let's establish a comprehensive program for the \ndisposal of this spent nuclear fuel, and put it in deep geologic \nrepositories licensed by the Commission.\n  So let me be clear about this point, because I am sure we will hear \nabout this in the debate. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was given \nthe responsibility of the deep geological repository license procedure. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission was not given the responsibility for \nthese low-level tanks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was not given \nthe responsibility to interpret this change in the DOD bill as it \nrelates to whether this is a cleanup plan and whether they can license \nit because that is not their responsibility. Their responsibility, as \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is on Yucca Mountain and the deep \ngeological solution. That is what their responsibility is.\n  The act directed the President to decide whether high-level \nradioactive defense waste should be disposed of in the same repository \nas civilian waste, or in a separate repository. So in 1985, President \nReagan decided this defense waste should be put in the same repository \nas civilian waste.\n  The 1982 act defines high-level radioactive waste. We had a decision \nby the President in 1985 that military waste should be treated as \ncivilian waste, and that the civilian waste should be put in the same \nspot.\n  So that is the plan we have been on. Now, I have had some concerns \nabout how much waste you are actually going to take out of Hanford \nbecause, I tell you what, I want more than 17 percent of the waste \ntaken from Hanford to go to Yucca Mountain. I want it cleaned up and I \nwant it in a permanent place.\n  I don't want grouting and I don't want to have plumes continuing to \nleak. But that was the decision made in 1985, and the President made \nthat decision. They said, let's vitrify this waste, glassify it, take \nit out of the tanks, turn it into glass logs, and take that to a site \nfor permanent storage, wherever that site is.\n  The plan, since 1985, has not been to pour cement and sand and create \ngrout leaving some percentage, some indeterminate amount of waste in \ntanks.\n  I cannot emphasize how important it is if DOE believes in this \nphilosophy, this science, if DOE thinks this is the successful course \nof discussion that should happen with spent nuclear fuel, then come to \nthe broad daylight of a Senate hearing and make their case and put that \nbefore the appropriate Senate committees. If they are so proud of their \nscience and the standing of their decision, they should have no problem \ndoing that. As Governor Kempthorne of Idaho said, when you don't end up \nachieving public consensus, you don't do anybody any favors.\n\n  The issue is the Department of Energy knows all too well, because \nthese States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and South Carolina \nchallenged the Department of Energy in court, that these States do not \nbelieve this order or plan for reclassifying waste is sound science. \nThey do not believe it is sound science. That is why they challenged it \nin court.\n  I know the Department of Energy knows they cannot waltz into the \nSenate hearing rooms and make their case without hearing the critiques \nof the experts who have been dealing with this issue for years and \nyears. And by ``the experts,'' I mean not only the scientists, but the \npeople who have to live with the economic and health consequences of \nhaving a million gallons of nuclear waste leak into the ground and make \nits way to the Columbia River. Those people are paying attention, and \nthey are paying attention to the fact that this science is not standing \nthe test of daylight and scrutiny. If it were, they would be here \ndebating it.\n  I am saying to them now, this Senator, and I am sure members of other \ncommittees, welcomes the opportunity to understand this technology, to \nunderstand this new process, to understand exactly how taking some \nlevel of spent fuel from these reactors in these underground tanks and \nsomehow pouring a grouting material on them is going to make for a \nsuccessful cleanup effort.\n  I am sure my colleagues would love to hear if it actually saves \nbillions of dollars and can be safe and sound science. But if that is \nthe case, then we should not be in a rush today. After the courts have \nalready said DOE does not have the authority to change this policy \nwithout the approval of Congress, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, my \ncolleagues should not be in a hurry to pass this legislation that \nbasically says in a contradictory form: Go ahead, DOE Secretary, \nreclassify the waste because nuclear waste from spent fuel does not \nhave to be classified as highly radioactive.\n  The definition of highly radioactive waste that is used in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act was initially modeled after the definition \nfound in the West Valley demonstration project. That is a commercial \nsite in New York. I am again reading from the legal opinion Energy \ncounsel has provided to us.\n  It basically said waste produced by reprocessing of spent fuel, that \nit included both liquid waste and that waste directly from reprocessing \nand dry solid material derived from that solid waste.\n  In addition, it gave the Nuclear Regulatory Commission the authority \nto include other waste in the definition of such material. \nSignificantly, West Valley gave the Commission power to add material \nother than reprocessing waste to the definition, but not to exempt any \npart of the processing of waste.\n  We have had this debate, and I know the Department of Energy objected \nto the definition. I know they wanted the regulatory agencies to be \nable to exclude material from high-level radioactive waste. I know that \nis what they wanted. But Congress rewrote the definition, not as the \nDepartment asked, but, as enacted, the final definition provides, as I \nsaid earlier, high-level radioactive waste means material from \nreprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, and that other radioactive material \nthat the Commission, consistent with existing law, determines requires \npermanent isolation.\n\n  That is the process by which we, as the legislative branch, have \ngotten to the point of making decisions about this incredible product \nthat was made by men and women throughout our country in the 1940s. It \nwas a time of great military need, during World War II and the cold \nwar. And they did their job, as the federal government had asked.\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\n  Now we are saying we are going to ignore the definitions and the \nprocess and not really have a hearing on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nor the fact that the DOE has already been turned down in the courts in \nits ability to reclassify that waste.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Washington \nwill allow me a moment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Pardon?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I do not have a question. I wanted to know how much \nlonger the Senator from Washington will take because we have Members in \nthe Chamber who would like to speak. They have schedules and would like \nto get some feel of when their opportunity may come up to speak.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Washington how much \nlonger she anticipates taking to complete her remarks.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have some more material on the history \nof the process. I see 2 of my colleagues in the Chamber who are also \nvery concerned about this issue, but I imagine at least another half \nhour or so longer, maybe more.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for that guidance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator from Washington have a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would hope we could go back and forth. I think that is \nthe way the debate has been going. The next Senator I will call on is \nSenator Inhofe, and then whoever on your side.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I obviously want my colleagues to join in the debate on \nthis issue, but the reason this Senator feels so strongly about this \nprocess is because I do believe this measure does not belong on the \nDefense authorization bill. We have a very important piece of \nlegislation that needs to move through the process, and yet we have an \nentity the courts have turned down, that believes that States have \nturned them down, that believes this is a controversial issue, and \nthinks they ought to sneak it in on a DOD bill and that is a way to do \nlegislation. It is not the way to do legislation.\n  This is the only opportunity we have to expose the fact this \nlegislation has been drafted this way and the unbelievable effect it \nhas on so many people in this country when the Department of Energy can \nauthor legislation and give it to a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee who then offers it in a mark-up in private and includes it in \nthe legislation.\n  I am going to take a little more time to go over these facts because \nI think the bright light of day needs to shine on the fact the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982 ought to have the attention of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and ought to have the attention of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and not be proposed on the \nDefense authorization bill without the scrutiny of public debate and \nforesight that such a huge, significant change in policy would bring \nabout.\n  This is why I am going to take as much time as necessary to explain \nthis policy and to say to the members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that while any member has the ability to offer any amendment \nthey want, including in an authorizing bill, usually it is the other \nway around. We have authorizing on appropriations and issues of that \nnature that have caused----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I remind the Senator from Washington, if she is concerned \nabout the action that we had proposed with the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I chair that committee and I am waiting to be heard \nconcerning this issue because I also have a lot of interest in it. I \nappreciate the fact that the Senator is suggesting our jurisdiction \nshould be heard, and that is what I am waiting to do.\n  Will the Senator agree with that?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for his question. The issue is that \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee should never have voted and \nconsidered this legislation in a closed door session without those \nhearings. So I certainly want the Member to be heard but--I think I \nhave the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield the floor for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I think I have the floor, Mr. President, and I will \nyield in a moment for another question.\n  The issue is that we have been trying to work with the author of this \nlegislation on a compromise that would promote a dialog and a hearing. \nMy staff has been working diligently since the language came out of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  This morning we learned without warning, without notice, that perhaps \nnow they did not want to continue discussion on that, they did not want \nto continue discussion on how we brought this issue to light.\n  I really did not want to spend the afternoon on the Senate floor. We \nhad hoped we would actually propose a better process and procedure, but \nothers want to move forward on changing the underlying bill, which in \nthis amendment is still flawed. The proposed amendment by Senator \nGraham of South Carolina makes a bad situation slightly better but does \nnot correct the underlying problem. And this Senator whose home state \nhas one million gallons of nuclear waste flowing to the Columbia \nRiver--is going to be heard on the details of this proposal.\n  The fact that we have not had a full public hearing on a significant \nchange in 30 years of policy and 50 years of science is something that, \nif it takes me 5 hours to explain, I will take it. I will take the 5 \nhours to explain to my colleague the significance of these changes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. May I most respectfully explain that \nunder the Senate rules of allocation of committee responsibilities, \nthis issue of the nuclear waste is directly within the purview of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. We control, through oversight, 70 \npercent of the budget of the Department of Energy. The cost of nuclear \nwaste cleanup comes before our committee. So I want to say to my \ndistinguished colleague, while she may have concerns about the \nlegislative process as a whole, there is no doubt about the \njurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee over this subject.\n  We have put in our bill, which is now at the desk and the subject of \ndebate, the specific provisions the Senator is addressing. \nJurisdictionally we had the perfect right to incorporate in our bill \nsuch legislative language we deemed as a committee necessary for \ndealing with this question of this specific type of nuclear waste. I \nwas not certain that the distinguished Senator was aware that clearly \nthis is in the jurisdiction of this committee.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for his question, but under rule \nXXV, the Armed Services Committee has jurisdiction over national \nsecurity aspects of nuclear energy, the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee has jurisdiction over nonmilitary development of nuclear \nenergy, and the EPW Committee has jurisdiction over the nonmilitary \nenvironmental regulation and control of nuclear energy.\n  Undoubtedly SASC has jurisdiction over the reprocessing that created \nthe tanks to begin with because DOE was responsible for the national \nsecurity, but I do not see how anyone could seriously argue how the \nwaste, disposal, and cleanup of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is a part \nof the national security aspect of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee's jurisdiction.\n  While I am more than happy that the committee has used this authority \nto bring this issue up, I think the committee is doing an injustice to \nsay to our colleagues that a change that is in contradiction to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act ought to be passed by the committee without \nhearing, without debate, without full scrutiny of public daylight. This \nprovision would really contradict 30 years of law on the books when the \nagency promulgating that rule change lost a court battle basically \ntelling it it does not have the authority to redefine high-level \nnuclear waste.\n  I fully respect, because of all the committees that I work with, I \nknow that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee always strives \nto be fair and balanced at his hearings. And\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\nthere are difficult challenges that we have had over many sensitive \nsubjects in the last several weeks. The chairman has gone way out of \nhis way to make sure the continuity of that committee works well and \nthat the rules and processes are followed. But I say to the chairman \nthat if the Department of Energy is so sure about these statutory \nchanges they are promulgating through his committee without debate, \nthen they ought to be willing to have the hearings and have the debates \nwith the other committees that have jurisdiction for the cleanup, not \nthe national security efforts the Senator was responsible for as the \nchairman of that committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could reply, without the Senator \nlosing her right to the floor, I will shortly bring the President's \nbudget request for funds. I will bring appropriations acts and I will \nshow the Senator the direct linkage of the request for funds coming to \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Armed Services Committee bill going \nto the Appropriations Committee, and action by the Appropriations \nCommittee on the authorizations of expenditure of the funds for nuclear \nwaste and cleanup. It is irrefutable, and I will take a little time to \ngo out and get the documentation. Then I will ask unanimous consent to \nprint that documentation in the Record.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the chairman again for his statement. I point \nout to him that the difference between authorizing for appropriations \nand oversight of policy, and what I am debating is that the committee's \noversight over nuclear waste cleanup policy as set out in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. When that was passed in 1982 and moved through the \nlegislative branch and made its way through the debates, it was debated \nin the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and EPW Committee. As the \nparliamentarian referred to those committees, I am sure that the SASC, \nbecause of its nature of the appropriated funds, has some \nresponsibilities. But I do not think that the SASC is the committee of \njurisdiction for changing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. I do not think \nthat is the primary responsibility of that committee.\n  So, I don't know. I say to the Senator, the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I have a great deal of respect for his \nwillingness at all times in the most difficult of situations to try to \nhave consideration of issues be as fair and balanced as possible, and \nto give Members their opportunity. I am happy to continue to discuss \nwith him the nuances of this particular issue. But I have a feeling \nthat if we had this Nuclear Waste Policy Act before us today and we \nasked the Parliamentarian--this change that is in your bill, under a \nseparate act, under a separate stand-alone bill--it would not be \nreferred to that committee. It would be referred jointly to those other \ncommittees and maybe to SASC in the authorizing of an appropriation, \nbut not for the policy change.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will reply later today with the \ndocuments in hand.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I think there are several other people \nhere.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator respond to a question from the Senator?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend from Washington, having spoken with \nher, it is my understanding the Senator has said publicly that if we \ncame back after the break, the Senator would be willing to look very \nclosely at the amendment pending and would be willing to offer one of \nher own, that she would agree to a time certain on that amendment. Is \nthat true?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I simply want the issue to have the appropriate amount \nof debate and dialog. All of us will have the opportunity to vote up or \ndown on any of the amendments anybody wants to offer to this section. \nBut the question before us was, all of a sudden at 11:30 today, without \nnotice, when we had been in negotiations on this language, to bring it \nto the floor, this Senator feels obligated to make sure this time \nperiod is used to bring committee members and colleagues up to speed \nabout the contents of the underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my further understanding the Senator, who has spoken \nfor some time now, has a lot more to say, is that right, on this \namendment, on this date? She has only gotten warmed up; is that right?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And you, as a matter of courtesy, will allow Senators \nHollings and Murray and anyone on the majority side to speak and you \nwill be back at a later time for another round or two; is that correct?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is correct. I will give my colleagues from \nWashington and South Carolina an opportunity to join in this debate and \nparticipate because I think it is very important that this issue \nreceive the full attention of Members. As I said at the beginning of \nthis discussion, I do not believe this is an issue--even though a lot \nof my colleagues would like to classify it as an issue that only \naffects Washington State, South Carolina, or Idaho perhaps with some \nimpact on Oregon and maybe Georgia, or New York in its commercial \nfacility. I have never thought of this nuclear waste issue as a \ngeographic-specific debate.\n  Our responsibility as a body is to make sure nuclear waste cleanup \nhappens in a process that the science determines will not be with harm \nto humans or to the environment. We now have a proposal before us that \nscience says will be harmful, that is not based on sound science, that \nhas not met the test, nor has our approval.\n  While I am willing to have this debate, I hope my colleagues will use \nthis debate as an opportunity to understand our challenge on nuclear \nwaste cleanup and the tremendous amount of resources that are spent by \nour Government on that cleanup and the efficiencies that need to happen \nto make that process go more smoothly than it has in the past.\n\n  But I can guarantee to my colleagues that wanting that process to go \nmore smoothly in the future, and wanting it to be more cost effective, \ndoes not simply mean coming up with a short-term proposal, a fix that \nis counter to what existing statute and law is. If we want to have that \ndebate, let's go through the normal committees and have that debate, \nand let's have the scientists come in and discuss it with us, and let's \nnot end up with a process where we are going to be battling in the \ncourts. I don't think that does any of us any good. Certainly, for us \nin the State of Washington, with a 1-million-gallon plume heading \ntoward the Columbia River, it doesn't do us any good.\n  I hope my colleagues will use this opportunity to focus attention not \njust on the question at hand, of high-level radioactive waste, but I \nwould say the consistency by which the States of Washington, Oregon, \nIdaho, South Carolina, and others have banded together in the last year \nor two in authorizing and appropriations language that has done a good \njob to make sure the processing of radioactive waste is completed.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is the first time I think the Department \nof Energy has successfully picked off a State. At first the underlying \nlanguage was actually blackmail: We are going to make this change and \nnuclear waste is going to be reclassified, and if you are going to \nagree with us, we will give you some money, and if you don't agree with \nus, we are not cleaning up your waste. That is blackmail. That is what \nthe current language in the DOD authorizing bill is. It is blackmail.\n  Now, after my colleagues have seen what ludicrous language that is, \nSenator Graham wants to offer an amendment that will not tie up the \nfunds. But we still remain with the underlying problem, which is the \nDepartment of Energy is trying to reclassify highly radioactive waste \nas low-level ancillary waste and say it can be grouted, that is that \ncement and sand can be poured on it and somehow, leaving incidental \namount of tank waste is a sufficient way to clean up tanks.\n  I will continue to fight on this issue until Members understand the \nsignificant policy change that is before this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent after the remarks of Senator Inhofe that \nSenators Murray, Allard, and Hollings be recognized, and that I \nimmediately be recognized after them.\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nWashington has the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I want to accommodate the Senator from Nevada. I was \nproposing to accommodate and trade off recognition of the four Members \nwho are present on the floor?\n  Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. REID. When the Senator yields the floor, I will speak.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from Nevada--I am happy to yield the floor \nto the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Pardon me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding the floor?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator from Nevada have a question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Chair. I have a question on \nthat statement. The Senator from Washington has a right to speak, but \nwe are not going to set a long list of speakers here at random, what \nspeakers are going to speak. I think what we are going to do, we have a \nnumber of speakers on the floor, Senators Inhofe, Hollings, Allard, \nMurray--people who have been here for a long period of time.\n  It appears to me we are not going to have a vote on this in the near \nfuture. I suggest what we do is enter into agreement for the next \nseveral however long it takes. We have people who want to speak. We can \ngo forward and whoever gets the jump ball, have people be recognized \nwhenever they get the floor.\n  Senator Hollings has said Senator Inhofe has been here longer than he \nhas. Senator Inhofe could be recognized for whatever time he feels \nappropriate. I would like to get some idea of what the time should be. \nThen, Senator Hollings, I think that would be the best way to go.\n  But in the meantime, it must be under some agreement, whoever gets \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from Washington is happy to entertain a \nquestion that would allow the various Members who are here----\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Washington has to understand--she has the \nfloor, and if she wants to keep talking, let her keep talking. When she \nfinishes, we will be happy to----\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator from Washington will yield, I would like \nto pose a plan of how we can go through this. I suggest that maybe we \ncan sit down with leadership and work out some time for debate. I know \nSenator Graham on this side of the Senate floor would like to wrap up \nthis debate. Maybe we can get some time limits to give everybody an \nopportunity to speak. I know there is some interest in having some \nvotes tonight. I believe I need to work with leadership on this side, \nif Senator Reid will work with leadership on his side, to determine if \nwe can work this out. The Senator from Washington can finish, and I can \ncall on the Senator from Oklahoma. Maybe we can sit down and work out a \ntime agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Let me say this: Everyone should understand that there is not going \nto be a vote on this amendment tonight. Everyone should understand \nthat. There is going to be no vote on the pending amendment tonight. I \ntold people that 5 hours ago. No one believed me. There is not going to \nbe a vote on the Graham amendment tonight.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Nobody is calling for a vote on this amendment tonight, \nbut there might be other votes.\n  Mr. REID. We will not agree to set this one side. If the Senator from \nSouth Carolina wishes to withdraw his amendment and set some orderly \nprocedure to take it up when we get back after the Memorial Day break, \nwe are in agreement. But we are not going to agree to set this aside to \ngo to another amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this Senator is happy to yield the floor \nto my colleague to discuss this issue. I want to make it clear that \nafter 30 years of standard policy, they are not willing to just have a \nfew hours of debate and then vote on this significant a change. The \nunderlying Graham amendment does not fix the underlying DOD committee-\npassed authorization language that allows the Department of Energy to \nreclassify waste.\n  That is the key issue at hand. We do not want to leave this bill with \nthis reclassification of highly radioactive waste to an amendment on \nspent fuel storage tanks to then be grouted over. We need to have the \nattention of this body, my colleagues who are members of the various \ncommittees I mentioned and my colleagues from those States directly \naffected, although I said it is a policy everybody should be \ndiscussing, and the public needs to have an idea and an opportunity to \nunderstand that this is a major policy proposal which is being proposed \nin this underlying bill.\n  I would have preferred that the Graham amendment not be brought up \ntoday, not to this particular issue of the DOD bill being discussed. We \nare still talking. We hoped we might able to work something out and \nsave our colleagues the time and attention of studying a nuclear waste \npolicy proposal and what level of radioactivity could be sufficiently \nremoved from tanks and what couldn't be. But if my colleagues want to \ncontinue to pursue the subject, we are going to continue to pursue and \ndiscuss this issue.\n  With that, I know various Members of both sides of the aisle are \nwaiting, and I will have more to say on this subject as we continue to \ndebate the DOD authorizing bill and continue to debate whether the \nGraham amendment is sufficient in disposing of the problem that has now \nbeen created in the underlying bill in overriding 30 years of law and \nscience about how this country should clean up nuclear waste. I don't \nbelieve anybody in America wants to do it on the cheap. We need to give \nthe American public the certainty that this body will not propose major \npolicy changes without hearings, without debate, without committees of \njurisdiction having oversight of this policy proposal that is in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to work out, subject to the \napproval of the majority leader, to allow Senator Inhofe to speak for \n15 minutes and Senator Hollings for 45 minutes. They have waited a long \ntime. Senator Allard, being the gentleman he is, did want to talk about \nthe subsequent votes; there are a couple of judges who need votes. We \nhave 25 to do before the end of June, so we have a lot of voting to do. \nThen, of course, everyone should understand that we will be right back \non the Defense bill following those votes.\n  We appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Oklahoma for being \npatient and the Senator from South Carolina. The order has not been \nentered, but that is what we will order. It would be appropriate for \nthe Senator from Oklahoma to start his speech.\n  Members should understand that we will have a couple of votes around \n5:30.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the manager if I could have 20 minutes, but I will \nprobably not take that long. I am saving the best for last and I don't \nwant to miss it.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I amend that and ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma be allowed to speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will clarify a couple of things that \nwere said by the distinguished Senator from Washington that I am sure \nshe believes are true but need to be elaborated upon. First, \ncharacterizing the consideration of going back to the old policy as \nsomething that happened in the middle of the night, something that \nhappened in the dark, something that\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\nhappened in a less than honest way is not at all accurate.\n  I suggest two things. First, I chaired the Subcommittee on Clean Air, \nWetlands, Private Property and Nuclear Safety of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee in 1998 and 1999. During that time, of course, \nwe had jurisdiction over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During that \ntime, they had countless hearings. They had comment periods. They \ntalked about this out in the open, with people given an opportunity to \nbe heard. I happened to be chairing the committee that had oversight at \nthe time. I remember that very well.\n  Second, I suggest this was discussed in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. It certainly was not something that was done in any way that \nwas less than totally honest and totally done in the daylight. By \nsuggesting that Senator Joe Lieberman and Senator Jack Reed and the \nother Members on this side of the issue did something that was not out \nin the open, I don't think is quite fair.\n  We had a hearing this morning with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nIt is an oversight hearing we have had ever since 1998. That is when, \nin the NRC, I believe we saw a major change. They have done a good job. \nThe NRC says we should manage waste based on the risk it poses, not how \nit is defined.\n  The Department of Energy was attempting to pursue this very policy \nwhen it was stopped in its tracks. What stopped it? Several of my \ncolleagues already mentioned a lawsuit was brought against the DOE by \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council. This is the allegedly charitable \norganization that uses a substantial amount of taxpayer dollars in the \nform of discretionary grants to achieve its goals.\n  Three weeks ago I spoke in the Senate about the spurious and \nmisleading advertisement run by the NRDC. This organization places a \nhigher priority on imposing ridiculously stringent environmental \nstandards than on essential elements of national security. They have \nproven this many times in the past by filing lawsuits to limit the Navy \nreadiness exercises and otherwise hampering our military. Now the NRDC \nhas hamstrung the Department of Energy in the faithful execution of its \nresponsibilities.\n  This amendment allows the DOE to pursue the best plan to dispose of \nthis nuclear material. That plan saves our taxpayers money. It shortens \nthe amount of time the waste remains in the tanks. It is a safe way to \ndo it. It is a well-thought-out way of doing it and one that has been \nthe subject of a lot of daylight. It is merely going back to a policy \nthat has worked for a long period of time.\n  We know the background. Sometimes it is necessary to repeat it. \nDuring the cold war, the national security of the United States \nnecessitated the building of nuclear weapons. Now, 50 years later, we \nare faced with the legacy of this effort and the need to clean up the \nsites where there is waste from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. \nThe creation of this waste was a necessary result of the chemical \nprocesses needed to make defense nuclear material. We all understand \nthat.\n  Last summer, this very important cleanup effort, which is the single \nlargest ongoing environmental risk reduction project for the Department \nof Energy, took a crushing blow when the district court issued a ruling \nthat created significantly illegal uncertainties and enormous problems \nfor the Department's tank waste cleanup at the Savannah River site, the \nWest Valley, the Hanford site, and the Idaho National Engineer \nEnvironmental Laboratory. Unless these legal uncertainties are \nresolved, the only path the Department of Energy could in theory pursue \nthat does have the necessary legal certainty would be to involve \nsending all the waste in tanks and the tanks themselves to Yucca \nMountain no matter how long or short lived is the radioactivity they \ncontain.\n  This dramatic change in course would increase the costs of the \ncleanup itself in terms of human lives sevenfold and also delay \ncompletion of simply emptying the tanks and treating the waste there by \nfour decades, thereby further substantially increasing the risk, as the \nNRC pointed out, to the public health and safety during the time period \nby leaving the waste in tanks for that much longer. It would also \nincrease the cost of simply emptying and treating the tank waste, \naccording to the DOE estimates, by an additional $86 billion, only $1 \nbillion less than last year's supplemental appropriation for the Iraq \nwar, for approximately a total cost of $138 billion.\n  We are talking about something really big. The estimates for delay \nand the additional costs do not take into account the very complex \nlogistics of transporting and disposing of all the additional waste at \nYucca Mountain or the complex logistics of preparing for disposal, \ntransporting, and disposing of the tanks themselves. Keep in mind, it \nis not just what is in the tanks. The tanks themselves would have to go \nthere and be disposed of at the Yucca Mountain facility. These would \nalso add additional decades and tens, if not hundreds, of billions of \ndollars to the cleanup cost.\n\n  Furthermore, under this scenario, the number of canisters of waste \nthat would be transported to Yucca Mountain would increase from 20,000 \ncanisters to approximately 200,000 canisters.\n  I know there are a lot of members in the Senate concerned about the \ntransport of waste to Yucca Mountain. That would increase it tenfold. \nSome have asked, why not just authorize and appropriate $350 million \nneeded for the cleanup activities in fiscal year 2005 and force the \nDepartment of Energy to continue its work? This is not a responsible \npath. If the Department of Energy constructs the facility necessary to \nprepare waste for disposal as low-level or transuranic waste and \nprepare the waste for disposal and then finds out after the fact that \nit lacked the legal authority to classify the waste in this manner, \nhundreds of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money would already \nhave been wasted and years of cleanup work lost. The Department may \nhave actually made it harder to put the waste in the form needed to \ndispose of it at Yucca Mountain.\n  The fundamental root cause of the dilemma that faces our Nation today \nis the ambiguity presented by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act's definition \nof high-level waste and that, if left unclassified, is producing this \ntechnologically irrational result without environmental benefit that, \nin fact, increases health and safety risks.\n  It is up to this committee and this Congress to resolve ambiguity in \norder for the cleanup of the sites which played such a key role in the \nnational security of our Nation. The language before the Senate \nclarifies the ambiguity, and I urge adoption of this language.\n  What had happened on this, back in the time it was considered in SAS \nCommittee--the Senate Armed Services Committee--was that it was an \namendment to actually go back and do it as it had been done before, to \ndo it in the best way, as determined by the multitude of hearings that \nwere conducted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and which were \nconducted during the time I chaired the oversight committee. So we were \nthere. We knew it was taking place.\n  The thing that I guess bothers me the most--I see the ranking \nminority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Senate \nfloor. We acted very responsibly. This was not a partisan issue. This \nwas a bipartisan issue. To infer in any way that things were done in \nthe dark of night or in any way inappropriately is to say that I and \nseveral others--certainly the chairman of the committee; certainly \nSenator Joe Lieberman; certainly Senator Jack Reed, who supported this \neffort and supported the Senator from South Carolina--were acting \ninappropriately. I do not think that is realistic.\n  By the way, it has been said several times that there is some doubt \nas to what the NRC's position is on this issue. I will read the last \nparagraph of a letter that was sent to me, on May 18, as chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. This last paragraph says:\n\n       It is our understanding that some opponents of DOE's \n     proposed plans believe that the tanks and the waste residuals \n     should be disposed of as high-level waste in a geologic \n     repository. While either approach could potentially be \n     implemented within NRC regulatory requirements, we note that \n     removal of the tanks, packaging of the tanks and residuals \n     for transport and disposal, and disposal of the waste at a \n     geologic repository, if feasible, would incur significant \n     additional worker exposures--\n\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\n\n  That is human lives. We are exposing individuals.\n\n     and transportation exposures--\n\n  The transportation exposures we have talked about on this floor many, \nmany times--\n\n     at very large financial costs.\n\n  You might conclude that, at this time, with all the terrorist threats \naround, these could become prime targets while being transported. Still \nquoting the letter:\n\n       Whereas, if DOE's proposed plans meet appropriate criteria, \n     such as those used in NRC's previous reviews, then the NRC \n     believes that public health and safety can be maintained \n     while avoiding unnecessary additional exposures and risks \n     associated with removal and transport of the waste and \n     unnecessary additional expenditures of Federal funds.\n       I hope this letter satisfactorily addresses your questions.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from \nthe NRC to me dated May 18 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2004.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter responds to your request of \n     May 18, 2004, for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's \n     (NRC's) views on waste-incident-to-reprocessing (WIR). \n     Specifically, you requested NRC's thoughts on: (1) the U.S. \n     Department of Energy's (DOE's) plan to grout in place the \n     remaining residues left in the tanks at the Savannah River \n     Site (SRS), the Hanford site, and the Idaho National \n     Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL); and (2) the \n     risks to human health and the environment by following DOE's \n     plan or the Natural Resources Defense Council' (NRDC's) plan. \n     The concept underlying WIR is that wastes can be managed \n     based on their risk to human health and the environment, \n     rather than the origin of the wastes. For wastes that \n     originate in reprocessing of nuclear fuel, such as the tank \n     residuals at the DOE sites, some are highly radioactive and \n     need to be treated and disposed of as high-level radioactive \n     waste. Others do not pose the same risk to human health and \n     the environment, and do not need to be disposed of as high-\n     level waste in order to manage the risks that they pose.\n       At the outset, it must be understood that the NRC does not \n     have regulatory authority or jurisdiction over SRS, Hanford, \n     or INEEL. In the past, DOE has requested NRC review of some \n     of its WIR determinations and supporting analysis. The NRC \n     entered into reimbursable agreements to perform these \n     reviews, which were provided as advice and did not constitute \n     regulatory approval. NRC performed comprehensive and \n     independent WIR reviews for Hanford in 1997, SRS in 2000, and \n     INEEL in 2002 and 2003. These reviews involved both waste \n     removed from tanks, and waste residuals remaining in the \n     tanks for grouting and closure. NRC assessed whether DOE's \n     determinations had sound technical assumptions, analysis, and \n     conclusions with regard to specific WIR criteria. These \n     criteria are: (1) the waste has been processed to remove key \n     radionuclides to the maximum extent that is technically and \n     economically practical, and (2) the waste is to be managed so \n     that safety requirements comparable to the performance \n     objectives in NRC's regulation 10 CFR Part 61 (Licensing \n     Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste), Subpart \n     C, are satisfied. In all cases, the NRC staff found that \n     DOE's proposed methodology and conclusions met the \n     appropriate WIR criteria and therefore met the performance \n     objectives and dose limits that would apply to near-surface \n     low-level waste disposal and would protect public health and \n     safety. It should be noted that the Commission did not review \n     all of DOE's actions with regard to WIR at those sites, and \n     that the NRC conclusions applied only to those actions that \n     the NRC reviewed. It should be noted that the Commission in \n     its ``Decommissioning Criteria for the West Valley \n     Demonstration Project (M-32) at the West Valley Site; Final \n     Policy Statement'' (67 FR 5003, February 1, 2002), \n     established WIR criteria for that site identical to those \n     used in our reviews of the three DOE sites.\n       It is our understanding that some opponents of DOE's \n     proposed plans believe that the tanks and the waste residuals \n     should be disposed of as high-level waste in a geologic \n     repository. While either approach could potentially be \n     implemented within NRC regulatory requirements, we note that \n     removal of the tanks, packaging of the tanks and residuals \n     for transport and disposal, and disposal of the waste at a \n     geologic repository, if feasible, would incur significant \n     additional worker exposures and transportation exposures at \n     very large financial costs. Whereas, if DOE's proposed plans \n     meet appropriate criteria, such as those used in NRC's \n     previous reviews, then the NRC believes that public health \n     and safety can be maintained while avoiding unnecessary \n     additional exposures and risks associated with removal and \n     transport of the waste and unnecessary additional \n     expenditures of Federal funds.\n       I hope this letter satisfactorily addresses your questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Nils J. Diaz.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have a lot of commissions and a lot of organizations \nin the committee that I chair. We have some 17 Departments for which we \nhave oversight and we deal with on a daily basis. When the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission was originally formed, it was to have the \nexpertise and the knowledge as to what is going to assure the most \nsafety for the public in the cheapest way you can get things done. They \nhave done a good job. We have a lot of organizations such as this \nthroughout Government. We have CASAC, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory \nCommittee. We look to them because they have expertise. We look to the \nNRC because they have expertise.\n  I do not want to imply that any of the Members here would have \nnecessarily less expertise than the NRC, but I suspect that is the \ncase. So we rely on that expertise. Here we have the Department of \nEnergy with all of its experts saying: This is the safe way to do it. \nThis is the cheapest way to do it. And we have the NRC, which is \ncharged with the responsibility of public safety, saying: This is the \nbest way to do it.\n  So I believe, when the time comes, we need to look at this rationally \nand not try to make disparaging remarks about some of the members of \nthe Armed Services Committee in our consideration of this amendment. \nKeep in mind, this was years in the making. Six years ago we started \nhearings on how to properly dispose of this, and the conclusions they \ncame to were unanimous.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, are we in a position now \nto do anything on this request we had?\n  Mr. ALLARD. No. We are still hearing. Senator Inhofe has finished his \nstatement. I would suggest we recognize the Senator from South Carolina \nfor 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized--\n  Mr. REID. No. The Senator is recognized for whatever time he wants. \nHe has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                      Setting The Record Straight\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues. I \nhave, this afternoon, the opportunity to respond to being charged as \nanti-Semitic when I proclaimed the policy of President Bush in the \nMideast as not for Iraq or really for democracy in the sense that he is \nworried about Saddam and democracy. If he were worried about democracy \nin the Mideast, as we wanted to spread it as a policy, we would have \ninvaded Lebanon, which is half a democracy and has terrorism and \nterrorists who have been problems to the interests of Israel and the \nUnited States.\n  It is very interesting that on page 231, Richard Clarke, in his book \n``Against All Enemies,'' cites the fact that there had not been any \nterrorism, any evidence or intelligence of Saddam's terrorism against \nthe United States from 1993 to 2003. He says that in the presence of \nPaul Wolfowitz. He says that in the presence of John McLaughlin of the \nCIA. In fact, he says: Isn't that right, John? And John says: That is \nexactly right.\n  The reason was when they made the attempt on President Bush, Senior, \nback in 1993, President Clinton ordered a missile strike on Saddam in \ndowntown Baghdad, the intelligence headquarters, and it went right \nstraight down the middle of the headquarters. It was after hours so not \na big kill--but Saddam got the message: You monkey around with the \nUnited States, a missile will land on your head.\n\n  So, in essence, the equation had changed in the Saddam-Iraq/Mideast \nconcerns whereby Saddam was more worried about any threat of the United \nStates against him than the United States was worried about a threat by \nSaddam against us.\n  I want to read an article that appeared in the Post and Courier in \nCharleston on May 6; thereafter, I think in the State newspaper in \nColumbia a couple days later; and in the Greenville News--all three \nmajor newspapers in South Carolina. You will find\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\nthat there is no anti-Semitic reference whatsoever in it.\n  The reason I emphasize that upfront is for the simple reason that you \ncannot put an op-ed in my hometown paper that is anti-Semitic. We have \na very, very proud Jewish community in Charleston. In fact, it is where \nreform Judaism began. The earliest temple, Kadosh Beth Elohim, is on \nHasell Street. I have spoken there several times. I had the pleasure of \nhaving that particular temple put on the National Register. This \nparticular Senator, with over 50 years now of public service, has \nreceived a strong Jewish vote.\n  Let me emphasize another thing because the papers are piling on and \nbringing up again a little difference of opinion I had on the Senate \nfloor with Senator Metzenbaum. It was not really a difference. What had \nhappened was we were discussing a matter, and we referred to each's \nreligion in order to make sure there would not be any misunderstanding \nor tempers flaring. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nHelms, referred to himself as the Baptist lay leader, Senator Danforth \nas the Episcopal priest. I referred to myself as the Lutheran Senator. \nAnd when Senator Metzenbaum came on the floor, I referred to him as the \nSenator from B'nai B'rith, and he took exception. He thought it was an \naspersion. I told him: Wait a minute, I will gladly identify myself as \nthe Senator from B'nai B'rith. I did not mean to hurt his feelings. I \napologized at that time but not for the legitimacy and the \ncircumstances of the particular reference.\n  Now here we go again, some years later. The Senator from Virginia, \nMr. George Allen, and I are good friends. Maybe after this particular \nthing he might feel different, but I know his role as the chairman of \nthe campaign committee. And so I have an article here where Senator \nAllen denounces Senator Hollings' latest political attack, Senator \nHollings' antisemitic, political conspiracy statement. Let me read the \nstatement here from the May 6 Post and Courier, and you be the judge:\n\n       With 760 dead in Iraq, over 3,000 maimed for life--home \n     folks continue to argue why we are in Iraq--and how to get \n     out.\n       Now everyone knows what was not the cause. Even President \n     Bush acknowledges that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with \n     9/11. Listing the 45 countries where al-Qaida was operating \n     on September 11 . . . the State Department did not list Iraq.\n\n  They listed 45 countries and at that particular date on September 11, \n2001, they did not even list Iraq.\n\n       Richard Clarke, in ``Against All Enemies,'' tells how the \n     United States had not received any threat of terrorism for 10 \n     years from Saddam at the time of our invasion.\n       On page 231, John McLaughlin of the CIA verifies this to \n     Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. In 1993, President \n     Clinton responded to Saddam's attempt on the life of \n     President George H.W. Bush by putting a missile down on \n     Saddam's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad. Not a big \n     kill, but Saddam got the message--monkey around with the \n     United States and a missile lands on his head. Of course \n     there were no weapons of mass destruction. Israel's \n     intelligence Mossad knows what's going on in Iraq. They are \n     the best. They have to know.\n       Israel's survival depends on knowing. Israel long since \n     would have taken us to the weapons of mass destruction . . .\n\n  Let me divert for a second there. I was here when Israel attacked the \nnuclear facility in Baghdad during the 1980s. In all candor, when \nPresident Bush, on October 7, 2002, said, after all that buildup by \nCheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld and everybody else, that facing clear \nevidence of peril, we cannot wait until the smoking gun is a mushroom \ncloud, I thought we were attacking for Israel. I thought that they knew \nabout some kind of nuclear development there. And rather than getting \nthem in further trouble with the United Nations and the Arab world, \nthat its best friend, the United States, would knock it out for them. \nThat is why I voted for it. I got misled. Our attack on Iraq, the \ninvasion of Iraq is a bad mistake. I will get into that later. But let \nme read even further:\n\n     . . . if there were any [weapons of mass destruction] or if \n     they had been removed. With Iraq no threat, why invade a \n     sovereign country? The answer: President Bush's policy to \n     secure Israel.\n       Led by Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Charles Krauthammer, \n     for years there had been a domino school of thought that the \n     way to guarantee Israel's security is to spread democracy in \n     the area. Wolfowitz wrote: ``The United States may not be \n     able to lead countries through the door of democracy, but \n     where that door is locked shut by a totalitarian deadbolt, \n     American power may be the only way to open it up.''\n\n  Namely, invasion. That is Wolfowitz talking.\n\n       And on another occasion: Iraq as ``the first Arab democracy \n     . . . would cast a very large shadow, starting with Syria and \n     Iran but across the whole Arab world.'' Three weeks before \n     the invasion, President Bush stated: ``A new regime in Iraq \n     would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example for freedom \n     for other nations in the region.''\n\n  I referred to those three gentlemen because I know them well. They \nare brilliant. I have been for years associated one way or the other \nwith each of them. I read Charles Krauthammer. I wish I could write \nlike he can. With respect to Richard Perle, he was sort of our \nauthority in the cold war, best friend of Scoop Jackson. That is how I \nmet him 38 years ago almost. I followed him and I followed his advice, \nand that is in large measure how we prevailed in the cold war. So I \nhave the highest respect for Richard Perle.\n\n  And, of course, the other gentleman, Paul Wolfowitz, Paul Wolfowitz, \nI met him out in Indonesia when he was Ambassador. He came back. We \nwere good friends. He was looking around for a position, and I know I \noffered him one--in fact, we might go to the records and find \ntemporarily he might have been on my payroll for a few weeks. But I \nhave always had the highest regard for Paul Wolfowitz.\n  That is why I referred to him. I had their sayings and everything \nelse. But let me go, diverting for a minute, right to the Project For \nThe New American Century. I have a letter that was written on May 29, \n1998, to Newt Gingrich, the Speaker, Trent Lott, the Senate majority \nleader. These are the gentlemen who said this:\n\n       We would use U.S. and allied military power to provide \n     protection for liberating areas in northern and southern \n     Iraq, and we should establish and maintain a strong U.S. \n     military presence in the region and be prepared to use that \n     force to protect our vital interests in the Gulf and, if \n     necessary, to help remove Saddam from power.\n\n  And that is signed by--and I want everybody to remember these names--\nElliot Abrams, William J. Bennett, Jeffrey Bergner, John R. Bolton, \nPaula Dobriansky, Francis Fukuyama, Robert Kagan, Zalmay Khalilzad, \nWilliam Kristol, Richard Perle, Peter Rodman, Donald Rumsfeld, William \nSchneider, Jr., Vin Weber, Paul Wolfowitz, James Woolsey, Robert B. \nZoellick. There is a studied school of thought of the best way to \nsecure Israel. We have been going for years back and forth with every \nparticular administration, you can see where we are now.\n  But in any event, the better way to do it is go right in and \nestablish our predominance in Iraq and then, as they say, and I have \ndifferent articles here I could refer to, next is Iran and then Syria. \nAnd it is the domino theory, and they genuinely believe it. I differ. I \nthink, frankly, we have caused more terrorism than we have gotten rid \nof. That is my Israel policy. You can't have an Israel policy other \nthan what AIPAC gives you around here. I have followed them mostly in \nthe main, but I have also resisted signing certain letters from time to \ntime, to give the poor President a chance.\n  I can tell you no President takes office--I don't care whether it is \na Republican or a Democrat--that all of a sudden AIPAC will tell him \nexactly what the policy is, and Senators and members of Congress ought \nto sign letters. I read those carefully and I have joined in most of \nthem. On some I have held back. I have my own idea and my own policy. I \nhave stated it categorically.\n  The way to really get peace is not militarily. You cannot kill an \nidea militarily. I was delighted the other day when General Myers \nappeared before our Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense and he said \nthat we will not win militarily in Iraq. He didn't say we are going to \nget defeated militarily but that you can't win militarily in Iraq.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not until I complete this thought. Time is running out \non me.\n  The papers are the ones that pointed out Wolfowitz, Pearle, and \nCharles Krauthammer were of the Jewish faith. They are the ones who \nbrought all this Semitism in there. I can tell you that right now, I \ndidn't have that in mind. I had my friends in mind and I followed them. \nWe had this in the late 1990s\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\nunder President Clinton, when we passed a resolution that we ought to \nhave Saddam removed from power, have a regime change. I was wondering \nhow it went. I had to find my old file--on this Project For The New \nAmerican Century.\n  Now, going back to my article: ``every President since 1947 has made \na futile attempt to help Israel negotiate peace. But no leadership has \nsurfaced amongst the Palestinians that can make a binding agreement. \nPresident Bush realized his chances at negotiation were no better. He \ncame to office imbued with one thought.''\n  Mr. ALLARD. I wonder if the Senator will yield, preserving his time, \nfor a unanimous consent request to move forward with the judge vote we \nhave at 5:40.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Without losing my right to the floor, I will yield.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 5:30 today the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nominations en bloc on today's Executive \nCalendar: No. 556, the nomination of Raymond Gruender to be U.S. \nCircuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit; and Calendar No. 557, the \nnomination of Franklin S. Van Antwerpen, to be U.S. Circuit Judge for \nthe Third Circuit.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following 10 minutes of debate, \nequally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, or their designees, that the Senate proceed to \nconsecutive votes on the confirmation of the nominations, with no \nfurther intervening action or debate; further, that following the vote, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator modify his request so \nthat the statement of the Senator from South Carolina will stop at \n5:40, and the rest of the unanimous consent kick in at 5:40, rather \nthan 5:30, so we will be voting at 5:50.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am willing to modify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me again read from my article:\n  President Bush came to office imbued with one thought: reelection.\n  I say that advisedly. I have been up here with eight Presidents. We \nhave had support of all eight Presidents. Yes, I supported the \nPresident on this Iraq resolution, but I was misled. There weren't any \nweapons, or any terrorism, or al-Qaida. This is the reason we went to \nwar. He had one thought in mind, and that was reelection. I say that \nabout President Bush. He is a delightful fella, a wonderful campaigner, \nbut he loves campaigning. You cannot get him in the White House or \ncatch him there, hardly. He doesn't work on these problems at all.\n  I have worked with all of the Presidents. I know the leadership goes \nto the White House and tries to work with him. He is interested in one \nthing, and that is to be out campaigning. So he had one thought in \nmind, and that was reelection.\n  Again, let me read: Bush thought tax cuts would hold his crowd \ntogether and that spreading democracy in the Mideast to secure Israel \nwould take the Jewish vote from the Democrats.\n  Is there anything wrong with referring to the Jewish vote? Good gosh, \nevery 1 of us of the 100, with pollsters and all, refer to the Jewish \nvote. That is not anti-Semitic. It is appreciating them. We campaigned \nfor it.\n  I just read about President Bush's appearance before the AIPAC. He \nconfirmed his support of the Jewish vote, referring to adopting Ariel \nSharon's policy, and the dickens with the 1967 borders, the heck with \nnegotiating the return of refugees, the heck with the settlements he \nhad objected to originally. They had those borders, Resolution No. \n242--no, no, President Bush said: I am going along with Sharon, and he \nwas going to get that and he got the wonderful reception he got with \nthe Jewish vote. There is nothing like politicizing or a conspiracy, as \nmy friend from Virginia, Senator Allen, says--that it is an anti-\nSemitic, political, conspiracy statement.\n  That is not a conspiracy. That is the policy. I didn't like to keep \nit a secret, maybe; but I can tell you now, I will challenge any 1 of \nthe other 99 Senators to tell us why we are in Iraq, other than what \nthis policy is here. It is an adopted policy, a domino theory of The \nProject For The New American Century.\n  Everybody knows it because we want to secure our friend, Israel. If \nwe can get in there and take it in 7 days, as Paul Wolfowitz says, then \nwe would get rid of Saddam, and when we got rid of Saddam, now all they \ncan do is fall back and say: Aren't you getting rid of Saddam?\n  Let me get to that point. What happens is, they say he is a monster. \nWe continued to give him aid after he gassed his own people and \neverything else of that kind. George Herbert Walker Bush said in his \nbook All The Best in 1999, never commit American GIs into an unwinnable \nurban guerrilla war and lose the support of the Arab world, lose their \nfriendship and support. That is a general rephrasing of it.\n  The point is, my authority is the President's daddy. I want everybody \nto know that. I don't apologize for this column. I want them to \napologize to me for talking about anti-Semitism. They are not getting \nby with it. I will come down here every day--I have nothing else to \ndo--and we will talk about it and find out what the policy is.\n  Let me go back to this particular column:\n\n       But George Bush, as stated by former Treasury Secretary \n     Paul O'Neill and others, started laying the groundwork to \n     invade Iraq days before the Inauguration.\n\n  There is no question, he got a briefing. That was the first thing he \nwanted out of former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen. Then the nominee, \nabout to take the oath of office as President of the United States, \nwanted to be briefed on Iraq. They had this policy in mind coming to \ntown. Mr. President, 9/11 had nothing to do with it, and we all know it \nnow. We have to understand it because that is the only way really to \nhelp Israel and get us out of the soup. Everybody is worrying about \nIraq. We better worry about Israel because we certainly have put her in \nterrible jeopardy with this particular initiative.\n\n       Without any Iraq connection to 9/11, within weeks President \n     Bush had the Pentagon outlining a plan to invade Iraq. He was \n     determined. President Bush thought taking Iraq would be easy. \n     Wolfowitz said it would take only 7 days. Vice President \n     Cheney believed that we would be greeted as liberators, but \n     Cheney's man, Chalabi, made a mess of de-Baathification of \n     Iraq by dismissing Republican Guard leadership and Sunni \n     leaders who soon joined with the insurgents.\n       Worst of all, we tried to secure Iraq with too few troops. \n     In 1966 in South Vietnam, with a population of 16 million, \n     General William C. Westmoreland, with 535,000 U.S. troops, \n     was still asking for more troops. In Iraq, with a population \n     of 25 million, General John Abizaid, with only 135,000 \n     troops, can barely secure the troops, much less the country. \n     If the troops are there to fight, there are too few. If they \n     are there to die, there are too many. To secure Iraq we need \n     more troops, at least 100,000 more. The only way to get the \n     United Nations back in Iraq is to make the country secure. \n     Once back, the French, Germans, and others will join with the \n     U.N. to take over.\n       With President Bush's domino policy in the Mideast gone \n     awry, he can't keep shouting ``Terrorism war.'' Terrorism is \n     a method, not a war. We don't call the Crimean war, with the \n     charge of the light brigade, the cavalry war, or World War II \n     the blitzkrieg war. There is terrorism in Northern Ireland, \n     there is terrorism in India, and in Pakistan. In the Mideast, \n     terrorism is a separate problem, to be defeated by diplomacy \n     and negotiation, not militarily.\n       Here, might does not make right. Right makes might. Acting \n     militarily we have created more terrorism than we have \n     eliminated.\n\n  The title of this article is ``Bush's failed Mideast policy is \ncreating more terrorism, `` and, I could add, jeopardizing the security \nof Israel.\n  They say: He talks like a big fan of Israel. I am. I have a 38-year \ntrack record. I will never forget some 34 years ago meeting with David \nBen-Gurion. He talked about little Israel, less than 3 million at that \ntime in a sea of 100 million.\n  Let's say Israel has 5 million people there now, but there are 150 \nmillion Muslims surrounding it. If you punch the particular buzzer I \ndid with Yitzhak Rabin 1 day down on the Negev to scramble the air \nforce, I think it was 21 seconds they were up in the air, and\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nin a minute's time, they were outside over Jordan.\n  Militarily, Israel is a veritable aircraft carrier. You can hardly \nfly and you are out of the country, and everybody has to understand \nthat. You cannot play the numbers game Sharon plays. He thinks he can \ndo it militarily.\n  I want to remind you, it was in that 6-day war--the book is ``Six \nDays of War'' by Michael Oren. Look on page 151, and Major Ariel Sharon \nsays: Look, we are going to decimate the Egyptian army and you will not \nhear from Egypt again for several generations. And Levi Eshkol, the \nPrime Minister, on page 152 says: ``Militarily victory decides nothing. \nThe Arabs will still be here.''\n\n  That is my theme. I have watched it over the years. You have to learn \nnot to kill together, but to live together. The finest piece I ever \nread was right in this morning's paper. There is still hope. I refer to \nan article: ``Israeli Arabs Exalting in a Rare Triumph.''\n  There are a million Israeli Arabs. They won a soccer match in Tel \nAviv. The majority of the team was of Israeli heritage, and they held \nan Israeli flag, if you can imagine that in the political United States \nof America. They are living together. Every Prime Minister since David \nBen-Gurion has realized that fact: that they have to learn to live \ntogether. They all moved, and they almost had it under Ehud Barak and \nPresident Clinton. Arafat proved he did not want peace. He did not \naccept it. That was our one chance.\n  Unfortunately, rather than working on that one chance and continuing, \nAriel Sharon went in their face at Temple Mount, the intifada started, \nand he has been killing 10 to 1. He plays the numbers game, almost like \nwe had in Vietnam. He thinks he can eliminate by moving the ball some, \ngetting some more settlements, bulldozing a house, but he is creating \nterrorism.\n  I had a headline the other day. When I saw it, I showed it to my \nstaff. I said: You all come in here, I want to ask you something. \n``Israel plans to destroy more Gaza dwellings.'' You see that headline? \nI asked staff members: Suppose they bulldoze your daddy's home. \nWouldn't you want to cut their throat?\n  They said: In a New York minute.\n  How do you create terrorists? Where is the front line in the so-\ncalled war on terrorism? I learned the answer recently on a trip I was \non with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We talked for over an \nhour with the King of Jordan. He finally cautioned at the very end, \nwhen we stood up, he said: You have to settle this Israel-Palestine \nquestion. That is the only way to get on top of this. We went over to \nKuwait to the Prime Minister when he got through, he said: You have to \nsettle the Israel-Palestine situation.\n  I will quote Mr. Musharraf, the President of Pakistan. When we got \nthere, he cautioned if you can settle the Israel-Palestine question, \nterrorism will disappear around the world.\n  Then we came in on a Friday evening to make a little courtesy call \nwith the French. The distinguished Senator from Virginia with \nLafayette--and I have slept in Lafayette's bed over there in Richmond, \nVA, and I helped with that particular thing because I believe and \nremember the French help. I will never forget--everybody is going to \nthe 60th anniversary of D-Day, but I was at the 50th anniversary and we \nwent over to Ste-Mere-Eglise, where a major, who was a Citadel \ngraduate, had broken through the line and saved us from having to leave \nthe beachhead and go back to England. They made a movie of it. A shell \nburst killed him. They laid him down on their side. He is buried on the \nside of the chapel.\n  We went to the services. We had talks there. This little old lady \ncame. She was about 80 years old, walking with a cane. I was listening \nto the mayor, and she pulled my jacket and she said: Thank you, Yank. \nIf you had not come we would be goose-stepping.\n  I turned to her and I said, thank you, madam, because if you had not \ncome, we would still be a colony.\n  The majority of the troops on the field at Yorktown with the \nsurrender of Cornwallis were French troops. We had French troops that \nhelped us get this so-called freedom. All this anti-French stuff, do \nnot give me french fries and everything else, is crazy.\n  I was proud to appear with the Senator from Virginia. But Chirac, he \nsaid, look, we have to have western solidarity. We have to work \ntogether now and we have to watch this competition from China in the \nFar East, and we in the western world have to stick together. He said \nhe wanted to help in Iraq, but he needed a U.N. resolution to cover. He \nsaid what we have to do is do something about Israel and Palestine.\n  I said, what would you do?\n  He said, I would put a peacekeeping force.\n  I said, would French troops come?\n  He said, French troops would come immediately. We would be part of it \nand we would separate them from killing each other every day.\n  My position is, and I believe in this particular policy as strongly \nas I know how, might does not make right, but right makes might. We \nhave lost our evenhanded posture and reputation in the Mideast. We are \nin worse off shape with Israel, our principal interest in the gulf.\n  Sharon has not helped us at all. We see him going back and forth. \nThey say, oh, no, it is negotiation. But we are throwing over the \nUnited States-Israel policy of some 35 years insofar as negotiating the \nsettlements and the refugees. We are saying forget about all of that, \nlet Sharon keep bulldozing them. Now in the morning paper on the front \npage one sees the killing of children, they are saying, we are \ndefending Israel. That is the U.S. policy. That is not just Israel's \npolicy.\n  They are coming in there with U.S. equipment, U.S. gun helicopters, \nU.S. tanks that are bulldozing. That is our policy. That is the reason \nfor 9/11 and Osama. He said, I do not like American troops in Saudi \nArabia, get the infidel out. That is why they went right into that \nthing. Where do you think we get all this talk about hate America? I do \nnot buy that stuff. I have traveled the world. They love Americans.\n  Recently we met with the Ambassadors of Germany and France, and \nBritain in our policy committee and they said the young people are \ndisillusioned. They always look to the United States for the moral \nposition and taking and defending that particular position. They do not \nlook there anymore.\n  We are losing the terrorism war because we thought we could do it \nmilitarily under the domino policy of President Bush, going into Iraq. \nThat is my point. That is not anti-Semite or whatever they say in here \nabout people's faith and ethnicity. I never referred to any faith. I \nshould have added those other names from the Project For The New \nAmerican Century, but I picked out the names I had quotes for. And for \nspace, I left other things out.\n  Mr. President, on May 12 of this year, I had printed in the Record \nthe article in its entirety.\n  I diverted from the reading of the article several times, so for the \nsake of accuracy I wanted the whole article printed.\n  This particular op-ed piece appeared in the Post and Courier. Never \nwould they have thought, having read it, if it was anti-Semitic, that \nthey would have ever put it in there. Nor would the Knight Ridder \nnewspapers in Columbia, SC. Nor would the Metro Media newspapers in \nGreenville, SC. But the Anti-Defamation League picked it up and now \nthey have given it to my good friend, Senator Allen of Virginia. I have \nhis particular admonition how I am anti-Semitic and I cannot let that \nstay there.\n  My staff knew I was coming over and waiting my turn in order to talk \nunder the Pastore rule. I know I am as vitally interested as anybody \ncan be about this issue. Our distinguished colleague from Washington, \nSenator Cantwell, knows this subject backward and forward.\n  The reason I had not known or gotten all fired up is I have been \ndoing some other work and South Carolina has already looked to me for \neverything at that Savannah River plant. I am on the Energy \nAppropriations Subcommittee and we have gotten all the money--do not \nworry about money. This is a policy of nuclear waste disposal, high-\nlevel waste, being reclassified under an end-around-end deal of trying \nto make it low-level waste and, as Senator Cantwell says, pouring in \nsome sand and concrete on top of it. The scientists say, watch out, the \nremains in these tanks are 50 percent as deadly and dangerous as the \nentire tank container.\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\n  Back to Saddam, everybody is glad we have gotten rid of Saddam, but \nwe can see what has happened. There is an old saying we learned in \nWorld War II that no matter how well the gun is aimed, if the recoil is \ngoing to kill the gun crew, you do not fire.\n  Did this White House and administration ever think of the recoil? It \nseverely injured the gun crew. Yes, ordinarily to get rid of Saddam, \nlike they put a missile on the intelligence head, they could have put a \nmissile on him any time they wanted, but they did not want to do that. \nThey wanted the domino policy to ensue.\n  No, no, getting rid of Saddam was not worth almost 800 dead GIs and \nover 3,500 maimed for life. Some say every time we want to criticize \nthe policy, we are weakening the GIs. I am strengthening the GIs. I \nsaid let's get enough in there so they can secure themselves. We have \n135,000 now. A third of those are guarding the other third, and that \nmeans leaving a third, 35,000 or 40,000 troops, running out like a fire \ndrill to any particular trouble and coming back in and eating. I have \nbeen there.\n  You can see it in Rafah. They are building a big old thing like in \nKosovo, where we hunker down and act like we are in charge of Kosovo. \nThe Albanians are in charge of Kosovo.\n  You can't force-feed democracy. It has to come from within. We helped \nliberate Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, 60-some years ago, and Morocco, \nAlgeria, Tunisia have not opted for democracy, nor has Libya, nor has \nEgypt, nor has Lebanon, nor has Syria, nor has Iraq, nor has Iran, nor \nhas Afghanistan, nor has Pakistan, nor has Jordan, nor has Yemen, nor \nhas Aden, nor has Saudi Arabia, nor has the organization of Arab \nstates.\n  Come on. So we have to go out and not speak sense with respect to \npolicy, and when you want to talk about policy, they say it is anti-\nSemitic. Well, come on the floor, let's debate it. Because my friend \nfrom Virginia admonishes me. Referring to me he says, ``I suggest he \nshould learn from history before making accusations.'' I didn't make \nany accusations. I stated facts. That is their policy. That is not my \npolicy.\n  Mind you me, when we went into Iraq, the only people in the world who \nfavored that policy were the people of the United States and the people \nof Israel. The people of Jordan, Iraq, Britain, Spain, Poland, Italy, \nJapan, everywhere around the world said you just don't invade a \nsovereign country no matter how bad the rascal is. We have Kim Jong of \nNorth Korea--he has weapons of mass destruction, but we don't do \nanything there.\n  Don't give me this about how we saved this and we did this or did \nthat. We have to sort of learn that the front line now is not the \nPentagon but the State Department. We have to work through diplomacy. \nWe live in a global economy and a global world. That is only going to \ncome about economically, politically, diplomatically, and by \nnegotiations.\n  The United States, until this invasion and this domino policy for \nIsrael--don't tell me it is otherwise, about spreading democracy. They \nknow what they are talking about. They are insisting on it. It is not a \nJewish policy or a Semite policy. It is their domino policy. That is \nexactly what it is. But they know how to make you tuck tail and run. \nNot the Senator from South Carolina. We don't run, we don't win, we are \nnot right, we are wrong a lot of times, but I have thought this out as \nthoroughly as I know how, and it worries me that here we are.\n  I said after we got into that thing in Vietnam with the Gulf of \nTonkin--I came there at that particular time, in 1966, went to Vietnam \nwhen we were under fire three times--actually over into Cambodia before \nand that kind of thing. We finally came up with McNamara writing a book \nsaying he was wrong.\n  I'll never forget, McNamara comes out to Allie Richenberg near Saint \nAlbans to get his tennis lesson at 7 o'clock, and Bob Mcnamara turned \nto Allie and said, ``Allie, what do you think about my book?'' He said, \n``It's as bad as your backhand. You should not have written it.''\n  But we had to wait 20 years for that one, and we killed 58,000 \nAmericans. Now we have killed almost 800, maimed for life thousands of \nothers. Are we going to just continue on?\n  What would the Senator from South Carolina do if I were king for a \nday? Yes, I would put the troops in to get security, and I would step \nup the election. I can tell you right now, I have run for all kind \nof offices, 20-some statewide offices and campaigns. But don't put me \nin on that temporary coalition. That fellow, El Baradei, who is running \naround the United Nations to get a temporary coalition or government to \nturn power over to on June 30--don't put me in that. I immediately have \nto repudiate the United States, that I am not a stooge for the United \nStates. We just have our fingers crossed that we can hold law and order \nso we can have an election. But don't wait until 2005, or December; by \nSeptember 30, let's get that election going.\n\n  Let's realize we are in real trouble. Saudi Arabia is in trouble. \nIsrael is in trouble. The United States is in trouble. I am going to \nstate what I believe to be the fact. In fact, I believe it very \nstrongly. They just are whistling by on account of the pressures that \nwe get politically. Nobody is willing to stand up and say what is going \non.\n  It was a mistake like Vietnam. We got misled with the Gulf of Tonkin, \nwe got misled here, and we are in that quagmire. ``Municipal guerrilla \nwar and a quagmire,'' that says George Herbert Walker Bush. I will end \non my authority--President George Herbert Walker Bush said:\n\n       Never commit U.S. troops into an unwinnable urban guerrilla \n     war and turn off the Arab world.\n\n  Look in that book of his and you will see exactly what I am talking \nabout. He is not anti-Semitic. He is sensible. He didn't go in.\n  Yes, Colin Powell, General Powell said if you are going in, let's \nhave enough troops. They tried to do it on the cheap. They were ill \nadvised. My friend Paul Wolfowitz said you will do it in 7 days. Come \non. And they let the Republican Guard back into the city of Baghdad and \ninto the Sunni triangle, and the next thing you know, when Chalabi, who \nhas now been demoted or set aside--he did away with their leadership \nand everything, so they got turned off and they buddied up with the \ninsurgents, and now we have hell on our hands. Everybody knows that.\n  So it has been ill prepared, ill advised, and ill administered. The \nentire thing is a mess. Don't give me ``support the troops, support the \ntroops.'' I have been with troops, about 3 years in combat, so don't \ntell me about troops. I have always supported the troops.\n  You ask how many Senators have gotten a Woodward Award from the U.S. \nArmy. They don't give that out lightly. I have been with every \nSecretary of Defense until this one, and I think he is brilliant, but I \nthink he has made a mistake going along with this domino policy. We \nhave it now out on the table, and we will all talk about it, and we \nwill be around and ready to debate it.\n  I appreciate the colleagues yielding to me. I wish I had all the time \nto put all these articles in.\n  I want to thank--and I am going to sit here and support my friend \nfrom Washington. She has done a magnificent job stating what the issue \nis.\n  It is simply under the auspices of an accelerated disposal plan going \naround end to reclassify--and it is around end. I had not heard \nanything about it. I have been handling everything at Savannah River \nfor 30 some years. I called up the South Carolina Department of Health \nand Environmental Control--DHEC--and they were adamantly opposed and \ngave me the brief they signed a few weeks ago adamantly opposing it, \nwith the assistant attorney general's name on it. They say this is DHEC \npolicy. I talked to two members of DHEC and they said it was never \nbrought up at their meetings. They do not know anything about it.\n  So, yes, it is a little rider for one special State that is injurious \nnot only to the State itself--I say that advisedly--but also to the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5907-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5907-S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005--Continued\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3226 To Amendment No. 3170\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I came to the floor with the \nunderstanding that we are in a moment where we haven't been able to \nmove forward legislatively as far as the schedule goes. I wanted to \ntake a few minutes of leader time to comment on a number of specific \nissues.\n\n\n          Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yesterday I spoke about the Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act. This is a critical piece of health care \nlegislation. One in five Americans today suffers from a mental illness \nevery year. Many are now denied health care they need because of legal \ndiscrimination by their health insurers. Such discrimination often \ntakes a terrible toll on people with mental illness, their families, \nand all of us.\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\n  It is estimated that not treating mental illness costs our society \n$300 billion a year. The Wellstone bill will end that discrimination \nfor all Americans. It is modest, affordable, and urgently needed.\n  I mentioned yesterday people from across America were coming to \nWashington on June 10 for a rally in support of mental health parity \nand the Wellstone bill. The famous Wellstone green bus that Paul loved \nto campaign on is coming back here for that rally.\n  It is my hope the majority leader will agree to allow the Senate to \nvote on the Wellstone bill prior to the June 10 rally. I think it would \nbe a fitting tribute to Paul, and it would make a profound difference \nfor millions of Americans who live with mental illness.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daschle pertaining to the introduction of S. 2451 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                     commemoration of memorial day\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, in the Black Hill National \nCemetery, SD, SSG Cory Brooks was laid to rest.\n  A member of the South Dakota National Guard, Sergeant Brooks died in \nIraq in late April, and his friends and family gathered to remember his \nlaughter, his joyful spirit, and his love of country.\n  Among the mourners was a man Cory Brooks had never met, Pat Red Fox.\n  Mr. Red Fox came as a representative of the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe.\n  Six months earlier, the tribe had suffered the loss of PVT Sheldon \nHawk Eagle, who died when his Black Hawk helicopter collided with \nanother above Mosul.\n  The families of Sheldon Hawk Eagle and Cory Brooks had little in \ncommon on the surface.\n  But each passed along the values of service and patriotism to their \nchildren.\n  With pride and sorrow, each said good-bye as their loved ones were \nshipped overseas. And each prayed that Sheldon and Cory would complete \ntheir mission unharmed. Today, they are bound to one another in \nmourning.\n  And so to acknowledge this bond, this sacred bond that transcends all \napparent differences, the family of Sheldon Hawk Eagle sent Pat Red Fox \nto Cory Brooks' funeral with one of the most valued gifts in the Sioux \ntradition--a star quilt bearing the colors of our Nation, and the Sioux \nsymbol representing the immortality of the soul and the connection \nbetween the living and the dead.\n  During the upcoming recess, our Nation will commemorate Memorial Day \nwith a special unity, immediacy, and poignancy.\n  As we honor those who gave their lives for their country in \ngenerations past, young American soldiers today face mortal danger.\n  As we offer thanks for the sacrifice of families who suffered the \nloss of loved ones, hundreds of American families are today mourning \nthe deaths of their children, spouses, and parents.\n  For them, the cost of war and the price of freedom is not a thing of \nmemory. It is the inescapable fact of their lives. And their pain and \nshock reverberate throughout American communities.\n  All Americans stand together in awe of the courage of our soldiers, \nand in gratitude for their sacrifice.\n  But the urgency of this Memorial Day also serves to amplify and \nclarify our understanding of America's history.\n  Within the sacrifices of today's soldiers, we see a clear reflection \nof the sacrifice of those who came before.\n  Like our soldiers today, our veterans, too, left families behind. \nThey, too, woke up to uncertain dangers. They, too, saw their friends \nfall. Yet, knowing both their risks and their responsibilities, they, \ntoo, performed their duty each day. And many gave their lives.\n  Forty years ago, President Kennedy noted that no nation ``in the \nhistory of the world has buried its soldiers farther from its native \nsoil than we Americans--or closer to the towns in which they grew up.''\n  At our proudest moments, the American people have sent our sons and \ndaughters across the globe to fight for freedom.\n  Today, the honor of defending those who cannot defend themselves is \ncarried forward by young American soldiers. But their service is \ndoubled, for in addition to offering a chance for freedom to the Iraqi \npeople, they are renewing our understanding of the cost of war, the \nprice of freedom, and the immeasurable depths of American valor.\n  Seven hundred and ninety one Americans have lost their lives in Iraq. \nAnother 122 have died in Afghanistan during the course of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  As was true in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, South \nDakotans have volunteered for service in disproportionate numbers. And \nas before, South Dakota has borne a disproportionate share of loss. \nSeven of South Dakota's sons have lost their lives in this conflict:\n  CWO Hans GOO-Keye-sen, of Lead; PFC Michael DOOL, of Nemo; CWO Scott \nSaboe, of Willow Lake; CPT Chris SOUL-zer, of Sturgis; SP Dennis \nMorgan, of Winner; PFC Sheldon Hawk Eagle, of Eagle Butte; SSG Cory \nBrooks, of Philip.\n  For them and for the hundreds more who have lost their lives in \nservice to their country, America is united in sorrow, and in debt for \ntheir sacrifice.\n  But this sorrow, and this debt, is not unique to us. In many ways, it \nhas been the central experience of each and every American generation.\n  My father was an Army sergeant in World War II. He landed on the \nbeaches of Normandy with the 6th Armored Division on ``D Plus 1''--June \n7, 1944.\n  He was injured during the landing, and, as he was recovering, one of \nhis duties was sending word back to the States of those who had died so \ntheir loved ones could be notified.\n  That experience left my father with a profound sense of respect for \nthe sacrifices that freedom sometimes demands, and he passed that \nlesson on to his four sons.\n  When I was a boy, every Memorial Day, my parents would take my \nbrothers and me to the cemetery to pay our respects to the heroes who \nlie buried there.\n  Later in life, when I was in the service, I learned the lesson in a \ndeeper way, as friends of mine lost their lives in Vietnam.\n  The men whose names my father sent home from Normandy, the men whose \nnames are carved into The Wall in Washington, and all of the other \nnoble heroes we honor gave their lives to preserve our freedom.\n  We are in their debt--today and every day. Now a new generation of \nAmericans is called to battle--in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other \nareas around the world. And once again, they are answering the call, \nand making us proud.\n  In 1868, just three years after the end of the bloodiest conflict our \nNation has ever known, General James Garfield led the first observance \nof the holiday we now know as Memorial Day.\n  Standing among the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers alike, he \nsaid:\n\n       If silence is ever golden, it must be here beside the \n     graves of fifteen thousand men whose lives were more \n     significant than speech and whose death was a poem the music \n     of which can never be sung.\n       We do not know one promise these men made, one pledge they \n     gave, one word they spoke; but we do know they summed up and \n     perfected, by one supreme act, the highest virtues of men and \n     citizens.\n       For love of country they accepted death, and thus resolved \n     all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and virtue.\n\n  No words, no ceremony could add to the honor they won in their lives.\n  So this year, with the heroism of our soldiers so radiant, we must \nacknowledge that Memorial Day is not commemorated for the sake of those \nwho gave their lives, but for our own.\n  We remember their courage because within it lie the seeds of our own \ncourage.\n  We remember their sacrifice, because it shows us both the cost, and \nthe value, of freedom.\n  Memorial Day is not merely a time to remember those who died in \nuniform, but a time for each of us to rededicate ourselves to trying in \nour own way, in our own lives, to meet the the example of patriotism \nset by all the men and women who defend our Nation.\n  It is a time to rededicate ourselves to carrying forward the legacy \nthat has been passed down from one generation to the next.\n  As with the families of Sheldon Hawk Eagle and Cory Brooks, it is a \nlegacy that binds together every American.\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\n  It transcends borders and generations and all political divisions.\n  Above all else, it is this shared legacy, and the great gifts that it \nhas conferred upon our Nation, that we reaffirm on Memorial Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Rule of Law\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the core concept which has guided this \nNation for 200 years has been the rule of law. That is why we have a \nConstitution. That is why we have a judiciary. That is why we have a \nnational legislature, to make and revise the laws which rule our \nconduct, one and all, no exceptions. Therefore, no one, not the \nmightiest in his mansion, not the lowest begger on the street, is \nabove, beneath, or outside the law.\n  If a law is outmoded, has lost its utility, if it is obsolete, it is \nnot the place of any citizen, no matter how high or how low, to decide \nit must no longer be obeyed. That decision rests only with the Congress \nor with an interpretation by the Federal courts. That is the only place \nthat decision can rest.\n  Yet I have in front of me a memorandum written in January of 2002 by \nAlberto Gonzales, the White House counsel to President Bush, telling \nthe President of the United States that the Third Geneva Convention of \n1949 is obsolete, that the War Crimes Act, which we passed in 1995 \nmaking it a felony to commit a grave breach of that Convention, is \ninapplicable, and that as a result, prisoners captured on the \nbattlefield can be questioned using means that would violate the Third \nGeneva Convention.\n  I am not talking about members of al-Qaida. The Gonzales memo \nspecifically discusses members of the Taliban. It makes an extremely \nquestionable argument that the Taliban are not prisoners of war because \nthey were not the government of a state.\n  That argument is most disturbing. In the first place, it represents \nprecisely the kind of arguments which the drafters of the Third Geneva \nConvention tried to defeat, drafters who included representatives of \nthe United States. Those drafters repeatedly expressed their concern \nthat the German Government, the Nazi government during World War II, \nused trumped-up legalisms to avoid applying the 1929 POW Convention to \ncaptured prisoners. One of those arguments was that Polish prisoners \nwere unprotected because, according to the Nazis, Poland had ceased to \nexist as a state. That is precisely why articles 4 and 5 of the current \nConvention are written in such broad language with such inclusive \npresumptions.\n  I am equally disturbed by Mr. Gonzales's argument that because the \nTaliban were generally unrecognized as a legal government, they should \nnot be afforded the protection required for soldiers of a de facto \ngovernment. What particularly bothers me about that is the statement \nissued by the White House late in 2001 that the United States \nrecognized that the Taliban was a de facto government of Afghanistan. \nYou cannot have it both ways. Did Mr. Gonzales forget that statement? \nDid he ignore it or did he just not care that it squarely contradicted \nhis memo of January 25, 2002, made just days later?\n  When he sent that memo to the President, over the objections of the \nSecretary of State, Mr. Gonzales and everyone else involved in its \ndrafting and preparation sowed a bitter harvest. They sowed the seeds \nof solitary confinement, of sensory deprivation, of physical \nmistreatment, of violations of religious right, of legal rights, of \nrights against intimidations and threats and torture--all grave \nbreaches of the Third Geneva Convention. They sowed the wind, and now \nwe are reaping their whirlwind caused by that memorandum from the legal \nrepresentative of the President of the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3170\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Graham amendment.\n  It is almost unbelievable that we are on the DOD authorization bill, \na very important bill that we need to discuss and move forward, as it \nsupports a lot of important things for our troops, and our military \nstrategy. But somehow the other side of the aisle and the Department of \nEnergy think they can sneak in language to this Defense authorization \nbill that would allow the reclassification of hazardous, high-level \nnuclear waste and basically call it incidental waste. Basically it \nwould reclassify nuclear waste that is in existing tanks in my State, \nin South Carolina, in Idaho, and in New York, and basically say that \nwaste can be covered over with cement, with sand, and could be grouted. \nBasically, it says we can take high-level nuclear waste and grout it--\ngrout it.\n  For most Americans, grout is something they see in their bathroom, \nnot something they do with nuclear waste. Yet this is what we have \nbefore us in the underlying Department of Defense authorization bill. \nIt is a shame. It is a shame that this body would allow such a \nsignificant change, really a change to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act on \nhow nuclear waste is classified in this country, without public debate, \nwithout a public vote, without a public hearing, even without \nlegislation discussing that change. Yet the other side of the aisle \nthinks they can come at 1 o'clock in the afternoon and offer an \namendment to change 30 years of policy, and that in the blink of an \neye, they are going to get a vote on changing that policy without \ndiscussion.\n  The underlying bill is flawed. As far as I am concerned, it has made \nthe whole DOD bill radioactive itself. Why do they play politics on an \nissue that is so important to our country? Why do they try to sneak \nthrough a change that ought to be debated in public in full daylight, \nwith people weighing in on what is appropriate science?\n  Mr. President, if I sound as if I am a little upset about this \nunderlying bill and the fact that it has this sneak attack language to \nreclassify high-level nuclear waste, you are right.\n  Fifty-three million gallons of nuclear waste reside at the Hanford \nnuclear reservation in the State of Washington.\n  This Senator wants to see that waste cleaned up. I do not believe \nthat can happen by pouring cement on top of it and putting sand in \nthose tanks and all of a sudden now say we have cleaned up waste. \nNowhere has that policy been promulgated as sound science.\n  This is a picture of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and one of its \nreactors in proximity to the Columbia River. My constituents in \nWashington State already know the 53 million-gallon tanks of nuclear \nwaste are leaking, and there are toxic plumes that have already gained \naccess to the Columbia River. So, yes, Washington State wants the tanks \nto be cleaned up. They want the material that has been part of the \nnuclear mission of this country removed from the tanks, the tanks \ncleaned up, the ground cleaned up, the plumes removed to the best \npossible extent, in order for us to go on with our mission and our life \nat the Hanford Reservation.\n  What we do not want is somebody to come in and say all of a sudden \nthese underground storage tanks that exist below ground should be taken \nand cement poured on top of them and that means they are cleaned up.\n  It is amazing to me because when I think about the Hanford project \nand what I think it meant to our country, these were men and women in \n1943 who started on a mission to produce a product that would help us \nwin the war. In less than 2 years, they had the world's first reactor \ngoing and they produced plutonium that provided a very valuable tool \nfor our country. Those men and women did their job.\n  Now we have been left with the aftermath of that and we should handle \nit in the same professional way those men and women did, by cleaning up \nthe waste and recognizing that these tanks are leaking and they are \ncausing hazard to the environment. The appropriate way to clean them up \nis by making sure the material is removed and that that material is \nplaced in a more permanent storage. That is exactly what science has \nbeen saying. Yet my colleagues believe that in this underlying bill, \nthe Defense authorization, it\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\nwas somehow appropriate, in a closed-door session, with no public, no \npublic testimony, no public witness to this language, no bill saying \nthey were going to put this in the DOD bill, they can now sneak through \nthis policy.\n  Well, thank God some people in America are paying attention because \nthey are starting to respond. I will share some of that with my \ncolleagues. For example, the Idaho Falls Post Register basically said \nthose on the other side are choosing the wrong side.\n  What happened in this case is the Department of Energy--maybe I \nshould stop for a second and give some of my colleagues a little \nreminder of how we got to this point, because everybody thinks \nreclassification of waste is something that belongs to the States. It \ndoes not belong to the States. It belongs in the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct that was passed in 1982. That was passed by Congress, after much \ndebate. It went through the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and \nthe EPW Committee. They had a discussion about what nuclear waste \ncleanup should be. They have the authority.\n  So when the Department of Energy recently said ``let us accelerate \nthe cleanup of waste, let us do it faster, we have an idea, instead of \nremoving all of the material from these tanks we can just pour cement \nand sand on top of it and somehow we can get this done quicker and \ncheaper''--I am sure everybody in America agrees that pouring sand \nand cement on top of the waste that is there instead of cleaning it up \nis cheaper. But no one says it is safer and no one says it satisfies \ncurrent law in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n\n  That is why when the Department of Energy tried to use an order \nbasically reclassifying waste, saying, ``let us try this accelerated \ncleanup, let us try this notion of grouting and see if it, in fact, is \nthe way we can do this.'' The courts have said the Department of Energy \ndoes not have that authority to reclassify the waste; the definition \nlies within the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and DOE was not consistent \nwith that act.\n  So what did the Department of Energy do when they lost that case? \nYes, it is on appeal. They can go through the appeal process. But \ninstead of coming to Congress and asking for public hearings on \nchanging the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, saying, ``listen, we think some \nwaste that ought to be able to be reclassified,'' they have snuck \nlanguage into the DOD authorizing bill.\n  Let me be clear again. Sneaking in language is having a closed-door \nsession, without public debate, without public scrutiny, without a \nhearing on the change in this reclassification.\n  Now all of a sudden we are presented with this bill and people think \nwe ought to move ahead without removing this radioactive language that \nis in the DOD bill, which I say has no business being here. If people \nwant to debate this policy, let us debate it in the broad daylight of a \nhearing and discuss what hazardous waste is and the changes to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act that might be appropriate.\n  I guarantee, if somebody wants to change the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, that bill would not go to the Senate Armed Services Committee. It \nwould be a policy that was debated by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and by the EPW Committee. It is not the Armed Services \nCommittee's jurisdiction to change the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. This \nunderlying bill basically will put in place language contradictory to \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  What are newspapers around America saying about this? Basically, the \nIdaho Falls Post Register says, ``if the courts are uncooperative, try \nblackmail. That is what DOE is doing by holding $350 million in cleanup \nfunds, including $95 million for Idaho's national engineering and \nenvironmental laboratory.\n  They go on to say, ``if blackmail fails, start cutting deals in \nsecret with Congress. DOE found an ally and behind closed doors in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee won a provision in the Defense \nauthorization bill that would allow DOE to reclassify the high-level \nSavannah River waste.''\n  I think they said it best when they said the view from Boise is more \naccurate, and that Kempthorne, the Governor, believes the measure \n``would wreck Idaho's position in the court by setting a precedent in \nshort order, it would undermine the State's landmark decision.''\n  It goes on to say: ``Why would you reward DOE for its heavyhandedness \nagainst the State by passing something in the committee with the \nthinnest of claims to jurisdiction? If the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nneeds revision, do so in the open. Hold hearings. Conduct them in \ngermane committees. What is going on here is not science, it is bare-\nknuckle politics.'' That is from the Idaho paper.\n  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer said a similar thing: ``The Senate \nshould halt the nuclear waste plan.'' Why? Because the bill gives the \nDOE the reclassification authority and withholds funds, and that this \nis a scheme to reclassify, hoping the States will cave in. It is not a \ngood idea.\n\n  What did the Idaho Statesman say? Well, basically in a headline that \nsaid ``State Cleanup Faces An All or All Proposition,'' it said: ``We \nexpect the Feds to clean up and move out all the highly radioactive \nliquid waste now stored in Idaho. No haggling, no shortcuts. Our \npolitical leaders need to hold firm even when politicians in other \nStates are willing to cut deals.''\n  What did the Spokesman Review in my State say? I thought the \nSpokesman Review had an interesting take. They said: ``For example, let \nus say the next step would be to persuade the affected parties and the \npublic there is scientific consensus on this matter. Without that, \nthere will be no hope of political consensus. The U.S. Department of \nEnergy believes leaving some waste behind is a good idea but is trying \nto slip this in as a seismic policy shift in the Defense authorization \nbill without comment or without congressional debate.''\n  I think these newspapers have it right. In fact, another newspaper in \nmy State, the Tacoma News Tribune, said: ``It was bad enough that the \nU.S. Department of Energy was trying to carry out illegal, quick, and \ndirty disposal of the Nation's most dangerous radioactive waste. Now a \nSenate committee is helping the Department circumvent the law.''\n  I think these newspapers are on to it. The Buffalo News, in their \neditorial, called it ``A Dangerous Game.''\n\n       The Federal Department of Energy is trying to use \n     administrative sleight of hand to avoid its responsibilities \n     in the cleanup of nuclear waste at West Valley and several \n     other sites. DOD is trying to downgrade the threat of nuclear \n     waste altered in this bill. The department argues that the \n     waste should be classified as high level based only on how it \n     originated, not on what they are. But what they are still is \n     bad. It's still radioactive and it's still a Federal \n     responsibility.\n\n  That is from the Buffalo News.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have all those editorials \nprinted in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Buffalo News, May 10, 2004]\n\n Dangerous Games--Federal Effort To Bury Nuclear Wastes at West Valley \n                           Is Unconscionable\n\n        The federal Department of Energy is trying to use \n     administrative sleight of hand to avoid its responsibility in \n     the cleanup of nuclear waste sites at West Valley and several \n     other states.\n        This contemptible effort involves downgrading the threat \n     of nuclear waste, thereby allowing the government to bury \n     that dangerous material at West Valley and other sites \n     instead of shipping it to a permanent repository as called \n     for in a 1982 law.\n        Fortunately, New York Sens. Charles E. Schumer and Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton recognized this downgrading for what it was, a \n     threat to West Valley and surrounding areas from the \n     possibility of future leakage of this radioactive material. \n     After they protested the legislation, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a \n     Republican from south Carolina who introduced the bill that \n     would have allowed the DOE to downgrade the threat of nuclear \n     wastes, altered his bill. It now will apply only to the waste \n     remediation project at Savannah River, S.C.\n        But that doesn't remove the danger. The House, essentially \n     led by Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, still has to \n     consider the DOE legislation. That cannot be a comforting \n     thought to residents living near West Valley.\n        The department argues that the wastes should be classified \n     as ``high-level'' based only on how they originated, not what \n     they are. But what they are is still bad, still radioactive \n     and still a federal responsibility.\n        Decades of expensive cleanup progress have improved safety \n     at West Valley, but the work is far from over. The \n     radioactive liquid wastes from a nuclear fuels reprocessing \n     effort have been solidified into safe glass logs, which were \n     supposed to be stored elsewhere. But the anticipated long-\n     term storage facility at Yucca Flats is years from \n     completion.\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\n     Tanks and residual wastes still remain at West Valley, and an \n     underground plume of water is contaminated with radioactive \n     strontium. Covering wastes with concrete won't help that.\n        The 600,000 gallons of West Valley wastes have their \n     counterpart in nuclear weapons production wastes at other \n     sites--53 million gallons at Hanford on the Washington-Oregon \n     border, 34 million gallons at Savannah River near Aiken, \n     S.C., and 900,000 gallons at the Idaho National Engineering \n     and Environmental Laboratory.\n        West Valley is the only site where the state shares the \n     cost of cleanup.\n        Those costs may run into the tens of billions of dollars \n     over decades, but the mess remains a federal issue. At West \n     Valley, the risk includes not only the site's land but water \n     drainage that flows into Buttermilk Creek, Cattaraugus Creek \n     and Lake Erie. Trace amounts of that radioactivity have been \n     tracked as far as Buffalo.\n        The DOE also is threatening to withhold $350 million in \n     cleanup money from military-related cleanup efforts unless it \n     gets a change in the definition of what constitutes high-\n     level waste. That bit of weaseling does the department no \n     credit. These sites were created by the federal government, \n     and the federal government should not be allowed to walk away \n     from them.\n        Acceptable cleanup at West Valley involves removal of all \n     wastes and dismantling and removal of the contaminated \n     structures that were used to process and store them. The \n     government cannot be allowed to escape that responsibility \n     through administrative trickery.\n        If the federal government truly could end a problem by \n     renaming it, we'd already be at ``mission accomplished'' in \n     Iraq.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Idaho Falls Post Register, May 19, 2004]\n\n                        Choosing the Wrong Side\n\n       Why would Idaho's two U.S. senators support the Department \n     of Energy against their own state?\n       You'll have to ask them.\n       A big vote is coming up--possibly today or tomorrow--in the \n     Senate.\n       Idaho has a lot at stake.\n       The outcome is expected to be close.\n       Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne is on the right side.\n       Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo intend to be on the wrong \n     side.\n       At issue is nearly 1 million gallons of high-level \n     radioactive wastes stored in Idaho. The Hanford nuclear site \n     in Washington has 53 million gallons. Savannah River in South \n     Carolina had 37 million gallons.\n       Federal law says that waste may be collected and stored in \n     a national repository. DOE wants to reclassify it, leave some \n     material behind and save a few bucks.\n       But it can't get a judge to go along. Last year, U.S. \n     District Judge Lynn Winmill ruled DOE couldn't do that on its \n     own. DOE appealed.\n       If the courts are uncooperative, try blackmail. DOE is \n     withholding $350 million in cleanup funds--including about \n     $95 million for the Idaho National Engineering and \n     Environmental Laboratory.\n       And if blackmail fails, start cutting deals--in secret--\n     with Congress. DOE found an ally in freshman Sen. Lindsey \n     Graham, R-S.C. Behind closed doors in the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee last week, Graham won a provision in the \n     Defense authorization Bill that would allow DOE to reclassify \n     high-level wastes at Savannah River. Another provision allows \n     DOE to continue holding cleanup funds hostage in Washington \n     and Idaho until the accede to DOE's demands.\n       Fortunately, the House version contains none of this \n     mischief. So even if the Senate goes along, there's still \n     hope a conference committee will reject it.\n       Craig and Crapo say they're willing to defer to Graham on \n     something they believe affects only his state--as long as the \n     cleanup funds are kicked loose. They also believe Graham will \n     be appreciative down the road when Idaho needs his help.\n       The view from Boise is the more accurate one, however. \n     Kempthorne believes the Graham measure could wreck Idaho's \n     position in the courts by setting a precedent. In short \n     order, it would undermine the state's landmark 1995 \n     settlement with DOE, which requires the agency to clean up \n     the INEEL and ship wastes out of the state.\n       That's not to say Idaho isn't willing to negotiate. But no \n     governor can surrender unilaterally to DOE demands without \n     unraveling the 8-year-old truce that ended the statewide \n     battle over the INEEL, its future and the waste issue that \n     has raged for more than a decade.\n       Politically, two states are weaker than three. If South \n     Carolina cuts a private deal on waste, Washington and Idaho \n     are left to fight on their own.\n       And why would you reward DOE for its heavy-handedness \n     against the states by passing something in a committee with \n     the thinnest of claims to jurisdiction? If the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act needs revision, do so in the open. Hold hearings \n     and conduct them in the germane committees--Energy or \n     Environment and Public Works.\n       What's going on there isn't science. It's bare-knuckle \n     politics.\n       So as early as today, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., will \n     offer a motion to strip Graham's language from the defense \n     bill. She has the support of Graham's colleague, Sen. Ernest \n     Hollings, D-S.C. But it's going to be close, and the Idaho \n     delegation could make the difference.\n       Does Graham may have more to offer Craig and Crapo than \n     Idaho voters?\n       Maybe. Craig is in the second year of a six-year term. \n     Crapo just got re-elected to a second term. Although the \n     election isn't until November, Idaho Democrats have forfeited \n     the race.\n       Just the same, both Idaho senators ought to reconsider.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 18, 2004]\n\n                 Senate Should Halt Nuclear Waste Plan\n\n       Senators should halt the Bush administration's Department \n     of Energy's attempts to boss everyone around on nuclear waste \n     policy and end run the federal courts. The administration's \n     bullying tactics should be met with a firm refusal to submit.\n       The DOE has a responsibility to clean up the heavily \n     contaminated radioactive waste in tanks at Hanford and \n     several other sites around the country. A federal judge \n     already has overruled the department's attempts to reclassify \n     the waste in order to save money and leave it at the sites.\n       Legitimately, Energy has filed an appeal. But is has shown \n     horrid judgment with attempts to dictate changes in federal \n     law to evade its responsibility, blackmail states into \n     accepting the waste and free itself of state controls.\n       Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has put language into a \n     defense authorization bill to give the department much of \n     what it wants. The bill would authorize reclassification of \n     the waste in his state and let DOE withhold $350 million in \n     cleanup money for Hanford and other sites until their states \n     cave in to reclassification schemes.\n       Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., is leading a fight against \n     the plan. Tank waste at Hanford threatens to pollute the \n     Columbia River. Environmental groups rightly complain about \n     rewriting the waste law in a defense bill without public \n     hearings.\n       The Senate should strip Graham's amendment from the bill. \n     The Energy Department needs to clean up nuclear waste fully, \n     not evade public accountability.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Idaho Statesman, May 11, 2004]\n\n               State Cleanup Faces All-or-All Proposition\n\n       Idaho's political leaders need to hold the Department of \n     Energy to a simple standard.\n       We expect the feds to clean up and move out all the highly \n     radioactive liquid waste now stored in Idaho. No haggling and \n     no shortcuts. Our political leaders need to hold firm even \n     when politicians in other states are willing to cut deals.\n       About 900,000 gallons of high-level radioactive waste sit \n     in underground tanks in the Eastern Idaho desert, above an \n     aquifer that provides water for many Idaho farms and \n     communities.\n       After decades of nuclear defense work in states like Idaho, \n     it's time for the Energy Department to fully clean up the \n     sites that helped produce the implements of the Cold War.\n       Unfortunately, the Energy Department has been more \n     interested in cutting corners than in cleaning up. The agency \n     wants to clean up most of the waste but leave a fraction of \n     it in the tanks, sealed with grout.\n       The Energy Department has been trying to foist off less-\n     than-clean cleanup as adequate and cost-effective. B. Lynn \n     Winmill, an Idaho federal judge, ruled last year that the DOE \n     plan violated federal law. Since then, the Energy Department \n     has pushed the idea in Congress, and it may have a taker. \n     With the help of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Energy \n     Department now has language in a defense bill limiting its \n     cleanup obligations in South Carolina, where 34 million \n     gallons of waste are stored at its Savannah River Plant.\n       The language covers only South Carolina, not Idaho. Still, \n     it could set an alarming precedent, and could put pressure on \n     Idaho's political leaders to cave to the federal government.\n       In Idaho, cleanup should be non-negotiable. Idaho has the \n     law and Winmill on its side and has in hand a binding \n     agreement with the feds mandating the tank cleanup. Then-Gov. \n     Phil Batt reached a comprehensive waste cleanup deal in 1995, \n     and Idaho voters ratified it a year later.\n       The deal gives Idaho leverage--but only if state officials \n     and the Idaho delegation hold the feds to every word of it. \n     Especially the word ``all.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Tacoma News Tribune, May 10, 2004]\n\n            Fix Energy Department, Not the Law It's Breaking\n\n        It was bad enough that the U.S. Department of Energy was \n     trying to carry out an illegal quick-and-dirty ``disposal'' \n     of some of the nation's most dangerous radioactive waste. Now \n     a U.S. Senate committee is helping the department circumvent \n     the law.\n        The law in question is the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which \n     Congress passed in 1982. Among other things, this act \n     requires the federal government to safely dispose of high-\n     level nuclear waste in a deep underground repository. The law \n     quite explicitly specifies that the radioactive byproducts of \n     plutonium creation--a category of waste all-too-abundant at \n     the Hanford Nuclear Reservation--must be buried in such a \n     repository.\n        Despite what the law says, the Energy Department has other \n     plans. Hanford's high-\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\n     level wastes are presently being stored on site in steel-\n     walled tanks, many of which have leaked dangerous \n     radioisotopes into the surrounding soils. The department does \n     intent to encase most of the wastes in these tanks in glass \n     cylinders, which will be buried. But it also wants to leave \n     significant quantities on site. Naturally, the idea is to \n     save money.\n        The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, however, doesn't say, ``Bury \n     what's convenient, and don't spend too much trying to get the \n     rest.'' It says, ``Bury it, bury it all, and bury it deep.'' \n     A federal judge in Boise last year called the Energy \n     Department on its scheme, ruling that the leave-it-in-place \n     plan would violate the law.\n        Laws, however, can be altered. That is what Sen. Linsey \n     Graham (R-S.C.) is now trying to do, so far with success. At \n     this behest, the Senate Armed Services Committee last week \n     amended a defense bill with a measure that partially exempts \n     the Energy Department from the requirement that all high-\n     level waste be sent to a repository.\n        The amendment applies only to South Carolina wastes, but \n     it's a scary precedent for this state. The Energy Department \n     has already made clear its desire for an incomplete cleanup \n     at Hanford, the nuclear contamination capital of America.\n        If Congress attempts to relax the disposal standards in \n     Washington as well, the state had better be given \n     consultation rights and veto power over whatever plan the \n     Energy Department comes up with. The department simply cannot \n     be trusted to act in the interest of Washington and its \n     environment.\n        As for Graham, his constituents in South Carolina ought to \n     be giving him an earful about the prospect of living in \n     perpetuity with the world's most lethal garbage.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Spokesman-Review.com, May 9, 2004]\n\n                     Debate Needed on Nuclear Waste\n\n        For the sake of argument, let's say leaving some lethal \n     waste buried at nuclear weapons sites is a good idea, because \n     the cost benefits outweigh the risks.\n        The next step would be to persuade affected parties and \n     the public there is a scientific consensus on the matter. \n     Without that, there would be no hope of a political \n     consensus. The U.S. Department of Energy believes that \n     leaving some waste behind is a good idea, but it is trying to \n     slip this seismic policy shift into a defense authorization \n     bill, without public comment or congressional debate.\n        Last year, DOE tried to get House-Senate conferees on an \n     already passed energy bill to accept this change. But that \n     bill has bogged down. Now it has found an opening in a bill \n     that otherwise has nothing to do with energy matters. U.S. \n     Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., is pushing the change, but \n     according to a Seattle Post-Intelligencer article, a deputy \n     assistant energy secretary is listed as ``author'' in \n     supporting documents.\n        In effects, Graham's measure would exempt DOE from the \n     1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, allowing the agency to solely \n     determine when a site has been ``cleaned.'' This is just the \n     latest DOE maneuver to shut states out of the decision-making \n     process, which is in direct conflict with the 1989 Tri-Party \n     Agreement.\n        DOE has been trying to reclassify some ``high-level'' \n     waste as ``low level'' for two years, but the states, \n     Congress and the courts have said no. A federal judge's \n     ruling sent DOE back to Congress to get the law changed. Such \n     a change would have enormous implications for sites such as \n     the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the Idaho National \n     Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, both of which are \n     near major rivers. DOE previously announced a plan that would \n     redefine as ``low level'' 53 million gallons of waste at \n     Hanford and 900,000 gallons at INEEL.\n        Idaho and Washington are against reclassifying the waste. \n     Said Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington: ``Trying to rename \n     high-level nuclear waste doesn't change the fact that it is \n     still dangerous, toxic, radioactive sludge that needs to be \n     cleaned up.''\n        Critics say another danger in allowing such waste to be \n     reclassified and permanently buried where it sits is that it \n     paves the way for the importation of any other waste DOE \n     deems to be ``low level.'' Hanford could be a dumping ground \n     for another state's waste. The National Academy of Sciences \n     has concluded that the best approach is to bury nuclear waste \n     deep underground. Since that conclusion, Yucca Mountain in \n     Nevada has been chosen as the national repository.\n        Without a scientific or political consensus, it is \n     unconscionable for DOE to seek such a major change on such an \n     important matter, especially in the absence of an open \n     debate. The agency needs to stop the repeated end-runs and \n     make a good-faith effort to involve all affected parties if \n     it sees the need for change.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, let's go back for a second to what this \nissue is as it relates to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and what the \nunderlying change in this bill does. That is the question at hand.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle hope we can get rid of \nthis issue in one afternoon--again, without public debate, without the \nscrutiny of changing the definition of highly radioactive waste. They \nthink we should just pass what is in the underlying bill. It has only \nseen the daylight because of the objections of myself and other \ncolleagues and the scrutiny of the press. That is what has gotten them \nnow to offer the amendment on the floor. The amendment on the floor is \nnot sufficient to strike the language relating to the reclassification \nof waste.\n  So what is the issue? In 1982, when we passed the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act--I wasn't here but other Members were--basically we came up \nwith a definition. We said:\n\n       Highly radioactive material resulting from the processing \n     of spent nuclear fuel, including the liquid waste produced in \n     the reprocessing. . . .\n\n  That is what this reactor did for us in World War II. It basically \nprocessed spent nuclear fuel and that liquid waste was then stored in \ntanks still at Hanford.\n\n       That the solid material derived from such waste that \n     contains fission products in sufficient concentrations. . . .\n\n  So that is what we said high-level radioactive waste was. We went on \nto add to the definition:\n\n       Highly radioactive material that the Commission says is \n     consistent with the law requires permanent isolation.\n\n  That is what we said in 1982, that the spent fuel from these reactors \nrequired permanent isolation. That is what the current law says. The \ncurrent law says spent fuel requires permanent isolation. That means \nyou have to remove it from the tanks that are there, because the tanks \nare leaking and you cannot guarantee permanent isolation.\n  So the tanks have started to be cleaned up and the process for \ncleaning them up is underway. But now the Department of Energy wants to \nsay, ``let's have a new definition of that.'' In fact, in the \nunderlying DOD bill, in section 3116, it basically says:\n\n       High-level radioactive waste does not include radioactive \n     material resulting from the processing of spent nuclear fuel.\n\n  How about that? One change in the DOD bill and billions of gallons of \nwaste in my State is no longer high-level radioactive nuclear waste. \nJust like that, changing the definition. Yes, it says the Secretary can \ndetermine whether various hurdles have been scaled, but that is \ncontradictory to the current law in the 1982 act.\n  I remind my colleagues this is an act that was passed through this \nbody after hearings, after discussion. I think the process may have \ntaken more than a year. It took more than a year to define high-level \nradioactive waste. Yet now we want to pass the DOD authorizing bill \nwith this change in it and basically say, ``let's go ahead and \nreclassify nuclear waste.''\n  I am not for reclassifying nuclear waste without a debate and a \ndiscussion and, frankly, the notion that this underlying bill would \nreclassify it in such an inappropriate fashion, to say you could \nsomehow call this grouting and that this would be a sufficient way to \ndeal with the country's nuclear waste, is incredible. It is incredible \nthat this is the scam being used on the American public just to get \nthis process in place.\n\n  Let's go through some of the history, because as I said, I think this \nis really sour grapes by the Department of Energy, which has tried to \nget this policy pushed through and has not been successful. In fact, in \n2001, basically, the Department said that they would re-create a better \ncleanup process. But, they said, we obviously have to get States to \nagree.\n  They came to us in Washington State and we said: We have an agreement \nwith you about the level of waste that is going to be cleaned up under \nthe requirements of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, so we don't really \nknow what you mean by reclassification. At that time they refused to \nsay that they meant they would clean up 99 percent, or all that was \ntechnically possible, of this waste.\n  So we in Washington State said: Listen, it doesn't sound like you \nhave a serious plan for reclassifying waste when you just want to call \nit a different name. That is not an appropriate process. In fact, \nWashington State decided not to do that.\n  Wisely enough, the Idaho court basically said DOE didn't have that \nability, they didn't have the ability to reclassify that waste. That is \nexactly why they are trying to sneak this language in today, because \nthey would like to\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\ncontinue to say that they can move ahead on a plan that, sure, would \nsave money, but who wants to save money by leaving nuclear waste in the \nground, where it is leaking into the Columbia River or the Savannah \nRiver, or other areas of the country?\n  If somebody thinks this is an issue that affects the State of \nWashington, or affects just Idaho, or affects South Carolina--it \ndoesn't. These are bodies of water, with the potential of nuclear waste \nin them, that flow through many parts of our country. To pass \nlegislation without debate on changing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is \nan incredible statement, that people are willing to override 30 years \nof law just to do that.\n  There are other issues I think we need to talk about. I am very \npleased the Governor of Idaho, Governor Kempthorne, issued a release \nsaying:\n\n       Federal legislation undermines the cleanup that was to take \n     place in Idaho, at the Idaho facility.\n\n  In fact, Governor Kempthorne has said his opposition to the \nlegislation that was passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee is \nbecause it allows the Secretary of Energy to withhold an estimated $95 \nmillion from cleanup funds, which is part of the debate we are going to \nhave on the underlying amendment. But then he goes on to say:\n\n       I recognize the need to ensure public confidence in how we \n     manage nuclear waste. This legislation would be a huge step \n     backwards, reinforcing public fears about our Nation walking \n     away from nuclear cleanup obligations. I am also concerned \n     this legislation will negatively impact DOE's compliance with \n     the 1995 court settlement case in Idaho.\n\n  I think Governor Kempthorne, who has to deal with this, just as \nGovernor Locke does in the State of Washington, has realized what a bad \ndeal this is for Idaho. He realizes the underlying language, when it \ntries to reclassify waste, is a danger.\n  I find it interesting that we will forget the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, no problem. We will write our own rule about what hazardous waste \nis. We will come up with our own definition.\n  The states of Washington, Idaho, Oregon, South Carolina, New Mexico, \nand New York filed into the court case and in their amicus brief said:\n\n       DOE cannot ignore Congress' intent . . . by simply calling \n     [high level] waste by a different name.\n\n  South Carolina joined that case. South Carolina went to the courts, \nput its name on a brief, objecting to the DOE attempt to reclassify \nhigh-level nuclear waste by issuing an order.\n  Why all of a sudden are we now going to listen to one State tell us \nthey have the right to decide they are going to keep nuclear waste in \ntheir State and they are going to call it something else? Nuclear waste \nthat reaches the Savannah River does not affect just South Carolina, \nand a definition in statute that conflicts with the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act does not just affect South Carolina; it affects everyone. \nThat is not the way to legislate, by sneaking it in without having full \npublic debate about this issue and the obligations we have for nuclear \nwaste cleanup.\n  What has the Atomic Energy Commission said? Basically, it said in \n1970 that over the life of these tanks, basically you have a problem. \nBasically, what you are saying when you assume that you will take those \nHanford tanks or Savannah River tanks or Idaho tanks or West Valley \ntanks, and you are going to leave material in them and somehow put \ncement over the top of them and everything will be okay--that is \ncounter to all the science we have had for 50 years.\n  The Atomic Energy Commission said ``over periods of centuries,''--\nguess what, that is what happens when you leave it in the tanks for a \nlong period of time; you are talking about centuries--``one cannot \nassure the continuity of surveillance and care which tank storage \nrequires.''\n  (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. CANTWELL. They are saying if you put in high-level waste, we \ncannot tell what will happen to that over a long period of time. That \nis why the decision was made to take it out and put it in a permanent \nstorage facility somewhere else, because these tanks do not have the \ncapacity.\n  The science says that once you do the grouting of this waste, \nunfortunately, your opportunity to do other things is much more \ndifficult. Once you have poured cement on the ground and solidified it, \nthe process of getting it out and retrieving it is made immensely more \ndifficult. In fact, the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research \nin 2004 said:\n\n       Grouting residual high-level waste in tanks that contain \n     significant quantities of long lived radionuclides . . . Is a \n     policy that poses considerable risk to the long-term health \n     of the water resources in the region.\n\n  This statement is from 2004. In 2004, people have said this grouting \ntechnique, which basically is storing this in the leaking position in \nunderground tanks, is a threat to the water resources of the region. \nThese tanks are not more than 7 miles from the Columbia River, not 7 \nmiles from one of the major water resources of the Pacific Northwest. \nIt already has a plume of nuclear waste that has reached the river. \nFortunately, it is at a level that we can contain today but only if we \ncontinue to clean up the tanks.\n\n  This proposal to pour cement and sand on top of it and just keep the \nwaste in the ground has not been proven as a secure way to keep the \nwaste intact and water resources clean. So what you are leaving us with \nin the Pacific Northwest--in Washington, in Oregon, in the tributaries \nfeeding in and out of the Columbia River and into the Pacific Ocean--is \nthe threat of 50 million gallons of nuclear waste not being cleaned up \nin a sufficient fashion and that waste ending up in the Columbia River. \nOr in the South Carolina, Savannah River. Governor Kempthorne said it \nright: this is a huge step backward because it reinforces the public \nfears about this process.\n  This Senator wants to have the nuclear waste cleaned up in our State. \nSome people may not understand the process, or some people listening to \nthis debate may even think this is somehow about four or five States in \nthis country. It is not about four or five States in this country and \njust about whether we will change the definition of high-level \nradioactive waste and what we will do about the definition.\n  That is what I am concerned about today in the underlying bill. This \nNation has a responsibility--as it had a responsibility in development \nof the reactors, the development of the plutonium, and the development \nof that product--this Nation has a responsibility for the cleanup of \nthose facilities. Oftentimes my colleagues forget about that \nresponsibility until it comes time to do the budget and people see the \nhuge amount of money that is spent on nuclear waste cleanup.\n  I would be the first Senator to say we have made mistakes in this \nprocess. It is mind-boggling to think prior to my coming here that at \none point in time somebody gave contracts to a company to produce \nvitrified logs, and they were not going to pay them until they made the \nvitrification work. Somewhere along the way people figured that would \nnot work, that the vitrification process was not underway and \noperating. But now we have been successful and vitrification is \nstarting to take place. That means we are taking the nuclear waste out \nof the ground and solidifying it into a glass log substance and that \nglass log substance will then go to permanent storage. So it will be in \na facility that can help store that product for an indefinite period of \ntime. That has been the plan. That is the plan on the books. That is \nthe plan of record.\n  But that is not what the DOE authorizing bill does. It says, ``no, \nlet's reclassify that waste and say that it is not high level. Let's \njust call it another name, let's call it grout and say it is okay to \nkeep in the ground, let it contaminate water, and let's keep the \nsavings from that unbelievable shortcutting of our responsibilities in \nthe cleanup process.'' I don't think that is something we want to do as \na body and government.\n  I would like to talk about how this legal process worked and why DOE \nis attempting to do this. What my colleagues seem to want to think \ntoday is that this is all about giving the State of South Carolina the \nability to negotiate with DOE what nuclear waste cleanup should be. In \nfact, as I said, in the underlying bill, instead of saying that high-\nlevel waste is something that needs to be retrieved, basically that \nspent fuel from reactors is something\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\nthat needs to be retrieved from tanks and put in permanent storage, \nbasically the DOE underlying bill says, no, high-level radioactive \nwaste resulting from fuel process can be reconsidered and considered \nfor a different kind of storage permanently in the tank. And that is \nsomething South Carolina and DOE can do together.\n  That is not what the cleanup partnership really is. The cleanup \npartnership is not about the State of South Carolina and the Federal \nDepartment of Energy interpreting the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in a new \nway by passing contradictory language.\n  Let's imagine for a second that we let the State of Michigan \ndetermine what the clean air standards are for the State of Michigan. \nLet's say that EPA and the State of Michigan decided, well, the clean \nair standards for Michigan are going to be at X level, and that somehow \nthat is OK for Michigan, but somehow we do not think that is going to \napply to the rest of the country.\n  Does anyone think that once it applies to Michigan, some other State \nis not going to say: How come you gave Michigan an exemption? They \ncontinue to pollute the air at a level that the rest of the country \ndoes not, which has a higher standard. We are talking about a recipe \nfor disaster in the courts and for predictability in the process. I \nthink it is very detrimental, where we are going with this legislation.\n  The court process that took place is now on appeal to the Ninth \nCircuit Court. We are still waiting for a decision. I think the \nappropriate thing for the Department of Energy to do, while they are \nwaiting for their decision on appeal, is to say they want to come to \nCongress and have hearings on changing radioactive waste definitions, \nthat they want to come and have a discussion about that.\n  I appreciate the fact the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, as this \nissue was discussed in the Armed Services Committee, understood the \ndangerous precedence of this language, and understood how important it \nwas to get the DOD bill done. He basically asked that they not include \nthat language in the bill.\n  Now, it was a closed-door session. I do not know what the real vote \nwas. I am sure it was a closely, hotly debated issue. But, really, what \nthey put in was section 3116, which would overturn 30 years of \ncarefully crafted laws and 50 years of scientific consensus related to \nthe cleanup of the Nation's radioactive defense waste.\n  As written, this provision--because it allows DOE to reclassify waste \nthat, as I said, for decades has been classified as high-level waste--\nbasically says the radioactive and chemical toxic components would stay \nthe same. So basically the same toxic level of waste is there, but we \nare just going to call it another name. I appreciate the fact that the \nSenator from Michigan tried to change this language and prevent it from \nbeing in the bill. Unfortunately, it is in the underlying bill before \nus.\n  The underlying bill before us also created a slush fund of $350 \nmillion. I find it intriguing. I love knowing a little bit about \nsoftware because when you share documents and you basically try to make \nchanges to documents, and you e-mail those around to everybody, you can \nlook at the text and see where the changes came from. It is very \ninteresting, this legislation was proposed by a member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. But when you check on who was really the \nauthor of the legislation, when you look at who was making the changes \nto the legislation, it was the Department of Energy.\n  The Department of Energy wrote the statute and basically submitted it \nto the committee, and tried to make it look like it was a Member's \nidea. This is coming straight from the Department of Energy, that lost \na court battle, and does not want to wait for an appeal, does not want \nto come here and fight their battle in the daylight, but wants to try \nto sneak language in a bill, in the hopes these people will blink on a \nThursday afternoon. Well, I am not prepared to have this bill move \nforward without having this discussion today about this change.\n\n  Now, what was DOE's great idea that they submitted through a member \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee? What was their wonderful idea? \nWell, besides reclassifying waste, they decided, ``well, let's create a \n$350 million slush fund that gives the Secretary of Energy the \nauthority to withdraw cleanup funds from the States of South Carolina, \nWashington, and Idaho--until they agree with our reclassification \nplan.'' Basically, it was to hold them hostage and blackmail them into \nagreeing.\n  As I said, when the State of Washington was offered this deal 2 years \nago, we said: ``We are not taking any deal unless we understand what \nyou are cleaning up and how you are cleaning it up. The fact that you \nthink you are going to reclassify and rename this is not good enough \nfor us. Let's see the details.'' When they refused to show us that they \nplanned on cutting cleaning up all this waste, we refused to accept the \ndeal. Now they are hoping they will buy off some other State.\n  If the Department of Energy really believes science is on their side, \nif it really believes this grouting technique works, if it really \nbelieves this is the process we ought to pursue, then come before the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, come before the EPW Committee, \nand debate a change to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the policy that \ndefines highly radioactive waste and how it should be cleaned up.\n  I think it is a tragedy, especially when you think about the good job \nthe people did at Hanford, the process by which these people speedily \ngot to the business of helping us in World War II, in the cold war \nyears, and providing us with help and support. They got the job done. \nThey did their job. Now it is our turn to do our job and clean this up.\n  When you are talking about 100 million gallons of highly radioactive \nwaste that is stored in 253 deteriorating tanks in all of these \nStates--as I said, at Hanford we have 53 million gallons of this tank \nwaste, about 60 percent of the whole national inventory. So 60 percent \nis in Washington State, along with other high level waste stored in the \nHanford 200-Area. That includes spent fuel and miscellaneous volumes \nthat contain high-level waste from offsite which are also buried in the \nground.\n  I am all for considering new technology and new ways to clean up \nwaste and to retrieve waste that is buried in the ground that is \nconsidered high-level waste, which may have come from other States or \nhave been basically brought to the Hanford Reservation. Some has been \ndumped on the Hanford Reservation and then has been part of the storage \nthere for some time, but that is a different issue.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act makes it very clear that spent nuclear \nfuel from reactors needs to be placed in a permanent isolated area. \nThat does not mean pouring cement in tanks and calling it incidental. \nIt is very clear about that. So we can talk about other technologies to \nclean up other kinds of waste, or we can come back and debate changing \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act. But because 67 of the 177 tanks that we \nhave in Washington State have already leaked 1 million gallons of waste \ninto the ground, that is 1 million gallons of nuclear waste, this \nSenator does not take this issue lightly.\n  DOE estimates that at Hanford, 270 billion gallons of ground water is \ncontaminated above the drinking water standards across 80 miles of this \nsite, and that plumes containing numerous toxins have reached the \nColumbia River.\n  I think we have another picture of the Hanford site. I encourage all \nmy colleagues, at some point in time, to go to the Hanford site. This \nsite is in Washington State, but this is a Federal responsibility. It \nis a Federal responsibility to clean up nuclear waste. It is not just \nthe province or jurisdiction of four or five States in the country. We \nspend budget money on this issue, and we need to get the job done.\n  You can see one scene of the Hanford reservation, which is almost as \nbig as--a third of the size--the State of Rhode Island. It is an \nimmense property. I know the senior Senator from Washington State has \njoined me, and she can tell you--because she was instrumental in \ngetting the Hanford Reach Monument created, preserving some of this as \na national monument for us. On the one hand we are preserving it as a \nnational monument and then deciding one day we are going to take high-\nlevel radioactive waste, rename it, let the plume that is already \nreaching the Columbia River to stay in the ground, and that somehow by \nputting cement\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\nand sand on it, we are all going to be OK.\n  Everybody wants to say how much cheaper that proposal is. I think \neverybody in America gets how cheap it would be to pour concrete and \nsand. What they want to know is whether it is safe, whether it is the \nright technology, whether it is going to stop the plumes or leaking \ntanks, whether you are going to change the current law first to get \nthere.\n  This is a beautiful, pristine area of our country that we can \npreserve, but only if we do the job we are responsible to do, as the \npeople who created the B reactor and created this facility were \nresponsible in doing.\n  To be irresponsible today by offering this on the DOD authorizing \nbill and thinking we are going to have a debate about it in a few short \nhours and change 30 years of law and 50 years of science is shameful. \nIt is shameful that we think we can have this kind of discussion in a \nfew hours and wrap up a decision. If people are so sure about their \nposition, then hold the public hearings and have the debate. Because \nthese tanks are leaking and one million gallons have already leaked in \nmy State. It is not something that is a tomorrow issue.\n  What about the science? Let's go back, so my colleagues are clear \nabout how we got here. Congress required DOE to clean up these sites \nand make it a priority, and they did that in that 1982 act. That act \nreflected science dating back to 1950, when the National Academy of \nSciences recognized that high-level radioactive waste, such as the \nwaste at Hanford, must remain isolated from human beings and the \nenvironment long enough for the radioactivity to decay. That is a long \nprocess.\n  That is why the Atomic Energy Commission, a precursor to the \nDepartment of Energy, also recognized something must be done to treat \nhigh-level radioactive waste in the tanks and at these DOE sites, and \nthey referred to ``over a period of centuries.'' As I said earlier, \nthis isn't a problem where you think about it for a few years or even a \ndecade. You have to come up with a solution for centuries.\n  Over a period of centuries, the Atomic Energy Commission wrote in \n1970, ``one cannot assure the continuity of surveillance of care with \nstorage tanks.'' Basically they said, you can't get it done with \nstorage tanks. So the science has not changed since then.\n  Yet there are provisions in this bill where DOE says, let's throw out \nthe science. And the provision in this bill would allow DOE to take 50 \nyears of science and leave an indeterminate amount of toxic sludge in \nthese leaky tanks and simply say: Mission accomplished. I think we have \nheard that statement before.\n  What science says is that grouting residual high-level waste in tanks \nthat contain significant quantities of long-lived radionuclides is a \npolicy that possesses considerable risk to the long-term health of the \nwater resources of the region. That is what science says.\n\n  The grouting proposal that is in this bill is a considerable risk. In \nthe State of Washington, we are very familiar with this. In Washington \nState, thank God our Department of Ecology has had strong reservations \nabout grouting and we have vocalized those. For us, because it is 50 \nmillion gallons of this highly radioactive waste, it would have to have \nbeen a plan for durability for 10,000 years. That is what you would \nhave to have. That is how radioactive the waste is.\n  What is bothersome is when people say an indeterminate amount, that \nis what DOE can decide. An indeterminate amount? The last 8 percent of \nthe waste in the tanks has 50 percent of the radioactivity. Think about \nthat. So we are saying in this underlying bill, go ahead, DOE. Leave an \nindeterminate amount in the tanks. Maybe they will say let's leave 10 \npercent. Maybe they will say, let's leave 5 percent. We know at 8 \npercent it is 50 percent of the radioactivity.\n  We think the grouting plan is something that is not the way to go. We \nset it aside in Washington State. We said that basically glassifying or \nvitrifying the waste was the way to go. That means that process of \nturning it into a glass structure so it is a solid structure and taking \nit to permanent storage was a better way to go.\n  As I said, in 2002, DOE wanted to use this accelerated initiative. We \nin Washington State had people come and talk to us about what \naccelerated cleanup was and what the schedule would be on high-level \nwaste. And we said: We want to understand how you are going to comply \nwith the agreements that are already on the table and with the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, with the triparty agreement, because this isn't the \nfirst time the Department of Energy has had debates with the State \nabout their responsibilities for cleanup.\n  I can't imagine that there is an OMB director or a DOE executive who \ndoes not come to that post and look at the numbers involved in cleanup \nand basically says: Boy, there has to be a way we can get this done \nquicker and cheaper. I am all about getting it done quicker, given that \nI have a million gallons already leaking and running into the Columbia \nRiver. I am all about quicker. But I am not about a plan that has not \nbeen verified by science, that has not had a hearing in a full \ncommittee as to this process and what it will mean.\n  Everybody gets the quick factor, but who said cleaning up nuclear \nwaste in America should be about doing it on the cheap? It is about \ndoing it the right way. As the Atomic Energy Commission said, it is \nabout keeping it out of the reach of humans for centuries.\n  Subsequently DOE has insisted upon researching new technologies for \nthe treatment of Hanford tanks, this new form of grout, cast stone, \nsteam reforming, and different forms of vitrification. In all, I think \nthere were three cases. DOE said they would still retrieve waste from \nthe tanks, but try to treat it and bury it in steel containers and \nlined trenches in the Hanford site.\n  I can tell you, even the new and improved grout was quickly rejected \nby the State of Washington and by other scientists.\n  According to the officials at the Washington State Department of \nEcology, grouting would have violated the State requirement that any \nalternative waste that was not performed at the vitrification objected \nto. And, in addition, the State found that this grouting would still \npose ground water risks and create leaching; furthermore, that this \nwould violate drinking water standards.\n  Even more interesting is the fact that the grouting was not to be \nfound more efficient. In some instances, grouting wasn't found to be \nany cheaper than other options of cleaning up the tanks. While \neverybody says that pouring cement and sand on this is a great way to \nclean up nuclear waste, most people figured out that leaking would \nstill happen and that nuclear waste would still need to be removed. \nThey figured out that it was even more expensive to remove than waste.\n  So those are the scenarios with which we are dealing. Those are the \nscenarios that have been discussed. This debate--whether we want to \nreclassify nuclear waste and call it low-level waste and say we are \ngoing to grout it--might be new to some of my colleagues in the Senate \nas to. But for the State of Washington, we already said this plan \nwasn't acceptable science, and that reclassification was something we \ndidn't think we should go along with, when DOE wasn't willing to give \nus a definition on how they were going to clean up the waste.\n  So this is very difficult because the tanks holding sludge and salt \ncake and hard heels--this would mean the waste in those tanks would not \nbe penetrated to remove and segregate the radionuclides. The hazardous \nmaterial would not be separated out and removed. It means those tanks \nwould not be thoroughly mixed without the right level of product. \nBasically, what they found is that grout, as engineered, is not an \noption that protects human health and the environment for such a \nsignificant portion of tank waste, when we don't know the definition, \nbecause it is an indeterminate amount of tank waste.\n  As I said, even the last 8 percent of tank waste includes 50 percent \nof the radioactivity. How do you know, by using this grouting process, \nthat you have successfully rendered this a nonhazardous substance? So \ngrout as an in-tank treatment for significant waste volume will be, as \nI said, probably more expensive than other routes when we find out that \nit is not successful.\n  The best science says is don't hold States hostage by reclassifying \nwaste\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\nand telling them we are not going to give them money for cleanup unless \nthey agree to our definition. This definition is something that the \nDepartment of Energy thinks they can come up with on their own. But the \ncourts have determined that DOE doesn't have that authority.\n  The courts have not sided in DOE's favor. The courts have not said \ndon't go ahead with cleanup. They didn't say you cannot move forward on \ncleaning up the tanks. The courts said: DOE cannot move forward on its \nplan of reclassifying waste and saying that it is a grout process and \nthat is going to work. It says you cannot move forward on that.\n  So back to the underlying bill and what happened in the Defense \nauthorization bill. There was an amendment that would enable the \nDepartment of Energy to exempt an intermediate amount of highly \nradioactive waste from regulation as high-level radioactive waste.\n  I am reading from legal counsel's interpretation of this underlying \nprovision in the DOD bill. This interpretation says the amendment would \nallow the Department of Energy to continue to store waste long thought \ndestined for deep geologic repository in existing storage tanks or send \nthem to waste isolation pile-up plants or low-level radioactive waste \nburial sites. It also would exempt the Department's handling of those \nwastes from the license and regulation by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. It will, in short, overturn the fundamental \nlegal principles that have governed the disposal of these wastes for \nthe past 30 years.\n\n  This legal briefing goes on to point out--which I think is very \nimportant--that for nearly half a century, when the DOE and its \npredecessors made plutonium for their nuclear weapons, they did so by \nirradiating uranium fuel, transforming it into plutonium, and \nreprocessing the spent fuel, as I showed in the picture with the \nreactor. And that became high-level radioactive waste. This is the term \ngiven to the plutonium spent fuel from the reactors was high-level \nwaste.\n  So what did the Nuclear Waste Policy Act say? In 1981, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act said: Let's establish a comprehensive program for the \ndisposal of this spent nuclear fuel, and put it in deep geologic \nrepositories licensed by the Commission.\n  So let me be clear about this point, because I am sure we will hear \nabout this in the debate. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was given \nthe responsibility of the deep geological repository license procedure. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission was not given the responsibility for \nthese low-level tanks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was not given \nthe responsibility to interpret this change in the DOD bill as it \nrelates to whether this is a cleanup plan and whether they can license \nit because that is not their responsibility. Their responsibility, as \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is on Yucca Mountain and the deep \ngeological solution. That is what their responsibility is.\n  The act directed the President to decide whether high-level \nradioactive defense waste should be disposed of in the same repository \nas civilian waste, or in a separate repository. So in 1985, President \nReagan decided this defense waste should be put in the same repository \nas civilian waste.\n  The 1982 act defines high-level radioactive waste. We had a decision \nby the President in 1985 that military waste should be treated as \ncivilian waste, and that the civilian waste should be put in the same \nspot.\n  So that is the plan we have been on. Now, I have had some concerns \nabout how much waste you are actually going to take out of Hanford \nbecause, I tell you what, I want more than 17 percent of the waste \ntaken from Hanford to go to Yucca Mountain. I want it cleaned up and I \nwant it in a permanent place.\n  I don't want grouting and I don't want to have plumes continuing to \nleak. But that was the decision made in 1985, and the President made \nthat decision. They said, let's vitrify this waste, glassify it, take \nit out of the tanks, turn it into glass logs, and take that to a site \nfor permanent storage, wherever that site is.\n  The plan, since 1985, has not been to pour cement and sand and create \ngrout leaving some percentage, some indeterminate amount of waste in \ntanks.\n  I cannot emphasize how important it is if DOE believes in this \nphilosophy, this science, if DOE thinks this is the successful course \nof discussion that should happen with spent nuclear fuel, then come to \nthe broad daylight of a Senate hearing and make their case and put that \nbefore the appropriate Senate committees. If they are so proud of their \nscience and the standing of their decision, they should have no problem \ndoing that. As Governor Kempthorne of Idaho said, when you don't end up \nachieving public consensus, you don't do anybody any favors.\n\n  The issue is the Department of Energy knows all too well, because \nthese States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and South Carolina \nchallenged the Department of Energy in court, that these States do not \nbelieve this order or plan for reclassifying waste is sound science. \nThey do not believe it is sound science. That is why they challenged it \nin court.\n  I know the Department of Energy knows they cannot waltz into the \nSenate hearing rooms and make their case without hearing the critiques \nof the experts who have been dealing with this issue for years and \nyears. And by ``the experts,'' I mean not only the scientists, but the \npeople who have to live with the economic and health consequences of \nhaving a million gallons of nuclear waste leak into the ground and make \nits way to the Columbia River. Those people are paying attention, and \nthey are paying attention to the fact that this science is not standing \nthe test of daylight and scrutiny. If it were, they would be here \ndebating it.\n  I am saying to them now, this Senator, and I am sure members of other \ncommittees, welcomes the opportunity to understand this technology, to \nunderstand this new process, to understand exactly how taking some \nlevel of spent fuel from these reactors in these underground tanks and \nsomehow pouring a grouting material on them is going to make for a \nsuccessful cleanup effort.\n  I am sure my colleagues would love to hear if it actually saves \nbillions of dollars and can be safe and sound science. But if that is \nthe case, then we should not be in a rush today. After the courts have \nalready said DOE does not have the authority to change this policy \nwithout the approval of Congress, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, my \ncolleagues should not be in a hurry to pass this legislation that \nbasically says in a contradictory form: Go ahead, DOE Secretary, \nreclassify the waste because nuclear waste from spent fuel does not \nhave to be classified as highly radioactive.\n  The definition of highly radioactive waste that is used in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act was initially modeled after the definition \nfound in the West Valley demonstration project. That is a commercial \nsite in New York. I am again reading from the legal opinion Energy \ncounsel has provided to us.\n  It basically said waste produced by reprocessing of spent fuel, that \nit included both liquid waste and that waste directly from reprocessing \nand dry solid material derived from that solid waste.\n  In addition, it gave the Nuclear Regulatory Commission the authority \nto include other waste in the definition of such material. \nSignificantly, West Valley gave the Commission power to add material \nother than reprocessing waste to the definition, but not to exempt any \npart of the processing of waste.\n  We have had this debate, and I know the Department of Energy objected \nto the definition. I know they wanted the regulatory agencies to be \nable to exclude material from high-level radioactive waste. I know that \nis what they wanted. But Congress rewrote the definition, not as the \nDepartment asked, but, as enacted, the final definition provides, as I \nsaid earlier, high-level radioactive waste means material from \nreprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, and that other radioactive material \nthat the Commission, consistent with existing law, determines requires \npermanent isolation.\n\n  That is the process by which we, as the legislative branch, have \ngotten to the point of making decisions about this incredible product \nthat was made by men and women throughout our country in the 1940s. It \nwas a time of great military need, during World War II and the cold \nwar. And they did their job, as the federal government had asked.\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\n  Now we are saying we are going to ignore the definitions and the \nprocess and not really have a hearing on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nor the fact that the DOE has already been turned down in the courts in \nits ability to reclassify that waste.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Washington \nwill allow me a moment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Pardon?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I do not have a question. I wanted to know how much \nlonger the Senator from Washington will take because we have Members in \nthe Chamber who would like to speak. They have schedules and would like \nto get some feel of when their opportunity may come up to speak.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Washington how much \nlonger she anticipates taking to complete her remarks.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have some more material on the history \nof the process. I see 2 of my colleagues in the Chamber who are also \nvery concerned about this issue, but I imagine at least another half \nhour or so longer, maybe more.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for that guidance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator from Washington have a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would hope we could go back and forth. I think that is \nthe way the debate has been going. The next Senator I will call on is \nSenator Inhofe, and then whoever on your side.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I obviously want my colleagues to join in the debate on \nthis issue, but the reason this Senator feels so strongly about this \nprocess is because I do believe this measure does not belong on the \nDefense authorization bill. We have a very important piece of \nlegislation that needs to move through the process, and yet we have an \nentity the courts have turned down, that believes that States have \nturned them down, that believes this is a controversial issue, and \nthinks they ought to sneak it in on a DOD bill and that is a way to do \nlegislation. It is not the way to do legislation.\n  This is the only opportunity we have to expose the fact this \nlegislation has been drafted this way and the unbelievable effect it \nhas on so many people in this country when the Department of Energy can \nauthor legislation and give it to a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee who then offers it in a mark-up in private and includes it in \nthe legislation.\n  I am going to take a little more time to go over these facts because \nI think the bright light of day needs to shine on the fact the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982 ought to have the attention of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and ought to have the attention of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and not be proposed on the \nDefense authorization bill without the scrutiny of public debate and \nforesight that such a huge, significant change in policy would bring \nabout.\n  This is why I am going to take as much time as necessary to explain \nthis policy and to say to the members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that while any member has the ability to offer any amendment \nthey want, including in an authorizing bill, usually it is the other \nway around. We have authorizing on appropriations and issues of that \nnature that have caused----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I remind the Senator from Washington, if she is concerned \nabout the action that we had proposed with the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I chair that committee and I am waiting to be heard \nconcerning this issue because I also have a lot of interest in it. I \nappreciate the fact that the Senator is suggesting our jurisdiction \nshould be heard, and that is what I am waiting to do.\n  Will the Senator agree with that?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for his question. The issue is that \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee should never have voted and \nconsidered this legislation in a closed door session without those \nhearings. So I certainly want the Member to be heard but--I think I \nhave the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield the floor for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I think I have the floor, Mr. President, and I will \nyield in a moment for another question.\n  The issue is that we have been trying to work with the author of this \nlegislation on a compromise that would promote a dialog and a hearing. \nMy staff has been working diligently since the language came out of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  This morning we learned without warning, without notice, that perhaps \nnow they did not want to continue discussion on that, they did not want \nto continue discussion on how we brought this issue to light.\n  I really did not want to spend the afternoon on the Senate floor. We \nhad hoped we would actually propose a better process and procedure, but \nothers want to move forward on changing the underlying bill, which in \nthis amendment is still flawed. The proposed amendment by Senator \nGraham of South Carolina makes a bad situation slightly better but does \nnot correct the underlying problem. And this Senator whose home state \nhas one million gallons of nuclear waste flowing to the Columbia \nRiver--is going to be heard on the details of this proposal.\n  The fact that we have not had a full public hearing on a significant \nchange in 30 years of policy and 50 years of science is something that, \nif it takes me 5 hours to explain, I will take it. I will take the 5 \nhours to explain to my colleague the significance of these changes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. May I most respectfully explain that \nunder the Senate rules of allocation of committee responsibilities, \nthis issue of the nuclear waste is directly within the purview of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. We control, through oversight, 70 \npercent of the budget of the Department of Energy. The cost of nuclear \nwaste cleanup comes before our committee. So I want to say to my \ndistinguished colleague, while she may have concerns about the \nlegislative process as a whole, there is no doubt about the \njurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee over this subject.\n  We have put in our bill, which is now at the desk and the subject of \ndebate, the specific provisions the Senator is addressing. \nJurisdictionally we had the perfect right to incorporate in our bill \nsuch legislative language we deemed as a committee necessary for \ndealing with this question of this specific type of nuclear waste. I \nwas not certain that the distinguished Senator was aware that clearly \nthis is in the jurisdiction of this committee.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for his question, but under rule \nXXV, the Armed Services Committee has jurisdiction over national \nsecurity aspects of nuclear energy, the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee has jurisdiction over nonmilitary development of nuclear \nenergy, and the EPW Committee has jurisdiction over the nonmilitary \nenvironmental regulation and control of nuclear energy.\n  Undoubtedly SASC has jurisdiction over the reprocessing that created \nthe tanks to begin with because DOE was responsible for the national \nsecurity, but I do not see how anyone could seriously argue how the \nwaste, disposal, and cleanup of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is a part \nof the national security aspect of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee's jurisdiction.\n  While I am more than happy that the committee has used this authority \nto bring this issue up, I think the committee is doing an injustice to \nsay to our colleagues that a change that is in contradiction to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act ought to be passed by the committee without \nhearing, without debate, without full scrutiny of public daylight. This \nprovision would really contradict 30 years of law on the books when the \nagency promulgating that rule change lost a court battle basically \ntelling it it does not have the authority to redefine high-level \nnuclear waste.\n  I fully respect, because of all the committees that I work with, I \nknow that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee always strives \nto be fair and balanced at his hearings. And\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\nthere are difficult challenges that we have had over many sensitive \nsubjects in the last several weeks. The chairman has gone way out of \nhis way to make sure the continuity of that committee works well and \nthat the rules and processes are followed. But I say to the chairman \nthat if the Department of Energy is so sure about these statutory \nchanges they are promulgating through his committee without debate, \nthen they ought to be willing to have the hearings and have the debates \nwith the other committees that have jurisdiction for the cleanup, not \nthe national security efforts the Senator was responsible for as the \nchairman of that committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could reply, without the Senator \nlosing her right to the floor, I will shortly bring the President's \nbudget request for funds. I will bring appropriations acts and I will \nshow the Senator the direct linkage of the request for funds coming to \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Armed Services Committee bill going \nto the Appropriations Committee, and action by the Appropriations \nCommittee on the authorizations of expenditure of the funds for nuclear \nwaste and cleanup. It is irrefutable, and I will take a little time to \ngo out and get the documentation. Then I will ask unanimous consent to \nprint that documentation in the Record.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the chairman again for his statement. I point \nout to him that the difference between authorizing for appropriations \nand oversight of policy, and what I am debating is that the committee's \noversight over nuclear waste cleanup policy as set out in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. When that was passed in 1982 and moved through the \nlegislative branch and made its way through the debates, it was debated \nin the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and EPW Committee. As the \nparliamentarian referred to those committees, I am sure that the SASC, \nbecause of its nature of the appropriated funds, has some \nresponsibilities. But I do not think that the SASC is the committee of \njurisdiction for changing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. I do not think \nthat is the primary responsibility of that committee.\n  So, I don't know. I say to the Senator, the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I have a great deal of respect for his \nwillingness at all times in the most difficult of situations to try to \nhave consideration of issues be as fair and balanced as possible, and \nto give Members their opportunity. I am happy to continue to discuss \nwith him the nuances of this particular issue. But I have a feeling \nthat if we had this Nuclear Waste Policy Act before us today and we \nasked the Parliamentarian--this change that is in your bill, under a \nseparate act, under a separate stand-alone bill--it would not be \nreferred to that committee. It would be referred jointly to those other \ncommittees and maybe to SASC in the authorizing of an appropriation, \nbut not for the policy change.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will reply later today with the \ndocuments in hand.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I think there are several other people \nhere.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator respond to a question from the Senator?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend from Washington, having spoken with \nher, it is my understanding the Senator has said publicly that if we \ncame back after the break, the Senator would be willing to look very \nclosely at the amendment pending and would be willing to offer one of \nher own, that she would agree to a time certain on that amendment. Is \nthat true?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I simply want the issue to have the appropriate amount \nof debate and dialog. All of us will have the opportunity to vote up or \ndown on any of the amendments anybody wants to offer to this section. \nBut the question before us was, all of a sudden at 11:30 today, without \nnotice, when we had been in negotiations on this language, to bring it \nto the floor, this Senator feels obligated to make sure this time \nperiod is used to bring committee members and colleagues up to speed \nabout the contents of the underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my further understanding the Senator, who has spoken \nfor some time now, has a lot more to say, is that right, on this \namendment, on this date? She has only gotten warmed up; is that right?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And you, as a matter of courtesy, will allow Senators \nHollings and Murray and anyone on the majority side to speak and you \nwill be back at a later time for another round or two; is that correct?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. That is correct. I will give my colleagues from \nWashington and South Carolina an opportunity to join in this debate and \nparticipate because I think it is very important that this issue \nreceive the full attention of Members. As I said at the beginning of \nthis discussion, I do not believe this is an issue--even though a lot \nof my colleagues would like to classify it as an issue that only \naffects Washington State, South Carolina, or Idaho perhaps with some \nimpact on Oregon and maybe Georgia, or New York in its commercial \nfacility. I have never thought of this nuclear waste issue as a \ngeographic-specific debate.\n  Our responsibility as a body is to make sure nuclear waste cleanup \nhappens in a process that the science determines will not be with harm \nto humans or to the environment. We now have a proposal before us that \nscience says will be harmful, that is not based on sound science, that \nhas not met the test, nor has our approval.\n  While I am willing to have this debate, I hope my colleagues will use \nthis debate as an opportunity to understand our challenge on nuclear \nwaste cleanup and the tremendous amount of resources that are spent by \nour Government on that cleanup and the efficiencies that need to happen \nto make that process go more smoothly than it has in the past.\n\n  But I can guarantee to my colleagues that wanting that process to go \nmore smoothly in the future, and wanting it to be more cost effective, \ndoes not simply mean coming up with a short-term proposal, a fix that \nis counter to what existing statute and law is. If we want to have that \ndebate, let's go through the normal committees and have that debate, \nand let's have the scientists come in and discuss it with us, and let's \nnot end up with a process where we are going to be battling in the \ncourts. I don't think that does any of us any good. Certainly, for us \nin the State of Washington, with a 1-million-gallon plume heading \ntoward the Columbia River, it doesn't do us any good.\n  I hope my colleagues will use this opportunity to focus attention not \njust on the question at hand, of high-level radioactive waste, but I \nwould say the consistency by which the States of Washington, Oregon, \nIdaho, South Carolina, and others have banded together in the last year \nor two in authorizing and appropriations language that has done a good \njob to make sure the processing of radioactive waste is completed.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is the first time I think the Department \nof Energy has successfully picked off a State. At first the underlying \nlanguage was actually blackmail: We are going to make this change and \nnuclear waste is going to be reclassified, and if you are going to \nagree with us, we will give you some money, and if you don't agree with \nus, we are not cleaning up your waste. That is blackmail. That is what \nthe current language in the DOD authorizing bill is. It is blackmail.\n  Now, after my colleagues have seen what ludicrous language that is, \nSenator Graham wants to offer an amendment that will not tie up the \nfunds. But we still remain with the underlying problem, which is the \nDepartment of Energy is trying to reclassify highly radioactive waste \nas low-level ancillary waste and say it can be grouted, that is that \ncement and sand can be poured on it and somehow, leaving incidental \namount of tank waste is a sufficient way to clean up tanks.\n  I will continue to fight on this issue until Members understand the \nsignificant policy change that is before this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent after the remarks of Senator Inhofe that \nSenators Murray, Allard, and Hollings be recognized, and that I \nimmediately be recognized after them.\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nWashington has the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I want to accommodate the Senator from Nevada. I was \nproposing to accommodate and trade off recognition of the four Members \nwho are present on the floor?\n  Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. REID. When the Senator yields the floor, I will speak.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from Nevada--I am happy to yield the floor \nto the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Pardon me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding the floor?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator from Nevada have a question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Chair. I have a question on \nthat statement. The Senator from Washington has a right to speak, but \nwe are not going to set a long list of speakers here at random, what \nspeakers are going to speak. I think what we are going to do, we have a \nnumber of speakers on the floor, Senators Inhofe, Hollings, Allard, \nMurray--people who have been here for a long period of time.\n  It appears to me we are not going to have a vote on this in the near \nfuture. I suggest what we do is enter into agreement for the next \nseveral however long it takes. We have people who want to speak. We can \ngo forward and whoever gets the jump ball, have people be recognized \nwhenever they get the floor.\n  Senator Hollings has said Senator Inhofe has been here longer than he \nhas. Senator Inhofe could be recognized for whatever time he feels \nappropriate. I would like to get some idea of what the time should be. \nThen, Senator Hollings, I think that would be the best way to go.\n  But in the meantime, it must be under some agreement, whoever gets \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from Washington is happy to entertain a \nquestion that would allow the various Members who are here----\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Washington has to understand--she has the \nfloor, and if she wants to keep talking, let her keep talking. When she \nfinishes, we will be happy to----\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator from Washington will yield, I would like \nto pose a plan of how we can go through this. I suggest that maybe we \ncan sit down with leadership and work out some time for debate. I know \nSenator Graham on this side of the Senate floor would like to wrap up \nthis debate. Maybe we can get some time limits to give everybody an \nopportunity to speak. I know there is some interest in having some \nvotes tonight. I believe I need to work with leadership on this side, \nif Senator Reid will work with leadership on his side, to determine if \nwe can work this out. The Senator from Washington can finish, and I can \ncall on the Senator from Oklahoma. Maybe we can sit down and work out a \ntime agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Let me say this: Everyone should understand that there is not going \nto be a vote on this amendment tonight. Everyone should understand \nthat. There is going to be no vote on the pending amendment tonight. I \ntold people that 5 hours ago. No one believed me. There is not going to \nbe a vote on the Graham amendment tonight.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Nobody is calling for a vote on this amendment tonight, \nbut there might be other votes.\n  Mr. REID. We will not agree to set this one side. If the Senator from \nSouth Carolina wishes to withdraw his amendment and set some orderly \nprocedure to take it up when we get back after the Memorial Day break, \nwe are in agreement. But we are not going to agree to set this aside to \ngo to another amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this Senator is happy to yield the floor \nto my colleague to discuss this issue. I want to make it clear that \nafter 30 years of standard policy, they are not willing to just have a \nfew hours of debate and then vote on this significant a change. The \nunderlying Graham amendment does not fix the underlying DOD committee-\npassed authorization language that allows the Department of Energy to \nreclassify waste.\n  That is the key issue at hand. We do not want to leave this bill with \nthis reclassification of highly radioactive waste to an amendment on \nspent fuel storage tanks to then be grouted over. We need to have the \nattention of this body, my colleagues who are members of the various \ncommittees I mentioned and my colleagues from those States directly \naffected, although I said it is a policy everybody should be \ndiscussing, and the public needs to have an idea and an opportunity to \nunderstand that this is a major policy proposal which is being proposed \nin this underlying bill.\n  I would have preferred that the Graham amendment not be brought up \ntoday, not to this particular issue of the DOD bill being discussed. We \nare still talking. We hoped we might able to work something out and \nsave our colleagues the time and attention of studying a nuclear waste \npolicy proposal and what level of radioactivity could be sufficiently \nremoved from tanks and what couldn't be. But if my colleagues want to \ncontinue to pursue the subject, we are going to continue to pursue and \ndiscuss this issue.\n  With that, I know various Members of both sides of the aisle are \nwaiting, and I will have more to say on this subject as we continue to \ndebate the DOD authorizing bill and continue to debate whether the \nGraham amendment is sufficient in disposing of the problem that has now \nbeen created in the underlying bill in overriding 30 years of law and \nscience about how this country should clean up nuclear waste. I don't \nbelieve anybody in America wants to do it on the cheap. We need to give \nthe American public the certainty that this body will not propose major \npolicy changes without hearings, without debate, without committees of \njurisdiction having oversight of this policy proposal that is in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to work out, subject to the \napproval of the majority leader, to allow Senator Inhofe to speak for \n15 minutes and Senator Hollings for 45 minutes. They have waited a long \ntime. Senator Allard, being the gentleman he is, did want to talk about \nthe subsequent votes; there are a couple of judges who need votes. We \nhave 25 to do before the end of June, so we have a lot of voting to do. \nThen, of course, everyone should understand that we will be right back \non the Defense bill following those votes.\n  We appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Oklahoma for being \npatient and the Senator from South Carolina. The order has not been \nentered, but that is what we will order. It would be appropriate for \nthe Senator from Oklahoma to start his speech.\n  Members should understand that we will have a couple of votes around \n5:30.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the manager if I could have 20 minutes, but I will \nprobably not take that long. I am saving the best for last and I don't \nwant to miss it.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I amend that and ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma be allowed to speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will clarify a couple of things that \nwere said by the distinguished Senator from Washington that I am sure \nshe believes are true but need to be elaborated upon. First, \ncharacterizing the consideration of going back to the old policy as \nsomething that happened in the middle of the night, something that \nhappened in the dark, something that\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\nhappened in a less than honest way is not at all accurate.\n  I suggest two things. First, I chaired the Subcommittee on Clean Air, \nWetlands, Private Property and Nuclear Safety of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee in 1998 and 1999. During that time, of course, \nwe had jurisdiction over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During that \ntime, they had countless hearings. They had comment periods. They \ntalked about this out in the open, with people given an opportunity to \nbe heard. I happened to be chairing the committee that had oversight at \nthe time. I remember that very well.\n  Second, I suggest this was discussed in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. It certainly was not something that was done in any way that \nwas less than totally honest and totally done in the daylight. By \nsuggesting that Senator Joe Lieberman and Senator Jack Reed and the \nother Members on this side of the issue did something that was not out \nin the open, I don't think is quite fair.\n  We had a hearing this morning with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nIt is an oversight hearing we have had ever since 1998. That is when, \nin the NRC, I believe we saw a major change. They have done a good job. \nThe NRC says we should manage waste based on the risk it poses, not how \nit is defined.\n  The Department of Energy was attempting to pursue this very policy \nwhen it was stopped in its tracks. What stopped it? Several of my \ncolleagues already mentioned a lawsuit was brought against the DOE by \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council. This is the allegedly charitable \norganization that uses a substantial amount of taxpayer dollars in the \nform of discretionary grants to achieve its goals.\n  Three weeks ago I spoke in the Senate about the spurious and \nmisleading advertisement run by the NRDC. This organization places a \nhigher priority on imposing ridiculously stringent environmental \nstandards than on essential elements of national security. They have \nproven this many times in the past by filing lawsuits to limit the Navy \nreadiness exercises and otherwise hampering our military. Now the NRDC \nhas hamstrung the Department of Energy in the faithful execution of its \nresponsibilities.\n  This amendment allows the DOE to pursue the best plan to dispose of \nthis nuclear material. That plan saves our taxpayers money. It shortens \nthe amount of time the waste remains in the tanks. It is a safe way to \ndo it. It is a well-thought-out way of doing it and one that has been \nthe subject of a lot of daylight. It is merely going back to a policy \nthat has worked for a long period of time.\n  We know the background. Sometimes it is necessary to repeat it. \nDuring the cold war, the national security of the United States \nnecessitated the building of nuclear weapons. Now, 50 years later, we \nare faced with the legacy of this effort and the need to clean up the \nsites where there is waste from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. \nThe creation of this waste was a necessary result of the chemical \nprocesses needed to make defense nuclear material. We all understand \nthat.\n  Last summer, this very important cleanup effort, which is the single \nlargest ongoing environmental risk reduction project for the Department \nof Energy, took a crushing blow when the district court issued a ruling \nthat created significantly illegal uncertainties and enormous problems \nfor the Department's tank waste cleanup at the Savannah River site, the \nWest Valley, the Hanford site, and the Idaho National Engineer \nEnvironmental Laboratory. Unless these legal uncertainties are \nresolved, the only path the Department of Energy could in theory pursue \nthat does have the necessary legal certainty would be to involve \nsending all the waste in tanks and the tanks themselves to Yucca \nMountain no matter how long or short lived is the radioactivity they \ncontain.\n  This dramatic change in course would increase the costs of the \ncleanup itself in terms of human lives sevenfold and also delay \ncompletion of simply emptying the tanks and treating the waste there by \nfour decades, thereby further substantially increasing the risk, as the \nNRC pointed out, to the public health and safety during the time period \nby leaving the waste in tanks for that much longer. It would also \nincrease the cost of simply emptying and treating the tank waste, \naccording to the DOE estimates, by an additional $86 billion, only $1 \nbillion less than last year's supplemental appropriation for the Iraq \nwar, for approximately a total cost of $138 billion.\n  We are talking about something really big. The estimates for delay \nand the additional costs do not take into account the very complex \nlogistics of transporting and disposing of all the additional waste at \nYucca Mountain or the complex logistics of preparing for disposal, \ntransporting, and disposing of the tanks themselves. Keep in mind, it \nis not just what is in the tanks. The tanks themselves would have to go \nthere and be disposed of at the Yucca Mountain facility. These would \nalso add additional decades and tens, if not hundreds, of billions of \ndollars to the cleanup cost.\n\n  Furthermore, under this scenario, the number of canisters of waste \nthat would be transported to Yucca Mountain would increase from 20,000 \ncanisters to approximately 200,000 canisters.\n  I know there are a lot of members in the Senate concerned about the \ntransport of waste to Yucca Mountain. That would increase it tenfold. \nSome have asked, why not just authorize and appropriate $350 million \nneeded for the cleanup activities in fiscal year 2005 and force the \nDepartment of Energy to continue its work? This is not a responsible \npath. If the Department of Energy constructs the facility necessary to \nprepare waste for disposal as low-level or transuranic waste and \nprepare the waste for disposal and then finds out after the fact that \nit lacked the legal authority to classify the waste in this manner, \nhundreds of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money would already \nhave been wasted and years of cleanup work lost. The Department may \nhave actually made it harder to put the waste in the form needed to \ndispose of it at Yucca Mountain.\n  The fundamental root cause of the dilemma that faces our Nation today \nis the ambiguity presented by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act's definition \nof high-level waste and that, if left unclassified, is producing this \ntechnologically irrational result without environmental benefit that, \nin fact, increases health and safety risks.\n  It is up to this committee and this Congress to resolve ambiguity in \norder for the cleanup of the sites which played such a key role in the \nnational security of our Nation. The language before the Senate \nclarifies the ambiguity, and I urge adoption of this language.\n  What had happened on this, back in the time it was considered in SAS \nCommittee--the Senate Armed Services Committee--was that it was an \namendment to actually go back and do it as it had been done before, to \ndo it in the best way, as determined by the multitude of hearings that \nwere conducted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and which were \nconducted during the time I chaired the oversight committee. So we were \nthere. We knew it was taking place.\n  The thing that I guess bothers me the most--I see the ranking \nminority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Senate \nfloor. We acted very responsibly. This was not a partisan issue. This \nwas a bipartisan issue. To infer in any way that things were done in \nthe dark of night or in any way inappropriately is to say that I and \nseveral others--certainly the chairman of the committee; certainly \nSenator Joe Lieberman; certainly Senator Jack Reed, who supported this \neffort and supported the Senator from South Carolina--were acting \ninappropriately. I do not think that is realistic.\n  By the way, it has been said several times that there is some doubt \nas to what the NRC's position is on this issue. I will read the last \nparagraph of a letter that was sent to me, on May 18, as chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. This last paragraph says:\n\n       It is our understanding that some opponents of DOE's \n     proposed plans believe that the tanks and the waste residuals \n     should be disposed of as high-level waste in a geologic \n     repository. While either approach could potentially be \n     implemented within NRC regulatory requirements, we note that \n     removal of the tanks, packaging of the tanks and residuals \n     for transport and disposal, and disposal of the waste at a \n     geologic repository, if feasible, would incur significant \n     additional worker exposures--\n\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\n\n  That is human lives. We are exposing individuals.\n\n     and transportation exposures--\n\n  The transportation exposures we have talked about on this floor many, \nmany times--\n\n     at very large financial costs.\n\n  You might conclude that, at this time, with all the terrorist threats \naround, these could become prime targets while being transported. Still \nquoting the letter:\n\n       Whereas, if DOE's proposed plans meet appropriate criteria, \n     such as those used in NRC's previous reviews, then the NRC \n     believes that public health and safety can be maintained \n     while avoiding unnecessary additional exposures and risks \n     associated with removal and transport of the waste and \n     unnecessary additional expenditures of Federal funds.\n       I hope this letter satisfactorily addresses your questions.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from \nthe NRC to me dated May 18 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2004.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter responds to your request of \n     May 18, 2004, for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's \n     (NRC's) views on waste-incident-to-reprocessing (WIR). \n     Specifically, you requested NRC's thoughts on: (1) the U.S. \n     Department of Energy's (DOE's) plan to grout in place the \n     remaining residues left in the tanks at the Savannah River \n     Site (SRS), the Hanford site, and the Idaho National \n     Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL); and (2) the \n     risks to human health and the environment by following DOE's \n     plan or the Natural Resources Defense Council' (NRDC's) plan. \n     The concept underlying WIR is that wastes can be managed \n     based on their risk to human health and the environment, \n     rather than the origin of the wastes. For wastes that \n     originate in reprocessing of nuclear fuel, such as the tank \n     residuals at the DOE sites, some are highly radioactive and \n     need to be treated and disposed of as high-level radioactive \n     waste. Others do not pose the same risk to human health and \n     the environment, and do not need to be disposed of as high-\n     level waste in order to manage the risks that they pose.\n       At the outset, it must be understood that the NRC does not \n     have regulatory authority or jurisdiction over SRS, Hanford, \n     or INEEL. In the past, DOE has requested NRC review of some \n     of its WIR determinations and supporting analysis. The NRC \n     entered into reimbursable agreements to perform these \n     reviews, which were provided as advice and did not constitute \n     regulatory approval. NRC performed comprehensive and \n     independent WIR reviews for Hanford in 1997, SRS in 2000, and \n     INEEL in 2002 and 2003. These reviews involved both waste \n     removed from tanks, and waste residuals remaining in the \n     tanks for grouting and closure. NRC assessed whether DOE's \n     determinations had sound technical assumptions, analysis, and \n     conclusions with regard to specific WIR criteria. These \n     criteria are: (1) the waste has been processed to remove key \n     radionuclides to the maximum extent that is technically and \n     economically practical, and (2) the waste is to be managed so \n     that safety requirements comparable to the performance \n     objectives in NRC's regulation 10 CFR Part 61 (Licensing \n     Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste), Subpart \n     C, are satisfied. In all cases, the NRC staff found that \n     DOE's proposed methodology and conclusions met the \n     appropriate WIR criteria and therefore met the performance \n     objectives and dose limits that would apply to near-surface \n     low-level waste disposal and would protect public health and \n     safety. It should be noted that the Commission did not review \n     all of DOE's actions with regard to WIR at those sites, and \n     that the NRC conclusions applied only to those actions that \n     the NRC reviewed. It should be noted that the Commission in \n     its ``Decommissioning Criteria for the West Valley \n     Demonstration Project (M-32) at the West Valley Site; Final \n     Policy Statement'' (67 FR 5003, February 1, 2002), \n     established WIR criteria for that site identical to those \n     used in our reviews of the three DOE sites.\n       It is our understanding that some opponents of DOE's \n     proposed plans believe that the tanks and the waste residuals \n     should be disposed of as high-level waste in a geologic \n     repository. While either approach could potentially be \n     implemented within NRC regulatory requirements, we note that \n     removal of the tanks, packaging of the tanks and residuals \n     for transport and disposal, and disposal of the waste at a \n     geologic repository, if feasible, would incur significant \n     additional worker exposures and transportation exposures at \n     very large financial costs. Whereas, if DOE's proposed plans \n     meet appropriate criteria, such as those used in NRC's \n     previous reviews, then the NRC believes that public health \n     and safety can be maintained while avoiding unnecessary \n     additional exposures and risks associated with removal and \n     transport of the waste and unnecessary additional \n     expenditures of Federal funds.\n       I hope this letter satisfactorily addresses your questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Nils J. Diaz.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have a lot of commissions and a lot of organizations \nin the committee that I chair. We have some 17 Departments for which we \nhave oversight and we deal with on a daily basis. When the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission was originally formed, it was to have the \nexpertise and the knowledge as to what is going to assure the most \nsafety for the public in the cheapest way you can get things done. They \nhave done a good job. We have a lot of organizations such as this \nthroughout Government. We have CASAC, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory \nCommittee. We look to them because they have expertise. We look to the \nNRC because they have expertise.\n  I do not want to imply that any of the Members here would have \nnecessarily less expertise than the NRC, but I suspect that is the \ncase. So we rely on that expertise. Here we have the Department of \nEnergy with all of its experts saying: This is the safe way to do it. \nThis is the cheapest way to do it. And we have the NRC, which is \ncharged with the responsibility of public safety, saying: This is the \nbest way to do it.\n  So I believe, when the time comes, we need to look at this rationally \nand not try to make disparaging remarks about some of the members of \nthe Armed Services Committee in our consideration of this amendment. \nKeep in mind, this was years in the making. Six years ago we started \nhearings on how to properly dispose of this, and the conclusions they \ncame to were unanimous.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, are we in a position now \nto do anything on this request we had?\n  Mr. ALLARD. No. We are still hearing. Senator Inhofe has finished his \nstatement. I would suggest we recognize the Senator from South Carolina \nfor 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized--\n  Mr. REID. No. The Senator is recognized for whatever time he wants. \nHe has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                      Setting The Record Straight\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues. I \nhave, this afternoon, the opportunity to respond to being charged as \nanti-Semitic when I proclaimed the policy of President Bush in the \nMideast as not for Iraq or really for democracy in the sense that he is \nworried about Saddam and democracy. If he were worried about democracy \nin the Mideast, as we wanted to spread it as a policy, we would have \ninvaded Lebanon, which is half a democracy and has terrorism and \nterrorists who have been problems to the interests of Israel and the \nUnited States.\n  It is very interesting that on page 231, Richard Clarke, in his book \n``Against All Enemies,'' cites the fact that there had not been any \nterrorism, any evidence or intelligence of Saddam's terrorism against \nthe United States from 1993 to 2003. He says that in the presence of \nPaul Wolfowitz. He says that in the presence of John McLaughlin of the \nCIA. In fact, he says: Isn't that right, John? And John says: That is \nexactly right.\n  The reason was when they made the attempt on President Bush, Senior, \nback in 1993, President Clinton ordered a missile strike on Saddam in \ndowntown Baghdad, the intelligence headquarters, and it went right \nstraight down the middle of the headquarters. It was after hours so not \na big kill--but Saddam got the message: You monkey around with the \nUnited States, a missile will land on your head.\n\n  So, in essence, the equation had changed in the Saddam-Iraq/Mideast \nconcerns whereby Saddam was more worried about any threat of the United \nStates against him than the United States was worried about a threat by \nSaddam against us.\n  I want to read an article that appeared in the Post and Courier in \nCharleston on May 6; thereafter, I think in the State newspaper in \nColumbia a couple days later; and in the Greenville News--all three \nmajor newspapers in South Carolina. You will find\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\nthat there is no anti-Semitic reference whatsoever in it.\n  The reason I emphasize that upfront is for the simple reason that you \ncannot put an op-ed in my hometown paper that is anti-Semitic. We have \na very, very proud Jewish community in Charleston. In fact, it is where \nreform Judaism began. The earliest temple, Kadosh Beth Elohim, is on \nHasell Street. I have spoken there several times. I had the pleasure of \nhaving that particular temple put on the National Register. This \nparticular Senator, with over 50 years now of public service, has \nreceived a strong Jewish vote.\n  Let me emphasize another thing because the papers are piling on and \nbringing up again a little difference of opinion I had on the Senate \nfloor with Senator Metzenbaum. It was not really a difference. What had \nhappened was we were discussing a matter, and we referred to each's \nreligion in order to make sure there would not be any misunderstanding \nor tempers flaring. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nHelms, referred to himself as the Baptist lay leader, Senator Danforth \nas the Episcopal priest. I referred to myself as the Lutheran Senator. \nAnd when Senator Metzenbaum came on the floor, I referred to him as the \nSenator from B'nai B'rith, and he took exception. He thought it was an \naspersion. I told him: Wait a minute, I will gladly identify myself as \nthe Senator from B'nai B'rith. I did not mean to hurt his feelings. I \napologized at that time but not for the legitimacy and the \ncircumstances of the particular reference.\n  Now here we go again, some years later. The Senator from Virginia, \nMr. George Allen, and I are good friends. Maybe after this particular \nthing he might feel different, but I know his role as the chairman of \nthe campaign committee. And so I have an article here where Senator \nAllen denounces Senator Hollings' latest political attack, Senator \nHollings' antisemitic, political conspiracy statement. Let me read the \nstatement here from the May 6 Post and Courier, and you be the judge:\n\n       With 760 dead in Iraq, over 3,000 maimed for life--home \n     folks continue to argue why we are in Iraq--and how to get \n     out.\n       Now everyone knows what was not the cause. Even President \n     Bush acknowledges that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with \n     9/11. Listing the 45 countries where al-Qaida was operating \n     on September 11 . . . the State Department did not list Iraq.\n\n  They listed 45 countries and at that particular date on September 11, \n2001, they did not even list Iraq.\n\n       Richard Clarke, in ``Against All Enemies,'' tells how the \n     United States had not received any threat of terrorism for 10 \n     years from Saddam at the time of our invasion.\n       On page 231, John McLaughlin of the CIA verifies this to \n     Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. In 1993, President \n     Clinton responded to Saddam's attempt on the life of \n     President George H.W. Bush by putting a missile down on \n     Saddam's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad. Not a big \n     kill, but Saddam got the message--monkey around with the \n     United States and a missile lands on his head. Of course \n     there were no weapons of mass destruction. Israel's \n     intelligence Mossad knows what's going on in Iraq. They are \n     the best. They have to know.\n       Israel's survival depends on knowing. Israel long since \n     would have taken us to the weapons of mass destruction . . .\n\n  Let me divert for a second there. I was here when Israel attacked the \nnuclear facility in Baghdad during the 1980s. In all candor, when \nPresident Bush, on October 7, 2002, said, after all that buildup by \nCheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld and everybody else, that facing clear \nevidence of peril, we cannot wait until the smoking gun is a mushroom \ncloud, I thought we were attacking for Israel. I thought that they knew \nabout some kind of nuclear development there. And rather than getting \nthem in further trouble with the United Nations and the Arab world, \nthat its best friend, the United States, would knock it out for them. \nThat is why I voted for it. I got misled. Our attack on Iraq, the \ninvasion of Iraq is a bad mistake. I will get into that later. But let \nme read even further:\n\n     . . . if there were any [weapons of mass destruction] or if \n     they had been removed. With Iraq no threat, why invade a \n     sovereign country? The answer: President Bush's policy to \n     secure Israel.\n       Led by Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Charles Krauthammer, \n     for years there had been a domino school of thought that the \n     way to guarantee Israel's security is to spread democracy in \n     the area. Wolfowitz wrote: ``The United States may not be \n     able to lead countries through the door of democracy, but \n     where that door is locked shut by a totalitarian deadbolt, \n     American power may be the only way to open it up.''\n\n  Namely, invasion. That is Wolfowitz talking.\n\n       And on another occasion: Iraq as ``the first Arab democracy \n     . . . would cast a very large shadow, starting with Syria and \n     Iran but across the whole Arab world.'' Three weeks before \n     the invasion, President Bush stated: ``A new regime in Iraq \n     would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example for freedom \n     for other nations in the region.''\n\n  I referred to those three gentlemen because I know them well. They \nare brilliant. I have been for years associated one way or the other \nwith each of them. I read Charles Krauthammer. I wish I could write \nlike he can. With respect to Richard Perle, he was sort of our \nauthority in the cold war, best friend of Scoop Jackson. That is how I \nmet him 38 years ago almost. I followed him and I followed his advice, \nand that is in large measure how we prevailed in the cold war. So I \nhave the highest respect for Richard Perle.\n\n  And, of course, the other gentleman, Paul Wolfowitz, Paul Wolfowitz, \nI met him out in Indonesia when he was Ambassador. He came back. We \nwere good friends. He was looking around for a position, and I know I \noffered him one--in fact, we might go to the records and find \ntemporarily he might have been on my payroll for a few weeks. But I \nhave always had the highest regard for Paul Wolfowitz.\n  That is why I referred to him. I had their sayings and everything \nelse. But let me go, diverting for a minute, right to the Project For \nThe New American Century. I have a letter that was written on May 29, \n1998, to Newt Gingrich, the Speaker, Trent Lott, the Senate majority \nleader. These are the gentlemen who said this:\n\n       We would use U.S. and allied military power to provide \n     protection for liberating areas in northern and southern \n     Iraq, and we should establish and maintain a strong U.S. \n     military presence in the region and be prepared to use that \n     force to protect our vital interests in the Gulf and, if \n     necessary, to help remove Saddam from power.\n\n  And that is signed by--and I want everybody to remember these names--\nElliot Abrams, William J. Bennett, Jeffrey Bergner, John R. Bolton, \nPaula Dobriansky, Francis Fukuyama, Robert Kagan, Zalmay Khalilzad, \nWilliam Kristol, Richard Perle, Peter Rodman, Donald Rumsfeld, William \nSchneider, Jr., Vin Weber, Paul Wolfowitz, James Woolsey, Robert B. \nZoellick. There is a studied school of thought of the best way to \nsecure Israel. We have been going for years back and forth with every \nparticular administration, you can see where we are now.\n  But in any event, the better way to do it is go right in and \nestablish our predominance in Iraq and then, as they say, and I have \ndifferent articles here I could refer to, next is Iran and then Syria. \nAnd it is the domino theory, and they genuinely believe it. I differ. I \nthink, frankly, we have caused more terrorism than we have gotten rid \nof. That is my Israel policy. You can't have an Israel policy other \nthan what AIPAC gives you around here. I have followed them mostly in \nthe main, but I have also resisted signing certain letters from time to \ntime, to give the poor President a chance.\n  I can tell you no President takes office--I don't care whether it is \na Republican or a Democrat--that all of a sudden AIPAC will tell him \nexactly what the policy is, and Senators and members of Congress ought \nto sign letters. I read those carefully and I have joined in most of \nthem. On some I have held back. I have my own idea and my own policy. I \nhave stated it categorically.\n  The way to really get peace is not militarily. You cannot kill an \nidea militarily. I was delighted the other day when General Myers \nappeared before our Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense and he said \nthat we will not win militarily in Iraq. He didn't say we are going to \nget defeated militarily but that you can't win militarily in Iraq.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not until I complete this thought. Time is running out \non me.\n  The papers are the ones that pointed out Wolfowitz, Pearle, and \nCharles Krauthammer were of the Jewish faith. They are the ones who \nbrought all this Semitism in there. I can tell you that right now, I \ndidn't have that in mind. I had my friends in mind and I followed them. \nWe had this in the late 1990s\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\nunder President Clinton, when we passed a resolution that we ought to \nhave Saddam removed from power, have a regime change. I was wondering \nhow it went. I had to find my old file--on this Project For The New \nAmerican Century.\n  Now, going back to my article: ``every President since 1947 has made \na futile attempt to help Israel negotiate peace. But no leadership has \nsurfaced amongst the Palestinians that can make a binding agreement. \nPresident Bush realized his chances at negotiation were no better. He \ncame to office imbued with one thought.''\n  Mr. ALLARD. I wonder if the Senator will yield, preserving his time, \nfor a unanimous consent request to move forward with the judge vote we \nhave at 5:40.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Without losing my right to the floor, I will yield.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 5:30 today the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nominations en bloc on today's Executive \nCalendar: No. 556, the nomination of Raymond Gruender to be U.S. \nCircuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit; and Calendar No. 557, the \nnomination of Franklin S. Van Antwerpen, to be U.S. Circuit Judge for \nthe Third Circuit.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following 10 minutes of debate, \nequally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, or their designees, that the Senate proceed to \nconsecutive votes on the confirmation of the nominations, with no \nfurther intervening action or debate; further, that following the vote, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator modify his request so \nthat the statement of the Senator from South Carolina will stop at \n5:40, and the rest of the unanimous consent kick in at 5:40, rather \nthan 5:30, so we will be voting at 5:50.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am willing to modify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me again read from my article:\n  President Bush came to office imbued with one thought: reelection.\n  I say that advisedly. I have been up here with eight Presidents. We \nhave had support of all eight Presidents. Yes, I supported the \nPresident on this Iraq resolution, but I was misled. There weren't any \nweapons, or any terrorism, or al-Qaida. This is the reason we went to \nwar. He had one thought in mind, and that was reelection. I say that \nabout President Bush. He is a delightful fella, a wonderful campaigner, \nbut he loves campaigning. You cannot get him in the White House or \ncatch him there, hardly. He doesn't work on these problems at all.\n  I have worked with all of the Presidents. I know the leadership goes \nto the White House and tries to work with him. He is interested in one \nthing, and that is to be out campaigning. So he had one thought in \nmind, and that was reelection.\n  Again, let me read: Bush thought tax cuts would hold his crowd \ntogether and that spreading democracy in the Mideast to secure Israel \nwould take the Jewish vote from the Democrats.\n  Is there anything wrong with referring to the Jewish vote? Good gosh, \nevery 1 of us of the 100, with pollsters and all, refer to the Jewish \nvote. That is not anti-Semitic. It is appreciating them. We campaigned \nfor it.\n  I just read about President Bush's appearance before the AIPAC. He \nconfirmed his support of the Jewish vote, referring to adopting Ariel \nSharon's policy, and the dickens with the 1967 borders, the heck with \nnegotiating the return of refugees, the heck with the settlements he \nhad objected to originally. They had those borders, Resolution No. \n242--no, no, President Bush said: I am going along with Sharon, and he \nwas going to get that and he got the wonderful reception he got with \nthe Jewish vote. There is nothing like politicizing or a conspiracy, as \nmy friend from Virginia, Senator Allen, says--that it is an anti-\nSemitic, political, conspiracy statement.\n  That is not a conspiracy. That is the policy. I didn't like to keep \nit a secret, maybe; but I can tell you now, I will challenge any 1 of \nthe other 99 Senators to tell us why we are in Iraq, other than what \nthis policy is here. It is an adopted policy, a domino theory of The \nProject For The New American Century.\n  Everybody knows it because we want to secure our friend, Israel. If \nwe can get in there and take it in 7 days, as Paul Wolfowitz says, then \nwe would get rid of Saddam, and when we got rid of Saddam, now all they \ncan do is fall back and say: Aren't you getting rid of Saddam?\n  Let me get to that point. What happens is, they say he is a monster. \nWe continued to give him aid after he gassed his own people and \neverything else of that kind. George Herbert Walker Bush said in his \nbook All The Best in 1999, never commit American GIs into an unwinnable \nurban guerrilla war and lose the support of the Arab world, lose their \nfriendship and support. That is a general rephrasing of it.\n  The point is, my authority is the President's daddy. I want everybody \nto know that. I don't apologize for this column. I want them to \napologize to me for talking about anti-Semitism. They are not getting \nby with it. I will come down here every day--I have nothing else to \ndo--and we will talk about it and find out what the policy is.\n  Let me go back to this particular column:\n\n       But George Bush, as stated by former Treasury Secretary \n     Paul O'Neill and others, started laying the groundwork to \n     invade Iraq days before the Inauguration.\n\n  There is no question, he got a briefing. That was the first thing he \nwanted out of former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen. Then the nominee, \nabout to take the oath of office as President of the United States, \nwanted to be briefed on Iraq. They had this policy in mind coming to \ntown. Mr. President, 9/11 had nothing to do with it, and we all know it \nnow. We have to understand it because that is the only way really to \nhelp Israel and get us out of the soup. Everybody is worrying about \nIraq. We better worry about Israel because we certainly have put her in \nterrible jeopardy with this particular initiative.\n\n       Without any Iraq connection to 9/11, within weeks President \n     Bush had the Pentagon outlining a plan to invade Iraq. He was \n     determined. President Bush thought taking Iraq would be easy. \n     Wolfowitz said it would take only 7 days. Vice President \n     Cheney believed that we would be greeted as liberators, but \n     Cheney's man, Chalabi, made a mess of de-Baathification of \n     Iraq by dismissing Republican Guard leadership and Sunni \n     leaders who soon joined with the insurgents.\n       Worst of all, we tried to secure Iraq with too few troops. \n     In 1966 in South Vietnam, with a population of 16 million, \n     General William C. Westmoreland, with 535,000 U.S. troops, \n     was still asking for more troops. In Iraq, with a population \n     of 25 million, General John Abizaid, with only 135,000 \n     troops, can barely secure the troops, much less the country. \n     If the troops are there to fight, there are too few. If they \n     are there to die, there are too many. To secure Iraq we need \n     more troops, at least 100,000 more. The only way to get the \n     United Nations back in Iraq is to make the country secure. \n     Once back, the French, Germans, and others will join with the \n     U.N. to take over.\n       With President Bush's domino policy in the Mideast gone \n     awry, he can't keep shouting ``Terrorism war.'' Terrorism is \n     a method, not a war. We don't call the Crimean war, with the \n     charge of the light brigade, the cavalry war, or World War II \n     the blitzkrieg war. There is terrorism in Northern Ireland, \n     there is terrorism in India, and in Pakistan. In the Mideast, \n     terrorism is a separate problem, to be defeated by diplomacy \n     and negotiation, not militarily.\n       Here, might does not make right. Right makes might. Acting \n     militarily we have created more terrorism than we have \n     eliminated.\n\n  The title of this article is ``Bush's failed Mideast policy is \ncreating more terrorism, `` and, I could add, jeopardizing the security \nof Israel.\n  They say: He talks like a big fan of Israel. I am. I have a 38-year \ntrack record. I will never forget some 34 years ago meeting with David \nBen-Gurion. He talked about little Israel, less than 3 million at that \ntime in a sea of 100 million.\n  Let's say Israel has 5 million people there now, but there are 150 \nmillion Muslims surrounding it. If you punch the particular buzzer I \ndid with Yitzhak Rabin 1 day down on the Negev to scramble the air \nforce, I think it was 21 seconds they were up in the air, and\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nin a minute's time, they were outside over Jordan.\n  Militarily, Israel is a veritable aircraft carrier. You can hardly \nfly and you are out of the country, and everybody has to understand \nthat. You cannot play the numbers game Sharon plays. He thinks he can \ndo it militarily.\n  I want to remind you, it was in that 6-day war--the book is ``Six \nDays of War'' by Michael Oren. Look on page 151, and Major Ariel Sharon \nsays: Look, we are going to decimate the Egyptian army and you will not \nhear from Egypt again for several generations. And Levi Eshkol, the \nPrime Minister, on page 152 says: ``Militarily victory decides nothing. \nThe Arabs will still be here.''\n\n  That is my theme. I have watched it over the years. You have to learn \nnot to kill together, but to live together. The finest piece I ever \nread was right in this morning's paper. There is still hope. I refer to \nan article: ``Israeli Arabs Exalting in a Rare Triumph.''\n  There are a million Israeli Arabs. They won a soccer match in Tel \nAviv. The majority of the team was of Israeli heritage, and they held \nan Israeli flag, if you can imagine that in the political United States \nof America. They are living together. Every Prime Minister since David \nBen-Gurion has realized that fact: that they have to learn to live \ntogether. They all moved, and they almost had it under Ehud Barak and \nPresident Clinton. Arafat proved he did not want peace. He did not \naccept it. That was our one chance.\n  Unfortunately, rather than working on that one chance and continuing, \nAriel Sharon went in their face at Temple Mount, the intifada started, \nand he has been killing 10 to 1. He plays the numbers game, almost like \nwe had in Vietnam. He thinks he can eliminate by moving the ball some, \ngetting some more settlements, bulldozing a house, but he is creating \nterrorism.\n  I had a headline the other day. When I saw it, I showed it to my \nstaff. I said: You all come in here, I want to ask you something. \n``Israel plans to destroy more Gaza dwellings.'' You see that headline? \nI asked staff members: Suppose they bulldoze your daddy's home. \nWouldn't you want to cut their throat?\n  They said: In a New York minute.\n  How do you create terrorists? Where is the front line in the so-\ncalled war on terrorism? I learned the answer recently on a trip I was \non with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We talked for over an \nhour with the King of Jordan. He finally cautioned at the very end, \nwhen we stood up, he said: You have to settle this Israel-Palestine \nquestion. That is the only way to get on top of this. We went over to \nKuwait to the Prime Minister when he got through, he said: You have to \nsettle the Israel-Palestine situation.\n  I will quote Mr. Musharraf, the President of Pakistan. When we got \nthere, he cautioned if you can settle the Israel-Palestine question, \nterrorism will disappear around the world.\n  Then we came in on a Friday evening to make a little courtesy call \nwith the French. The distinguished Senator from Virginia with \nLafayette--and I have slept in Lafayette's bed over there in Richmond, \nVA, and I helped with that particular thing because I believe and \nremember the French help. I will never forget--everybody is going to \nthe 60th anniversary of D-Day, but I was at the 50th anniversary and we \nwent over to Ste-Mere-Eglise, where a major, who was a Citadel \ngraduate, had broken through the line and saved us from having to leave \nthe beachhead and go back to England. They made a movie of it. A shell \nburst killed him. They laid him down on their side. He is buried on the \nside of the chapel.\n  We went to the services. We had talks there. This little old lady \ncame. She was about 80 years old, walking with a cane. I was listening \nto the mayor, and she pulled my jacket and she said: Thank you, Yank. \nIf you had not come we would be goose-stepping.\n  I turned to her and I said, thank you, madam, because if you had not \ncome, we would still be a colony.\n  The majority of the troops on the field at Yorktown with the \nsurrender of Cornwallis were French troops. We had French troops that \nhelped us get this so-called freedom. All this anti-French stuff, do \nnot give me french fries and everything else, is crazy.\n  I was proud to appear with the Senator from Virginia. But Chirac, he \nsaid, look, we have to have western solidarity. We have to work \ntogether now and we have to watch this competition from China in the \nFar East, and we in the western world have to stick together. He said \nhe wanted to help in Iraq, but he needed a U.N. resolution to cover. He \nsaid what we have to do is do something about Israel and Palestine.\n  I said, what would you do?\n  He said, I would put a peacekeeping force.\n  I said, would French troops come?\n  He said, French troops would come immediately. We would be part of it \nand we would separate them from killing each other every day.\n  My position is, and I believe in this particular policy as strongly \nas I know how, might does not make right, but right makes might. We \nhave lost our evenhanded posture and reputation in the Mideast. We are \nin worse off shape with Israel, our principal interest in the gulf.\n  Sharon has not helped us at all. We see him going back and forth. \nThey say, oh, no, it is negotiation. But we are throwing over the \nUnited States-Israel policy of some 35 years insofar as negotiating the \nsettlements and the refugees. We are saying forget about all of that, \nlet Sharon keep bulldozing them. Now in the morning paper on the front \npage one sees the killing of children, they are saying, we are \ndefending Israel. That is the U.S. policy. That is not just Israel's \npolicy.\n  They are coming in there with U.S. equipment, U.S. gun helicopters, \nU.S. tanks that are bulldozing. That is our policy. That is the reason \nfor 9/11 and Osama. He said, I do not like American troops in Saudi \nArabia, get the infidel out. That is why they went right into that \nthing. Where do you think we get all this talk about hate America? I do \nnot buy that stuff. I have traveled the world. They love Americans.\n  Recently we met with the Ambassadors of Germany and France, and \nBritain in our policy committee and they said the young people are \ndisillusioned. They always look to the United States for the moral \nposition and taking and defending that particular position. They do not \nlook there anymore.\n  We are losing the terrorism war because we thought we could do it \nmilitarily under the domino policy of President Bush, going into Iraq. \nThat is my point. That is not anti-Semite or whatever they say in here \nabout people's faith and ethnicity. I never referred to any faith. I \nshould have added those other names from the Project For The New \nAmerican Century, but I picked out the names I had quotes for. And for \nspace, I left other things out.\n  Mr. President, on May 12 of this year, I had printed in the Record \nthe article in its entirety.\n  I diverted from the reading of the article several times, so for the \nsake of accuracy I wanted the whole article printed.\n  This particular op-ed piece appeared in the Post and Courier. Never \nwould they have thought, having read it, if it was anti-Semitic, that \nthey would have ever put it in there. Nor would the Knight Ridder \nnewspapers in Columbia, SC. Nor would the Metro Media newspapers in \nGreenville, SC. But the Anti-Defamation League picked it up and now \nthey have given it to my good friend, Senator Allen of Virginia. I have \nhis particular admonition how I am anti-Semitic and I cannot let that \nstay there.\n  My staff knew I was coming over and waiting my turn in order to talk \nunder the Pastore rule. I know I am as vitally interested as anybody \ncan be about this issue. Our distinguished colleague from Washington, \nSenator Cantwell, knows this subject backward and forward.\n  The reason I had not known or gotten all fired up is I have been \ndoing some other work and South Carolina has already looked to me for \neverything at that Savannah River plant. I am on the Energy \nAppropriations Subcommittee and we have gotten all the money--do not \nworry about money. This is a policy of nuclear waste disposal, high-\nlevel waste, being reclassified under an end-around-end deal of trying \nto make it low-level waste and, as Senator Cantwell says, pouring in \nsome sand and concrete on top of it. The scientists say, watch out, the \nremains in these tanks are 50 percent as deadly and dangerous as the \nentire tank container.\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\n  Back to Saddam, everybody is glad we have gotten rid of Saddam, but \nwe can see what has happened. There is an old saying we learned in \nWorld War II that no matter how well the gun is aimed, if the recoil is \ngoing to kill the gun crew, you do not fire.\n  Did this White House and administration ever think of the recoil? It \nseverely injured the gun crew. Yes, ordinarily to get rid of Saddam, \nlike they put a missile on the intelligence head, they could have put a \nmissile on him any time they wanted, but they did not want to do that. \nThey wanted the domino policy to ensue.\n  No, no, getting rid of Saddam was not worth almost 800 dead GIs and \nover 3,500 maimed for life. Some say every time we want to criticize \nthe policy, we are weakening the GIs. I am strengthening the GIs. I \nsaid let's get enough in there so they can secure themselves. We have \n135,000 now. A third of those are guarding the other third, and that \nmeans leaving a third, 35,000 or 40,000 troops, running out like a fire \ndrill to any particular trouble and coming back in and eating. I have \nbeen there.\n  You can see it in Rafah. They are building a big old thing like in \nKosovo, where we hunker down and act like we are in charge of Kosovo. \nThe Albanians are in charge of Kosovo.\n  You can't force-feed democracy. It has to come from within. We helped \nliberate Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, 60-some years ago, and Morocco, \nAlgeria, Tunisia have not opted for democracy, nor has Libya, nor has \nEgypt, nor has Lebanon, nor has Syria, nor has Iraq, nor has Iran, nor \nhas Afghanistan, nor has Pakistan, nor has Jordan, nor has Yemen, nor \nhas Aden, nor has Saudi Arabia, nor has the organization of Arab \nstates.\n  Come on. So we have to go out and not speak sense with respect to \npolicy, and when you want to talk about policy, they say it is anti-\nSemitic. Well, come on the floor, let's debate it. Because my friend \nfrom Virginia admonishes me. Referring to me he says, ``I suggest he \nshould learn from history before making accusations.'' I didn't make \nany accusations. I stated facts. That is their policy. That is not my \npolicy.\n  Mind you me, when we went into Iraq, the only people in the world who \nfavored that policy were the people of the United States and the people \nof Israel. The people of Jordan, Iraq, Britain, Spain, Poland, Italy, \nJapan, everywhere around the world said you just don't invade a \nsovereign country no matter how bad the rascal is. We have Kim Jong of \nNorth Korea--he has weapons of mass destruction, but we don't do \nanything there.\n  Don't give me this about how we saved this and we did this or did \nthat. We have to sort of learn that the front line now is not the \nPentagon but the State Department. We have to work through diplomacy. \nWe live in a global economy and a global world. That is only going to \ncome about economically, politically, diplomatically, and by \nnegotiations.\n  The United States, until this invasion and this domino policy for \nIsrael--don't tell me it is otherwise, about spreading democracy. They \nknow what they are talking about. They are insisting on it. It is not a \nJewish policy or a Semite policy. It is their domino policy. That is \nexactly what it is. But they know how to make you tuck tail and run. \nNot the Senator from South Carolina. We don't run, we don't win, we are \nnot right, we are wrong a lot of times, but I have thought this out as \nthoroughly as I know how, and it worries me that here we are.\n  I said after we got into that thing in Vietnam with the Gulf of \nTonkin--I came there at that particular time, in 1966, went to Vietnam \nwhen we were under fire three times--actually over into Cambodia before \nand that kind of thing. We finally came up with McNamara writing a book \nsaying he was wrong.\n  I'll never forget, McNamara comes out to Allie Richenberg near Saint \nAlbans to get his tennis lesson at 7 o'clock, and Bob Mcnamara turned \nto Allie and said, ``Allie, what do you think about my book?'' He said, \n``It's as bad as your backhand. You should not have written it.''\n  But we had to wait 20 years for that one, and we killed 58,000 \nAmericans. Now we have killed almost 800, maimed for life thousands of \nothers. Are we going to just continue on?\n  What would the Senator from South Carolina do if I were king for a \nday? Yes, I would put the troops in to get security, and I would step \nup the election. I can tell you right now, I have run for all kind \nof offices, 20-some statewide offices and campaigns. But don't put me \nin on that temporary coalition. That fellow, El Baradei, who is running \naround the United Nations to get a temporary coalition or government to \nturn power over to on June 30--don't put me in that. I immediately have \nto repudiate the United States, that I am not a stooge for the United \nStates. We just have our fingers crossed that we can hold law and order \nso we can have an election. But don't wait until 2005, or December; by \nSeptember 30, let's get that election going.\n\n  Let's realize we are in real trouble. Saudi Arabia is in trouble. \nIsrael is in trouble. The United States is in trouble. I am going to \nstate what I believe to be the fact. In fact, I believe it very \nstrongly. They just are whistling by on account of the pressures that \nwe get politically. Nobody is willing to stand up and say what is going \non.\n  It was a mistake like Vietnam. We got misled with the Gulf of Tonkin, \nwe got misled here, and we are in that quagmire. ``Municipal guerrilla \nwar and a quagmire,'' that says George Herbert Walker Bush. I will end \non my authority--President George Herbert Walker Bush said:\n\n       Never commit U.S. troops into an unwinnable urban guerrilla \n     war and turn off the Arab world.\n\n  Look in that book of his and you will see exactly what I am talking \nabout. He is not anti-Semitic. He is sensible. He didn't go in.\n  Yes, Colin Powell, General Powell said if you are going in, let's \nhave enough troops. They tried to do it on the cheap. They were ill \nadvised. My friend Paul Wolfowitz said you will do it in 7 days. Come \non. And they let the Republican Guard back into the city of Baghdad and \ninto the Sunni triangle, and the next thing you know, when Chalabi, who \nhas now been demoted or set aside--he did away with their leadership \nand everything, so they got turned off and they buddied up with the \ninsurgents, and now we have hell on our hands. Everybody knows that.\n  So it has been ill prepared, ill advised, and ill administered. The \nentire thing is a mess. Don't give me ``support the troops, support the \ntroops.'' I have been with troops, about 3 years in combat, so don't \ntell me about troops. I have always supported the troops.\n  You ask how many Senators have gotten a Woodward Award from the U.S. \nArmy. They don't give that out lightly. I have been with every \nSecretary of Defense until this one, and I think he is brilliant, but I \nthink he has made a mistake going along with this domino policy. We \nhave it now out on the table, and we will all talk about it, and we \nwill be around and ready to debate it.\n  I appreciate the colleagues yielding to me. I wish I had all the time \nto put all these articles in.\n  I want to thank--and I am going to sit here and support my friend \nfrom Washington. She has done a magnificent job stating what the issue \nis.\n  It is simply under the auspices of an accelerated disposal plan going \naround end to reclassify--and it is around end. I had not heard \nanything about it. I have been handling everything at Savannah River \nfor 30 some years. I called up the South Carolina Department of Health \nand Environmental Control--DHEC--and they were adamantly opposed and \ngave me the brief they signed a few weeks ago adamantly opposing it, \nwith the assistant attorney general's name on it. They say this is DHEC \npolicy. I talked to two members of DHEC and they said it was never \nbrought up at their meetings. They do not know anything about it.\n  So, yes, it is a little rider for one special State that is injurious \nnot only to the State itself--I say that advisedly--but also to the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5926-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5926-S5929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nRAYMOND W.

Gruender, of \nMissouri, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, and \nFranklin S. Van Antwerpen, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the Third Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally counted on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, shortly we are going to be voting on the \nnomination of Raymond Gruender to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I want to tell my colleagues this is one of the finest young men I \nknow. He worked his way through Washington University, getting an MBA \nand a law degree in 6 years while working full time to support himself. \nHis personal story is a very touching one, with very significant \ndifficulties which he overcame.\n  He served as an assistant U.S. Attorney under Republican and \nDemocratic administrations.\n  He has been in private practice of law and has tried cases in \ndistrict courts--criminal and a wide range of civil cases.\n  He served as an appellate lawyer.\n  Most recently, he has been U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nMissouri.\n  I can assure you this is a man who will bring not only integrity, \nlegal skills, and judicial knowledge to the Eighth Circuit, but he is a \nperson of great human understanding and intellect. He will be a \npleasure to appear before.\n  We can be proud the President has nominated a man who has such great \nrespect among the bar in the Eastern District of Missouri and law \nenforcement personnel, as well as plaintiffs' and defendants' \nattorneys.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Raymond Gruender.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Raymond W. Gruender, who has been nominated to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n  Our nominee has ideal qualifications for the Federal bench. An honors \ngraduate of Washington University School of Law, Mr. Gruender has \nnearly ten years of experience as a trial attorney in private practice \nalong with a solid record in public service. He joined the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri as an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney in 1990, specializing in white collar and economic \ncrimes, including fraud and corruption cases.\n  Mr. Gruender has the bipartisan support of the Missouri legal \ncommunity, including: Senators Bond and Talent; Edward L. Down, Clinton \nappointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri; Lee \nLawless, First Assistant Federal Public Defender for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri; Howard Shalowitz, President of the Bar \nAssociation of Metropolitan St. Louis; Joseph Mokwa, Chief of Police of \nCity of St. Louis; and Dean Joel Seligman, Washington University in St. \nLouis School of Law.\n  In 2000, Mr. Gruender returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the \nEastern District of Missouri, and specialized in fraud and corruption \nprosecution. A year later, he was unanimously confirmed as the United \nStates Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, where he manages \nboth the civil and criminal litigation handled by the office, as well \nas overseeing the administration of the office, which includes 60 \nattorneys. Mr. Gruender and his office have been active in helping to \nreduce violent crime in the St. Louis area. He has also been a leader \nin strengthening our nation's readiness in the war on terror.\n  Mr. Gruender also believes in giving back to his community, and in \naddition to devoting a significant amount of his career to public \nservice, he has been very active in civic affairs. He has volunteered \nhis time on domestic violence issues, serving at various times as \nPresident of the Board of Directors, Vice President, and Secretary of \nAlternatives to Living in Violent Environments, ALIVE. ALIVE is a not-\nfor-profit organization dedicated to eliminating domestic violence. He \nalso serves as a volunteer on the Allocations Committee of the Variety \nClub of St. Louis, which raises and distributes funds to disadvantaged \nand disabled children.\n  Raymond W. Gruender III has a fine background, which will serve him \nwell as a circuit court judge. He will be a terrific addition to the \nCourt, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, we were able to obtain a \nfirm commitment from the White House that there would be no further \njudicial recess appointments for the remainder of this presidential \nterm. That undertaking led immediately and directly to the Senate \nvitiating a cloture vote and proceeding to confirm the nomination of \nMarcia Cooke to the federal bench in Florida. Today we debate and vote \non the nomination of Raymond Gruender to the Eighth Circuit.\n  Thus, despite the pessimism expressed by some last week, I continued \nworking to conclude an arrangement between the White House and the \nSenate that would allow additional progress on judicial confirmations. \nWorking with Senator Daschle, Senator Frist, Judge Gonzales and the \nWhite House chief of staff Andy Card, we were able to reach an \nagreement on Tuesday. I again commend our two leaders. I have been \nworking with Senator Daschle for months, as well as with the White \nHouse, to find a way out of the impasse in judicial confirmations. \nSenator Frist and I have spoken at length about this, and he has been \nworking on that, too. I was delighted to see the meeting of Senator \nDaschle, Senator Frist, and Mr. Card finally take place this week. Most \nimportantly, I was pleased that the White House agreed to no more \nrecess appointments of judges.\n  I think we have demonstrated our good faith. In the 17 months that \nthe Democrats were in charge of the Senate, we confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's nominees to lifetime positions on the federal bench. \nAnd the Republicans, during the 23 months that they have been in charge \nof the Senate, have now confirmed another 74. With the consideration of \nthe Gruender nomination today, that total reaches 75.\n  This is the 75th confirmation for 2003 and 2004, of the 108th \nCongress. That matches the total for the entire two-year 1995-1996 \nperiod in which Republicans controlled the 104th Congress and exceeds \nthe total for the entire two-year 1999-2000 period in which Republicans \ncontrolled the 106th Congress. Of course in those years Senate \nRepublicans were reviewing President Clinton's judicial nominees. \nFurther, with 175 confirmations, we will have matched the total \nconfirmation for the most recent 4-year Presidential term 1997-2000.\n  It is significant that this is the first circuit court nomination the \nSenate will have considered this Presidential election year. The last \ntime a President ran for reelection was 1996. During that session, with \nthe Republican majority controlling the Senate agenda not a single \ncircuit court nominee was considered. Accordingly, when the Senate acts \nto confirm the first circuit court nominee this year, we will have \nbested the total for the entire 1996 session.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has received assurances from the White \nHouse that the President will not further abuse the recess appointment\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\npower by making recess appointments during the remainder of his \npresidential term. It was the White House's refusal to reach a \nreasonable accommodation of the concerns of many Senators about the \nunilateral approach of the President's recess appointments to the \nfederal courts that complicated our efforts to reach an agreement \nregarding votes on judicial nominees over the past few months. That is \ndemonstrated by the prompt vote and confirmation of Judge Cooke Tuesday \nafternoon. I was pleased to be able to help facilitate the end of that \nimpasse.\n  And now we are set to vote on another candidate, the nomination of \nRaymond Gruender to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. \nWhile some have mischaracterized the nominees included in this week's \nagreement as ``noncontroversial,'' they in fact include a number who \nwill require debate and they will each require a roll call vote\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Gruender is another nominee whose record raises \nconcerns, just as have the records of far too many of President Bush's \njudicial nominees. Mr. Gruender, though only 40 years old, has been a \nmember of the Federalist Society since 1988 and has played a lead role \nin many national Republican campaigns. For the past two years, Mr. \nGruender has served as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nMissouri. In this capacity, he has been a vocal defender of Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft's aggressive and controversial tactics.\n  He has also been critical of a city that passed a resolution \nreaffirming the importance of civil liberties in the fight against \nterrorism. He claimed that the resolution, which aimed to protect \nfreedom of speech, assembly, privacy and due process, is ``putting \nlives in jeopardy and increasing the chances for terrorists to be \nsuccessful.'' Mr. Gruender stood by these statements and his criticisms \nof the resolution at his hearing.\n  Despite his activities applying the PATRIOT Act as a U.S. Attorney \nand his public pronouncements about its provisions, Mr. Gruender stated \nin his answers to my written questions that he has ``not formed or \nexpressed any opinions with respect to the constitutionality of any \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act'' and would, if confirmed, protect each \ncitizen's civil rights and civil liberties.\n  I do hope that, if confirmed, Mr. Gruender will be a person of his \nword. I hope he will be fair and open-minded, and listen to all \narguments involved in such cases. I hope he would not seek to decide \ncases in accordance with his partisan or personal beliefs rather than \nin accordance with the law. I also must note that, while he was candid \nabout some of his activities, Mr. Gruender failed to directly answer \nseveral questions that I asked him in writing after his hearing, \nquestions that would enable me to fully evaluate his qualifications for \na lifetime appointment on the federal bench.\n  Just as a nominee last year attempted to stonewall Committee Members \nby not answering questions in a forthright manner, so Mr. Gruender \navoided answering some of my questions by claiming that he could not \nexpress his views on the issues without a complete factual record and \nthe benefit of the ``deliberative process.'' For example, Mr. Gruender \nrefused to express his opinion about Congress's power under the \nCommerce Clause, Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the 10th or \n11th Amendments. This is a timid, evasive and useless response. And \nmany other circuit court nominees of this President have answered the \nsame questions.\n  Mr. Gruender does, however, have the support of both of his home-\nState Senators and has served both as prosecutor and a defense \nattorney.\n  I am hopeful that he will be open-minded on the bench and will act as \nhe says he will, that he will follow the law and not seek out \nopportunities to overturn precedent or decide cases in accord with his \npolitical beliefs rather than his obligations as a judge. I also \nsincerely hope that Mr. Gruender will treat all those who appear before \nhim with respect and courtesy and will not abuse the power and trust of \nhis position.\n  For the last three and one-half years, I have urged President Bush to \nwork with us. Our proceeding today on this nomination demonstrates our \ngoing the extra mile.\n  I would note that President Clinton's nomination of Bonnie Campbell \nto this court was blocked--by a secret Republican hold--from ever \ngetting Committee or Senate consideration. By contrast, the Senate has \nalready confirmed four of President Bush's nominees to this circuit:--\nWilliam Riley, Michael Melloy, and Lavenski Smith were confirmed while \nDemocrats held the majority, and, last year, Steven Colloton was \nconfirmed to this court, as well. Mr. Gruender makes the fifth.\n  With his confirmation, Republican appointees on the Eighth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals will outnumber Democratic appointees by four to one. \nThere will be eight active Republican-appointed judges and only two \nactive Democratic-appointed judges. And there is one more vacancy on \nthis court which President Bush intends to fill with another \nconservative nominee.\n  I would note for my friends on the other side of the aisle--who \nconsistently rebuke the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as being ``too \nliberal'' because 60 percent of the judges are Democratic appointees--\nthat the scales are tipped much farther the other way on the Eighth \nCircuit. With Democratic cooperation in confirming five of President \nBush's nominees to the Eighth Circuit, Republican appointees now occupy \n80 percent of the authorized seats on that court.\n  I congratulate Mr. Gruender and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, United States Attorney Ray Gruender has \nhad a distinguished career as a public servant and practicing attorney. \nHe is an outstanding and highly qualified candidate as evidenced by his \nprofessional and academic credentials.\n  From humble beginnings, Mr. Gruender has risen to the top of the \nlegal profession. Neither of his parents graduated from high school; \nhis father painted houses; his mother worked in a factory as a \nbookbinder and is now a prison guard. He has worked since age 10 with \nhis father and he continued to work all through school.\n  Mr. Gruender obtained three degrees from Washington University in \nless than 6 years, all while working and paying his own way through \nschool. By 1987, he had obtained Bachelor of Science in Business \nAdministration, Master of Business Administration and Juris Doctoris \ndegrees. Not only did he work twenty hours per week during the 6 years \nin which he obtained these degrees, but he also ranked near the top of \nhis class in each program. In law school, Mr. Gruender served on the \nWashington University Law Quarterly and is a member of The Order of the \nCoif. In December 2003, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws \ndegree by William Woods University in Fulton, Missouri.\n  Since May 1, 2001, Ray Gruender has served as the United States \nAttorney for the Easter District of Missouri. As United States Attorney \nhe oversees an office of 60 Assistant United States Attorneys actively \nengaged in both civil and criminal matters. During his tenure, the \nnumber of Federal firearms prosecutions in his district has increased \ndramatically. In 2003, the City of St. Louis experienced 69 homicides, \nthe first time it had fewer than 100 homicides in more than 40 years.\n  Prior to serving as the United States Attorney, Mr. Gruender served \nas an Assistant United States Attorney--AUSA--between 1990 and 1994 and \nagain between 2000 and 2001. As an AUSA, he specialized in fraud and \npublic corruption matters. He was one of the AUSAs who handled the \nSecond Injury Fund prosecutions involving several lawyers, physicians \nand an administrative law judge who were defrauding Missouri's workers' \ncompensation system.\n  In addition to his experience as a Federal prosecutor, Mr. Gruender \nhas spent 9 years in the private practice of law. Between 1987 and \n1990, he was an associate with the large St. Louis law firm of Lewis, \nRice and Fingersh. Between 1994 and 2000, he as a partner with Thompson \nCoburn, LLP, another large Missouri firm. He has represented both \nplaintiffs and defendants in a broad array of civil matters such as \nadmiralty, antitrust, contracts, employment, securities, fraud, banking \nand various torts claims.\n  He is a member of the Missouri and Illinois bars, the Bar Association \nof Metropolitan St. Louis, and has been a member of the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri's Criminal Justice Act Lead Counsel Panel, making \nhimself available to accept criminal appointments.\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\n  Mr. Gruender also has been active in civil affairs. His numerous \ncivic contributions include serving as a volunteer on the Allocations \nCommittee of the Variety Club of St. Louis to help raise and distribute \nfunds to disadvantaged and disabled children in the St. Louis area. He \nalso served on the Board of Directors--including as board president \nof--ALIVE--Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments--a not-for-\nprofit entity dedicated to eliminating domestic violence and helping \nits victims.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote to confirm Raymond Gruender, of \nMissouri, to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

He will be an \nexcellent judge for the Third Circuit.\n  I yield time to my distinguished colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I add my congratulations to Judge Van \nAntwerpen. He has been an excellent public servant and distinguished \njurist and will make an excellent contribution to the Third Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Franklin S. Van Antwerpen, who has been \nnominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  Judge Van Antwerpen is truly an impressive man and has the \nenthusiastic support of both Pennsylvania senators, along with a \nunanimous ``Well Qualified'' ABA rating.\n  Judge Van Antwerpen has exceptional qualifications for the Federal \nappellate bench. After graduation from Temple University School of Law \nin 1967, he worked as an attorney at the Hazeltine Corporation and \nserved as Chief Counsel of the Northampton Legal Aid Society. He then \nspent 9 years in private practice, representing both plaintiffs and \ndefendants in general litigation matters, with a particular \nspecialization in municipal law.\n  In 1979, Judge Van Antwerpen commenced a 25-year career in public \nservice when he joined the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County. \nHe served in this position until 1987, when President Reagan appointed \nhim United States District Judge for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, the position he holds today.\n  Judge Van Antwerpen has a fine background which will serve him well \nas a circuit court judge. He will be a terrific addition to the court, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, in addition to voting on the \nnomination of Raymond Gruender, we vote to confirm another circuit \ncourt nominee, Judge Franklin Van Antwerpen to the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit. A Federal District Court judge since \nhe was appointed by President Reagan in 1987, Judge Van Antwerpen comes \nto the Senate floor strongly supported by the Senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, who I know is eager to see him confirmed.\n  Today's confirmation will make the 76th judge confirmed this year \nalone and the 176th judicial nominee to be confirmed for this \nPresident. With 76 judicial confirmations in just a little more than 16 \nmonths, the Senate has now confirmed more Federal judges than were \nconfirmed during the two full years of 1995 and 1996, when Republicans \nfirst controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in the White \nHouse. It also exceeds the 2-year total for the last 2 years of the \nClinton administration, when Republicans held the Senate. In fact, with \n176 total confirmations for President Bush in just 3\\1/2\\ years, the \nSenate has confirmed more lifetime appointees for this president than \nwere allowed to be confirmed in President Clinton's entire second term, \nthe most recent 4-year presidential term. We have already surpassed the \nnumber of judicial confirmations won by President Reagan in his entire \nfirst term in office.\n  The confirmation of Judge Van Antwerpen also marks the second circuit \ncourt nominee confirmed for President Bush this year, which is double \nthe number of circuit court nominees confirmed in all of 1996, the last \ntime a president was running for reelection and Republicans refused to \nallow a single circuit court nominee of President Clinton to be \nconfirmed all year. Today we confirm the 32nd circuit court nominee of \nPresident Bush, which is more circuit court confirmations than in all 4 \nyears of President Clinton's first term in the White House.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania demonstrates yet \nagain that President Bush's nominees have been treated far better than \nPresident Clinton's and shows dramatically how Democrats have worked in \na bipartisan way to fill vacancies, despite the fact that Republicans \nblocked more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. With \nthis confirmation, 16 of\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nPresident Bush's nominees to the Federal courts in Pennsylvania will \nhave been confirmed, more than for any other State except California.\n  With this confirmation, President Bush's nominees will make up 16 of \nthe 41 active Federal circuit and district court judges for \nPennsylvania--that is more than one third of the Pennsylvania Federal \nbench. With the additional four Pennsylvania district court nominees \npending on the floor and likely to be confirmed soon, nearly half of \nthe district court seats in Pennsylvania will be held by President \nBush's appointees. Republican appointees will outnumber Democratic \nappointees by nearly two to one.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President \nClinton was in the White House. Although Republicans now decry \nDemocratic filibusters of a mere handful of the most extreme nominees, \nRepublicans denied votes to nine district and one circuit court \nnominees of President Clinton in Pennsylvania alone. Despite the \nefforts and diligence of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSpecter, to secure the confirmation of all of the judicial nominees \nfrom every part of his home State, there were ten nominees by President \nClinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a vote. Despite how \nwell-qualified these nominees were, many of their nominations sat \npending before the Senate for more than a year without being \nconsidered. Such obstruction provided President Bush with a significant \nopportunity to shape the bench according to his partisan and \nideological goals.\n  Recent news articles in Pennsylvania have highlighted the way that \nPresident Bush has been able to reshape the Federal bench in \nPennsylvania. For example, the Philadelphia Inquirer, on November 27, \n2003, said that the significant number of vacancies on the Pennsylvania \ncourts ``present Republicans with an opportunity to shape the judicial \nmakeup of the court for years to come.''\n  Democratic support for the confirmation of Franklin Van Antwerpen is \nyet another example of our extraordinary cooperation despite an \nuncompromising White House and the record of how President Clinton's \nPennsylvania nominees fared under Republican control in the Senate. In \ncontrast to many of President Bush's nominees, Judge Van Antwerpen \ncomes to us with a distinguished and widely acclaimed career on the \nbench--both on the State and Federal levels. He was rated unanimously \nwell-qualified by the American Bar Association and has the respect of \nhis peers on the bench and of the attorneys who appear before him. He \nis the kind of nominee this President and my Republican colleagues \nshould be looking for as we fulfill our constitutional duty of \nappointing members to the Federal judiciary--an independent branch of \nthe government.\n  I congratulate Judge Van Antwerpen and his family on his confirmation \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Franklin S. Van Antwerpen, of Pennsylvania, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Third Circuit?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I join with my colleague in requesting Senators to send \nin as many amendments as they possibly can. The Senator from Michigan \nand I will be here tomorrow in hopes that we can clear amendments. \nThere are days when clearances could be facilitated. I think tomorrow \nis one of those days.\n  I say to my good colleague, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, am \nI correct in that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I say to my good friend from Virginia, he is absolutely \nnot only correct but I would join his plea to our colleagues that we \nmake good use of time tomorrow. If Senators are not here, their staff \ncan deliver amendments so at least we can begin to consider them. We \ncan make good use of tomorrow so when we come back we will have to use \nup less of the Senate's time.\n  So I join the chairman's plea that Members on both sides of the \naisle, who have not filed amendments or given our staffs amendments, do \nthat tomorrow. Let us try to work through some of them. We could clear \nthem tomorrow and, even if we do not have contested amendments \ntomorrow, we could make some progress on this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada, the Democratic whip, pointed \nout that he has a count of over 100-odd amendments with which we have \nto deal. So there is a formidable task ahead of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. The reason I speak as we close out this \nevening is to comment on a few things about the amendment pending \nbefore the Senate in regard to an effort to do two things: to make sure \nthe $350 million that is available for the Department of Energy to \nprovide cleanup in the States of Washington, Idaho, and South Carolina \ncan move forward without any strings attached, and to ratify an \nagreement that the State of South Carolina has entered into with the \nDepartment of Energy concerning 51 tanks containing high-level waste.\n  I really do very much like my colleague from Washington, Senator \nCantwell, but we dramatically disagree on this. I cannot emphasize how \ndramatically we do disagree about what is at stake and what we are \ntrying to accomplish.\n  My senior Senator from South Carolina could not have been possibly \nbetter to me since I have been in the Senate almost 18 months now. He \nis going through some accusations that I find not consistent with who \nSenator Hollings is. I am not going to dwell on that, but I believe \nthat most of us who\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nknow Senator Hollings very well believe he gives everybody the same \ntreatment: Really hard. He is a fair man. He is a good man. We have \nsome disagreement about how to handle the amendment before us, but I \ndid not come to this issue without some time, attention, and thought to \nthe matter.\n  Well over a year I have been involved with my State working with the \nDepartment of Energy to make sure that the 51 tanks that have high-\nlevel waste as a result of the cold war legacy material at the Savannah \nRiver site is cleaned up in a way that is environmentally sound for \nSouth Carolina, good for the taxpayer, and it makes sense.\n  I have a letter from the Governor of South Carolina. Contrary to what \nSenator Hollings suggested, the Governor of South Carolina not only \nknows what we are doing, he encourages what we are doing. I received a \nletter to that effect. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, May 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing in support Section 3116, \n     Defense Site Acceleration Completion in the FY 2005 \n     Department of Defense Authorization bill, S. 2400. More \n     specifically, this section of the bill will allow for an \n     accelerated clean up of the Savannah River Site in South \n     Carolina.\n       This Administration is concerned about the prospect of \n     long-term storage of radioactive waste in aging tanks at the \n     Savannah River Site. Under the current Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act, the cleanup process could leave the waste in those \n     storage tanks for an additional 30 years.\n       However, the amendment allows the U.S. Department of \n     Energy, working with the South Carolina Department of Health \n     and Environmental Control, to move more quickly to clean up \n     the Savannah River Site. In fact, the estimated cleanup time \n     will be reduced by 23 years, at a savings of $16 billion to \n     the taxpayers.\n       Most important is ensuring that the State of South Carolina \n     will be able to retain an oversight role in the cleanup \n     process. According to analysis by the South Carolina \n     Department of Health and Environmental Control, the state's \n     environmental regulatory agency, the clean up process will \n     still require an equal partnership with the State.\n       As you move through the legislative process, we urge you \n     and your colleagues to retain two very important goals for \n     South Carolina: 1. allow for a more accelerated clean up \n     process, and 2. provide strong language to protect the \n     State's sovereignty within the process of accelerated \n     cleanup.\n       Thank you for your leadership in the United States Senate. \n     I look forward to working with you on this and many other \n     matters of importance to our State.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mark Sanford.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I am going to read from it. The \nquestion Senator Hollings raised was, well, if our Governor knew about \nthis he would not agree to this because he is a good environmentalist.\n  We will agree on this: Our Governor is a good environmentalist. He \nhas been a great Governor trying to change the culture of the way we do \nbusiness in South Carolina. I have been working with him for well over \na year to make sure our State gets those tanks cleaned up in our \nlifetime and we do not have to worry about ground water leakage.\n  The folks in Washington have a real problem on their hands, and I \nwant to help them. The people in Idaho have problems on their hands, \nand I want to help them. I do not think they are being very responsible \nin terms of how we are dealing with each other's problems.\n  Here is a chronology of what has been going on in these three States. \nIdaho, South Carolina, and Washington have been separately negotiating \nwith the Department of Energy about trying to agree on standards in \ntheir States to remediate the high-level waste that is left over from \nthe cold war. Washington has a particular problem where they have tanks \nthat are leaking into the ground water. That needs to be fixed sooner \nrather than later.\n  The question is, What is clean? The question is, Are we going to \nallow South Carolina, Idaho, and Washington to work with the Department \nof Energy to take care of their specific needs and specific problems in \nan environmentally sound manner or are we going to give one group a \nveto power over everybody else?\n  I hope we do not. January 26, 2004, Congressman Hastings and Senators \nMurray and Cantwell sent a letter to Governor Locke and Secretary \nAbraham asking them to work together to resolve the ongoing dispute \npertaining to waste classification.\n  On February 2, the deputy secretary and Governor Locke connected. \nGovernor Locke indicated he would designate someone to enter into a \ndiscussion on behalf of the State of Washington.\n  That has been going on in South Carolina far before January 26. It is \ngoing on in Idaho. About 8 or 9 years ago Idaho reached agreement about \ncertain aspects of cleaning up of the Idaho sites. Each site has a \ndifferent problem and it is working with DOE in a way that is good for \neveryone, the State and at the Federal level, to clean up these sites.\n  The reason we are in court in Idaho is DOE unilaterally issued an \norder that gave them the authority to set the cleanup standards without \nconsulting with the States. They were trying to change the game or the \nagreement Idaho had with DOE, and Idaho sued and we--South Carolina and \nWashington--joined as a friend of the court, saying we will not sit on \nthe sidelines and watch the Department of Energy have the unilateral \nright to set cleanup standards. That is what we agree upon.\n  The amendment I have before the Senate does two important things. It \ndoes not allow the Department of Defense to withhold funds to Idaho and \nWashington unless they reach a similar agreement with South Carolina. \nIt does not make what is going on in South Carolina a Presidential \nevent, in terms of how it affects other States. It limits what is going \non in South Carolina to South Carolina. It does not disadvantage \nWashington or Idaho. They have the right, the obligation to enter into \nan agreement, if any, with DOE. What we are doing in South Carolina \nonly affects South Carolina. I will tell you in a moment what people in \nSouth Carolina who are in charge of our environmental needs say about \nthis agreement. I will read the letter from the Governor here in a \nmoment.\n  The Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the State of \nWashington, along with the State of Idaho, exchanged drafts and held \nconversations between January and April. There is a lot of paperwork \nout there that shows Idaho and Washington have been trying to do the \nsame thing we have been doing in South Carolina. Here is the \ndifference. We reached an agreement South Carolina likes that will get \nour tanks cleaned up in an environmentally sound manner. And listen to \nthis, it allows the tanks to be cleaned up, remediated, and closed 23 \nyears ahead of schedule, and it saves $16 billion to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  I hope Washington and Idaho can get there. If they ever do get there, \nif they ever do reach an agreement with the Department of Energy where \nthe Governor says I like it, where the environmental regulators say I \nlike it, where the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says this is waste \nincidental to reprocessing, that this can be done in a way that is \nenvironmentally sound--I hope I will help, not stand in the way.\n  So much was said that is so wrong about this issue. To my two friends \nfrom Idaho, you have taken some political abuse here that is so far \nfrom the truth that it is mind-boggling. What Senators Crapo and Craig \nhave been doing is they have been working with me, in conjunction with \nall three States, to make sure they get the money they are entitled to \nregardless of what we do in South Carolina, and they have been kind \nenough to work with me to make sure my State's agreement can go \nforward. We are doing nothing to prejudice the lawsuit of the State of \nIdaho or their ability to reach an independent agreement. I can assure \nyou, this is not blindsiding anybody because there is paperwork from \nJanuary all the way through to recent months between Idaho and \nWashington, talking with DOE about trying to find an agreement.\n  On February 25, 2004, Jessie Roberson, the Assistant Secretary for \nEnergy for Environmental Management came before Senator Allard in a \nhearing and talked about this extensively. He was asked numerous \nquestions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have an excerpt of that hearing printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Transcript on Waste Incidental to Reprocessing, Strategic Forces \n                Subcommittee Hearing, February 25, 2004\n\n\n  questions by senator wayne allard to ms. jessie roberson, assistant \n            secretary of energy for environmental management\n\n       ALLARD: Well, thank you very much for your participation. \n     It's invaluable to this committee.\n       I'm going to be referring in my questioning to WIR, which \n     stands for Waste Incidental Reprocessing. And I think it \n     would behoove the committee to hear, Secretary Roberson, you \n     summarize what the WIR issue is.\n       ROBERSON: Thank you, Chairman Allard. Thank you, Senator, \n     as well.\n       Clean-up of tank waste at Hanford, Idaho, and Savannah \n     River represents the greatest risk-reduction effort in the \n     department's entire clean-up program.\n       ALLARD: And this all falls under Waste Incidental \n     Reprocessing, is that correct?\n       ROBERSON: Absolutely.\n       ALLARD: Okay.\n       ROBERSON: And I'll explain what portion of the program that \n     specifically applies to.\n       ALLARD: Very good.\n       ROBERSON: Okay, we have planned at these three sites to \n     clean up tank waste, plans agreed to with our host states and \n     that the NRC had also carefully reviewed. At each site, our \n     plans acknowledge we would remove as much tank waste as we \n     could. We would separate the tank waste into two factions.\n       The first is a high-activity faction containing over 95 \n     percent of the radioactivity, which we would classify as \n     high-level waste and treat and dispose of in the repository \n     for spent fuel and high-level waste called for by the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act.\n       And then a low-activity faction, which we would classify as \n     low-level waste, incidental to reprocessing and, depending on \n     its characteristics, treat and dispose of in an appropriate \n     disposal facility for such material.\n       We would then determine whether we could demonstrate that \n     disposing of a small amount of residues remaining in the \n     tank, generally around one percent of the original volume, by \n     immobilizing it in place and determine--to ensure that it \n     would be comparable to the public health and safety \n     requirements for disposal of low-level waste in a near-\n     surface disposal facility. If it would, our plans were to \n     classify the residues as low-level waste, incidental to \n     reprocessing, to immobilize them in the tank and close the \n     tanks with these residues in place.\n       A key element of these plans is the classification of the \n     tank waste.\n       The problem we have encountered is that in July of 2003, an \n     Idaho district court struck down the waste incident to \n     reprocessing portion of DOE Order 435.1, the DOE order \n     addressing how DOE and its contractors classify waste under \n     the Atomic Energy Act. As a result, we now face uncertainty \n     in implementing the very plans our host states had agreed \n     made technical sense.\n       The classification of this waste is key to determining how \n     to dispose of it. Therefore, if we're unable to resolve this \n     issue regarding waste incidental to reprocessing, we face \n     leaving these tank wastes in place far longer than we and our \n     host states had anticipated. In fact, such delay would likely \n     create more serious health and safety risk to workers and \n     members of the public by leaving the waste in tanks longer \n     and risking leaks to ground water.\n       ALLARD: Madam Secretary, why do you have to leave any of \n     the waste residues behind?\n       ROBERSON: Mr. Chairman, let me just briefly describe the \n     size of these tanks and the nature of the waste removal in \n     question. Each tank can hold as much as 1.3 million gallons \n     of liquid waste. At Hanford, for example, the tanks are 75 \n     feet in diameter, and the tanks are of differing shapes. Some \n     are concave, which means they don't have a flat bottom.\n       ALLARD: I guess that's about the size of this room . . . .\n       (CROSSTALK)\n       ROBERSON: Under the tri-party agreement at Hanford between \n     DOE, Washington state and EPA, which governs the clean-up at \n     that site, the goal is that we retrieve 99 percent of the \n     tank waste. If all of the remaining waste were on the bottom \n     of the tank, it would be just under one inch thick.\n       Because of radiological concerns with exposure for workers, \n     tank waste removal must be done remotely. In addition, these \n     tanks usually sit below 10 feet of soil cover. Our retrieval \n     equipment must fit into openings two inches to two feet wide. \n     And tank structures are not designed to support heavy loads \n     for which equipment must be deployed to do the tank cleaning. \n     So it is not a simple task to scrape the last remaining tank \n     residues from a tank.\n       Further, much of the waste residues are expected to have a \n     stiff consistency. Most removal techniques require directing \n     pressurized water streams at the remaining waste to \n     immobilize it and to move it to a location which can be \n     pumped.\n       ROBERSON: We have spent over 10 years working on \n     technologies to improve removal opportunities of the waste \n     from these tanks.\n       Finally, many of the tanks are over 40 years old. And a \n     number of them have known leak sites, requiring us to \n     exercise great care to preclude water leaking from the tank.\n       As I said, DOE spent tens of millions of dollars exploring \n     how to get as much residual waste as possible out of the \n     tanks.\n       ALLARD: What is the material you plan to leave in the \n     tanks?\n       ROBERSON: We think the residues, when stabilized, are \n     appropriately considered low-level waste, suitable for \n     shallow land burial. Analysis will be performed to ensure \n     that they meet performance objectives established by DOE and \n     the NRC for low-level waste performance objectives.\n       In fact, that is what the order that was struck down by the \n     judge's ruling required.\n       ALLARD: Now, shouldn't the waste characteristics and the \n     risks they pose be what matters in terms of safe disposal \n     rather than the process that created the waste?\n       ROBERSON: Yes, Mr. Chairman, we believe so. And we believe \n     that that is the philosophy behind the clean-up plans in \n     place for those sites.\n       ALLARD: And how much more than your current estimates might \n     this cost the American taxpayers?\n       ROBERSON: Our preliminary assessment was that it would cost \n     as much as $50 billion more over the life-cycle of the \n     department's clean-up program and extend that life-cycle by \n     decades to have to process all of our tank waste as high-\n     level waste for disposal in a geologic repository, including \n     exhuming the tanks themselves, cutting them up and packaging \n     them for disposal.\n       ALLARD: So what is the risk if you have to do that?\n       ROBERSON: Clearly, the risk to workers, and frankly to the \n     environment, is much larger if we have to exhume tanks. Given \n     that we cannot proceed with our clean-up plans that were \n     based on our waste classification order, we risk leaving \n     waste in tanks much longer than we had planned right now.\n       We also add to environmental risk by the need to dispose of \n     the large amounts of metals resulting from the almost 250 \n     large tanks and the associated equipment. Our analysis thus \n     far indicates that we would increase worker exposure 10 \n     fold. We would increase costs 10 fold and achieve no \n     meaningful improvement in environmental protection.\n       ALLARD: So I don't see what the rational benefit is to the \n     American taxpayer from the department having to implement the \n     Idaho district court decision.\n       ROBERSON: Frankly, Senator, we don't see it either, which \n     is why we are pursuing this. Rather than accelerating clean-\n     up of tank waste in agreement with our host states, we face \n     stopping much of that work.\n       ALLARD: What is your plan for resolving this WIR issue:\n       ROBERSON: Accelerated clean up of tank waste is a top \n     priority for the entire department and the states that host \n     our facilities. As pointed out in the General Accounting \n     Office report completed last year, the WIR, waste incidental \n     to reprocessing issue, poses a significant vulnerability for \n     the department.\n       Consistent with both the GAO recommendations to seek \n     legislative clarification regarding DOE's authority to \n     classify tank waste and with the request by the House \n     Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee last year, we \n     proposed draft legislation to Congress that would clarify our \n     authority for managing such waste.\n       We have since held discussions with affected states over \n     the impact the Idaho district court decision had on our \n     activities in Hanford, Idaho, and Savannah River, in order to \n     seek to address issues they have raised about our proposed \n     legislative approach.\n       In addition, we've just filed our opening brief in our \n     appeal of the Idaho court decision to continue our litigation \n     efforts to resolve the WIR issue. Without timely resolution \n     to this issue, not only could we be unable to implement our \n     clean-up plans, but DOE also could be forced to realign its \n     resources across the complex in a manner that would \n     significantly distort the department's clean-up and other \n     priorities.\n       ALLARD: What about the $350 million, and what does it take \n     to get that money released?\n       ROBERSON: The Department's fiscal year 2005 budget request \n     includes $350 million in a high-level waste proposal that \n     reflects the need to satisfactorily resolve this issue to \n     support clean-up. These funds will be requested only to the \n     extent that legal uncertainties concerning disposition of \n     these wastes are resolved.\n       Until we can resolve the legal uncertainties related to \n     WIR, it does not make sense for us to proceed with projects \n     that prepare tank waste for disposition as other than high-\n     level waste destined for deep geologic depository.\n       ALLARD: I want to thank you for your response.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. There was another Energy and Water \nhearing where the same topic was brought before the Congress. The topic \nis, how are you doing with your efforts to reach agreements with the \nthree States in question to find cleanup standards they can agree to \nthat are environmentally sound, that will allow things to go forward in \na more expeditious manner?\n  The truth is, we have spent billions of dollars talking about \ncleaning up and we have done nothing but let tanks leak and have waste \nstay around for years and decades. Now we have a new model. Now we have \nnew money, $350\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nmillion of new dollars, and we are using commonsense approaches to \ncleanup.\n  What are we trying to do in South Carolina? If I can explain very \nquickly. I am not a scientist, but I do have fairly good common sense. \nThe 51 tanks that have high-level waste, those tanks will be cleaned \nup. The liquid in those tanks will be converted to glass logs, it is \ncalled vitrification, and that will be sent to Yucca Mountain.\n  What we are trying to do is clean these tanks up in a manner \nconsistent with safety for South Carolina. The amendment says no tank \ncan be closed unless the State of South Carolina issues a closure \npermit. The letter from my Governor says, not only am I aware of what \nyou are doing, Senator Graham, I support it because it will allow the \ntanks to be closed up 23 years ahead of schedule, it will save money, \nand we don't have to worry about tanks deteriorating.\n  The plan is to take all of the liquid out and the film on the bottom, \nwhich will be 1 to 1.5 inches, treated with concrete and other \nmaterials and the tank will be closed. To get that 1 to 1.5 inches out \nof the bottom of that tank will cost $16 billion and take 23 additional \nyears and put people's lives at risk for no good reason, no good \nenvironmental reason.\n  Every State is trying to define what is clean for their State. \nWashington is trying to do the same thing. Maybe they will want half an \ninch. I don't know what they want. Idaho is trying to do the same \nthing. We have done it and I have a Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nreport that says what is left in that tank after treatment is waste \nincidental to reprocessing, not high-level waste.\n  The people in my State who regulate the environment have sent a \nletter saying we want this agreement because we have final say over \nwhere you close the tank and the standards we have negotiated we think \nare good for South Carolina. The only reason we are having this \nargument is they don't want one State to go--I guess some groups want \nto have the leverage of all three States to get standards they believe \nare better than those by the South Carolina folks who regulate our \nenvironment, and they are trying to use some standard that may not be \nnecessary for Idaho and South Carolina. We don't have the same problems \nthey do in Washington.\n  I will stand behind any Senator from Washington to make sure DOE \ndoesn't run over them. I will stand behind any Senator from Idaho to \nmake sure they can negotiate on their own terms. I am asking this body \nto approve an agreement that is environmentally sound, fiscally \nresponsible, that affects South Carolina, and is what all three States \nare trying to achieve.\n  I have had printed in the Record the letter from my Governor. I have \nhad printed the study from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed the letter from the Department of \nHealth and Environment Control in South Carolina, saying this is good \nfor the State, they retain control over the tanks, and this is \nenvironmentally sound.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    June 30, 2000.\n     Mr. Roy J. Schepens,\n     Assistant Manager for High-Level Waste, U.S. Department of \n         Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, Aiken, SC.\n\n Savannah River Site High Level Waste Tank closure: Classification of \n                      Residual Waste as Incidental\n\n       Dear Mr. Schepens: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     (NRC) has completed the review of the tank closure \n     methodology for the high-level waste (HLW) tanks at the \n     Savannah River Site (SRS). Under the terms and conditions of \n     the Department of Energy (DOE)/NRC Memorandum of \n     Understanding and the DOE/NRC Interagency Agreement, both \n     dated July 9, 1997, the NRC is acting in an advisory capacity \n     and is not providing regulatory approval. The focus of the \n     review was whether or not the residual waste left in the HLW \n     tanks, after cleaning, could be labeled as incidental waste. \n     The criteria for incidental waste were approved by the \n     Commission in the Staff Requirements Memorandum (SRM) dated \n     February 16, 1993, in response to SECY-92-391, ``Denial of \n     PRM 60-4--Petition for Rulemaking from the States of \n     Washington and Oregon Regarding Classification of Radioactive \n     Waste at Hanford,'' and described in the March 2, 1993, \n     letter from R. Bernero, NRC, to J. Lytle, DOE. The review \n     focused on DOE's ``Regulatory Basis for Incidental Waste \n     Classification at the Savannah River Site High-Level Waste \n     Tank Farms,'' ``High-Level Waste Tank Closure Program Plan,'' \n     ``Environmental Radiological Analysis, Fate and Transport \n     Modeling of Residual Contaminants and Human Health Impacts \n     from the F-Area High-Level Waste Tank Farm,'' ``Industrial \n     Wastewater Closure Module for the High-Level Waste Tank 17 \n     System,'' and ``Industrial Wastewater Closure Module for the \n     High-Level Waste Tank 20 System.'' It also included the \n     responses (letter from R. Schepens, DOE, to K. Stablein, NRC, \n     September 30, 1998) to the request for additional \n     information, as well as information resulting from the April \n     1, 1999, public meeting between NRC and DOE staff. The \n     results of the NRC staff review are enclosed to provide input \n     to your decision. DOE is responsible for determining whether \n     the residual tank waste can be classified as incidental.\n       Your tank closure methodology proposes using the incidental \n     waste criteria approved by the Commission in the February 16, \n     1993 SRM and stated in the March 2, 1993, letter from R. \n     Bernero, NRC, to J. Lytle, DOE, that were established for the \n     treatment and disposal of removed HLW. In reviewing your \n     methodology, staff took a generic performance-based approach \n     rather than strictly applying the criteria developed in 1993. \n     Criterion One from the March 1993, letter specified that ``. \n     . . wastes have been processed (or will be further processed) \n     to remove key radionuclides to the maximum extent that is \n     technically and economically practical.'' DOE identified only \n     water washing and oxalic acid washing as technically \n     feasible with regards to removal of key radionuclides \n     following bulk waste removal. Water washing and bulk waste \n     removal have been shown to be capable of removing 98 \n     percent of the initial tank activity. Depending on the \n     initial sludge inventories, oxalic acid washing, or \n     comparable cleaning, will be required on selected tanks, \n     although it is not considered to be economically practical \n     for all 51 tanks.\n       The sampling methods used to characterize the HLW tanks at \n     SRS have been evaluated. Several different sampling \n     techniques were used. In general, the sampling process for \n     Tanks 17 and 20 was adequate. NRC staff has concluded that \n     available removal technologies have been extensively examined \n     to determine those that are both technically and economically \n     practical, and that the residual waste left in the tanks is \n     limited to waste that cannot be removed by application of \n     those technologies currently considered technically and \n     economically practical for HLW tank cleaning. As the HLW tank \n     closure process evolves over the next several decades the \n     technical and economic feasibility of other waste removal \n     options should continue to be evaluated.\n       The staff recommends that a set waste sampling protocol \n     should be developed and followed. The number of samples \n     obtained will be a function of the tank contents, as well as \n     the homogeneity of the sludge. All sample results should be \n     compared to process estimates to ensure consistency and \n     accuracy. Any significant inconsistencies resulting from tank \n     sampling and process history should result in further \n     sampling.\n       The staff review generally found that DOE's methodology for \n     removal of key radionuclides to the maximum extent \n     economically and technically practical achieves the \n     objectives of Criterion One.\n       The staff review of Criterion Two, `` . . . wastes will be \n     incorporated in a solid physical form at a concentration that \n     does not exceed the applicable concentration limits for class \n     C low-level waste as set out in 10 CFR Part 61,'' made use of \n     information you provided on initial tank inventories and \n     expected removal efficiencies. Fourteen of the 51 HLW tanks \n     are anticipated to meet Class C limits by utilizing \n     concentration averaging with only bulk waste removal and \n     water washing. The other 37 tanks would require chemical \n     cleaning via oxalic acid washing to meet Class C limits, even \n     with the application of concentration averaging. DOE, \n     therefore, plans to rely on alternative considerations of the \n     classification of waste, rather than planning to use oxalic \n     acid cleaning to meet Class C concentration limits. In \n     particular, DOE relies on its plans to solidify the waste in \n     layers of grout, some 30 feet below the surface of the \n     ground, and relies on the disposal site, which it considers \n     to be stable. In addition, it appears that there is \n     reasonable assurance that the performance objectives of 10 \n     CFR Part 61, Subpart C can be met without meeting the Class C \n     concentration limits for all tanks. These considerations are \n     similar to those in 10 CFR 61.58 of the Commission's \n     regulations, and are viewed by DOE as providing comparable \n     protection to an inadvertent intruder. Staff believes that \n     concentration averaging in accordance with the Branch \n     Technical Position on Concentration Averaging, is generally \n     acceptable in this context to meet Class C concentration \n     limits, and recognizes that the alternative provisions for \n     waste classification proposed by DOE are generally similar to \n     those in 10 CFR 61.58. Staff recommends that DOE develop \n     site-specific concentration limits for residual waste in the \n     SRS HLW tanks in order to bound the associated analyses and \n     to provide a specific benchmark for satisfactory cleaning of \n     the tanks.\n       As for the portion of Criterion Two that addresses the \n     solid physical form, the staff believes that the waste has \n     been sufficiently immobilized to help prevent inadvertent \n     intrusion. By utilizing three different types of grout, the \n     waste is further protected. The initial reducing grout pour \n     helps to reduce\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\n     the mobility of the radionuclides. The middle layer of grout \n     provides a solid foundation to guard against subsidence, and, \n     finally, the top layer of strong grout provides protection \n     against physical penetration of the waste. Therefore, the \n     physical form aspect of Criterion Two appears to be achieved \n     by our methodology.\n       Assessing Criterion Three, `` . . . wastes are to be \n     managed, pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act, so that safety \n     requirements comparable to the performance objectives set out \n     in 10 CFR Part 61 are satisfied'' involves the evaluation of \n     the tank farm performance assessment (PA).\n       DOE has indicated that it intends to meet a 4 mrem/yr \n     drinking water dose limit. From standard dose modeling \n     methodology, the drinking water dose is expected to be the \n     largest dose contributor pathway. It appears from the \n     performance assessment that the drinking water dose will be \n     less than the 4 mrem/yr drinking water dose limit, and by \n     extrapolation, that the individual dose will be less than the \n     25 mrem/yr total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) requirement \n     of 10 CFR 61.41. In meeting the performance objective of \n     Sec. 61.41, reliance on institutional controls beyond 100 \n     years will not be needed, although DOE has proposed \n     institutional controls in perpetuity. Future PAs should focus \n     on meeting the performance objectives of 10 CFR Part 61 \n     Subpart C and should not rely on any active institutional \n     controls beyond 100 years. The NRC staff has concluded that \n     the DOE methodology will achieve safety objectives comparable \n     to Sec. 61.41.\n       To show protection of an inadvertent intruder, the standard \n     agriculture scenario consists of a farmer who lives at the \n     tank farm, and drills a well near the tank farm and then uses \n     the well water to irrigate his crops and feed his livestock \n     as well as himself. DOE-SR has provided only calculated \n     drinking water doses for this intruder scenario. DOE's \n     intruder PA showed that the maximum drinking water dose the \n     farmer would receive via the ground-water pathway was 130 \n     mrem/year at a well distance of 1 meter from the tank farm, \n     at approximately 700 years. According to DOE-SR, the drinking \n     water dose pathway is expected to be the highest dose \n     contributor and, therefore, provides reasonable assurance of \n     protection of individuals from inadvertent intrusion using a \n     500 mrem/year limit. The DOE-SR analysis assumes all activity \n     is contained within the reducing grout layer located at the \n     bottom of each tank, and that this contaminant zone is not \n     disturbed. This then implies that there is no activity in any \n     vertical component of the tank structure and, therefore, a \n     typical construction scenario (with a 10 foot deep basement) \n     would not disturb any contaminated portion of the tank \n     structure.\n       The staff recommends that future performance assessments \n     for SR tank closures, including individual tank closure \n     modules, and the H-Tank Farm Fate and Transport Modeling, \n     include the full agriculture scenario (all pathways) as well \n     as the discovery scenario, as described in the Draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement for 10 CFR Part 61. Staff also \n     notes that closure of ancillary piping and equipment must \n     consider an inadvertent intruder. That is, performance \n     assessment must consider disturbed surface piping and \n     equipment, which, in addition to tank sources, must not \n     exceed a TEDE of 500 mrem per year (all pathways) for the \n     discovery and agricultural scenarios. Furthermore, all \n     external components (e.g., piping) have not been demonstrated \n     to provide the same protection to an inadvertent intruder as \n     the residual waste in the HLW tank bottoms. Without the \n     proper intruder scenarios (e.g., intruder-agriculture) the \n     NRC does not recognize in-situ disposal of external \n     components as achieving the objectives of Criterion Three.\n       The worker is protected by DOE regulations which are \n     analogous to 10 CFR Part 20. The worker protection \n     performance objectives of Sec. 61.43 is, therefore, \n     considered to be adequately addressed. By filling the tanks \n     with three layers of grout, the site stability performance \n     objectives of Sec. 61.44 can also be satisfied.\n       The staff recommends that future tank closure modeling \n     should include a more thorough PA for all predicted or known \n     source terms (i.e., all HLW tanks) in the F-Area Tank Farm \n     and including the following: early degradation of grout, \n     degradation of ancillary equipment and piping, combined \n     aquifer scenarios, conservative distribution coefficient \n     analysis, conservative radionuclide dispersion analysis, \n     submerged tanks, conservative analysis for the horizontal \n     versus vertical flux radiouclide transport processes for the \n     saturated zone, and a complete all-pathways dose assessment. \n     See the enclosed Technical Evaluation Report for further \n     details and additional recommendations. In addition, future \n     tank closure modeling (including individual tank closure \n     modules, as well as fate and transport modeling for H-Tank \n     Farm) should not refer to, or be reliant on in any way, \n     previous modules. This will avoid confusion and errors \n     associated with outdated data and assumptions.\n       By generally achieving each of the performance objectives \n     stated in 10 CFR Part 61, Subpart C, the staff has concluded \n     that the tank closure methodology is consistent with the \n     objectives of Criterion Three.\n       Based on the information provided the staff has concluded \n     that the methodology for tank closure at SRS appears to \n     reasonably analyze the relevant considerations for Criterion \n     One and Criterion Three of the three incidental waste \n     criteria. DOE would undertake cleanup to the maximum extent \n     that is technically and economically practical, and would \n     demonstrate it can meet performance objectives consistent \n     with those required for disposal of low-level waste. These \n     commitments, if satisfied, should serve to provide adequate \n     protection of public health and safety. Further, DOE's \n     methodology relies on alternative classification \n     considerations similar to those contained in the Commission's \n     regulations at 10 CFR 61.58. The NRC staff, from a safety \n     perspective, therefore does not disagree with DOE-SR's \n     proposed methodology, contingent upon DOE reaching current \n     goals for bulk waste removal, as well as water and chemical \n     washing, such that the performance objectives comparable to \n     those stated in Subpart C 10 CFR 61 are met. In addition, NRC \n     judgment as to the adequacy of the methodology is dependent \n     on verification that the assumptions underlying the analysis \n     are correct.\n       The analysis performed regarding the proposed tank closure \n     methodology for the HLW tanks located at the DOE Savannah \n     River Site was performed by NRC according to the terms and \n     conditions of the established Memorandum of Understanding and \n     the Interagency Agreement. The analysis and resulting NRC \n     conclusions are specific only to the 51 tanks located at the \n     DOE Savannah River F and H Area tank farms, and related \n     piping and equipment. The NRC assessment is a site-specific \n     evaluation, and is not a precedent for any future decisions \n     on waste classification scenarios at other sites, \n     particularly sites under NRC jurisdiction.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              William F. Kane,\n\n                                       Director, Office of Nuclear\n                                   Material Safety and Safeguards.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. With that, to be continued. Thank you. \nHappy holidays.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year \n2005 Defense authorization bill. I want to first commend Chairman \nWarner and Senator Levin, who have continued their tradition of strong \nand bipartisan leadership. I also want to thank my friend, colleague \nand subcommittee chairman Senator Ensign, for his cooperation and \nleadership throughout this process this year.\n  While I think the bill before us goes a long way to supporting the \nneeds of our service men and women, I do want to highlight a few \nconcerns.\n  First, I am pleased that the administration finally followed \nCongress' lead and sent a request for an additional $25 billion to \nbegin to address the ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for the first few months of fiscal year 2005. While I do \nnot support the structure of the administration's request, in part \nbecause it does not do enough to ensure accountability for how these \nfunds would be used, I do support its intent, and I think it is \nimperative that we include an authorization of additional funding in \nthe final version of this bill.\n  Second, while I support every action to aid our brave men and women \nin the armed forces, who are making so many sacrifices as they fight \nfor our freedoms, I am concerned and disappointed by some of the \nactions we have taken in the bill we are reporting to the Senate. My \ngreatest concern lies, as it did last year, in the reductions we have \nmade in the working capital funds of the military services and defense \nagencies. While I disagreed with the cuts in these accounts last year, \nthe ones this year are even more harmful, as DOD is already tapping \nthese accounts to the greatest possible extent to get through the \nremainder of this fiscal year. So they will already be well below \nnormal cash balances as they enter fiscal year 2005, and the $1.6 \nbillion in reductions we have recommended in this bill will increase \nthe risk of readiness problems by decreasing DOD's ability to provide \nspare parts, maintenance, and other support for our forces that are \ncritical to their continued success. By cutting into these accounts, I \nbelieve we are sending a message that we do not support our troops, a \nmessage that I know could not be further from the truth.\n  Our forces deserve armored vehicles to protect them in Iraq, but they \nalso deserve the spare parts they need to keep those vehicles running. \nWhen our troops come home, they deserve to have those vehicles \nrepaired, rather than wait for maintenance from a depot until parts \narrive that could have been ordered earlier if the working capital \nfunds had had sufficient cash. We owe them the courage to make tough \ndecisions to ensure that those needs are met now, not when future funds \nnot yet requested may or may not become available.\n  On the positive side, I am pleased about our continued support for \nmilitary construction and family housing\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nneeds that are so critical to quality of life for our service men and \nwomen. I also support many of the provisions we have included that will \nfurther improve the management of the department. I particularly \nappreciate the bipartisan effort that the staff has made to address a \nwide range of procurement issues, environmental issues, and \nlongstanding DOD financial management problems.\n  While I support the overall actions taken in this bill, and commend \nall of my colleagues for the hard work that they have invested, as \nranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee I have mixed feelings \nabout our actions. We have increased funding for some key programs, but \nat the expense of others where the impact might be more easily \nobscured. Our experience with the Air Force over the last few years has \nshown that there is a direct correlation between increased spare parts \nand mission capable rates for aircraft; those spare parts are provided \nthrough the Air Force Working Capital Fund. The Navy expects to have \nonly a few days of cash on hand at the end of this fiscal year, and may \nbe forced to bill customers before they actually receive their orders. \nAnd the Army faces a situation where its orders for parts and other key \nitems exceed its cash on hand by more than 700 percent. Wartime, when \nwe see a great expansion of customer needs for readiness and large \nfluctuations in required support, is not the time to take on more \nreadiness risk by decreasing cash balances in the working capital \nfunds. It hurts readiness, and it hurts the men and women who serve in \nuniform.\n  By reducing funding for the readiness accounts and failing to provide \nany supplemental funding for 2005, this bill does not do enough to meet \nthe most pressing needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  I will support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I \nthink it is a good bill that could have been better, and I will \ncontinue to work throughout the rest of the authorization process to \nimprove it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5934-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, as we are wrapping up the session this \nweek, I think it is very important to note what we all read in the \nWashington Post today. Something very serious was clearly spelled out. \nThat is that the General Accounting Office has concluded the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services illegally spent Federal money \non what amounted to covert propaganda, by producing videos about the \nMedicare changes that were made to look like news reports. Portions of \nthe videos which had been aired by 40 television stations around the \ncountry do not make it clear that the announcers were paid by Health \nand Human Services, or paid by taxpayers, and that they were not real \nreporters.\n  In fact, the administration has violated two Federal laws. This comes \nfrom the nonpartisan arm, the Congressional Investigative Services, the \nGeneral Accounting Office.\n  They indicated two different laws that the administration broke in \nthese ads on Medicare.\n  No. 1, the Omnibus appropriations bill of 2003: The prohibition on \nusing appropriated funds for publicity or propaganda purposes.\n  No. 2, the Anti-Deficiency Act: Incurred obligations in excess of \nappropriations available for that purpose.\n  This is just one more example of the ongoing saga in what happened in \nrelationship to the passage of the new Medicare law and all of the \nirregularities--the pronouncement that, in fact, the law was violated \nand the other ethics investigations going on.\n  Let me go through some of what else is happening. It is stunning, \nactually, when you look at the full picture. I would argue that this is \nabsolutely in the wrong direction and against the interests of those \nwho count on Medicare--our seniors and disabled, and the American \ntaxpayers who have been funding what the GAO says are illegal ads.\n  In addition to that, 2 weeks ago, the Congressional Research Service \nconcluded that the administration potentially violated the law in a \nrelated matter in which the Medicare Program's chief actuary has said \nhe was threatened with firing a year ago if he shared with Congress \ncost estimates that the Medicare legislation would be one-third more \nexpensive than what we were told--one-third more expensive than the \n$400 billion the President said it would cost.\n  Also, the House ethics panel meanwhile is investigating whether \nRepublican leaders attempted to bribe or coerce a Republican House \nMember--in fact, someone in my own State--to vote for the bill before \nit passed by a few votes just before dawn after the longest record \nrollcall in the history of the House.\n  We have numerous other challenges and questions. It is important to \nnote for the record that the latest investigation by the GAO was not \nprompted by our side of the aisle, nor requested. It was something they \nlooked into on their own separate from other concerns which have been \nraised. We have raised issues that relate to the advertising we have \nseen on television.\n  Concerning materials, the GAO indicated that, while they were not \nspecifically in violation, the HHS materials have notable omissions and \nother weaknesses. They say it is a question of prudence and \nappropriateness for HHS's decision to communicate by placing \nadvertising in Roll Call, which we all know is something that we read \nand certainly our constituents and the seniors and the disabled of the \ncountry do not read.\n  This goes on and on, questions of violating the law and questions of \nan ethics violation.\n  Now we see, in fact, that the administration specifically has broken \ntwo different laws. One of the questions is, What do we do about that? \nI think the public deserves the answer to that. What is it that we do \nwhen the administration violates the law as it relates to spending \npublic dollars and advertising as it relates to this Medicare bill?\n  A colleague of mine is suggesting--since we know it is a campaign \nyear and we know this is put forward certainly to put the best light on \nthis for the administration--the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg, has suggested that the President repay the funds from his \nPresidential campaign.\n\n  Given what we know is happening this year and the fact that certainly \nthe administration wants to have the best face put on this Medicare \npackage and certainly has everything to gain from using public dollars \nto advertise that, I think it would be appropriate to ask the President \nto repay that from his campaign funds. In fact, they are in violation \nof the law.\n  We have seen questionable action after questionable action. The head \nof the center of Medicare and Medicaid, after writing this bill and \nworking closely with the industry that benefits from it--the \npharmaceutical industry--leaves to take a job with folks involved in \nthe industry that will make money off of this new law.\n  We have seen other individuals leaving and going into lucrative \npositions where they will themselves be making money off of this new \nlaw.\n  We know it has been analyzed and that the pharmaceutical industry \nwill be making, during the next 8 years, about $139 billion in new \nprofits. That is tough to do if you are lowering prices and tough to do \nif you are providing a real Medicare benefit to seniors which they can \nafford.\n  The reality is that is not what this bill does. This bill doesn't \nallow Medicare to be able to negotiate group discounts as we do through \nthe VA.\n  It creates a situation where up to 40 million seniors and disabled \nare locked into the highest possible prices--not only in our country \nbut in the world. We have a bill that locks in high prices.\n  The industry is making billions of dollars from it. People from the \nadministration are going to work for the industry or related businesses \nthat will be making money off of this process.\n  We now see a situation where, again, the taxpayer money that was put \naside\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\nto be able to explain the Medicare bill has actually been used in a way \nthat is in violation of the law.\n  I say again that the GAO concluded that the Department of Health and \nHuman Services illegally spent Federal money--taxpayers' money--on what \namounted to covert propaganda by producing videos about the Medicare \nchanges that were made.\n  Another piece of that which is extremely disconcerting to me is we \nnow have discount cards for seniors for those who qualify for \nMedicare--depending on where you live--and there could be 60 or 70 \ndifferent cards that you now can attempt to wade through to try to find \na discount card that will help you when you really are struggling to \npay for your medicine.\n  We are now finding since passing the Medicare bill that many of the \nname brand companies have dramatically increased the prices of their \nproducts in anticipation of the discount card. The base is higher. That \nis like the storeowner who marked up the product 25 percent and then \nput a sign out that says: ``15 percent sale.'' That is what is \nhappening to many of our seniors.\n  To add insult to injury, those who purchase cards--most of them are \npurchased for about $30--lock themselves into one card for a year after \nwading through all of the different cards. They pick the one that \ncovers the medicines they use. They purchase the card and they are \nlocked into it for a year, but the business, the industry can change \nevery 7 days the list of what is covered. Today, four medicines are not \ncovered; next week maybe two aren't covered; and next week maybe none \nof them are covered.\n  Why would this be set up like this? It is confusing. They are not \nreal discounts. The discounts are changed. It is certainly not set up \nfor the people who depend on Medicare every day.\n  Once again, the implementation of the bill that passed is being done \nin a way that helps the industry that already makes billions and \nbillions of dollars in producing the products, but it is not helping \nour seniors. We want industry to be successful.\n  Taxpayers help subsidize the billions of dollars of research given \nfree to the industry. We provide tax credits, tax deductions, writeoffs \nand patents. All we ask at the end of the day is that people can afford \ntheir medicine, that people can afford oftentimes the lifesaving \nmedicine they need for their cancer, diabetes, or other chronic \ndisease.\n  This is serious. We debated and had a lot of hoopla about a new law \nin Medicare. We have seen nothing but broken promises, broken laws, \nbroken ethics rules since the adoption of the law. I suggest it is time \nto start over. We can do better. It is time to scrap this benefit, \nstart over, get it right, follow the law, follow the ethics rules, \nnegotiate group prices, get a real benefit, bring prices down. That is \nwhat our seniors expected the first time. It is time we make a \ncommitment to get it right.\n  I am very hopeful between now and the end of the session in the fall \nthat we are going to turn around and get this right. Scrap the old bill \nand pass a new one that focuses on helping our seniors and bringing \ndown prescription drug prices for everyone. And by the way, it is time \nto follow the law in the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take a few minutes to clarify points \nfrom the debate we had prior to moving off the DOE bill and the \nspecifics of the Graham amendment.\n  I know my colleague, the Senator from South Carolina, is probably \nsomewhere still in the vicinity of the Senate. I, too, admire the \nSenator from South Carolina on a variety of issues, particularly on \nNational Guard issues and some of the challenges we have had, both \ncoming from States that have been hard hit economically and challenged \nwith a large number of people participating in our efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This issue that he and I disagree on obviously is one of \nutmost importance and certainly one that needs a lot of attention by \nthe Members of this body. We will get that time and attention when we \nreturn to DOE after the recess.\n  I bring up a couple of points made that are the crux of my concern \nabout this legislation; that is, that section 3116 of the underlying \nbill, the Defense authorization bill, attempts to reclassify high-level \nnuclear waste into a low-level material and allow it to be disposed of \nin a different way.\n  I object to that and I object to the process by which that \nlegislation was drafted. The Senate Armed Services Committee does not \nhave jurisdiction over the ability to reclassify waste. That is a \nchange to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act drafted in 1982. If the \nDepartment of Energy wants to have that debate, then the Department of \nEnergy should come down here and have hearings before the appropriate \ncommittees and discuss that issue. But to have such a major policy \nchange of 30 years' policy since 1982 and 50 years of science saying \nthis is what high-level nuclear waste is and one day changing it in the \nDOD bill is beyond absurd. Obviously, that is why we have spent time \nthis afternoon talking about it.\n\n  The chairman of the committee asked me in a question whether that \ncommittee has jurisdiction over the issue. I know that DOE many times \nhas tried with various environmental issues to have them go through the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, environmental issues such as the \nResource Conservation Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Endangered Species Act. \nAll of those, even though they are DOE issues, do not go through the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. In fact, the committee even said they \nare not part of our issues. Those are environmental policies or \npolicies for other committees and referred to those specific \ncommittees.\n  I read to my colleagues rule XXV earlier regarding what the \njurisdiction of the Senate Armed Services Committee is. It is specific \nto the national interests that were necessary in creating nuclear fuel. \nThat was an offshoot of the reactors used in the development of \nplutonium for our efforts in World War II and the cold war, but they do \nnot have the legislative oversight of the cleanup policy. That is the \nprerogative of other committees, the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  To make my point, I took section 3116 of this bill, this section that \nreclassifies waste, and introduced it today as my own legislation and \nasked for a referral. If we took this section on reclassification now \nas a stand-alone bill, let's see where it was referred to. That bill, \nSenate bill 2457, by Senator Cantwell, was referred to the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. That proves my point, that this policy \nchange is not the jurisdiction of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nand the Senate Armed Services Committee should not try, in a closed-\ndoor session, in secrecy without having a public hearing, without \nhaving a public debate, to change policy of this significant nature \nwhich is not the jurisdiction of their committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nthat was also sent to the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman and \nranking member asking them not to pass this legislation out of \ncommittee, and that it was the jurisdiction of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2004.\n      Hon. John W. Warner, Chairman,\n      Hon. Carl Levin, Ranking Democratic Member,\n      Committee on Armed Services,\n      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Warner and Senator Levin:  I am writing to \n     urge you not to include language relating to the \n     reclassification of high-level radioactive defense wastes \n     proposed by Senator Graham of South Carolina in the defense \n     authorization bill.\n        For thirty years, it has been the policy of this nation \n     that the high-level radioactive defense wastes temporarily \n     stored in tanks at Savannah River and elsewhere would, in \n     time, be removed from those tanks and permanently disposed of \n     in new facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission. Enactment of Senator Graham's amendment would \n     abandon that policy and permit the Department of Energy, in \n     its discretion, to reclassify an unknown part of the tank \n     wastes as transuranic or low-level\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\n     waste and either leave it where it is or ship it to New \n     Mexico for disposal in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant as \n     transuranic waste, or to some other state for shallow land \n     burial as low-level waste.\n        In addition, Senator Graham's amendment would exempt the \n     Department's handling of these wastes from licensing and \n     regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Its \n     enactment would have profound consequences for the nation's \n     high-level nuclear waste policy, which is under the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources. It would also interfere in litigation now pending \n     before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit.\n        For all of these reasons, I urge you not to include \n     Senator Graham's amendment in the defense authorization bill.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Bingaman.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am trying to make the point that the \nranking member of the committee, and now the parliamentarian, have \nagreed that this is not the jurisdiction of this committee.\n  I ask my colleagues to weigh that in the time we have away from here, \nto drop this policy as it relates to trying to reclassify waste without \nhaving the proper public hearing and public comment about the issues.\n  Yes, everyone has heard of DOE attempts to try to reclassify this \nwaste. It is well known that they actually tried to do it by order \nthemselves and were shot down in court. They were shot down in court \nbecause specifically they do not have the authority. They have to \nchange the definition under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. If they want \nto do that, debate it on the Hill, have this discussion, and move \nforward.\n  I make a point that cleanup around America--whether it is in South \nCarolina, in the Savannah River, or whether it is Washington State at \nthe Hanford reservation, whether it is Idaho or any other facility in \nthis country--should be continuing. There is nothing about any court \ncase or any court battle that prohibits the Department of Energy from \ncontinuing with cleanup. I hope they understand that is the judgment \nand the clarification of the court that ruled.\n  If my colleague from South Carolina is hearing that nuclear waste \ncleanup may be going slow or may be put on hold in the future, that is \nthe absolute wrong message from the Department of Energy. Congress has \nappropriated funds, has appropriated funds in the past, and they should \nbe going about their cleanup job.\n  What we are not going to do as a body is whitewash a change of \nsignificant nature where we do not have science backing that says we \nought to reclassify this waste. In fact, science has been very specific \nin saying this is not a simple proposition.\n  In 1990, the National Academy of Science said:\n\n       There is strong worldwide consensus that the best, and \n     safest, long-term option for dealing with HLW is geologic \n     isolation.\n\n  Again, not grouting waste in existing tanks but removing the waste \nand putting it in a geological isolation, as we have suggested, and \nothers have suggested, at Yucca Mountain.\n  A 1992 report by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory said:\n\n       The grouts will remain at elevated temperatures for many \n     years. The high temperatures expected during the first few \n     decades after disposal will increase the driving force for \n     water vapor transport away from the grouts; the loss of water \n     may result in cracking . . .\n\n  A 1992 study on this issue regarding just pouring cement and sand on \nnuclear waste and somehow storing it and solidifying it in the ground \nsaid there would be a result of cracking.\n  What we know in Washington State is we already had the cracking of \nthe tanks. We already had a plume of nuclear waste going toward the \nriver. So we already know what this situation is all about.\n  In 2000, the National Academy of Sciences said:\n\n       [W]aste tank residue is likely to be highly radioactive and \n     not taken up in the grout, so there is substantial \n     uncertainty. . . .\n\n  Another 2000 study by the National Academy of Sciences says:\n\n       [Using grout,] the ability of the site to reliably meet \n     long-term safety performance objectives remains uncertain.\n\n  I think there is much science that basically says we do not think \ngrout can work. Obviously, we do not know what the Department of Energy \nis trying to do, because they want to leave an unspecified amount of \nwaste in the ground and not be specific about that. So it is very \ndifficult for us to see.\n  I would also like in my short time here, because I know each Member \nis limited in time this evening, to refute the letter that was \nsubmitted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While we do not know \nwhat the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was asked to comment on, what \nthey ended up commenting on was not the underlying language in the DOD \nauthorizing bill. They did not comment on the fact that the Graham \nlanguage would significantly change the Nuclear Waste Power Act and \nclassify high-level waste as something else.\n  What they did comment on was the fact that you could take the entire \ntanks out of the ground and it would be very expensive, which I do not \nknow if people can imagine, because the Hanford site is miles and miles \nof acres--I think earlier we said something close to one-third the size \nof the State of Rhode Island. That is how big the Hanford reservation \nis--580 miles of land. These tanks that have stored the spent fuel are \nenormous.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is saying: We do not know if it is \nfeasible to take out the tanks entirely. Well, no one ever said we \nexpected to take out the entire tanks. What we said was we think the \ntanks have to be cleaned and the site has to be cleaned. And that is \nthe removal process we should continue to do.\n  So I think while we would be wise to get a letter from the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission that was specific about the exact proposal that \nis in this bill and get their response, the issue is they are not in \ncharge of short-term waste disposal. They are in charge of this \ngeological isolation solution we in Congress and others have been \nlooking for, and basically asking questions about, and saying, Where \nare you going to take the vitrified waste and put it? They are not the \nregulatory entity over those short-term issues.\n  I think the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not fully addressed the \nquestion. I think perhaps we should send them a more direct question to \nwhich we can get a more specific answer.\n  We will hear a lot more about this issue when we return from the \nlegislative recess. But I assure my colleagues, we are going to \ncontinue to talk about the fact that we in Congress cannot have this \nsignificant a change in a policy by simply sneaking language into a \nSenate Armed Services Committee bill that does not have jurisdiction \nover this issue and make a major policy change that is 30 years of \nlaw--30 years of established law--and 50 years of scientific evidence \nand override that in a short period of time without a full discussion \nand debate.\n  This underlying bill language needs to be stricken. We need to get \nabout the nuclear waste cleanup that the science says we should do; \nthat is, removing the high-level waste and not simply trying to do \ncleanup on the quick by calling it grout.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5936-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5936-S5937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROBERT A. (BOB) BEAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, earlier today many of our Senate family \nattended the funeral of a former Senate employee, Robert Bean. Bob \nstarted here in the Senate when he was 15 years old as a Senate page \nunder the sponsorship of Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. Following his \npage graduation Bob moved into the Democratic cloakroom where he \ncontinued his outstanding service to our members. He rose to the \nposition of Assistant Secretary for the Majority and then was appointed \nby Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to the position of Deputy \nSergeant at Arms in 1990. He moved to the Treasury Department's \nlegislative affairs office in 1995 and remained there until 1999 when \nhe returned to the Hill to work on the House side as the minority staff \ndirector of the House Administration Committee. He retired from the \nHill in 2002 and he had just recently begun work for the Jefferson \nConsulting Group.\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\n  Throughout these years of service Bob earned his undergraduate degree \nfrom George Washington University and his law degree from American \nUniversity's Washington College of Law. But all of these \naccomplishments pale in comparison to his personal accomplishments. Bob \nwas known as a friend by anyone who came into contact with him. Whether \nyou were a member of Congress or a new staffer, lost on the Hill, Bob \nwould find a way to help you, and he would make sure you knew that, if \nyou ever needed help again, he'd be there to assist you. The church was \nfilled today and that was a testament to the type of person Bob was to \nso many people. He died at the age of 43 leaving behind his mother, \nMargaret and his brothers John, Kenneth, and Brian. Bob also left \nbehind a Capitol Hill community united in mourning the loss of one of \nits most cherished possessions--a true friend. I would like to extend \nmy sympathies to his mother, his brothers and to all those who were \nlucky enough to know him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy given earlier \ntoday by Congressman Steny Hoyer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Eulogy for Robert A. (Bob) Bean\n\n       Father Nash, Father Polland, Members of St. John's Parish, \n     Friends:\n       I first want to express my deepest condolences to the Bean \n     family, Bob's mother, Margaret; his brothers, John, Kenneth \n     and Brian; his sister-in-law, Patti; niece, Rachel; and \n     nephew, Christian.\n       Your loss, I know, is as immeasurable as it is unexpected; \n     that this good, decent, kind man who graced and brightened \n     your lives--and all of ours--was summoned by our Creator, at \n     what seems to so many of us as the twilight of youth.\n       The passing of one who had so much to offer, who yearned to \n     serve others, who continually took it upon himself to help \n     others, and who was enjoying what seemed to be the prime of \n     his life, cuts particularly deep.\n       But the truth be told, Robert A. Bean, son of Margaret and \n     Louis, lived more in 43 years than most do in twice that \n     time.\n       Bob's service to our nation started early, when at the age \n     of 15, he began working as a Senate page under the former \n     majority leader Mike Mansfield.\n       He later served on the staff of the democratic cloakroom in \n     the Senate, which is where I first met him after being \n     elected to Congress.\n       I couldn't help but be impressed with Bob, by his \n     willingness to help on matters big and small, his strong \n     bearing, and his ability to get things done.\n       Bob was not passing time.\n       His talent, his character, his personality led to his being \n     selected for ever-increasing responsibility: serving first as \n     the assistant secretary for the democratic majority in the \n     Senate and then as deputy sergeant at arms, where he \n     performed the duties of chief law enforcement officer, \n     protocol officer and manager of support services in the \n     Senate.\n       In that position, he supervised thousands of employees and \n     displayed his considerable management skills.\n       And yes, along the way, he earned a bachelor's degree from \n     George Washington University as well as a law degree from \n     American University.\n       Bob was always improving himself and, in the process, \n     improving the lot of others.\n       In 1995, Bob was asked by Secretary Robert Rubin to join \n     him at the Treasury Department as the Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of the Treasury for Legislative Affairs, where his \n     extraordinary knowledge of the Congress and his reputation on \n     Capitol Hill for honesty and insight would help guide our \n     Nation to unprecedented prosperity in the 1990s.\n       Given the wide breadth of Bob's experience on Capitol Hill \n     and in the Executive Branch, I was ecstatic that I had the \n     opportunity to hire him in 1999 to serve as the staff \n     director of the Committee on House Administration.\n       Bob's service in that position was an immense advantage to \n     me, the Committee, and the Congress, which he loved.\n       Bob was a fierce partisan. He believed deeply in the \n     Democratic party and its principles, and he lived them.\n       But his political convictions never translated into \n     unthinking antagonism toward foes.\n       And I saw that first-hand during the negotiations on \n     bipartisan election reform, a legislative effort that was \n     perhaps Bob's legacy as staff director on the House \n     Administration Committee.\n       Bob played to win, but he played by the rules. And \n     Congressman Bob Ney, the Republican chairman of the Committee \n     and his staff, knew that; and they respected and trusted Bob \n     for it, which in my judgment is one reason why we were able \n     to work together, across the partisan divide, to address the \n     problems in our election system.\n       This week, Chairman Ney said of Bob:\n       ``There were many times when the process was in danger of \n     breaking down. Bob Bean refused to let that happen, though. \n     He was a stand-up guy, a tremendously hard worker and truly \n     great American.''\n       As anyone who walked through the Capitol with Bob knows, he \n     knew an unbelievable number of people. House members and \n     Senators. Staffers. Capitol Police officers. Maintenance \n     workers. And cafeteria workers.\n       All who knew him were his friend.\n       Walking through the Capitol with Bob was a constant \n     reminder of his experience and popularity on Capitol Hill--\n     with people from all walks of life. And he returned their \n     affection with kindness, consideration and respect.\n       A friend of Bob's for nearly 30 years, Sharon Daniels, the \n     long-time executive assistant for Congressman Richard \n     Gephardt, said of Bob:\n       ``Bob is the kind of friend you could call at two in the \n     morning, and ask: Can I borrow twenty thousand dollars? And, \n     by the way, can you bring it to me by 4 a.m. out on Route 50? \n     And Bob would not only do it. He would ask if there was \n     anything else he could do--and, of course, when he showed up \n     at 4 a.m., he would be wearing a suit and tie.''\n       And, then, of course, there was Captain Bean, skipper of \n     the ``Margaret B.'' Fisherman extraordinaire.\n       He loved the bay and he loved his boat. And all who sailed \n     and fished with him remember that experience as one filled \n     with the joy of life and adventure.\n       How appropriate that God chose to take Bob home from his \n     beloved bay and boat.\n       Bob loved his family and all of us, as well. He was a \n     blessing to each of us--a kind and gentle man, who succeeded \n     in all of his careers: government leader, businessman, \n     captain, consultant.\n       But his greatest success was as a human being. So as we pay \n     our respects to a beloved son and brother, a trusted and good \n     friend, a colleague, let me end by quoting from the poem \n     ``Chesapeake Mornings'' by Chris Kleinfelter:\n\n     ``I measure all of my daybreaks at home,\n     ``Against the Chesapeake mornings I have known,\n     ``Anchored in the stillness of emerging light,\n     ``Waiting for dawn to open my shadowed eyes.\n     ``A grove of tall masts is tracing circles\n     ``In the sky as restless keels and unmanned rudders\n     ``Stain the blue water with rippling patterns;\n     ``Brush stokes from the steady hand of God.''\n\n       Bob has joined God now on one last voyage that beckons us \n     all.\n       Yes, his heart has been stilled.\n       But ours have been enriched beyond measure-and forever--for \n     having this opportunity to share time with this good and \n     decent man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5937-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5937-S5938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Petty Officer 2nd Class Trace Dossett\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Petty \nOfficer 2nd Class Trace Dossett who valiantly gave his life for his \ncountry on Sunday, May 2, 2004. Petty Officer Dossett was one of five \nNavy Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 14 killed during \na mortar attack on the Ramadi Marine base in Iraq. I offer my deepest \nsympathy to his wife, Angela, their two daughters, Cassidie and Raimi, \nand his parents, Larry and Cheryl of Wapello, IA.\n  Petty Officer Dossett was a 1985 graduate of Wapello High School in \nWapello, IA. He was respected in the community for his strong mind and \nsense of devotion to serve our country. Trace joined the Navy shortly \nafter graduating from high school and ended his six year tour in the \nearly 1990s. He joined the Naval Reserve a year ago and was activated \nin January. I am proud of the patriotism displayed by Petty Officer \nTrace Dossett and his exemplary commitment to defending America. I \noffer my condolences to his family and close with the words of his \nwife, ``Trace died a hero and he would have had it no other way.''\n\n\n                       PFC Brandon Chauncy Sturdy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to PFC \nBrandon Chauncy Sturdy, the fourteenth Iowan to be killed in Iraq in \nbrave service to our country. PFC Sturdy was a machine gunner in the \n2nd Battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment in the 1st Marine Division. I \noffer my deepest sympathy to his parents, Shelly Rivera and David \nSturdy and his fiance, Tricia Johnson.\n  PFC Sturdy was killed by the explosion of a homemade bomb in Iraq on \nThursday, May 13 in the Al Anbar Province near Fallujah. I thank him \nfor his patriotic duty to his country and am proud to honor the courage \nhe boldly displayed as a Marine. PFC Sturdy was a 2003 graduate of \nUrbandale High School in Urbandale, IA. A statement released by \nBrandon's family describes him as ``the best of the best'' who ``set \nthe bar high for us to reach for''. He was a top notch Marine who had \nalready been awarded the\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\nNational Defense Medal and a Purple Heart. Brandon Sturdy died a hero \nfighting to preserve freedom. He was a brave patriot whose presence \nwill be missed. I am proud of the model of service he provided to \nIowans and I again offer my condolences to his family.\n\n\n                        Maj. William E. Burchett\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave man who served in the \nIndiana Air National Guard unit stationed in Terre Haute, IN. Major \nWilliam E. Burchett, 35 years old, died during a training mission when \nthe F-16 he was flying collided with another F-16 fighter jet, just \nwest of Indiana on Monday, May 17, 2004.\n  Bill graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1991. A \nnative of Michigan, Bill moved to Terre Haute in 2000 after leaving \nactive duty and being reassigned to the 181st Fighter Wing. He was a \nseasoned fighter pilot with over 2,300 flight hours in various military \naircraft, which he flew while bravely serving our Nation on numerous \noccasions, including missions in Kosovo, Bosnia, Yugoslavia and Saudi \nArabia. His love of flying also spilled over into his civilian career. \nWhen Bill wasn't training in his Air Force flight suit, he was working \nin his FedEx pilot uniform flying around the packages and supplies that \nhelp keep our Nation's economy moving forward.\n  Bill was a man of great faith as well as a hardworking and brave \nairman. He leaves behind his wife, Deborah who is expecting their third \nchild in a few weeks and his two sons, ages six and two years old. May \nBill's children grow up knowing that their father gave his life to help \ndefend our great Nation and ensure that children in other countries, \nlike Kosovo and Iraq, will some day know the freedom they enjoy.\n  Today, I join Bill's family, his friends, and the entire Indiana \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \ntraining and fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his \ncourage and strength of character that people will remember when they \nthink of Bill, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing \ndays of grief.\n  When looking back on the life of his late parishioner, Bill's \nminister, Mark Grayless told the Terre Haute Tribune Star that he ``was \na fantastic family man. He was a really neat guy and great with his \nkids.'' Bill was known for his wonderful sense of humor, his unfailing \npatience and the incredible love he shared with his wife and small \nchildren. According to his friends, Bill's passion for flying may not \nsoon be forgotten for his oldest son was quoted as having proudly \npronounced that he, too, wanted to be a pilot, just like his dad.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of William E. Burchett in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our \nheroes, I hope that families such as Bill's can find comfort in the \nwords of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in \nvictory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5938-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MONUMENT IN TRIBUTE TO ``THE GREATEST GENERATION''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the dedication of the long overdue World \nWar II Memorial is a moment in time that we will always remember.\n  I am so pleased that many Vermont veterans from the WWII will be on \nhand for this solemn, and triumphant, occasion.\n  No monument--even one so grandly placed as this gleaming tribute in \nstone is, between the Washington and Lincoln Monuments--can fully \ncapture the full enormity of the service and sacrifice of the 16 \nmillion soldiers, sailors, airmen and others who served in uniform \nduring those 5 years of war and struggle. Yet with its marble expanse, \nmajestic pillars, and carefully chiseled engravings, this memorial will \nforever stand as a symbol of the Nation's appreciation for those who \nserved and for those who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  World War II was truly an epic struggle. It was a struggle that would \ndetermine the very direction of humanity, whether militarism and Nazism \nwould supplant freedom and democracy. Every American soldier understood \nthe purpose and the stakes of that war. They unwaveringly answered the \ncall to duty, they won the war, they returned home, and then the \ngreatest generation soldiered on further to also win the peace.\n  We in Vermont often pride ourselves on our healthy skepticism of \ncentralized government. Yet we are early and arduous in rallying to the \nNation's defense in disproportionate numbers to our relatively small \npopulation, from the Civil War onward. In World War II nearly 50,000 \nmen from the State of Vermont fought the axis powers. More than 1,200 \nVermonters lost their lives in the war. At home and overseas, Vermont \nwomen also made great contributions to the war effort, and 1,400 of \nthem served with our armed forces.\n  Today a new generation of veterans is being minted. I have had the \nhonor of meeting many of the young men and women who are serving in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. These soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines tell \nme time and time again that they look over their shoulders to take \npride and courage in the examples set by our World War II veterans, as \nwell as our veterans from more recent wars.\n  On behalf of all Vermonters, as an American citizen, and as a member \nof one of several grateful generations, I welcome our proud veterans to \nWashington on the occasion of the dedication of the World War II \nMemorial. We thank you for all that you have done, and our Nation will \nforever honor your sacrifices.\n  We cannot thank you enough, but we can, and we will, always remember.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5938-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5938-S5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEMORIAL DAY 2004 AND WWII MEMORIAL DEDICATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on this Memorial Day, I encourage my \nfellow New Mexicans to take a few moments to remember those Americans \nwho have given their lives in the name of freedom. The freedom we enjoy \ntoday remains only because of their courage and unselfish sacrifice.\n  American men and women, throughout our Nation's history, have fought \nand died because they believed in their country and believed in \npreserving its immeasurable blessings. Many gave their lives for her in \na far away land, and failed to make it back to the country or family \nthey loved.\n  With this upcoming remembrance, I am reminded of Oliver Wendell \nHolmes, Jr. Holmes gave us some of the best thoughts, and his speech \nand writings, as a whole, will always be among the best of their kind.\n  On May 30, 1884, Holmes delivered a Memorial Day address before John \nSedgwick Post No. 4, Grand Army of the Republic. The address reflected \non the Civil War and during his address he focused on a question posed \nto him by a young man, about why people still kept up Memorial Day. In \nhis wonderful style he gave attention why Memorial Day is what it is.\n  He said, ``Not the answer that you and I should give to each other-\nnot the expression of those feelings that, so long as you live, will \nmake this day sacred to memories of love and grief and heroic youth--\nbut an answer which should command the assent of those who do not share \nour memories, and in which we of the North and our brethren of the \nSouth could join in perfect accord. . . . but Memorial Day may and \nought to have a meaning also for those who do not share our memories.''\n  One month ago on April 29, 2004, the National World War II Memorial \nopened for public view. The memorial is the first national memorial \ndedicated to all who served during the WWII. The formal dedication will \ntake place this Memorial Day weekend as a service and tribute to \nmembers of the World War II generation, and to share their memories. \nThe memorial honors all military veterans of the war, the citizens of \nthe time that stayed on the home front, and the America's moral purpose \nthat ultimately warranted our nation's involvement.\n  The memorial was authorized by Congress in 1993, and this year's \nMemorial Day celebration on the National\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nMall will culminate a long effort to honor America's World War II \ngeneration. I take a quick moment to thank my friend former Majority \nLeader Bob Dole, a wounded and decorated WWII veteran who served in \nthis body, for chairing the World War II Memorial Commission and for \ngiving countless hours to this wonderful work.\n  It has been nearly 59 years since the end of World War II. However, I \nthink it is safe to say that from 1939 to 1945, when every major power \nin the world was involved in a worldwide conflict--those times, like \nthe Civil War, were some of our nation's toughest. We live in a \nremarkably different world today, but Memorial Day has kept many \nmemories. At this moment in America's history, our men and women in \nuniform are engaged in conflict in both Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nserve with the same courage and commitment shown by Americans of \ngenerations past, and they deserve our thoughts and prayers.\n  From the Bataan Peninsula to beaches of Normandy, from the Ia Drang \nValley to Inchon, from Iwo Jima and Okinawa to the North Apennine \nMountains of Italy, from Afghanistan to Iraq, and many other conflicts \ntoo numerous to mention, American men and women have fought and died \nbecause of their love of country.\n  I am proud that we have kept up Memorial Day. This one, in \nparticular, brings significant meaning and a special time to remember \nand reflect. I pay a special tribute today to those who have fallen \nduring the two conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, including those from \nmy home state of New Mexico: CPT Tamara Archuleta of Los Lunas; Marine \nCPL Aaron Austin of Lovington; SrA Jason Cunningham of Carlsbad; Army \nSP James Pirtle of La Mesa; and Marine PFC Christopher Ramos of \nAlbuquerque.\n  As we enjoy this holiday weekend with our family and friends, let us \ntake some time to recognize the valor with which so many of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have fought when called upon by \ntheir country. Finally, may our United States continue to be blessed \nand may America forever remain the land of the free and the home of the \nbrave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5939-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5939-S5940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, more than 60 years ago a generation of \nAmericans answered the call to service, leaving their daily lives and \njoining the fight in a world war that would dramatically change the way \nthis country, and the world, conducted itself. Raised during the Great \nDepression, this ``Greatest Generation'' would have such a profound \nimpact on our history that is almost impossible to overstate. Their \nlegacy is formidable and lasting.\n  Almost six decades later, we are finally paying full tribute to those \nmen and women, and this generation, who served and sacrificed their \nlives in defense of this great Nation and who ultimately saved the \nworld from tyranny and tyrants. No doubt, those men and women and their \ntriumph over evil have served as a stark reminder and inspiration to \nthe men and women in uniform who have followed in their permanent \nfootsteps.\n  However, the presence of this generation was not limited to the \nislands of the Pacific or the beaches of Normandy; it was also \ndisplayed by those who remained in this country to mobilize the home \nfront during and after the war. No one can question the hard work and \ndedication this generation embraced that ultimately pushed this nation \nto the position of global economic, military, political, and social \nleadership we still maintain today. Almost overnight, America moved \nfrom isolation to a country of engagement.\n  Having learned this lesson well, America remained engaged with the \nworld after the war, struggling against the advance of communism, and \nultimately winning that battle.\n  I am proud of the role the citizens of my state played in these \nstruggles, and as such, I would like to take a moment to honor those \nIdahoans who served and to those who lost their lives as a result of \nWorld War II. Their strong commitment and dedication to their state and \nto our country has not and will not go unnoticed. I am reminded of a \nsaying, ``For your tomorrow, we gave our today.'' This statement \nembodies what this generation gave; but words can't fully describe what \nthe soldiers and survivors of WWII contributed to this nation, during \nand after the war. That contribution changed the course, not only of \nour Nation, but of the entire world. We continue to see the \nrepercussions of it today, and to be honest, I believe the effect will \ncontinue to be felt long after all of us are gone. The official motto \nof Idaho is ``Esto Perpetua,'' meaning ``May it last forever.'' Well, \nthe same could probably be said of the influence of this generation on \nAmerica.\n  Still, despite playing such a profound role in American history, \nuntil this year, there was no monument or memorial in our Nation's \ncapital that honored the sacrifices of all World War II veterans. We \nhave monuments and memorials for Vietnam and the Korean War, as we \nshould. Just across the river in Arlington, there is the Iwo Jima \nMemorial which honors the U.S. Marines who served in World War II. It \nis a beautiful and fitting commemoration of the leathernecks' service \nin that conflict but just that branch, not all the services.\n  This Memorial Day, we will dedicate, at long last, the National World \nWar II Memorial on the National Mall. I believe it is fitting that the \nmemorial should take its place alongside Lincoln, Jefferson and \nWashington, in the place our nation comes to remember and honor the \ngreatest deeds in our great history. I thank our veterans for their \nservice, for guaranteeing my freedom and those of all Americans, and I \nwish them a Happy Memorial Day.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this week marks the 50th anniversary of \nBrown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court decision that ultimately \nended legal segregation in schools and helped catalyze a better \neducation for all of America's children.\n  This landmark decision was the first significant action by an \ninstitution of national government in the struggle for equality. \nHowever, it would be naive to believe that Brown erased the hatred and \nignorance that black families faced when testing their rights to a \nbetter education. One of the most dramatic examples occurred on \nSeptember 24, 1957 when President Eisenhower ordered federal troops to \nLittle Rock, AR to allow nine black children, the Little Rock Nine, to \nattend the all-white Central High School.\n  Of her experience, Melba Pattillo Beals of the Little Rock Nine \nrecalls: ``I had to become a warrior. I had to learn not how to dress \nthe best but how to get from that door to the end of the hall without \ndying.'' Her act of courage, and those of the other eight students who \nintegrated Little Rock Central, helped change history for all Americans \nin a tale that continues to have immediacy.\n  Another one of those students was Ernest Green, who best explains why \nthe Little Rock Nine sacrificed their innocence for a chance at a \nbetter education. He said, ``We wanted to widen options for ourselves \nand later for our children.'' Mr. Green was the first black student to \ngraduate from Central High School. He later served as Assistant \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Affairs under President Jimmy Carter and \nnow serves as the vice president of Lehman Brothers.\n  Turning opportunity into achievement is what civil rights pioneer \nDaisy Bates had in mind when she helped the Little Rock Nine break down \nthe barriers that stood between them and an equal education. Despite \nthreats on her life and financial ruin, Daisy Bates made significant \nstrides in the courtroom and increased public awareness through her \nnewspaper.\n  Mr. President, as a former student of Central High, I can tell you \nthe impact of the Little Rock Nine is still felt in the hearts of its \nstudent body and teachers past and present. In 2007, Central High will \ncommemorate the 50th anniversary of its desegregation crises. The \nNational Park Service plans to build the Little Rock Central High \nSchool Visitors Center in time for this watershed anniversary, and I \nwill be urging my colleagues to support funding for this endeavor later \nthis year.\n  What we know today is that children all over America have the right \nto learn--whether their ancestors came to America on slave ships or the \nMayflower. What we know today is that we all benefit when we learn \ntogether and work together for a common purpose. What we know today is\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nthere are more black doctors, lawyers, judges and elected officials \nthan ever before. What we know today is that there is more equality and \nmore opportunity for all children.\n  But what we don't know, what we still question is whether we have \nreally achieved the inclusion, equality and diversity in our schools \nthat the Court intended when it struck down the ``separate but equal'' \ndoctrine and required the desegregation of schools across America. I do \nnot believe we have met the promise of Brown yet.\n  I am concerned that many public schools in Arkansas and around the \ncountry remain segregated by race and class, still unequal in regard to \nperformance and resources. Today, a fourth-grade Hispanic child is only \none-third as likely to read at the same level as a fourth grade white \nchild. Only fifty percent of African-Americans are finishing high \nschool, and only 18 percent are graduating from college.\n  We must do better, and President Bush and the Congress can do better \nby keeping the promises made to parents and students when it passed the \nNo Child Left Behind Act. We must live up to this promise, and provide \nevery child access to a quality public education.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On June 1, 2000, Gary William Mick, 25, pleaded guilty to first-\ndegree murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery after admitting that \nhe murdered a gay man and tried to kill another because he believed gay \nmen were ``evil.'' In the first attack, a New Jersey man was bludgeoned \nto death with a claw hammer. Mick met his second victim, a dentist, at \na bar. There, he had dinner with him and went home with him. Mick later \nattacked the man with a knife, a struggle ensued, and the victim \nescaped. Mick told police that a childhood incident caused him to hate \nhomosexuals.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5940-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5940-S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          A COLOSSAL FAILURE OF WHITE HOUSE LEADERSHIP IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, according to the Washington Post, a recent \npoll by the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, which is, for all \nintents and purposes, an entity of the U.S. Government, showed that 80 \npercent of the Iraqis surveyed reported a lack of confidence in the CPA \nand 82 percent disapprove of the U.S. and allied militaries in Iraq.\n  I mention this for two reasons.\n  First, I remember when, less than 2 months ago, much was made by \nadministration officials and several Senators of a February poll which \nsuggested that Iraqis strongly supported the U.S. occupation. They held \nit up as proof that our strategy was working, even if they could not \nexplain what the strategy was.\n  To quote one of my friends on the other side of the aisle, who spoke \non April 8:\n\n       [I] noticed the BBC/ABC poll results in Iraq, which are \n     fascinating. I only wish Americans were as upbeat about \n     America as Iraqis are about Iraq. If you watched U.S. TV \n     every day, you would think there was nothing but bad things \n     happening in Iraq . . . But, in fact, in the BBC/ABC poll, \n     which was taken from February 9th to February 28th, in answer \n     to the question, ``How are things going today, good or bad, \n     in Iraq?'' Overall, 70 percent said good, 29 percent said \n     bad. . . And in terms of the optimism factor, how they will \n     be a year from now, 71 percent of Iraqis thought things would \n     be better a year from now . . .\n\n  He concluded by saying that this encouraging news was thanks to the \nleadership of the President of the United States.\n  Whatever the accuracy of that February poll, the CPA's recent poll \nindicates that far more Iraqis today oppose what we are doing in Iraq. \nThe CPA's poll also shows that more than half of Americans surveyed \noppose the President's policy.\n  This latest poll also compels us to ask why so many of the people we \nsought to liberate, and did liberate from the brutality of Saddam, \nturned against us so quickly. And why so many Americans are questioning \nthe President's decision to go to war.\n  There are many reasons, the genesis of which dates back to the \nPresident's fateful decision to shift gears from fighting al-Qaida, \nwhich had attacked us, to overthrowing Saddam Hussein, who had not \nattacked us and who apparently had no plan or ability to.\n  That decision, followed by a remarkable series of miscalculations and \nmisguided policies, has enmeshed our troops in an ill-fated, costly war \nfrom which neither the President, nor anyone else in his \nAdministration, appears to have the faintest idea of how to extricate \nourselves.\n  Let's review the history.\n  After September 11, there was nearly universal support for \nretaliation against al-Qaida. There was widespread sympathy and support \nfor the United States from around the world. But then the President, \nencouraged by a handful of Pentagon and White House officials, most \nnotably the Vice President, who were fixated on Saddam Hussein, changed \ncourse. And what followed, I believe, has very possibly increased the \nrisk of terrorism against Americans.\n  We remember when someone in the administration ``gave currency to a \nfraud,'' to quote George Will, by putting in the President's 2003 State \nof the Union speech that Iraq was trying to buy uranium in Africa.\n  This administration repeatedly, insistently and unrelentingly \njustified pre-emptive war by insisting that Saddam Hussein not only had \nweapons of mass destruction but was hell-bent on using them against us \nand our allies.\n  Administration officials, led by Vice President Cheney, repeatedly \ntried to link Saddam Hussein to 9/11 in order to build public support \nfor the war, though there never was any link--none.\n  Truth tellers in the administration--like General Shinseki and \nLawrence Lindsay--were either ridiculed or hounded out of their jobs \nbecause they had the temerity to suggest realistic estimates for the \nnumber of soldiers and amount of money it would take to do the job \nright in Iraq.\n  Incredibly, there was no real plan, despite a year-long, $5 million \nstudy by the State Department, to deal with the widespread looting that \ngreeted our soldiers once Saddam had fallen--doubling or tripling the \ncost of reconstruction, and leaving open the gates to stockpiles of \nweapons and ammunition that have been used with deadly results against \nour soldiers.\n  We remember President Bush flying onto the aircraft carrier and \ndeclaring ``Mission Accomplished'' when, in fact, the worst of it was \nahead.\n  Two months later, the President taunted Iraqi resistance fighters to \n``Bring It On!'' while our troops were still in harm's way and were \nfending off ambushes and roadside attacks every day and every night.\n  Some of our closest allies and friends, like Mexico and Canada, and \neven those countries Secretary Rumsfeld called ``Old Europe,'' were \nbelittled and alienated because they disagreed with our strategy of \npre-emptive war--countries whose diplomatic and intelligence and \nmilitary support we so desperately need today.\n  That sorry chronology has brought us to where we are today. Each day \nthat passes, more Iraqis seem to turn against us, threatening the \nmission and morale of our troops.\n  The latest episode in this misguided adventure is the Abu Ghraib \nprison scandal. It is tragic for many reasons, but none more so than \nthe harm it has caused to the image of our Armed\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\nForces and to our Nation, particularly among Muslims, and the fact that \nit could so easily have been prevented.\n  The International Red Cross had warned U.S. officials about the \nmistreatment of Iraqi prisoners last year, and nothing was done about \nit for months.\n  We also know that similarly cruel and degrading treatment of \nprisoners occurred at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. The New York \nTimes first reported it last March. It described prisoners who had been \nkept naked in freezing cold cells, forced to stand for days with their \narms upraised and chained to the ceiling, subjected to other \nhumiliating and abusive treatment, and in at least two instances \nprisoners died in what were ruled homicides. We have since learned that \nmany more detainees have died in U.S. custody in both Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  Even before last June, when I first sought information about the \nabuses at Bagram, my attempts to seek information about the \ndehumanizing and, I believe, illegal treatment of prisoners at \nGuantanamo were ignored.\n  It is no secret that Guantanamo was chosen precisely because the \nPentagon wanted it to be outside the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. They \ndid not want to be subjected to the watchful eyes of attorneys who know \nthe law. They did not want to be bothered with U.S. or international \nlaw. As it turns out, many of the prisoners at Guantanamo who had been \ndrugged and shackled and hooded and denied access to lawyers, were \nreleased after it was determined, a year or two later, that they were \ninnocent.\n  Now we hear that there are videos of the treatment of prisoners at \nGuantanamo, but, like Abu Ghraib, we only learned about it from the \npress. That is the only way we have learned about any of what is \nincreasingly looking like a pattern of cruel and degrading treatment of \nterrorism suspects in U.S. military custody.\n  Top Pentagon officials continue to insist that there is no pattern; \nthat we are dealing only with ``isolated incidents.'' We could debate \nwhen ``incidents'' become so pervasive that they are part of a \n``pattern.'' One might think that similar types of abuses of prisoners \nin U.S. custody in Cuba, Afghanistan, and Iraq during approximately the \nsame time period would suggest a pattern, but perhaps not to those who \nbear responsibility. The fact is, as the Washington Post so clearly \nstated on May 20, this was ``A Corrupted Culture.''\n  We have heard that U.S. military intelligence gave the orders. We \nhave heard of attempts by military to block investigations by the \nInternational Red Cross. We have heard that FBI officers declined to be \npresent during interrogations because of the harsh methods that were \nused. We have heard of complaints by former Iraqi and Afghan prisoners \nthat were ignored. We have heard about investigations of alleged abuses \nthat were cursory, at best. We have heard of instances when denials of \nmisconduct by military officers were treated as proof that nothing bad \nhappened, while those who alleged the abuse were never interviewed.\n\n  We have learned that self-serving and reassuring statements about \nrespect for the law by officials here in Washington, including the \nPresident and the Pentagon's top lawyer, bore little resemblance to \nwhat was going on in the field.\n  The sadistic acts that have now been published on the front pages of \nevery newspaper in the world as well as millions of television screens \nhave endangered our soldiers and civilians abroad and threaten our \nnational security and foreign policy interests abroad. The photographs \nwill be used as recruiting posters for terrorists around the world. \nThey depict an interrogation and detention system that is out of \ncontrol. They have made a mockery of President Bush's statement a year \nago that the United States will neither ``torture'' terrorist suspects, \nnor use ``cruel and unusual'' treatment to interrogate them, and they \ndirectly contradict the more detailed policy on interrogations outlined \nin a June 25, 2003, letter to me by Defense Department General Counsel \nWilliam Haynes.\n  It is apparent that, when it comes to Iraq, this administration is \ndisinterested, at best, in the views of anyone who is either a member \nof the minority, or who, Republican or Democrat, dares to utter words \nof caution or criticism. But there are some basic truths that cannot be \nignored.\n  First, atrocities occur in all wars. Invariably, there are \nincidents--often many incidents--in which excessive force is used, \ncivilians are brutalized, prisoners of war are tortured and summarily \nexecuted. There has never been a war without such heinous crimes.\n  Second, our Armed Forces are the finest in the world. The vast \nmajority of our troops have conducted themselves professionally and \ncourageously, in accordance with the laws of war. But even Americans \nhave at times used excessive force and violated the rights of civilians \nor prisoners. There were instances of this long before Abu Ghraib \nprison.\n  And it is precisely because these atrocities are predictable in any \nwar that the Geneva Conventions and the Torture Convention exist. The \nUnited States was instrumental in the drafting and adoption of these \nconventions, whose purpose is to prevent atrocities against civilians \nand the mistreatment of prisoners of war, including Americans.\n  We should also recognize that not only were the abuses at Abu Ghraib \nprison not isolated incidents; similar practices have recently been \ndocumented in many prisons in the United States. We have seen the same \ntypes of humiliating and sexually degrading treatment, the assaults by \nprison guards, the misuse of dogs against defenseless prisoners, and \nthe same failure to hold accountable those in positions of \nresponsibility.\n  The President reaffirmed, in the midst of the Abu Ghraib scandal, \nthat the United States is a nation of laws, and that those responsible \nfor the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners will be punished. This, of \ncourse, must happen. But it does not obscure the glaring hypocrisy of \nthis administration.\n  On the one hand, last March, referring to the capture of U.S. \nsoldiers by Iraqi forces, President Bush said, ``We expect them to be \ntreated humanely, just like we'll treat any prisoner of theirs that we \ncapture humanely. If not, the people who mistreat the prisoners will be \ntreated as war criminals.'' On the other hand, there is the White House \nCounsel, who called the Geneva Conventions ``quaint'' and ``obsolete,'' \nand there is the pattern of abuses themselves and the way the \nadministration ignored inquiries and warnings for months.\n  The White House set the tone, and the consequences were disastrous. \nAccording to the International Red Cross, 70 to 90 percent of the Iraq \nprisoners arrested--who were unquestionably entitled to the protections \nof the Geneva Conventions--were later determined to have been detained \nby mistake. That is appalling, but not so appalling that the \nAdministration did anything about it.\n  The Red Cross reported that soldiers carrying out arrests ``usually \nentered after dark, breaking down doors, waking up residents roughly, \nyelling orders. Sometimes they arrested all adult males present in a \nhouse, including the elderly, handicapped or sick people. Treatment \noften included pushing people around, insulting, taking aim with \nrifles, punching and kicking and striking with rifles.''\n  Is it any wonder that so many Iraqis want us to leave? This is not \nwhat we expect of the conduct of our military operations. The Geneva \nConventions have the force of law, and as a nation whose Bill of Rights \nwas the model for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that holds \nitself out as a force for human rights and human dignity around the \nworld, we should set the example. Any person taken into U.S. custody \nshould be treated, at a minimum, consistent with the Geneva Conventions \nand in accordance with the Torture Convention.\n  This fiasco is part and parcel of the increasing insecurity in Iraq \nand the dangers facing our troops from a hostile population that has \nresulted from such miserably poor planning that so many people warned \nof.\n  It has claimed the lives and limbs of hundreds of Americans and of \nthousands of Iraqis.\n  It has caused deep divisions between ourselves and the Iraqi people \nand Muslims around the world.\n  It has damaged our image as a nation that stands for respect for \nhuman rights.\n  It represents a colossal failure of leadership.\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n  As I and so many others have said for months, we cannot succeed in \nIraq by ourselves. Not when the rationale for going to war has been \nexposed for the pretext that it was. Not when we are widely perceived \nas occupiers. Not when photographs of uniformed Americans abusing naked \nIraqi prisoners have become the symbol of that occupation.\n  We saw, with the horrifying murder of Nicolas Berg by al-Qaida, the \nincredible depravity and determination of the enemy we face. Only weeks \nago there were images of dismembered American corpses hanging from a \nbridge.\n  We are united in our revulsion, and in our commitment to bring to \njustice those responsible for such despicable acts. The question is how \nto do it effectively.\n  Last October 13th, in a memo entitled ``Global War on Terrorism,'' \nSecretary Rumsfeld asked, ``Are we capturing, killing or dissuading \nmore terrorists every day than the madrassas and radical clerics are \nrecruiting, training and deploying against us?''\n  Since then, he and the President have called Iraq the main front in \nthe war against terrorism. It certainly did not used to be. Last week, \nI asked Secretary Rumsfeld how he would answer the question he posed \nlast October--whether we are winning the fight against terrorism. He \nsaid he didn't know.\n  That speaks volumes. We are spending more than $1 billion a week in \nIraq, and the Secretary doesn't know if we are winning.\n  President Bush's Iraq policy has been discredited not only among the \nworld's Muslims, but among most of our friends and allies. Not only \nhave we lost the moral authority that is necessary to defeat terrorism, \nwe have been unable to even secure the country we liberated. As I have \nsaid repeatedly, we need a radical change of course, and that decision \ncan be made only by the President of the United States.\n  The President has reaffirmed his steadfast support for the Secretary \nof Defense, and at this point it appears that Secretary Rumsfeld has no \nplans to leave. But many are seriously questioning whether we can \nsucceed in Iraq, or against terrorism for that matter, so long as he \nand General Myers, and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, who are so closely \nidentified with this discredited policy, remain at the helm.\n  At the same time, the President needs to articulate credible, \nachievable goals in Iraq, beyond ``staying the course'' and the usual \ncliches about remaking the Middle East.\n  We and the rest of the world need to know what those goals are and \nhow he plans to achieve them, to whom we are going to turn over \nsovereignty that can effectively govern, how the President plans to \nsecure the support needed from other nations to effectively address the \ndeteriorating security situation, how long he expects our troops to \nstay in Iraq, and how many more billions of dollars it may cost.\n  Unless the President can answer these questions, more and more \nAmericans will question how much longer we can ask our troops to risk \nlife and limb in Iraq and the taxpayers to continue to pay for a policy \nthat is not working.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5942-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5942-S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      END THE BLOCK AND BLAME GAME\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to make an appeal to our \nDemocratic colleagues to end this obstruction of legislation vital to \nour Nation. I am appealing to my Democratic colleagues to abandon this \nharmful, politically motivated, election year strategy of gridlock, and \nif I may be so bold, to suggest a different election year political \nstrategy that will not hurt Americans.\n  The Democrats' obstruction strategy is no secret in Washington, \nalthough it may not be so obvious to those outside the beltway.\n  We have all heard of the old ``blame game.'' Well now, Congressional \nDemocrats have taken it to a new level and created a new game. I call \nit the ``Block and Blame Game.''\n  According to a lobbyist, a few weeks ago one of the Senate's \nDemocratic leaders gave a briefing to campaign contributors. First, all \nwere assured, naturally, that the Democrats would take over the Senate. \nSecond, they were told that to help secure this Democratic victory, \nthey were implementing a strategy to block all major legislation, \nexcept for some appropriations measurers.\n  So how does blocking legislation elect Democrats? The answer came \nwithin days as a Senate Democrat blasted away, charging that while \nRepublicans control the White House, the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, the GOP is getting nothing done. The block and blame \ngame.\n  Democrats must think that as long as no one outside Washington can \nfigure out the nuances of the legislative procedures of obstruction, \nthen as they say, ``the proof is in the pudding,'' nothing is getting \ndone, the Republicans are in control, and therefore the Republicans are \nto blame.\n  Who is really hurt by this strategy? Republicans? Maybe, if they are \nunable to explain the complicated procedures that are being used by \nDemocrats to block the business of the Senate.\n  Clearly, it is the American people who are harmed. And for what \nreason? Simply, the interests of Americans are being sacrificed upon \nthe altar of the selfish, political power struggle.\n  Please understand that I refuse to insult my Democratic colleagues by \nsuggesting that they should not vigorously compete for control of \nCongress and the White House.\n  But they can do it in a way that helps Americans, not hurt them.\n  I do strongly urge them to abandon the block and blame game strategy \nand instead to join Republicans in making this closely divided \nGovernment work.\n  Let's all acknowledge that there are precious few legislative days \nleft in the 108th Congress, that we have a large number of bills very \nimportant to our country, and that we do not have the luxury of \ndebating and voting on each and every amendment we desire.\n  Let's recognize that no legislation will be perfect in everyone's \nmind, but let's not block it simply because we don't get everything we \nwant.\n  Instead, let's work hard together to get these important bills to the \nPresident's desk to be signed into law.\n  And that is the basis of a better campaign strategy for Democrats, \nand one that will not undermine the vital interests of Americans.\n  Simply, Democrats could share credit for all the legislation enacted \nthis year, but then they are free to argue with voters that had they \nbeen in control of the Congress and the White House, they would have \ndone much, much better.\n\n  Or, Democrats might try to persuade voters that if they are elected, \nprovisions that Democrats view as ill-conceived, will be repealed or \nmodified.\n  Republicans are happy to engage Democrats in the debate this fall \nover the issues, our goals and our vision for our nation's future. And \nDemocrats should be just as enthusiastic.\n  In short, there is no need to obstruct legislation. It makes no \nsense, it is totally irrational, for Democrats to be blocking \ncritically needed legislation, crucial for their own constituents, \nsimply because they fear that Republicans might get credit for passing \nand enacting legislation.\n  The ongoing fight over the Energy bill is a perfect case study that \nunderscores my point of how the vital interests of Americans are being \nsacrificed on the alter of political ambition.\n  Last year, lobbyist working hard for either the medicare prescription \nbill or the Energy bill, were telling me that the Senate Democratic \ncaucus was struggling with the following question: ``Which, if either \nbill, should we allow to pass? We definitely cannot let the President \nhave two victories.''\n  Let me repeat, Congressional Democrats concluded that they could not \nlet the President have two victories. So as it happened, Medicare was \npassed first, but then Democrats mounted a successful filibuster \nagainst the Energy bill.\n  They wanted to deny the President a victory.\n  Where did they get that crazy notion? What genius political \nconsultants and pollsters are advising them?\n  Enacting the Energy bill would be a victory for all Americans, not \njust the President! It would be a victory for people of all political \nstripes.\n  There are provisions in the Energy bill that would help increase oil \nproduction, which would reduce gasoline prices.\n  Do you thing Americans, who drive up to the pump today, having to \nspend well over two dollars a gallon for gasoline, give a hoot whether \nor not enacting the energy bill could be considered\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\na victory for the President? Do you think for one moment that even the \nmost dyed-in-the-wool Democrats living outside of Washington, DC say to \nthemselves, ``Well, we may be paying $2.50 for gasoline, but thank \ngoodness Congressional Democrats denied the President a legislative \nvictory''?\n  Why don't Democrats do to the Energy bill, what they did to the \nprescription drug bill? Let it be enacted into law, and then go out and \ntell everyone what a terrible bill it is. Tell voters that the Energy \nbill is just terrible, but that Republicans are in control, and if \nthat's their idea of good energy policy, so be it. But if you elect us, \nwe will do this and that differently, and you will be far better off.\n  That type of political strategy does not undermine Americans. That \nstrategy sets the stage for vigorous campaigns that will we won or lost \nbased upon who have the best ideas and vision.\n  Perhaps, therein lies the problem for Democrats. Perhaps the block \nand blame game is easier to play for those who are not confident that \nthey have better ideas and winning arguments about their goals and \nvision.\n  We came within two votes of shutting off the Democrat-led filibuster \nagainst the Energy bill. There are provisions in that bill of vital \ninterest to virtually every part of our country, let alone establishing \ncritically needed energy policy for our Nation as a whole.\n\n  For the upper Midwest's farm country, it contains renewable fuel \nprovisions that will expand farm markets for corn and soybeans which in \nturn will increase income for farmers and rural Americans while \nexpanding job opportunities. It contains provisions that increase our \nsources of oil and gas which will reduce the production costs of \nfarmers as well as save money for all consumers throughout our country.\n  Each and every one of us can point to things we did not like in the \nbill, but instead of passing it for the greater good, it has fallen \nprey to the Democrat's block and blame game.\n  Just 3 weeks ago, Democrats sacrificed the renewable fuels section of \nthe Energy bill to the block and blame game.\n  It is inconceivable that the renewable fuels amendment offered by the \nDemocratic leader on April 27 could have been designed any better to \nassure its failure. It was guaranteed to fail. If you understand Senate \nprocedures, and the importance of passing a regionally attractive, \ncomprehensive Energy bill, it is obvious to you that this amendment was \ndesigned to fail.\n  Let me offer the proof.\n  First, everyone knows that any energy bill that has any hope of \npassing this Congress must be a comprehensive package that addresses a \nwide variety of energy issues and that draws bipartisan support from \nall regions of the country.\n  This fact has long been recognized by ethanol and farm organizations \nwho have been working hard for approval of the renewable fuels \nstandard. Moreover, these groups recognize that the comprehensive \nenergy bill has provisions beyond ethanol and biodiesel that are very \nimportant to their members.\n  So why did the Democratic leader fail to offer instead the \ncomprehensive energy bill, which included the renewable fuels standard, \nas an amendment?\n  He has been around here long enough to know Senators from other parts \nof the country, who want to pass pro-energy provisions more important \nto their states than ethanol, are not likely to vote to strip ethanol \nout. After all, such an effort would unravel the energy coalition, and \nthus reduce the likelihood of passing their preferred energy \nprovisions.\n  So the Democratic leader offered an amendment that he knew was less \nlikely to pass.\n  The second bit of evidence that this effort was part of the block and \nblame game, is that no pro-ethanol Republican ally was contacted in \nadvance to help develop a strategy to assure that we secure enough \nvotes.\n  We have always counted on bipartisan cooperation to support ethanol \nlegislation, and for the first time that I can remember, neither I nor \nany other pro-ethanol Republican was contacted.\n  Third, and even more telling, the Democrat leader failed to contact \nthe ethanol and corn grower lobbyists in advance. That, I know, has \nnever happened. If you really want to pass renewable fuels legislation, \nevery one of us in this body knows you better have the National Corn \nGrowers and the Renewable Fuels Association ready and able to help you \nline up the votes.\n  Why weren't they contacted? Perhaps it is because Democrats knew they \nwould refuse to be part of an effort to splinter the broad energy \ncoalition, sinking all hope of passing any energy legislation this \nyear, including that for renewable fuels.\n  They would not willingly let themselves become victims of the \nDemocratic block and blame game!\n  The fourth bit of evidence that this amendment was designed to fail \ninvolves Senate procedure. As soon as the amendment was offered, a \nsigned cloture petition was immediately offered by the Democratic \nleader to his own amendment. This cloture petition, by the way, was \nsigned exclusively by Democrats.\n  The most obvious reason to invoke cloture is to cut off a filibuster. \nBut who in the world was going to filibuster this amendment? We were \ntrying to pass a long-overdue solution to differences that has stalled \nthe internet tax bill. Moreover, if the Democratic leader's renewable \nfuels amendment was so popular, why worry about a filibuster? Let's \njust vote up or down on the amendment.\n  Although cutting off debate is the obvious, normal purpose of filing \na cloture petition, there is another purpose which is not so widely \nunderstood. If cloture is invoked, all amendments to that underlying \nprovision must be germane. If a second degree amendment is not germane, \nthen you have constructed a hurdle requiring 60 votes to overcome.\n\n  Could it be, therefore, since no one was filibustering this \namendment, that an attempt to invoke cloture was aimed at blocking the \nmore popular, comprehensive energy legislation as a second degree \namendment?\n  Indeed, Senator Domenici, recognizing hopes for energy legislation \nwas being jeopardized by this block and blame game, offered the \ncomprehensive energy bill as a second degree.\n  What most constituents do not know, is that had the democratic leader \nsucceeded in gaining the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture on his \namendment, the Domenici amendment would have been ruled out of order as \nnon germane because it was far more expansive than the underlying \namendment. It would have taken another 60-vote majority to overcome \nthis ruling. That may not be impossible, but we know that some Senators \nvote will vote differently on a procedural question than they might on \nthe underlying amendment. So this was another hurdle, another attempt \nat blocking the more popular provision that, remember, included the \nrenewable fuels standard and had a much higher likelihood of passing.\n  The fifth piece of evidence that the Democratic leader's amendment \nwas designed to fail is that he offered it to S. 150, instead of the \ncompromise substitute amendment developed and offered by Senator \nMcCain, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  Given the long stalemate over the internet tax bill, we all knew that \nSenator McCain's substitute had broken the impasse and that if anything \nwas going to pass, it was his compromise.\n  But his amendment, No. 3048 was an entire substitute to the language \nof S. 150. We all know, therefore, that any amendment to S. 150, \nincluding amendment No. 3050 offered later by the Democratic leader, \nwould fall when the McCain substitute was approved.\n  So you should offer an amendment to the substitute that will prevail. \nIf you did not think you knew which would prevail, then you could offer \ntwo amendments--one to the underlying bill, and one to the substitute \namendment.\n  Here is a good way to explain this. Suppose our objective is to get \nsupplies to the space station. Do you load your supplies on the booster \nrocket, or do you load it into the space shuttle? The booster rocket in \nthis case was S. 150, and the McCain substitute was the space shuttle. \nAnd we all knew that.\n  The next bit of evidence that the Democratic leader's ethanol \namendment was designed to fail, is the very fact that he picked a bill, \nagain, the internet tax bill, that is controlled and managed by the \nSenate's most out-spoken, anti-ethanol Senator.\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\n  If everything else failed to fail, adding an amendment to a bill to \nbe taken to conference by Chairman McCain was the iron-clad guarantee \nit would be rejected. And in fact, that is exactly what Senator McCain \nstated on the floor of the Senate. He stated emphatically, and quite \npredictably, that if the ethanol or energy amendment passed, he would \ndrop it in conference.\n  So the Democrat leader's amendment was designed in so may ways to \nfail, and thus, to block his own amendment. And guess who gets the \nblame? Republicans.\n  Farmers lose. All energy consumers lose. But if the block and blame \ngame works and Republicans lose, too, then it is all worth it, because \nCongressional Democrats win.\n  The block and blame game.\n  An interesting exchange occurred between Chairman McCain and Senator \nDorgan during the debate of this amendment. Senator McCain said, ``I am \nsure there may be a headline in South Dakota that says: Senator Daschle \nfights for ethanol.''\n  Senator Dorgan responded, ``Senator Daschle has not offered an \namendment for the purpose of a headline in South Dakota.''\n  Guess what. As soon as his amendment failed, Senator Daschle did \nissue a press release. And not only that, the press release attacked \nRepublicans.\n  The release, according to the Congressional Quarterly, was headlined, \nand ``Washington Republicans abandon ethanol.''\n  The block and blame game: hurts the farmers, hurts Americans, but \nhelps the Democrats.\n  I would like to share a statement issued by the National Corn Growers \nfollowing the vote:\n\n       Yesterday, during consideration of legislation dealing with \n     internet sales taxes, Senator Daschle offered an amendment to \n     create a Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). Senator Domenici \n     offered S. 2095 as a second degree amendment to the Daschle \n     amendment. S. 2095 contains the RFS as well as other energy \n     provisions. NCGA will support all efforts to pass an energy \n     bill that contains an RFS and addresses the serious problem \n     our nation faces regarding energy. We again call upon \n     Congress to set aside partisan bickering and to pass an \n     energy bill.\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly with the National Corn Growers Association. We \nhave serious problems facing our nation, and we have several very \nimportant bills aimed at addressing these problems that are falling \nvictim to the block and blame game.\n  I wish that what I was told by a Democratic lobbyist, about the \nstrategy to block everything this year . . . I wish that it were not \ntrue. I hope that the Democratic leaders will have a change of heart \nand a change of campaign strategy that allows vital pieces of \nlegislation to be signed by the President this year, and then let the \nelection be fought over who has the best ideas or who will do better if \nthey take control of Congress or the White House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5944-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SECTION 8 HOUSING ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Schumer, \nKennedy, Reed, and others as an original co-sponsor of this important \nlegislation, which would clarify the intent of a provision in the \nfiscal year 2004 appropriations law regarding the Section 8 housing \nvoucher program.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, has claimed \nthat language in the FY2004 appropriations law requires it to \ndistribute voucher funding in a manner that leaves no alternative but \nto reduce assistance by $191 million nationwide. Subsequently, it \nissued a notice on April 22, 2004 that put in place a new system for \nfunding Section 8 vouchers that differed greatly from its usual \npractice. In the past, HUD would reimburse housing authorities for the \ncost of providing housing to low-income individuals based on their \nreal, current costs. Under the April 22 guidelines, however, the \nreimbursements will be gauged to August 1, 2003, plus a small \nadjustment for inflation. In addition, the change will be retroactive \nto January 1, 2004, which will create even further confusion for those \npublic housing authorities whose vouchers are already issued and whose \nbudget are already finalized.\n  I strongly believe that that HUD's interpretation of the FY2004 \nappropriations law is both unduly restrictive and is in sharp \ncontradiction to the intent of Congress to fully fund Section 8 \nprogram. Despite HUD's protestations that Congress forced its hand to \nmake these cuts, Congress in fact added funding to the Section 8 \nprogram in FY2004 so that HUD could fully fund all vouchers currently \nin use. Congress appropriated $17.6 billion in FY2004 to renew expiring \nSection 8 contracts, or $1.4 billion above the amount requested by the \nadministration. Although the FY2004 appropriations law did make some \nmodest changes in how voucher funding is disbursed, nothing in the law \nmandated that HUD take the unprecedented step of cutting housing \nassistance for senior citizens, the disabled, and working families and \nindividuals with the greatest housing needs.\n  It therefore makes little sense that HUD would insist on reading the \nFY2004 appropriations law in such a way as to produce more homelessness \nacross the nation. My own State of Connecticut will be especially hurt \nif HUD's April 22 notice is not changed to reflect the program \ncommitments of housing authorities. Many public housing authorities in \nConnecticut are anticipating that the HUD proposal will result in a \nsignificant reduction in funds needed to honor existing contracts as \nwell as effectively administer the voucher program. The current average \nHousing Assistance Payment for many agencies has typically increased \nbeyond the August 1, 2003 ``benchmark'' plus the Annual Adjustment \nFactor. In most cases, this result is not due to increases in local \nrental rates but reflects the rise in unemployment among Section 8 \nparticipants and thus an increase in the public housing authority's \nshare of the rent.\n  The impact of the April 22, 2004 rule on Connecticut will be \nparticularly severe given that that it has the sixth most expensive \nrental housing market in the nation and very few vacancies to meet the \nneeds of low-income individuals. Coupled with the administration's \nproposed FY2005 budget cuts and block granting of the Section 8 \nprogram, which could adversely affect over 4,000 existing voucher \nholders in Connecticut, it is difficult to understand why HUD would be \ntrying to balance its budget on the backs of low-income Americans.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development's April 22, 2004 \nnotice is therefore just another salvo in the administration's war on \nthe Section 8 program. Section 8 provides more than just rent \nassistance for low and moderate wage individuals in high cost housing \nmarkets. It also helps to sustain the employee base in urban markets, \nkeeps wages for jobs in the service and manufacturing sectors \ncompetitive, enables corporations to remain and expand in their \ncommunities, and reduces the strain on vehicular transportation \nsystems.\n  In an economy that is creating few jobs and producing scant \naffordable housing, HUD should be pursing policies to ensure that no \nfamily in America loses its housing assistance. HUD's April 22 notice \nshould therefore be changed, so I urge my colleagues to support this \nurgent legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5944-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5944-S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MANUEL RODRIGUEZ GOMEZ, MD\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Manuel Rodriguez \nGomez, MD, Emeritus Professor of Pediatric Neurology at Mayo Medical \nSchool in Rochester, Minnesota, for his lifetime of education and as \none of the first physicians in the United States to champion tuberous \nsclerosis complex, TSC. Dr. Gomez is considered by many to be the \n``father'' of tuberous sclerosis complex research because of his many \ncontributions to the field of TSC research and passionate patient care. \nThrough his work to describe TSC over the lifespan of an individual \nwith the disorder and the extraordinary resources provided by the Mayo \nClinic, Dr. Gomez published extensively on his growing knowledge of the \nmultiple organ involvement in TSC. He passionately encouraged his \ncolleagues to not only provide medical care for individuals with TSC, \nbut to also share their knowledge through conferences, publications and \nthe three editions of the book, ``Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.'' This \nbook is considered by his peers to be the premier medical textbook for \ncare of TSC patients. For his dedication to the many individuals he \ntreated throughout his medical practice and his guidance of the \nTuberous Sclerosis Alliance, Dr. Gomez made the world a\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nbetter place for individuals living with TSC by providing exceptional \nmedical care and guidance through the many challenges associated with \nliving with the disease. His quest to better understand the nature and \ncause of the disease will benefit all patients diagnosed with this \ncondition and possible unlock the secret to a cure that will eradicate \nthis disease once and for all. Because of his dedication to his \npatients and his contribution to the research community, it is my \npleasure to rise today, and offer this tribute to Dr. Gomez.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5945-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HONORING ERWIN ARNDT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the National World War II Memorial \nwill be dedicated here in Washington on the Saturday before Memorial \nDay. It is a stunningly beautiful monument, located midway between the \nLincoln Memorial and Washington Monument. It is a long-overdue salute--\nan expression of profound gratitude--to the millions of Americans who \nserved their country with courage, sacrifice, and selflessness in that \nwar.\n   I would like to share with my Senate colleagues a remarkable story \nabout how the small community of Walnut, IA, has expressed its \ngratitude to a local veteran of the Second World War, Erwin Arndt.\n   Mr. Arndt returned from the war to serve his community as an \nelectrician, a volunteer firefighter, a city council member, and \ncommander of the local AMVETS unit. Just about everybody in Walnut \nknows and respects Mr. Arndt. And there was much concern when he \nsuffered a series of strokes over the past year.\n   All too typically, a man in Mr. Arndt's condition would have no \nchoice but to become a dependent in a nursing home. But friends and \nneighbors in Walnut came to his rescue in a truly remarkable and \ninspiring way. They joined hands to give him the wherewithal and \nassistance he needed to continue living independently in his apartment.\n   A local restaurant helped to provide daily meals. Several citizens \nhelped Mr. Arndt to keep his apartment clean and orderly, and take him \nto medical appointments. Still others organized shifts to keep him \ncompany in his apartment. Several especially kind citizens got together \nto purchase a motorized chair to help Mr. Arndt get around.\n   It was truly a community effort--an act of collective kindness that \nI find truly inspiring. As you can imagine, Mr. Arndt's daughter, Karen \nDewinter, is overwhelmed with gratitude for what the people of Walnut \ndid for her father. She told me that she was especially touched that on \nher father's birthday, the local AMVET auxiliary held a party at a \ncafe, where they brought cards from local elementary and preschool \nchildren.\n   I express my own gratitude to the people of Walnut, IA, for their \nextraordinary caring and kindness toward Erwin Arndt. Like millions of \nAmericans of what Tom Brokaw has labeled ``the Greatest Generation,'' \nMr. Arndt served our Nation with dedication in both war and peace.\n   In their own special way, the people of Walnut have said thank you \nto this veteran and beloved member of the community. I would like to \nadd my own gratitude, not just to Mr. Arndt but also to the good \ncitizens of Walnut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5945-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FRIENDS OF THE DES PLAINES PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to honor The Friends of the \nDes Plaines Public Library, an organization that has been serving the \nDes Plaines community for the past 50 years.\n  The Friends of the Des Plaines Public Library was founded in April \n1954 by a planning committee of the northwest suburban branch of the \nAmerican Association of University Women and members of several parent \norganizations from Des Plaines area schools.\n  The initial objectives of The Friends of the Des Plaines Public \nLibrary were to stimulate interest in the library and record historical \ndata for the town of Des Plaines. Much of the historical data first \nrecorded by The Friends has since become part of the collection of the \nDes Plaines Historical Society.\n  Over the course of the past 50 years, The Friends of the Des Plaines \nPublic Library has come to play an invaluable role in the ongoing \noperations of the institution and community they serve. Members have \nvolunteered to straighten book shelves, provided rainy day plastic bags \nto help protect books on loan, and held voter registration drives.\n  The Friends of the Des Plaines Public Library holds ongoing book \nsales to provide financial support to the library, enabling the library \nto purchase additional resources and provide educational programming \nfor the citizens of Des Plaines. In the past, the proceeds of these \nbook sales have enabled the library to purchase computers and audio \nvisual equipment.\n  I congratulate the Friends of the Des Plaines Public Library as it \ncelebrates its 50th anniversary. I am confident that this organization \nwill continue its long tradition of promoting and fostering a lifelong \ncommitment to reading and education in the community of Des Plaines \nlong into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5945-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5945-S5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE LIFE OF AN AWARD-WINNING COLUMNIST, REPORTER, AUTHOR\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I honor the life of an award-winning \ncolumnist, reporter and author. My friend, Bill Fiset, lived a long, \ndistinguished life of 73 years, serving his country in World War II. In \naddition to his honorable career, he was a devoted husband, father, and \ngrandfather.\n  Bill Fiset was born March 15, 1921 in Seattle, WA and attended Queen \nAnne High School and the University of Washington, where he was a \nmember of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and a member of the golf \nteam. At 21, he was a reporter and wrote a column called ``Strolling \nAround the Town'' for the Seattle Times.\n  At 22, Fiset saw foreign service in Africa as an ambulance driver in \nthe American Field Service, an organization giving medical aid to the \nAllies before the U.S. entered the war. He resigned the Field Service \nin Egypt in April 1942, and enlisted with the Royal Armored Service \nCorps. As a second lieutenant in the British 8th Army in North Africa, \nhe served as a machine gunner on an armored lorry defending convoys \nfrom Italian bombers between Tobruk and Suez. Fiset also filed field \nreports as a war correspondent.\n  Then America entered WWII. With refugees flooding African transports, \nFiset luckily used his recent gunnery experience to sign on with an \nAmerican freighter as a member of the gun crew, reaching the U.S. 3 \nmonths later.\n  In October, 1942, he joined the Navy. He did his preflight training \nat St. Mary's College in Moraga, CA, and served as a blimp pilot in \nAirship Squadron 32 on a coastal submarine patrol stationed out of \nMoffet Field, California.\n  After the war, Fiset worked as a reporter for the Oakland Post \nEnquirer from 1946 to 1950 and joined the San Francisco Call Bulletin \nas a staff reporter from 1950 to 1952.\n  Fiset then wrote for the Oakland Tribune from March 1952 to 1955 as a \ngeneral assignment reporter covering such infamous murder and kidnap \ntrials as Burton Abbott, Carl Chessman; and Barbara Graham, Jack Santo \nand Emmett Perkins of the so-called Mountain Murder Mob. He also \nwitnessed and reported on their executions at San Quentin Prison.\n  In 1956 he wrote the Tribune's first television column where he \nbecame internationally syndicated and was invited to do walk-on acting \nparts in ``Route 66'' and ``Tales of Wells Fargo.'' He began a general \ncolumn for the Tribune in 1962. That same year, he was nominated for a \nPulitzer Prize and won many awards for his writing. His award-winning \npublic service booklets ``This Is Sherry'' and ``Want To Be Smart,'' \nwritten by Fiset and illustrated by artist Ray Marta were discreetly \ndesigned to warn children and parents about the dangers of kidnapping \nand child sex offenders. Over a million copies were distributed free \nworldwide and locally by the Tribune, the Bay Area Board of Education, \nand local police departments. The efforts earned a commendation by FBI \nDirector J. Edgar Hoover as, ``a graphic message which may mean the \ndifference between life and death for countless\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\nyoungsters,'' and was requested by police departments throughout the \nUnited States, Canada, and Europe.\n  From time to time Fiset continued to file news reports. He wrote \nabout the airlift of Vietnamese-American children out of Vietnam by Ed \nDaly, a friend and the flamboyant owner of World Airways. In 1973, \nFiset was one of the first to file an eyewitness report on the crash of \nthe Soviet SST TU-144 crash at the Paris Air Show.\n  An avid golfer, Fiset participated in many civic groups and fund \nraisers. He taught news writing and reporting at the College of Alameda \nand for many years was a board member for JACKIE, an agency that finds \nfoster homes for children.\n  He was married for almost 60 years and is survived by his wife, \nMarian Fiset of Walnut Creek, his sons Rick Fiset of Danville, Gary \nFiset of Alamo, daughter Michele Fiset Rice of Bryn Mawr, PA, and his \neight grandchildren. Bill Fiset died peacefully on Sunday, May 2, in \nConcord, CA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/20/senate-section/article/S5946-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE STUDENTS OF DOBSON HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. KYL.

A bill to amend the agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nrestore the application date for country of origin labeling; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Washington Post reported that \nthe United States Department of Agriculture secretly allowed American \nmeatpackers to resume imports of ground and processed beef from Canada \nlast September, just weeks after Secretary Veneman publicly reaffirmed \nthe Department's ban on such importation as a result of mad cow disease \nbeing found in Canadian-born cattle.\n  The article states that a total of 33 million pounds of Canadian \nprocessed beef came into the United States and went straight to \nAmerican consumers under a series of undisclosed permits USDA issued to \nthe meatpackers.\n  This is how today's article describes Secretary Veneman's public \nposition last August:\n\n       She and her top deputies said ground beef imports would \n     resume only after the agency completed a formal rulemaking \n     process, with public debate.\n\n  There was no public debate. Instead, there were undisclosed permits \nallowing banned Canadian beef in the United States.\n  Not only am I extremely concerned that the Department of Agriculture \ndeceived American consumers by allowing the import of Canadian beef \nthat was previously banned, but I am also disappointed that the Bush \nadministration is actually working to prevent American consumers from \nknowing where the food they buy comes from.\n  That is why I am introducing a bill today that will require USDA to \nimplement country-of-origin labeling on schedule this September. That \nwas the date agreed upon in the Farm Bill which the President signed \ninto law in 2002.\n   Unfortunately, at the urging of the Bush administration and the \nlarge meatpackers--most likely the same people who urged USDA to issue \npermits to allow the importation of banned Canadian meat products--\nRepublican leaders in Congress inserted language into last year's \nomnibus appropriations bill in the dead of night delaying \nimplementation of country-of-origin labeling for 2 years until \nSeptember 2006.\n   The bill I am introducing today is what the Senate has voted to do \nseveral times: Inform consumers about the origin of their food.\n   Over 80 percent of American consumers have said they want to know \nthe country of origin of their food, and over 170 groups representing \nover 50 million Americans support mandatory food labeling.\n   We must not allow anyone who may represent special interests, anyone \nwho now abrogates the spirit as well as the letter of the law to choose \nbig business interests over the interests of the average American \nfamily. We must ensure consumer confidence, particularly now in light \nof recent developments. We would have not had the situation of 33 \nmillion pounds of banned beef entering the United States if it couldn't \nhave been properly labeled.\n   This legislation is long overdue. It is time that it become the law \nof the land.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2451\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require labeling of raw agricultural of ginseng, \nincluding the country of harvest, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to discuss legislation I am \nintroducing that would protect ginseng farmers and consumers by \nensuring that ginseng sold at retail discloses where the root was \nharvested. The ``Ginseng Harvest Labeling Act of 2004'' is similar to a \nbill that I introduced in the last Congress, but it has been further \nstrengthened based on suggestions I received from ginseng growers and \nthe Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.\n  I would like to take the opportunity to discuss American ginseng and \nthe problems facing Wisconsin's ginseng growers so that my colleagues \nrecognize the need for this legislation. Chinese and Native American \ncultures have used ginseng for thousands of years for herbal and \nmedicinal purposes. As a dietary supplement, American ginseng is widely \ntouted for its ability to improve energy and vitality, particularly in \nfighting fatigue or stress.\n  In the U.S., ginseng is experiencing increasing popularity as a \ndietary supplement, and I am proud to say that my home State of \nWisconsin is playing a central role in ginseng's resurgence. Wisconsin \nproduces 97 percent of the ginseng grown in the United States, and 85 \npercent of the country's ginseng is grown in just one Wisconsin county, \nMarathon County. Ginseng is also grown in a number of other States such \nas Maine, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, \nand West Virginia.\n  For Wisconsin, ginseng has been an economic boon. Wisconsin ginseng \ncommands a premium price in world markets because it is of the highest \nquality and because it has a low pesticide and chemical content. In \n2002, U.S. exports of ginseng totaled nearly $45 million, much of which \nwas grown in Wisconsin. With a huge market for this high-quality \nginseng overseas, and growing popularity for the ancient root here at \nhome, Wisconsin's ginseng industry should have a prosperous future \nahead.\n  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious \nproblem--smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is \nconsidered so superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go \nto great lengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as \n``Wisconsin-grown.''\n  Here's how the switch takes place: Wisconsin ginseng is shipped to \nChina to be sorted into various grades. While the sorting process is \nitself a legitimate part of distributing ginseng, smugglers often use \nit as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng with Asian- or Canadian-grown \nginseng considered inferior by consumers. The lower quality ginseng is \nthen shipped back to the U.S. for sale to American consumers who think \nthey are buying the Wisconsin-grown product.\n  For consumers concerned with purchasing ginseng grown in the U.S., \nthere is no accurate way of testing ginseng to determine where it was \ngrown, other than testing for pesticides that are banned in the United \nStates. The Ginseng Board of Wisconsin has been testing some ginseng \nfound on store shelves, and in many of the products, residues of \nchemicals such as DDT, lead, arsenic, and quintozine (PCNB) have been \ndetected. Since the majority of ginseng sold in the U.S. originates \nfrom countries with less stringent pesticide standards, it is vitally \nimportant that consumers know which ginseng is really grown in the U.S.\n  To capitalize on their product's preeminence, the Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin has developed a voluntary labeling program, stating that the \nginseng is ``Grown in Wisconsin, U.S.A.'' However, Wisconsin ginseng is \nso valuable that counterfeit labels and ginseng smuggling have become \nwidespread around the world. As a result, consumers have no way of \nknowing the most basic information about the ginseng they purchase--\nwhere it was grown, what quality or grade it is, or whether it contains \ndangerous pesticides.\n  My legislation, the Ginseng Harvest Labeling Act of 2004, proposes \nsome common sense steps to address some of the challenges facing the \nginseng industry. My legislation requires that ginseng, as a raw \nagricultural commodity, be sold at retail with a label clearly \nindicating the country that the ginseng was harvested in. `Harvest' is \nimportant because some Canadian and Chinese growers have ginseng plants \nthat originated in the U.S., but because these plants were cultivated \nin the foreign country, they may have been treated with chemicals not \nallowed for use in the U.S. This label would also allow buyers of \nginseng to more easily prevent foreign companies from mixing foreign-\nproduced ginseng with ginseng harvested in the U.S. The country of \nharvest labeling is a simple but effective way to enable consumers to \nmake an informed decision.\n  We must give ginseng growers the support they deserve by implementing \nthese commonsense reforms that also help consumers make informed \nchoices about the ginseng that they consume. We must ensure that when \nginseng consumers reach for a high-quality ginseng product--such as \nWisconsin-grown ginseng--they are getting the real thing, not a knock-\noff.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill, the Ginseng \nHarvest Labeling Act of 2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain public lands \nin and around historic mining townsites in Nevada, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Nevada Mining Townsite Conveyance Act, which \nwill address an important public land issue in rural Nevada. As you may \nknow, the Federal Government controls over 87 percent of the State of \nNevada. That's more than 61 million acres of land. This fact makes it \nnecessary for our State and our communities to pursue Federal remedies \nfor problems that in other States can be handled in a much more \nexpeditious manner. With this in mind, Senator Ensign and I look \nforward to working with our colleagues to pass this common-sense \nlegislation in a bipartisan and timely fashion.\n  Two rural counties in Nevada have asked for our help in settling \nlongstanding trespass issues that hurt 2 historic mining communities. \nThe towns of Ione and Gold Point have been continuously occupied for \nover 100 years. Many residents live on land that their families have \nostensibly owned for many decades. These citizens have paid their \nproperty taxes and made improvements to their properties, rehabilitated \nhistoric structures and built new ones.\n  The documents by which many of these people claim possession of the \nproperties date back many years. In fact, some of the deeds are \nhistoric documents themselves. Yet because many of these documents do \nnot satisfy modern requirements for demonstrating land title, they have \nbeen deemed invalid. In other words, the Bureau of Land Management has \ndetermined that some of the residents of Ione and Gold Point are \ntrespassing on Federal land. This unfortunate situation puts the BLM at \nodds with the local residents and county governments.\n  Nye County, Esmeralda County, and the BLM have worked together for \nalmost 10 years to come up with a solution to this problem. All of \nthese parties support the legislation that we offer today as a solution \nto these land ownerships conflicts, and as a means of promoting \nresponsible resource management. All of the land included in our bill \nhas been identified by the BLM for disposal.\n  Our legislation represents the first of a two-part solution. Under \nthis bill, specified lands within the historic mining townsites of Ione \nand Gold Point would be conveyed to the respective counties. Under the \nprovisions of a State law passed several years ago in Nevada, the \ncounties will then re-convey the land to these people or entities who \ncan demonstrate ownership or longstanding occupancy of specific land \nparcels.\n  The sum of our bill is that it conveys for no consideration \napproximately 760 acres in Ione and Gold Point to the counties of Nye \nand Esmeralda. As a condition of the conveyance, all historic and \ncultural resources contained in the townsites shall be preserved and \nprotected under applicable Federal and State law. These conveyances \nwill benefit the agencies that manage Nevada's\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\nvast Federal lands as well as the proud citizens of our rural \ncommunities. We sincerely hope that our colleagues will support this \nlegislation. It is a practical solution that deserves swift passage. We \nsalute the Bureau of Land Management, the counties, and the local \nresidents for their cooperation and hard work in crafting this \nexcellent compromise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Nevada Mining Townsite \n     Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISPOSAL OF PUBLIC LANDS IN MINING TOWNSITES, \n                   ESMERALDA AND NYE COUNTIES, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Findings.-- Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government owns real property in and around \n     historic mining townsites in the counties of Esmeralda and \n     Nye in the State of Nevada.\n       (2) While the real property is under the jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \n     Land Management, some of the real property land has been \n     occupied for decades by persons who took possession by \n     purchase or other documented and putatively legal \n     transactions, but whose continued occupation of the real \n     property constitutes a ``trespass'' upon the title held by \n     the Federal Government.\n       (3) As a result of the confused and conflicting ownership \n     claims, the real property is difficult to manage under \n     multiple use policies and creates a continuing source of \n     friction and unease between the Federal Government and local \n     residents.\n       (4) All of the real property is appropriate for disposal \n     for the purpose of promoting administrative efficiency and \n     effectiveness, and the Bureau of Land Management has already \n     identified certain parcels of the real property for disposal.\n       (5) Some of the real property contains historic and \n     cultural values that must be protected.\n       (6) To promote responsible resource management of the real \n     property, certain parcels should be conveyed to the county in \n     which the property is situated in accordance with land use \n     management plans of the Bureau of Land Management so that the \n     county can, among other things, dispose of the property to \n     persons residing on or otherwise occupying the property.\n       (b) Mining Townsite Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``mining townsite'' means real property in the counties of \n     Esmeralda and Nye, Nevada, that is owned by the Federal \n     Government, but upon which improvements were constructed \n     because of a mining operation on or near the property and \n     based upon the belief that--\n       (1) the property had been or would be acquired from the \n     Federal Government by the entity that operated the mine; or\n       (2) the person who made the improvement had a valid claim \n     for acquiring the property from the Federal Government.\n       (c) Conveyance Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding sections 202 and 203 of \n     the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1712, 1713), the Secretary of the Interior, acting through \n     the Bureau of Land Management, shall convey, without \n     consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to mining townsites (including improvements \n     thereon) identified for conveyance on the maps entitled \n     ``Original Mining Townsite Ione Land Disposal Map Nye \n     County'' and ``Original Mining Townsite Gold Point Land \n     Disposal Map Esmeralda County'' dated October 29, 2003.\n       (2) Availability of maps.--The maps referred to in \n     paragraph (1) shall be on file and available for public \n     inspection in the appropriate offices of the Secretary of the \n     Interior, including the office of the Bureau of Land \n     Management located in the State of Nevada.\n       (d) Recipients.--\n       (1) Original recipient.--Subject to paragraph (2), the \n     conveyance of a mining townsite under subsection (c) shall be \n     made to the county in which the mining townsite is situated.\n       (2) Reconveyance to occupants.--In the case of a mining \n     townsite conveyed under subsection (c) for which a valid \n     interest is proven by one or more persons, under the \n     provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 244, the county \n     that received the mining townsite under paragraph (1) shall \n     reconvey the property to that person or persons by \n     appropriate deed or other legal conveyance as provided in \n     that State law. For purposes of proving a valid interest, the \n     person making the claim must have occupied the mining \n     townsite for at least 15 years immediately before the date of \n     the enactment of this Act. The county is not required to \n     recognize a claim under this paragraph submitted more than 10 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Protection of Historic and Cultural Resources.--As a \n     condition on the conveyance or reconveyance of a mining \n     townsite under subsection (c), all historic and cultural \n     resources (including improvements) on the mining townsite \n     shall be preserved and protected in accordance with \n     applicable Federal and State law.\n       (f) Valid Existing Rights.--The conveyance of a mining \n     townsite under this section shall be subject to valid \n     existing rights, including any easement or other right-of-way \n     or lease in existence as of the date of the conveyance. All \n     valid existing rights and interests of mining claimants shall \n     be maintained, unless those rights or interests are deemed \n     abandoned and void or null and void under--\n       (1) section 2320 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 21 et \n     seq);\n       (2) the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 \n     U.S.C. 1701 et seq); or\n       (3) subtitle B of title X of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (30 U.S.C. 28(f)-(k)), including \n     regulations promulgated under section 3833.1 of title 43, \n     Code of Federal Regulations or any successor regulation.\n       (g) Survey.--A mining townsite to be conveyed by the United \n     States under this section shall be sufficiently surveyed to \n     legally describe the land for patent conveyance.\n       (h) Release.--On completion of the conveyance of a mining \n     townsite under subsection (c), the United States shall be \n     relieved from liability for, and shall be held harmless from, \n     any and all claims arising from the presence of improvements \n     and materials on the conveyed property.\n       (i) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior such \n     amounts as may be necessary to carry out the conveyances \n     required by this section, including funds to cover the costs \n     of cadastral and mineral surveys, mineral potential reports, \n     hazardous materials, biological, cultural and archaeological \n     clearances, validity examinations and other expenses \n     incidental to the conveyances.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2459. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to \naward research and equipment grants, to provide a tax credit for \nemployers who hire temporary workers to replace employees receiving \nfirst responder training, to provide school-based mental health \ntraining, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the \nCommunity Security Act of 2004. This bill is intended to help prepare \nour Nation to cope with future disasters, as well as help the daily \nwork of our first responders, by adequately training and equipping \nthem, and by increasing Federal investments in relevant research and \ndevelopment. While much of the bill applies generally to all first \nresponders, this legislation gives special emphasis to the role of \nvolunteer first responders.\n  As my colleagues surely know, volunteers make up a very significant \nportion of our Nation's fire service, as well as emergency medical \npersonnel and, to a somewhat lesser degree, law enforcement. The role \nof volunteers is especially prominent in rural areas, such as in my \nState of West Virginia. Making certain that local governments can \nrecruit and retain first responders, and that once serving, these \ndedicated men and women have the necessary tools, are essential factors \nin protecting our communities.\n  Inspiration for much of this bill came from the West Virginia Summit \non Homeland Security, which I hosted in November of last year, and from \nthe numerous roundtable discussions I have had with my State's first \nresponders since the terrorist attacks on our country on September 11, \n2001. During the Summit and in the discussions that preceded it, first \nresponders, educators, health officials, and local elected officials \nfrom around West Virginia provided me with thoughtful analysis of what \nworks in Federal assistance programs, what doesn't, and what has been \ncompletely lacking.\n  Although the President and Congress have made great strides in \nimproving our homeland security, there are still gaping holes in our \nlevel of preparedness that must be filled. For the most part, the \nFederal Government is the only source of funding for this work; work \nthat must be done. This legislation is based on what first responders \nhave told me they need and is intended to address these needs.\n  What was reiterated in meeting after meeting was that the gaps were \nmany, and that additional State funding was unlikely. As almost every \nState in the Union faces budget shortfalls, I expect my colleagues have \nheard much the same thing. First responders and local politicians need \nto recruit and train volunteers; they need the Federal Government to \nhelp them supply these men and women with basic lifesaving and \ninteroperable communication equipment; and they need help in fostering \ncooperation among not only the\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\ndifferent professions within the first responder community, but between \nfirst responders and the education and social service communities.\n  Many areas of concern were discussed and it became clear to me that \nno one program could address all of them. Instead of introducing a \nnumber of small bills, I've put together a package of legislation that \ncontains several arguably unrelated provisions that have one thing in \ncommon--each is designed to improve homeland security at the local \nlevel.\n  In West Virginia and across the Nation, the numbers of volunteer \nfirst responders have been dwindling due to a number of factors--\nNational Guard and Reserve call-ups and changing American lifestyles \nthat leave little time for the serious commitment necessary to be a \nfirst responder. It is believed that many more people would volunteer, \nor would continue in their service as volunteers, if there were a way \nto carve out more time for the training involved. In addition to basic \ntraining, West Virginia and other states require additional training \nfor first responders who choose to serve in units specializing in \nWeapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) response, or mitigation of biohazards \nand chemical releases. In fact, Secretary Ridge has cited West \nVirginia's homeland security plan, including development of highly \ntrained Regional Response Teams, as an example for other States to \nfollow.\n  The problem is, earning the right to be part of one of these teams--\nmade up of the best of the best in their respective disciplines--\nrequires training that most volunteers, who are holding down full-time \njobs in addition to their public service and family responsibilities, \ncannot find the time for, or in some cases, afford. For example, West \nVirginia's Regional Response Team members are required, within the \nfirst two years, to complete 200 hours of specialized training over and \nabove what is already required in their roles as firefighters or EMTs. \nFor many volunteer first responders, this time commitment is difficult \nto meet but, for those whose jurisdictions do not pay training costs, \nit is impossible to justify.\n  To remedy this situation, this bill creates two tax incentives: a \nbusiness credit to encourage small businesses to allow their volunteer \nfirst responder employees to take time off for training, and a personal \ndeduction for the first responders themselves, when training and \nrelated expenses are not reimbursed by their State or local government.\n  My conversations with West Virginia first responders and local \nofficials have also taught me that even when a State is well prepared \nor, in the case of West Virginia, exceptionally prepared, gaps can \nstill exist at the local level which put citizens at risk. Some local \nfirst responder units, especially those in rural areas, do not feel as \nprepared as they know they should be. For example, a recent report \nfound that most fire departments across the country had only enough \nradios for one-half of the firefighters on a shift and breathing \napparatuses for only one-third. Without these basics, these brave men \nand women are not adequately equipped to respond to a house fire and \nare at a serious disadvantage when responding to a critical incident.\n  Similarly, some firehouses and police stations lack basic \ntelecommunications equipment. I have been concerned for some time that \nmany of our police departments in rural areas were operating without \nthe crime-fighting tools at their disposal that computers and high-\nspeed Internet connections offer. So, while I was not necessarily \nsurprised, I was a little troubled that the lack of modern \ntelecommunications equipment--computer hardware, Internet service and \ne-mail, and multiple phone and fax lines--was hampering the ability of \nfire departments and EMS units to serve their communities. Given the \nwealth of information available and the greater amounts of first \nresponder work conducted over the Internet, these basic office tools \nare essential to guarantee the safety and protection of our citizens. \nFor instance, where this equipment is available, some first responder \ntraining is now being done over the Internet, saving departments time \nand money. Rural firehouses are probably the ones least likely to have \nan Internet-accessible computer and are also the least likely to be \nable to fund a longer trip to a fire school.\n\n  So, this legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nassess the critical needs of a first responder unit, from personal \nsafety equipment to office machines, and establishes a grant program to \nprovide the basic equipment essential for carrying out the constantly \nexpanding responsibilities of local first responders. The Secretary is \nto give emphasis to those departments most in need. These departments \nwill often, but not always, be rural departments.\n  The other areas I cover in this bill are a bit of a departure from \nstandard measures to increase funding and provide better equipment for \nfirst responders. They are, I believe, no less important to the goal of \nimproving the safety and security of our towns and cities. Again, my \nconversations with people on the front lines--in this instance teachers \nand academic experts on homeland security and mental health--inspired \nthese provisions.\n  Our communities have had to adjust to some new realities. Our schools \nfind themselves thrust into a role in disaster preparedness and \nresponse that most educators never before considered. When I asked \nschool personnel what was needed to improve the circumstance of schools \nin homeland security preparation, response, and mitigation efforts, I \nwas surprised to hear their answer--mental health professionals in the \nschools and training for school staff in mental health issues. This \nbill works to address these community needs in two ways. First, in the \nunfortunate event that a school is the scene of a disaster, or is \ncalled upon to assist a community in response to a disaster elsewhere, \nthis bill provides that community with a reimbursement mechanism for \nrelated expenses. Second, the bill creates a sustainable program to \nprovide school-based mental health services to all students. I am \nconvinced that having mental health professionals in schools to train \nstudents and faculty about disaster avoidance and preparation makes for \nsafer, healthier schools and more stable communities.\n  Our institutions of higher learning are already contributing to \nhomeland security. The Department of Homeland Security has a program of \nuniversity-based research, and this legislation proposes to expand it \nwith a new research grant program to supplement the surprising dearth \nof research that has been conducted on human factors in homeland \nsecurity, including first responder group dynamics, citizens' response \nto disasters, and the human factors behind preparation efforts. We know \nthat a primary goal of terrorists is to disrupt social systems, and \nthis social disruption is often more devastating to a community then \nthe attack itself. I have actively supported both basic and applied \nscientific research throughout my Senate career, and I believe science \nshould guide policy. This research grant program will fund research on \nhow terrorism and the threat of terrorism impacts the average citizen, \nhow the inevitable societal disruption can be mitigated, and will help \nguide disaster planning and optimize the performance of first responder \nunits and the systems designed to assist them.\n  Historically, some States have benefited more than others under \ntraditional grant systems and in response to that situation, our \nleading science funding organizations have developed special programs \nto encourage the growth of research in under represented states. For \nexample, the National Science Foundation designed the Experimental \nProgram to Stimulate Competitive Research to support academic research \nand development across the nation and to counteract the trend that \nconcentrated research expertise in a few states. This bill allows for a \nsimilar program to be developed within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Homeland security is regional and research and personnel \nexpertise must be distributed around the country. Unfortunately, \nterrorist threats against the United States are not restricted to a \nsingle geographic area, terrorist group, or method of threat. Terrorism \nis possible in many parts of our country that have never had to prepare \nfor, or respond to, such attacks. Addressing these threats requires \nregional and local expertise; thus the homeland security- related \nscientific and technological workforce and training must not be overly \ncentralized.\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\n  Our country has worked extraordinarily hard to prepare for disaster. \nThe Local Preparation Act is designed to assist these preparation \nefforts by guaranteeing adequate numbers of first responders, providing \nthem with the training and protection they need, and improving the \nsafety and security of our communities. Local preparation is the \nbedrock of our state-wide and national efforts. I firmly believe these \ngoals will be achieved through the innovative programs contained in \nthis bill. I want to thank Summit participants as well as the men and \nwomen who have taken time out of their busy schedules to help work \nthrough the best way to design these new programs. Also, I want to \nthank first responders, both volunteer and career. After all, they are \nthe original inspiration for this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Security Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TAX INCENTIVES TO FACILITATE TRAINING OR DISASTER \n                   RESPONSE BY INDIVIDUALS SERVING AS VOLUNTEER \n                   FIRST RESPONDERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Seventy percent of our Nation's firefighters are \n     volunteers, as are many emergency medical service and police \n     personnel.\n       (2) States rely heavily on the services of these volunteer \n     first responders.\n       (3) Many career first responders begin as volunteers.\n       (4) Volunteer first responders need the same preparation \n     and training as career first responders. Advanced training is \n     frequently required before volunteer first responders can be \n     fully integrated in a State homeland security plan.\n       (5) The training and duties of volunteer first responders \n     sometimes conflict with their regular employment for \n     significant periods of time, such as in cases of out-of-State \n     training and disaster response. In these cases employers may \n     need to hire temporary replacement workers or incur other \n     related costs while the volunteer responders are away from \n     work. The burden of temporarily replacing these employees is \n     particularly great for small and single-employer businesses.\n       (b) Volunteer First Responder Credit.--\n       (1) In general.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 (relating to business-related credits), as amended \n     by this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 45G.

Undefended borders make terrorist attacks \n     possible in places that have never had to prepare for, or \n     respond to, terrorism.\n       (4) Every State must be prepared for disasters and will \n     incur costs associated with homeland security.\n       (5) States experience varying levels of potential homeland \n     security threats and homeland security concerns vary \n     geographically. Addressing these threats requires regional \n     and local expertise, thus the scientific and technological \n     workforce and training should not be overly centralized.\n       (6) Academic research and development funding has not been \n     distributed equitably in the past.

A bill to provide assistance to the State of New Mexico for \nthe development of comprehensive State water plans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, water is the life's blood for New \nMexico. When the water dries up in New Mexico, so will many of its \ncommunities. As such, the scarcity of water in New Mexico is a dire \nsituation. Unfortunately, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer \n(NM OSE) lacks the tools necessary to undertake the Herculean task of \neffectively managing New Mexico's water resources.\n  Today, I introduce legislation that would allow New Mexico to make \ninformed decisions about its limited water resources.\n  In order to effectively perform water rights administration, as well \nas comply with New Mexico's compact deliveries, the State Engineer is \nstatutorily required to perform assessments and investigations of the \nnumerous stream systems and ground water basins located within New \nMexico. However, the NM OSE is ill equipped to vigorously and \ncomprehensively undertake the daunting but critically important task of \nwater resource planning. At present, the NM OSE lacks adequate \nresources to perform necessary hydrographic surveys and data \ncollection. As such, ensuring a future water supply for my home state \nrequires that Congress provide the NM OSE with the resources necessary \nto fulfill its statutory mandate.\n  The bill I introduce today would create a standing authority for the \nState of New Mexico to seek and receive technical assistance from the \nBureau of Reclamation and the United States Geological Survey. It would \nalso provide the NM OSE the sum of $12.5 million in federal assistance \nto perform hydrologic models of New Mexico's most important water \nsystems. This bill would provide the NM OSE with the best resources \navailable when making crucial decisions about how best preserve our \nlimited water stores.\n  Ever decreasing water supplies in New Mexico have reached critical \nlevels and require immediate action. The Congress cannot sit idly by as \nwater shortages cause death to New Mexico's communities. I hope the \nSenate will give this legislation its every consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``New Mexico Water Planning \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation and \n     the United States Geological Survey.\n       (2) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of New \n     Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $2,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. KENNEDY):\n  S. 2461. A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food \nand Drug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join our colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, to introduce a bill\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\ndesigned to help protect consumers--especially children--from the \ndangers of tobacco. Simply, our bill would finally give the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) the authority it needs to effectively \nregulate the manufacture and sale of tobacco products.\n  I say finally, because there are some tobacco proponents who would \nhave you believe that the Master Settlement Agreement, which was signed \nin 1998 by 46 States, resolved the issue of youth tobacco use by \nimposing advertising restrictions.\n  I say finally, because my colleagues--first Senator McCain, then \nSenator Frist, then Senator Gregg, and then Senator Kennedy and I--have \nbeen seeking FDA regulation of tobacco products since the mid to late \n1990's.\n  And, I say finally, because the bill that we are introducing today is \nthe product of long and hard discussions and negotiations that I have \nhad with Senator Kennedy and public interest groups and industry. Our \nbill has the support of Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. Our bill has \nthe support of Philip Morris. Our bill has the support of the American \nHeart Association, the American Lung Association, and the American \nCancer Association. It is a bill that I am proud of, that is worthy of \nthe Senate's consideration, and that will provide the FDA--finally--\nwith strong and effective authority over the regulation of tobacco \nproducts.\n  I realize full well that tobacco users and non-users, alike, \nrecognize and understand that tobacco products are hazardous to their \nhealth. We all know that smoking is not a healthy habit. But, that's an \nobvious point in comparison to the fact that right now, many consumers, \nincluding smokers, are surprised to learn that no Federal agency has \nthe authority to require tobacco companies to list the ingredients that \nare in their products--things like trace amounts of arsenic, \nformaldehyde, and ammonia. And, no Federal agency has the authority to \ninspect tobacco manufacturers--how the cigarette and smokeless tobacco \nproducts are made, whether the manufacturers' machines and equipment \nare clean, etc.\n  While simply listing the ingredients, toxic as they may be, might not \nseem like much to some, think of it this way: Current law makes sure we \nknow what's in products designed to help people quit smoking, like \n``the patch'' or Nicorette gum, but not the very products that get \npeople addicted in the first place--the cigarettes. That is absolutely \nabsurd!\n  Think about this: Right now, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nrequires Philip Morris/Altria to print the ingredients in its Kraft \n``Macaroni and Cheese,'' but not the ingredients in its cigarettes--a \nproduct that contributes to the deaths of more than 440,000 people a \nyear.\n  Right now, the FDA requires Philip Morris-owned Nabisco to print the \ningredients contained in ``Oreo Cookies'' and ``Ritz Crackers,'' but \nnot the ingredients in its cigarettes--even though cigarettes cause \none-third of all cancer deaths and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths. It \nis unfathomable to me that we would require the listing of ingredients \non these products, yet not require the listing of ingredients for one \nof the leading causes of death and disease.\n  Right now, the FDA requires the printed ingredients for chewing gum, \nlipstick, bottled water, and ice cream, but not for cigarettes--a \nproduct that causes 20% of all heart disease deaths and is the leading \ncause of preventable death in the United States.\n  Think about this: If a company wants to market a food product as \n``fat-free'' or ``reduced-fat'' or ``lite,'' that company is required \nto meet certain standards regarding the number of calories or the \namount of fat grams in that product. Yet, cigarette companies can call \na cigarette a ``light'' or ``mild'' and not reveal a thing about the \namount of tar or nicotine or arsenic in that supposedly ``light'' \ncigarette.\n  Not having access to all the information about this deadly product \njust makes no sense, and it is something that needs to change. By \nintroducing this bill, we are finally saying that we are not going to \nlet tobacco manufacturers have free reign over their markets and \nconsumers any more.\n  Today, we are taking a step toward making sure the public gets \nadequate information about whether to continue to smoke or even to \nstart smoking in the first place. With this bill, we are not just \nsaying ``buyer beware.'' We are saying ``tobacco companies be honest.'' \nWe are saying ``tobacco companies stop marketing to innocent \nchildren.'' We are saying ``tobacco companies tell consumers about what \nthey are really buying.''\n  The legislation that Senator Kennedy and I are introducing would do \njust that.\n  One of the most dramatic changes our bill makes is that tobacco \nproducts will now have to be approved before they reach consumer hands. \nIt just makes sense that tobacco products should not be able to imply \nthat they may be safer or less harmful to consumers because they use \ndescriptors such as ``light'' or ``mild'' or ``low'' to characterize \nthe level of a substance in a product. The National Cancer Institute \nhas found that many smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and \n``light'' cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \nOur bill would require specific approval by the FDA to use those words, \nso that consumers could be informed.\n  For the first time ever, all new tobacco products entering the market \nwould have to be approved by the FDA. Obviously, we already know that \nsmoking is a health risk. But, what we don't know about is the harm \ncaused by or what adverse health effects are created by the other \ningredients in tobacco products or by how the tobacco is burned. There \nare tobacco products on the market that are not conventional \ncigarettes. They have carbon filters running down the center of them. \nThey are sophisticated products that burn tobacco differently, that \naffect the body differently, and that may cause people to smoke them \ndifferently.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, in an \nOctober article of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, ``the \nonly proven method to reduce tobacco-related cancer risk is to stop \nsmoking.'' Yet, often times, people cannot quit. It is very difficult \nto quit ingesting an addictive product. People are addicted to the \nnicotine in the tobacco product and are just simply unable to quit \nusing it. So, tobacco companies have responded by developing and \nmarketing tobacco products that purport to be ``reduced-risk'' or \n``safer.''\n  Take, for example, a person who smokes Marlboro cigarettes--just \nplain Marlboro cigarettes, the ones in the red package. Let's say that \nperson would like to quit smoking, has tried to quit smoking a number \nof times, but just hasn't been successful. So instead of quitting \noutright, that person figures they will switch the type of cigarette \nthey smoke to a cigarette that has the implied claim of being \n``safer''--like a ``light'' cigarette or a ``mild'' cigarette or a \n``low tar'' cigarette. Those cigarettes have not been found to be any \nsafer? In fact, just the opposite has been discovered.\n  In a 2001 National Cancer Institute publication, they wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       The tobacco companies set out to develop cigarette designs \n     that markedly lowered the tar and nicotine yield results as \n     measured by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) testing \n     method. Yet, these cigarettes can be manipulated by the \n     smoker to increase the intake of tar and nicotine. The use of \n     these ``decreased risk'' cigarettes have not significantly \n     decreased the disease risk. In fact, the use of these \n     cigarettes may be partly responsible for the increase in lung \n     cancer for long-term smokers who have switched to the low-\n     tar/low-nicotine brands. Finally, switching to these \n     cigarettes may provide smokers with a false sense of reduced \n     risk, when the actual amount of tar and nicotine consumed may \n     be the same as, or more than, the previously used higher \n     yield brand.\n\n  So the products that tobacco companies develop and market as being \n``safer'' are not safer. Rather than people quitting smoking entirely, \nthey are often misled into thinking that the ``light'' or ``mild'' \ncigarettes that they switch to are better for them. In addition, people \nmay begin to start smoking because they think some of these products \naren't so bad for them--that the products have been made safer or \nbetter for them somehow and are okay to smoke.\n  Tobacco companies are able to make these implied health claims about \ntheir products because they are not regulated. Consumers have no choice \nbut to trust the tobacco companies to reveal the ingredients and \nmarketing claims about their products. That is just absurd to me. These \nare all things that should be examined, reviewed, and commented on by \nthe Food and Drug\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\nAdministration to determine whether it is appropriate for these \nproducts to be marketed as ``reduced-risk'' products, so the public \nknows what they are choosing to consume.\n  Tobacco advertising is in magazines and on billboards along the \nhighway. Tobacco advertising is in convenience stores, along the aisles \nand at the checkout counter right beside the candy where children are \nlikely to see it. Tobacco advertising is at sporting events, part of \npromotional items, where consumers can ``buy 1 get 1 free.'' Tobacco \nadvertising is on the Internet and in the daily delivery of mail.\n  Our bill would make changes regarding tobacco advertising. It would \ngive the FDA authority to restrict tobacco industry marketing--\nconsistent with the First Amendment--that targets our children. Our \nbill would require advertisements to be in black and white text only \nand would define adult publication in terms of readership.\n  An issue that is related to advertising and marketing of tobacco \nproducts has to do with the flavored tobacco products, which clearly \ntarget our children. We have probably all seen the flavored \ncigarettes--flavors like strawberry, chocolate, and wild rum. The scent \nof strawberry filters through the unopened pack of cigarettes. And \nguess what, the cigarettes smell like candy. A recent New York Times \narticle described the scent of chocolate flavored cigarettes as if \n``someone had lifted the lid on a Whitman Sampler.''\n  I can't speak for every parent, but I know my 8 grandchildren like \ncandy, and they like the smell of chocolate, and they would be curious \nto try something that smells or tastes like candy. Cigarettes shouldn't \nbe flavored and marketed in such a way to attract children and to \nencourage children to smoke. Our bill bans the use of flavors such as \nstrawberry, grape, orange, clove, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, \ncoconut, coffee and other flavorings that would attract children to the \nproduct.\n  Despite the fact that 40 million Americans use tobacco products, many \nof them do not know what is inside the cigarette or the tobacco product \nthey ingest. They do not know the ingredients or the constituents, like \ntar or nicotine, that are in the products they use. Consumers do not \nknow what additives are included in the product. Additives like ammonia \nor urea, both of which may make the tobacco product more addictive \nbecause they increase the delivery of nicotine. Tobacco companies do \nnot disclose the specific ingredients in their products because they \ndon't have to. Tobacco products are unregulated.\n  Our legislation would give consumers more information about what's in \ntobacco products. Specifically, the bill would provide the FDA with the \nability to publish the ingredients of tobacco products.\n  It would require a listing of all ingredients, substances, and \ncompounds added by the manufacturer to the tobacco, paper, or filter.\n  It would require a description of the content, delivery, and form of \nnicotine in each tobacco product.\n  It would require information on the health, behavioral, or \nphysiologic effects of the tobacco products.\n  I think it is equally important that I mention what our bill does not \ndo. Here are some of the areas where authority is not conferred to FDA: \nOur bill does not allow FDA to ban tobacco products or to eliminate \nnicotine from a tobacco product. The bill ensures that FDA will not \nhave the power to use its ``performance standard'' authority to ban \ncigarettes, smokeless tobacco or any other category of tobacco \nproducts, or to reduce their nicotine yields to zero.\n  Our bill does not allow FDA to establish a minimum smoking age higher \nthan 18. The bill explicitly forbids FDA from establishing a minimum \nage higher than 18 years of age to purchase tobacco products.\n  Our bill treats all tobacco retailers equally. Our bill specifically \nprovides that FDA can't prohibit the sale of tobacco products in any \nparticular category of retail outlet. Our bill forbids FDA from \ncreating a more permissive set of advertising rules for adult-only \nestablishments. This provision protects retailers and convenience store \nowners.\n  Finally, I would like to make a comment about the tobacco farmers. \nThere has been a lot of talk recently about the need for a buyout for \nour Nation's tobacco farmers. My colleagues, Senator McConnell and \nSenator Dole, have been working tirelessly to craft a buyout bill for \ntobacco farmers. They need a buyout--and the Congress should give them \none. The Senate needs to pass the buyout, but the buyout needs to be \npassed along with this FDA bill. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues from the tobacco-growing states to make this happen.\n  The bill that Senator Kennedy and I introduce today gives the FDA the \nauthority to regulate a product that has gone unregulated for far too \nlong--a product that for the past century has not revealed its \ningredients to the consumer--a product whose manufacturing facilities \nare not inspected or accountable for following good manufacturing \npractices--a product that is never reviewed or approved before reaching \nthe hands of 40 million consumers, many of whom are just children. \nCongress needs to put an end to this. Congress should put an end to the \nmarketing of tobacco products to our children. Congress should put an \nend to the ability of tobacco companies to make claims, whether they \nare implied claims or direct claims, about their products. Congress \nshould put an end to tobacco companies putting any ingredient they want \ninto their products without disclosing it to the consumer.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\n     public at large recognize that the tobacco industry should be \n     subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 6,500,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 2,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2001, the tobacco industry spent more than \n     $11,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this Act for the regulation of tobacco \n     products by the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to \n     and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this Act.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. \n     Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not \n     and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed \n     by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes and such products may actually \n     increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in insuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be approved in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\n     support approval of these products is rigorous.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--Nothing in this Act (or an amendment \n     made by this Act) shall be construed to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or\n       (2) affect any action pending in Federal, State, or Tribal \n     court, or any agreement, consent decree, or contract of any \n     kind.\n       (b) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act \n     (or an amendment made by this Act) which authorize the \n     Secretary to take certain actions with regard to tobacco and \n     tobacco products shall not be construed to affect any \n     authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under existing law \n     regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of raw tobacco.\n\n     SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, the amendments made by this \n     Act, or the application of any provision of this Act to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder \n     of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of the provisions of this Act to any other person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected and shall continue to \n     be enforced to the fullest extent possible.\n\n         TITLE I--AUTHORITY OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, today, Senator DeWine and I are \nintroducing legislation to give the Food and Drug Administration broad \nauthority to regulate tobacco products for the protection of the public \nhealth. We cannot in good conscience allow the Federal agency most \nresponsible for protecting the public health to remain powerless to \ndeal with the enormous risks of tobacco, the most deadly of all \nconsumer products.\n  This legislation is a fair and balanced approach to FDA regulation. \nIt creates a new section in FDA jurisdiction for the regulation of \ntobacco products, with standards that allow for consideration of the \nunique issues raised by tobacco use. It is sensitive to the concerns of \ntobacco farmers, small businesses, and nicotine-dependent smokers. But, \nit clearly gives FDA the authority it needs in order to prevent youth \nsmoking and to reduce addiction to this highly lethal product.\n  The stakes are vast. Five thousand children have their first \ncigarette every day, and two thousand of them become daily smokers. \nNearly a thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced \ndiseases. Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in the \nNation today. Cigarettes kill well over 400,000 Americans each year. \nThat is more lives lost than from automobile accidents, alcohol abuse, \nillegal drugs, AIDS, murder, suicide, and fires combined. Our response \nto a public health problem of this magnitude must consist of more than \nhalf-way measures.\n  We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that \ntarget children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug \nAdministration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, \ndistribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n  The tobacco industry currently spends over $9 billion a year to \npromote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways designed to \ntempt children to start smoking, before they are mature enough to \nappreciate the enormity of the health risk. The industry knows that \nmore than 90 percent of smokers begin as children and are addicted by \nthe time they reach adulthood.\n  Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies' \nown words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children \ninto dependency on their deadly product. Recent studies by the \nInstitute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the \nsubstantial role of industry advertising in decisions by young people \nto use tobacco products.\n  If we are serious about reducing youth smoking, FDA must have the \npower to prevent industry advertising\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\ndesigned to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children. \nThis legislation will give FDA the ability to stop tobacco advertising \nwhich glamorizes smoking from appearing where it will be seen by \nsignificant numbers of children. It grants FDA full authority to \nregulate tobacco advertising ``consistent with and to the full extent \npermitted by the First Amendment.''\n  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every State makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children \nunder 18, but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and \nfrequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machine sales. There must also be serious \nenforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling \ntobacco products to children. This is the only way to ensure that \nchildren under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes.\n  The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history, \nstudying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were \nreceived in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its \nproceeding, the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which \ncigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those \nregulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing \nyouth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no \nsense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi-\nyear rulemaking process on the same issues. This legislation will give \nthe youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA \nthe immediate force of law, as if they had been issued under the new \nstatute.\n  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette \nand smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These \nwarnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical \nproblems which can result from tobacco use. The FDA is given the \nauthority to change the text of these warning labels periodically, to \nkeep their impact strong.\n  Nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say that \nit is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco \ncompanies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. \nNo one can forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under \noath before Congress that smoking cigarettes is not addictive. \nOverwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the \ndiscovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this \naddictiveness for decades, but actually relied on it as the basis for \ntheir marketing strategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers \nchemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even \nmore addictive.\n  The tobacco industry has a long, dishonorable history of providing \nmisleading information about the health consequences of smoking. These \ncompanies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far \nless hazardous than they are. They made minor innovations in product \ndesign seem far more significant for the health of the user than they \nactually were. It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous \nauthority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future. The largest \ndisinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end.\n  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the \nFDA regulate them for the protection of the public health. Over forty \nmillion Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes. No responsible \npublic health official believes that cigarettes should be banned. A ban \nwould leave forty million people without a way to satisfy their drug \ndependency. FDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help \naddicted smokers overcome their addiction, and to make the product less \ntoxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA \nmust have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from \ncigarettes, to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible. The \ninherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded.\n  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they \nplan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. \nThis legislation will require manufacturers to submit such ``reduced \nrisk'' products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed. No \nhealth-related claims will be permitted until they have been verified \nto the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential to prevent \ndeceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the public \ninto a false sense of health safety.\n  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America. \nCongress must vest FDA not only with the responsibility for regulating \ntobacco products, but with full authority to do the job effectively.\n  This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs--to \nreduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets \nchildren--to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors--to help \nsmokers overcome their addiction--to make tobacco products less toxic \nfor those who continue to use them--and to prevent the tobacco industry \nfrom misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  We believe that there is an excellent chance of enacting this bill \nthis year. The interest of tobacco-state members in passing a tobacco \nfarmers' quota buyout provides a golden opportunity. By joining a \nstrong FDA bill with relief for tobacco farmers, we can assemble a \nbroad, bipartisan coalition to accomplish both of these goals during \nthis session. This approach is supported by the public health community \nand by farmers' organizations. Most importantly, it is the right thing \nto do for America's children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 2462.

I left school \nat the age of 17 to enlist in the Navy to serve this country in World \nWar II. In the military, I earned the rank of Petty Officer 3rd Class, \nelectronic technician's mate. And, it was in this role that I earned my \nfirst bit of technical education.\n  In return for my service, I was lucky enough to earn a GI Bill that \nhelped me go to college at Washington & Lee University where I earned a \ndegree in engineering. Subsequently, I joined the Marines and earned a \nsecond GI Bill that allowed me to attend the University of Virginia \nwhere I earned my law degree.\n  Without the GI bill, I certainly might not have earned the education \nthat I was fortunate enough to receive, and I certainly would not be \nstanding here today in the United States Senate. That is why I feel so \nvery strongly that we must support education in this country. Today's \ngeneration of students should have at least the same opportunity to \nearn their education that I had, if not more.\n  We are fortunate in America that we have several important Federal \nprograms to help make education more affordable for today's generation. \nWhether it is the GI Bill, the Americorp stipend, subsidized and \nunsubsidized Stafford loans, or any number of other Federal education \nprograms, many Americans today who wish to obtain higher education have \naccess to a variety of educational programs. I support strengthening \nthese programs to increase access to higher education.\n  Of all the educational grant programs, the Pell Grant program is the \nlargest source of grant aid to help students pay for the costs \nassociated with higher education. Eligibility for Pell Grants is based \non financial need, and this year alone, Pell Grants helped 5.3 million \nundergraduate students attain higher education.\n  Now, I am a strong supporter of the Pell Grant program. The $13.1 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nthat is being spent by the Federal Government on Pell Grants in fiscal \nyear 2004 gives students access to higher education that otherwise \nmight not have such access. But, I also recognize that the Pell Grant \nprogram was created in 1972 when the world was entirely different.\n  Our world today is much more dangerous than it was back then, and \nmuch more dangerous than when I served this country with brief tours of \nduty in World War II and the Korean War.\n  Today, while we're sleeping, people in other parts of the world are \ncontriving of every possible way to take our business, our economy, our \nsecurity, and our freedoms away from us. September 11, 2001, should \nremind us of this.\n  Once, great oceans protected this Nation. But now, with the advent of \nthe Internet and other modern technologies, the world is more connected \nthan ever, and America is more vulnerable than ever in a lot of ways. \nComputer hackers all over the world try on a daily basis to hack into \ngovernment computers. If successful, this could wreak havoc. \nFurthermore, each day, for whatever reason, people create computer \nviruses, and even the smallest virus can cost our economy billions of \ndollars.\n  Simply put, in today's day and age, our country faces new challenges \nlike never before. I ask--are we prepared to meet these challenges?\n  Unfortunately, our institutions of higher learning are not producing \nenough American graduates with certain majors to meet our new \nchallenges. In engineering, math, computer sciences, hard sciences, and \ncertain foreign languages--America is coming up short.\n  The statistics are alarming: the Third International Math and Science \nStudy reports that U.S. 12th graders scored in only the 7th percentile \nin math worldwide, and only the 3rd percentile in science. This is near \nthe bottom among major industrialized nations. The National Science \nFoundation reports that the fraction of U.S. Bachelor degrees in \nscience and engineering have been declining for nearly 2 decades when \ncompared to the rest of the world. While nearly two-thirds of Bachelor \ndegrees in China and Singapore are science or engineering, they account \nfor only about 17 percent in the United States. In fact, we currently \nrank 61st out of the 63 countries surveyed. Similarly, the National \nScience Board reports that the fraction of foreign born scientists and \nengineers in the U.S. workforce rose to an all time high by 2000. \nAmazingly, 38 percent of all people working in the United States with \ndoctorate degrees in science or engineering are now foreign born.\n  The effects of these educational trends are already being felt in \nvarious important ways. For example: the American Physical Society \nreports that the proportion of articles by American authors in the \nPhysical Review, one of the most important research journals in the \nworld, has hit an all time low of 29 percent, down from 61 percent in \n1983. And the U.S. production of patents, probably the most direct link \nbetween research and economic benefit, has declined steadily relative \nto the rest of the world for decades, and now stands at only 52 percent \nof the total.\n  Despite these statistics, up to now, this country has been able to \nmeet its new challenges by importing brain power from foreign \ncountries. We are fortunate to have so many smart minds from other \ncountries willing to come to the United States to fill critical science \nand engineering positions. However, the need for home-grown talent is \nbecoming more and more apparent.\n  First, international competition for this foreign brain power has \nbecome intense. As the National Science Board notes, ``Governments \nthroughout the world recognize that a high-skill S workforce is \nessential for economic strength. Countries beyond the United States \nhave been taking action to . . . attract foreign students and workers, \nand raise the attractiveness to their own citizenry of staying home or \nreturning from abroad to serve growing national economies and research \nenterprises.'' This increased global competition for science and \nengineering workers ``comes at a time when demand for their skills is \nprojected to rise significantly--both in the United States and \nthroughout the global economy.''\n  Without action on our part, though, America will lose out in the \ncompetition for these technically talented workers. According to the \nNational Science Board, by 2010, if current trends continue, \nsignificantly less than 10 percent of all physical scientists and \nengineers in the world will be working in America.\n  Increased global competition is not the only reason, though, that we \nhave to promote a home-grown S workforce in America. In the post 9/11 \nera, it is more important than ever from a security perspective to have \nAmerican citizens performing certain tasks.\n  The National Science Board put it best when they said, ``The ready \navailability of outstanding science and engineering talent from other \ncountries is no longer assured, as international competition for the \nscience and engineering workforce grows. Threats to world peace and \ndomestic security create additional constraints on employment of \nforeign nationals in the United States.''\n  I think the message is clear: Our S workforce is in crisis. If we \ndo not act to encourage more American citizens to enter the high \nshortage areas in engineering, math, and science, then America may lose \nits historical advantage as the world's innovator.\n  The consequences of this trend are also significant from a national \nsecurity perspective. The defense-related research that goes into \ngiving our men and women in the Armed Forces the best technology and \nequipment requires the special skills of engineers, scientists and \ncomputer scientists. Our military has always recognized these facts, \nand historically has been a tremendous supporter of science and \nengineering on a broad scale, from applied research to the most pure \nand esoteric of pursuits.\n  Let me quote some numbers which make clear what a huge investment our \ndefense community makes in science and engineering: According to the \nNational Science Foundation, the Defense Department is by far the \nlargest single supporter of science and technology in the Federal \nGovernment, accounting for about half of the total research dollars \nspent; the proportion of defense funding for University research in \ncritical disciplines is very significant. For example, 90 percent of \nbasic astronautical research is defense-funded. And, as you all must \nrealize, University research is vastly important for training \nsubsequent generations of high-quality researchers; and in terms of \ntechnical manpower, defense-related scientists and engineers make up \nnearly 46 percent of the total Federal workforce. And, this includes 28 \npercent of all physical scientists, 48 percent of computer scientists \nand mathematicians, and 67 percent of all engineers.\n  For well over a century these investments have given us advantages in \ntechnological fields that have provided our men and women of our Armed \nForces the most advanced and powerful tools in existence, from \nsubmarines and airplanes to unmanned vehicles and the Internet. These \ntechnologies not only give our military an overwhelming advantage on \nthe battlefield, they also save many lives.\n  Yet, alarmingly, it is in the precise disciplines that produce these \ntechnologies and equipment where we see some of the greatest potential \nshortages in our science and engineering workforce. Numerous studies \nshow that the number of domestic students in these critical fields has \nbeen falling steadily for years. And, without major investments to \nencourage more Americans to enter these critical fields, America is \ngoing to lose its status as the world's innovator and be placed in the \nprecarious situation of having to rely on foreign countries to sell us \nthe best equipment and the best technology for our troops. That is why \nit is paramount for America, from within, to produce the home-grown \ntechnical talent it needs.\n  The consequences of inaction are enormous. And, while America's \nchallenge is substantial, it is not insurmountable. Fortunately, we \nalready have an existing Federal program up and running that, if \nmodified, can help.\n  Under current law, the $13.1 billion a year Pell Grant program awards \nrecipients grants regardless of the course of study that the recipient \nchooses to pursue. So, under current law, 2 people\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\nfrom the same financial background are eligible for the same grant even \nthough one chooses to major in the liberal arts while the other majors \nin engineering or science.\n  While I believe studying the liberal arts is an important component \nto having an enlightened citizenry, I also believe that given the \nunique challenges we are facing in this country, it is appropriate for \nus to add an incentive to the Pell Grant program to encourage \nindividuals to pursue courses of study where graduates are needed to \nmeet our national security, homeland security, and economic security \nneeds.\n  That is why today I am introducing this legislation. The legislation \nis simple. It provides that at least every 2 years, our Secretary of \nEducation, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary \nof Homeland Security, and others, should provide a list of courses of \nstudy where America needs home-grown talent to meet our national, \nhomeland, and economic security needs. Those students who pursue \ncourses of study in these programs will be rewarded through a doubling \nof their Pell Grant to help them with the costs associated with \nobtaining their education.\n  We in the Congress have an obligation when expending taxpayer money, \nto do so in a manner that meets our Nation's needs. Our Nation \ndesperately needs more highly trained domestic workers. That is an \nindisputable fact. And, in the Pell Grant program, we have over $13 \nbillion that is readily available to help meet this demand.\n  In closing, our world is vastly different today than it was when the \nPell Grant program was created in 1972. My legislation is a commonsense \nmodification of the Pell Grant program that will help America meet its \nnew challenges. I hope my colleagues will join me in this endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleague from the State of Virginia, Senator Warner, in introducing \nThe 21st Century Pell Grant Plus Act. This bill is intended to provide \nan immediate and direct response to the urgent need in this country to \nencourage greater numbers of graduates in the critical areas of math \nand science and foreign language. Specifically, our bill would provide \nfinancial incentives to American college students, via enhanced Pell \ngrants, to pursue degrees in science, engineering, mathematics, and key \nforeign languages. These subject areas are critical for meeting our \nnation's economic and homeland security needs.\n  Although the number of jobs requiring scientific and technical skills \nis projected to grow over the next decade, the last ten years have \nwitnessed a significant decline in the number of relevant baccalaureate \ndegrees awarded by U.S. institutions of higher education. Recent \nreports have highlighted the decline in science and engineering \ngraduates in our country, which has threatened the United States' \nworldwide dominance in science and innovation. Foreign advances in \nbasic science now often exceed those in the United States. To \nexacerbate the matter, future demographics signal that many of the \npresently employed engineers and scientists who entered the workforce \nin the 1960s and 1970s will retire during the next decade. \nUnfortunately, their children are not following them into the same \nprofessions.\n  Many of our competitors in the world market are not experiencing \nthese same problems. The universities in some European and Asian \ncountries are attracting science and engineering majors at much higher \nrates than the universities in the United States. For example, China \ngraduated three times as many engineering graduates than the United \nStates did in 1999. In 2000, there were 24 nations who awarded a higher \npercentage of science and engineering degrees than the United States \ndid. In that same year, the percentage of students earning science \ndegrees in Finland was 2.5 times higher than in the United States. \nGraduate education trends are no better. According to National Science \nFoundation indicators,\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nbetween 1986 and 1999, China produced science and engineering \ndoctorates at an average annual growth rate of 36.5 percent. By \ncomparison, the United States had an average annual growth rate of just \n2.2 percent during the same period. We must also keep in mind that of \nall the science and engineering doctoral degrees earned in the United \nStates in 1999, 48.6 percent of them were earned by non-U.S. citizens.\n  I noted in my recent offshore outsourcing study, now posted on my \nwebsite, that as global competition for technical talent intensifies, \nour economic security depends on producing U.S.-born science and \nengineering graduates. Not being able to fill the jobs in this country \nwith U.S. citizens is also a threat to our national security. Thus, it \nis imperative that our higher education system, which is the best in \nthe world, train more individuals in science and technology.\n  Our bill provides a simple and efficient solution to this problem. \nUnder our proposal, any student who qualifies for a Pell Grant and \nmajors in science, engineering, mathematics, or certain foreign \nlanguages would be eligible to receive a grant that is double the size \nof the original award. Every two years the Secretary of Education, in \nconsultation with the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, and \nthe director of the National Science Foundation will develop a list of \nengineering, mathematics, science, and foreign language majors, \ndegrees, certificates, or programs that if pursued by a student, may \nenable that student to receive the increased Federal Pell Grant amount.\n  Science, engineering, technology, and innovation are key to our \neconomic growth, prosperity, and security. The 21st Century Federal \nPell Grant Plus Act aims to strengthen our technical workforce, and \nthus our economic and homeland security, by encouraging more of our \ncollege students to study science, engineering, mathematics, and \nforeign languages. I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this \nmeasure.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a man \nwho some have appropriately described as a true gentleman as well as an \noutstanding leader in engineering and science. Dr. John H. Hopps died \non May 14, 2004 at 65 years of age. He has advised my office on our \nnation's science talent issues for the past three years, and I want to \ndedicate today's new bill to him. At the time of his death, he was \nserving as Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Research and National \nLaboratories, and Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering. \nHe accepted this dual position out of a strong sense of national \nservice after the September 11 attack. The science community has lost a \nmember who has served as an inspiration to many, including members of \nmy staff, for his commitment to his profession and his unique \napproaches to developing our technical workforce. Among his many \nachievements, including many in University education and at NSF, I \nwould note that Dr. Hopps was the author of numerous scholarly and \nscientific papers, and was recognized as one of the top African \nAmericans in Technology in 2004. I might also mention that in addition \nto his intellectual prowess, he was passionate about athletics--a \nwinning combination. As we introduce this bill to highlight the \nimportance of this profession, I thought it was appropriate to \nrecognize Dr. Hopps, and thank my colleagues for this opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein)\n  S. 2464. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to the sale of prescription drugs through the Internet; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 2465. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect \nto the seizure of shipments of controlled substances, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce two bills that expand \nFederal authority to prevent controlled substances from flooding into \nthe U.S., authorizing states to shut down illegitimate virtual \npharmacies, and bar Internet drug stores from dispensing drugs to \ncustomers referred to on-line doctors for a prescription.\n  Americans are increasingly turning to the Internet for access to \naffordable drugs. In 2003, consumer spending on drugs procured over the \nInternet exceeded $3.2 billion. Unfortunately, rogue Internet sites \nhave proliferated and rake in millions of dollars by selling unproven, \ncounterfeit, defective or otherwise inappropriate medications to \nunsuspecting consumers. Even more dangerously, these sites are \nprofiting by selling addictive and potentially deadly controlled \nsubstances to consumers without a prescription or any physician \noversight. This must stop before more individuals die or become \naddicted to easily obtainable narcotic drugs.\n  The first bill I am introducing was developed in close consultation \nwith Senator Feinstein, who is an original cosponsor. In appreciation \nfor her role in helping write this legislation it is named after a \nyoung man from her state who died from an overdose of drugs purchased \nover the Internet.\n  17-year old Ryan Haight of La Mesa, CA was an honor roll student, and \navid baseball card collector about to enter college. As his mom says, \n``he was a good kid.'' But in May of 2000 Ryan started hanging out with \na different crowd of friends. He joined an online chat forum, which \nadvocates the safe use of drugs, and he began buying prescription drugs \nfrom the Internet.\n  He used the family computer late at night and a debit card his \nparents gave him to buy baseball cards on Ebay. You might ask, how did \na healthy 17-year old obtain prescriptions for painkillers without a \nmedical exam. He got them from Dr. Robert Ogle an ``online'' physician \nbased out of Texas. With the prescriptions from Dr. Ogle, Ryan was able \nto order hydrocodone, morphine, Valium and Oxazepam and have them \nshipped via US mail right to his front door.\n  In February 2001, Ryan overdosed on a combination of these \nprescription drugs. His mother found him dead on his bedroom floor.\n  The Ryan Haight Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act counters \nthe growing sale of prescription drugs over the Internet without a \nvalid prescription by 1. providing new disclosure standards for \nInternet pharmacies; 2. barring Internet sites from selling or \ndispensing prescription drugs to consumers who are provided a \nprescription solely on the basis of an online questionnaire; and 3. \nallowing State Attorneys General to go to Federal court to shut down \nrogue sites.\n  The bill is geared to counter domestic Internet pharmacies that sell \ndrugs without a valid prescription, not international pharmacies that \nsell drugs at a low cost to individuals who have a valid prescription \nfrom their U.S. doctors.\n  Under current law, purchasing drugs online without a valid \nprescription can be simple: a consumer just types the name of the drug \ninto a search engine, quickly identifies a site selling the medication, \nfills in a brief questionnaire, and then clicks to purchase. The risks \nof self-medicating, however, can include potential adverse reactions \nfrom inappropriately prescribed medications, dangerous drug \ninteractions, use of counterfeit or tainted products, and addiction to \nhabit-forming substances. Several of these illegitimate sites fail to \nprovide information about contraindications, potential adverse effects, \nand efficacy.\n  Regulating these Internet pharmacies is difficult for Federal and \nState authorities. State medical and pharmacy boards have expressed the \nconcern that they do not have adequate enforcement tools to regulate \npractice over the Internet. It can be virtually impossible for States \nto identify, investigate, and prosecute these illegal pharmacies \nbecause the consumer, prescriber, and seller of a drug may be located \nin different States.\n  The Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act amends the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address this problem in three steps. \nFirst, it requires Internet pharmacy websites to display information \nidentifying the business, pharmacist, and physician associated with the \nwebsite.\n  Second, the bill bars the selling or dispensing of a prescription \ndrug via the Internet when the website has referred the customer to a \ndoctor who then writes a prescription without ever seeing the patient.\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\n  Third, the bill provides States with new enforcement authority \nmodeled on the Federal Telemarketing Sales Act that will allow a state \nattorney general to shut down a rogue site across the country, rather \nthan only bar sales to consumers of his or her state.\n  I am proud to say that the Ryan Haight Internet Pharmacy Consumer \nProtection Act is supported by the Federation of State Medical Boards, \nthe National Community Pharmacists Association, and the American \nPharmacists Association.\n  The second bill I am introducing enables Customs and Border \nProtection to immediately seize and destroy any package containing a \ncontrolled substance that is illegally imported into the U.S. without \nhaving to fill out duplicative forms and other unnecessary \nadministrative paperwork. The Act will allow Customs to focus on \ninterdicting and destroying potentially addictive and deadly controlled \nsubstances. The Act is dedicated to Todd Rode, a young man who died \nafter overdosing on imported drugs.\n  Todd Rode had the heart and soul of a musician. He graduated from \ncollege magna cum laude with a major in psychology and a minor in \nmusic. The faculty named him the outstanding senior in the Psychology \nDepartment. He worked in this field for a number of years, but he \nconstantly fought bouts of depression and anxiety.\n  Unfortunately Todd ordered controlled drugs from a pharmacy and \ndoctor in another country. These drugs included Venlafaxine, \nPropoxyphene, and Codeine. All were controlled substances and all were \nobtained from overseas pharmacies without any safeguards. To obtain \nthese controlled substances all Todd had to do was to fill out an \nonline questionnaire and with the click of a mouse they were shipped \ndirectly to his front door.\n  In October of 1999, Todd's family found him dead in his apartment.\n  A six-month investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations has revealed that tens of thousands of dangerous and \naddictive controlled substances are streaming into the U.S. on a daily \nbasis from overseas Internet pharmacies. For example, on March 15 and \n17, 2004, at JFK airport, home to the largest International Mail Branch \nin the U.S., at least 3,000 boxes from a single vendor in \nthe Netherlands containing hydrocodone and Diazepam (Valium) were \nseized by Customs and Border Protection (Customs).\n\n  In fact, senior Customs inspectors at JFK estimate that 40,000 \nparcels containing drugs are imported on a daily basis. During last \nsummer's FDA/Customs blitz, 28 percent of the drugs tested were \ncontrolled substances. Extrapolating these figures, 11,200 drug parcels \ncontaining controlled substances are imported through JFK daily, 78,400 \nweekly, 313,600 monthly and 3,763,200 annually. top countries of origin \ninclude Brazil, India, Pakistan, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Canada, \nMexico, and Romania.\n  Likewise, as of March 2003, senior Customs officials at the Miami \nInternational Airport indicated that as much as 30,000 packages \ncontaining drugs were being imported on a daily basis. A large \npercentage of these are controlled substances as well. Customs is \nsimply overwhelmed. At Mail facilities across the U.S., Customs \nregularly seizes shipments of oxycodone, hydroquinone, tranquilizers, \nsteroids, codeine laced products, GHB, date rape drug, and morphine.\n  In order to comply with paperwork requirements, Customs is forced to \ndevote investigators solely to opening, counting, and analyzing drug \npackages, filling out duplicative forms, and logging into a computer \nall of the seized controlled substances. It takes Customs at least one \nhour to process a single shipment of a controlled substance. This \nminimizes the availability of inspectors to screen incoming drug \npackages. In fact, currently at JFK, there are 20,000 packages of \nseized controlled substances waiting processing. Customs acknowledges \nthat, because of the sheer volume of product, bureaucratic regulations, \nand lack of manpower, the vast majority of controlled substances that \nare illegally imported are simply missed and allowed into the U.S. \nstream of commerce.\n  The Act to Prevent the Illegal Importation of Controlled Substances \nis a simple bill to address this burgeoning and potentially lethal \nproblem.\n  I am confident that, if enacted as stand-alone measures, each of \nthese bills will make on-line drug purchasing safer. However, I am \nworking with Senator Gregg to ensure these safety features are included \nin his comprehensive reimportation bill and urge my colleagues to help \nmake sure that this important piece of legislation becomes law this \nyear.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague \nSenator Coleman to introduce the Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection \nAct also called the ``Ryan Haight Act'', a bill which is vital to \nprotect the safety of Americans who choose to purchase their \nprescription drugs legally over the Internet.\n  This legislation is necessary because of a growing problem of illegal \nprescription drug diversion and abuse of prescription drugs. Coupled \nwith the ease of access to the Internet, it has led to an environment \nwhere illegitimate pharmacy websites can bypass traditional regulations \nand established safeguards for the sale of prescription drugs. Internet \nwebsites that allow consumers to obtain prescription drugs without the \nexistence of a bona fide physician-patient relationship pose an \nimmediate threat to public health and safety.\n  To address this problem, the Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection \nAct makes several critical steps to ensure safety and to assist \nregulatory authorities in shutting down ``rogue'' Internet pharmacies.\n  First, this bill establishes disclosure standards for Internet \npharmacies.\n  Second, this bill prohibits the dispensing or sale of a prescription \ndrug based solely on communications via the Internet such as the \ncompletion of an online medical questionnaire.\n  Third, it allows a State Attorney General to bring a civil action in \na federal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operation and to enforce \ncompliance with the provisions of this law.\n  Under this bill, for a domestic website to sell prescription drugs \nlegally, the website would have to display identifying information such \nas the names, addresses, and medical licensing information for \npharmacists and physicians associated with the website.\n  In addition, if a person wants to use the Internet to purchase their \nprescription drugs he or she will not be prohibited from doing so under \nthis bill but, in order to do so, must already have a prescription for \nthe drug that is valid in the United States prior to making the \nInternet purchase.\n  Reliance on the Internet for public health purposes and the expansion \nof telemedicine, particularly in rural areas, make it essential that \nthere be at the very least a minimum standard for what qualifies as an \nacceptable medical relationship between patients and their physicians.\n  According to the American Medical Association, a health care \npractitioner who offers a prescription for a patient he or she has \nnever seen before, based solely on an online questionnaire, generally \ndoes not meet the appropriate medical standard of care.\n  Let me illustrate the situation facing our country today. If a \nphysician's office prescribed and dispensed prescription drugs the same \nway Internet pharmacies currently can and do, it would look something \nlike this: A physician opens a physical office, asks a patient to fill \nout a medical history questionnaire in the lobby and give his or her \ncredit card information to the office manager. There is no nurse, and \ntherefore no one to take the patients' height, weight, blood pressure, \nverify his or her medical history, and so forth and no one to answer \nthe patient's questions regarding their health.\n  The questionnaire is then slipped through a hole in the window; the \noffice manager takes it to the physician, or person acting as the \nphysician, who then writes the prescription and hands it to the \npharmacist, or person acting as the pharmacist, in the next room. Once \nthe patient signs his credit card, he is on his way out the door, drugs \nin hand.\n  No examination is performed, no questions asked, and no verification \nor clarification of the answers provided on the medical history \nquestionnaire.\n  This illustration is not an exaggeration. It occurs every day all \nacross the United States. The National Association of Boards of \nPharmacy estimates\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\nthat there are around 500 identifiable rogue pharmacy websites \noperating on the Internet.\n  According to the Federation of State Medical Boards, approximately 29 \nstates and the District of Columbia either have laws or medical board \ninitiatives addressing Internet medical practice. Of the other 21 \nStates, 13 have medical or osteopathic medical boards that have taken \ndisciplinary action against a physician for prescribing medication \nonline.\n\n  Many States have already enacted laws defining acceptable practices \nfor qualifying medical relationships between doctors and patients and \nthis bill would not affect any existing State laws.\n  For example, California law was changed in 2000 to say:\n\n       No person or entity may prescribe, dispense, or furnish, or \n     cause to be prescribed, dispensed, or furnished dangerous \n     drugs or dangerous devices [defined as any drug or device \n     unsafe for self-use] on the Internet for delivery to any \n     person in this state, without a good faith prior examination \n     and medical indication . . .\n\n  I believe California's law is a perfect example of why this \nlegislation is needed. The law only applies to persons living in \nCalifornia. As we all know, however, the Internet is not bound by State \nor even country borders.\n  This legislation makes a critical step forward by providing \nadditional authority for State Attorneys General to file an injunction \nin Federal court to shut down an Internet site operating in another \nState that violates the provisions in the bill.\n  Under current law, in order to close down an Internet website selling \nprescription drugs prosecutors must take enforcement actions in every \nState where the Internet pharmacy operates, requiring a tremendous \namount of resources in an environment where the location of the website \nis difficult, if not impossible, to determine or keep track of.\n  This bill will allow a State Attorney General to bring a civil action \nin a Federal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operation and to \nenforce compliance with the provisions of the law in every jurisdiction \nwhere the pharmacy is operating.\n  While this legislation pertains to domestic Internet pharmacies, the \npractice of international pharmacies selling low-cost drugs to U.S. \nconsumers who have valid prescriptions from their doctors deserves to \nbe discussed and debated on the Senate floor. It is my hope that the \nSenate will act this year on prescription drug importation legislation.\n  In closing, I want to share with you the story of Ryan T. Haight of \nLa Mesa, CA in whose memory this bill is named.\n  Ryan was an 18-year old honor student from La Mesa, CA, when he died \nin his home on February 12, 2001. His parents found a bottle of Vicodin \nin his room with a label from an out-of-state pharmacy.\n  It turns out that Ryan had been ordering addictive drugs online and \npaying with a debit card his parents gave him to buy baseball cards on \neBay.\n  Without a physical exam or his parents' consent, Ryan had been \nobtaining controlled substances, some from an Internet site in \nOklahoma. It only took a few months before Ryan's life was ended by an \noverdose on a cocktail of painkillers.\n  Ryan's story and others like it force us to ask why anyone in the \nU.S. would be able to access such highly addictive and dangerous drugs \nover the Internet with such ease?\n  Why was there no physician or pharmacist on the other end of this \nteenager's computer verifying his age, his medical history and that \nthere was a valid prescription?\n  That is why I support this legislation. It makes sensible \nrequirements of Internet pharmacy websites that will not impact access \nto convenient, oftentimes cost-saving drugs.\n   With simple disclosure requirements for Internet sites such as \nnames, addresses and medical or pharmacy licensing information, \npatients will be better off and state medical and pharmacy boards can \nensure that pharmacists and doctors are properly licensed.\n  Lastly, this bill will give State Attorneys General the authority \nthey need to shut down rogue Internet pharmacies operating in other \nStates. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \n        Enzi, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, \n        Mr. Talent, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 2466. A bill to ensure that women seeking an abortion are fully \ninformed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nbipartisan Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, and I am joined by 22 \noriginal cosponsors.\n  Unborn children can experience pain, and they can certainly respond \nto touch from outside the womb. Any woman who has been blessed with \ncarrying a baby in the second trimester can tell you this.\n  I remember my own children kicking and squirming inside of my wife's \nwomb. And my wife certainly remembers feeling their kicks. That unborn \nchild is very much alive. All along, women have been able to feel the \nchild inside of them, but now, science is telling us what the child \ninside of his or her mother can feel.\n  Many among us are unaware of the scientific, medical fact that unborn \nchildren can feel, but it is true. Not only can they feel, but their \nability to experience pain is heightened. The highest density of pain \nreceptors per square inch of skin in human development occurs in utero \nfrom 20 to 30 weeks gestation.\n  An expert report on fetal development, prepared for the Partial Birth \nAbortion Ban trials, notes that while unborn children are obviously \nincapable of verbal expressions, we know that they can experience pain \nbased upon anatomical, functional, physiological and behavioral \nindicators that are correlated with pain in children and adults.\n  Unborn children can experience pain. This is why unborn children are \noften administered anesthesia during in utero surgeries.\n  Think about the pain that unborn children can experience, and then \nthink about the more gruesome abortion procedures. Of course, we have \nheard about Partial Birth Abortion, but also consider the D abortion. \nDuring this procedure, commonly performed after 20-weeks--when there is \nmedical evidence that the child can experience severe pain--the child \nis torn apart limb from limb. Think about how that must feel to a young \nhuman.\n  We would never allow a dog to be treated this way. Yet, the creature \nwe are talking about is a young, unborn child.\n  Fortunately, the issue of pain experienced by unborn children has \nbeen covered by the news media during the ongoing Partial Birth \nAbortion Ban trials. Take for instance an April 7, 2004 Associated \nPress news article covering the trials. And I quote: ``A type of \nabortion banned under a new federal law would cause `severe and \nexcruciating' pain to 20-week-old fetuses, a medical expert testified \nyesterday . . . `I believe the fetus is conscious,' said Dr. Kanwaljeet \n`Sonny' Anand, a pediatrician at the University of Arkansas for Medical \nSciences . . . said yesterday that fetuses show increased heart rate, \nblood flow, and hormone levels in response to pain. `The physiological \nresponses have been very clearly studied,' he said. `The fetus cannot \ntalk . . . so this is the best evidence we can get.''\n  Today I introduce a bill that would require those who perform \nabortions on unborn children 20 weeks after fertilization to inform the \nwoman seeking an abortion of the medical evidence that the unborn child \nfeels pain: (a.) Through a verbal statement given by the abortion \nprovider, and also (b.) by providing a brochure--developed by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services--that goes into more detail \nthan the verbal statement on the medical evidence of pain experienced \nby an unborn child 20 weeks after fertilization.\n  The bill would also ensure that the woman, if she chooses to continue \nwith\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nthe abortion procedure after being given the medical information, has \nthe option of choosing anesthesia for the child, so that the unborn \nchild's pain is less severe.\n  Women should not be kept in the dark; women have the right to know \nwhat their unborn child experiences during an abortion. After being \npresented with the medical and scientific information on the \ndevelopment of the unborn child 20 weeks after fertilization, the woman \nis more aware of the pain experienced by the child during an abortion \nprocedure, and able--at the very least--to make an informed decision. \nIt is simply not fair to keep women in the dark.\n  Unborn children do not have a voice, but they are young members of \nthe human family. It is time to look at the unborn child, and recognize \nthat it is really a young human, who can feel pain and should be \ntreated with care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 2468. A bill to reform the postal laws of the United States; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Carper, to introduce the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act of 2004, a bill designed to help the 225-year-old \nPostal Service meet the challenges of the 21st Century. This \nlegislation represents the culmination of a process that began in the \nsummer of 2002 when I introduced a bill to establish a Presidential \nCommission charged with examining the problems the Postal Service \nfaces, and developing specific recommendations and legislative \nproposals that Congress and the Postal Service could implement.\n  It has long been acknowledged that the financial and operational \nproblems confronting the Postal Service are serious. At present, the \nPostal Service has more than $90 billion in unfunded liabilities and \nobligations, which include $6.5 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury, \nnearly $7 billion for Workers' Compensation claims, $5 billion for \nretirement costs, and as much as $45 billion to cover retiree health \ncare costs. The General Accounting Office's Comptroller General, David \nWalker, has pointed to the urgent need for ``fundamental reforms to \nminimize the risk of a significant taxpayer bailout or dramatic postal \nrate increases.'' The Postal Service has been on GAO's ``High-Risk'' \nList since April of 2001. The Postal Service is at risk of a ``death \nspiral'' of decreasing volume and increasing rates that lead to further \ndecreases in volume.\n  In December of 2003, President Bush announced the creation of a \nbipartisan commission charged with identifying the operational, \nstructural, and financial challenges facing the U.S. Postal Service. \nThe President charged this commission with examining all significant \naspects of the Postal Service with the goal of recommending legislative \nand administrative reforms to ensure its long-term viability.\n  The President's Commission conducted seven public hearings across the \ncountry at which they heard from numerous witnesses. On July 31, 2003, \nthe Commission released its final report, making 35 legislative and \nadministrative recommendations for the reform of the Postal Service.\n  As I read through the Commission's report, I was struck by what I \nconsidered the Commission's wake up call to Congress: its statement \nthat ``an incremental approach to Postal Service reform will yield too \nlittle, too late given the enterprise's bleak fiscal outlook, the depth \nof current debt and unfunded obligations, the downward trend in First-\nClass mail volumes and the limited potential of its legacy postal \nnetwork that was built for a bygone era.'' That is a very strong \nstatement, and one that challenged both the Postal Service and Congress \nto embrace far-reaching reforms.\n  To the relief of many, including myself, the Commission did not \nrecommend privatization of the Postal Service. Instead, the Commission \nsought to find a way for the Postal Service to do, as Co-Chair Jim \nJohnson described to me, ``an overwhelmingly better job under the same \ngeneral structure.''\n  The Postal Service plays a vital role in our economy. The Service \nitself employs more than 750,000 career employees. Less well known is \nthe fact that it is also the linchpin of a $900-billion mailing \nindustry that employs 9 million Americans in fields as diverse as \ndirect mailing, printing, catalog production, paper manufacturing, and \nfinancial services. The health of the Postal Service is essential to \nthe vitality of thousands of companies and the millions that they \nemploy.\n  One of the greatest challenges for the Postal Service is the decrease \nin mail volume as business communications, bills and payments move more \nand more to the Internet. The Postal Service has experienced declining \nvolumes of First-Class mail for the past four years. This is highly \nsignificant, given that First-Class mail accounts for 48 percent of \ntotal mail volume, and the revenue it generates pays for more than two-\nthirds of the Postal Service's institutional costs.\n  The Postal Service also faces the difficult task of trying to cut \ncosts from its nationwide infrastructure and transportation network. \nThese costs are difficult to cut. Even though volumes may be \ndecreasing, carriers must still deliver six days a week to more than \n139 million addresses.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I held a series \nof eight hearings, including a joint hearing with the House, during \nwhich we reviewed the recommendations of the President's Commission. \nThe bill Senator Carper and I introduce today is the culmination of \neverything the Committee learned from dozens of witnesses over the past \neight months.\n  First and foremost, the Collins-Carper bill preserves the basic \nfeatures of universal service-affordable rates, frequent delivery, and \nconvenient community access to retail postal services. As a Senator \nrepresenting a large, rural State, I want to ensure that my \nconstituents living in the northern woods, or on the islands, or in our \nmany rural small towns have the same access to postal services as the \npeople of our cities. If the Postal Service were no longer to provide \nuniversal service and deliver mail to every customer, the affordable \ncommunication link upon which many Americans rely would be jeopardized. \nMost commercial enterprises would find it uneconomical, if not \nimpossible, to deliver mail and packages to rural Americans at rates \ncharged by the Postal Service.\n  The Collins-Carper bill allows the Postal Service to maintain its \ncurrent mail monopoly, and retain its sole access to customer \nmailboxes. It grants the Postal Service Board of Governors the \nauthority to set rates for competitive products like Express Mail and \nParcel Post, as long as these prices do not result in cross subsidy \nfrom market-dominant products. As a safeguard, our bill establishes a \n30 day prior review period during which the proposed rate changes shall \nbe reviewed by the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n  It replaces the current lengthy and litigious rate-setting process \nwith a rate cap-based structure for market-dominant products such as \nFirst-Class Mail, periodicals and library mail. This would allow the \nPostal Service to react more quickly to changes in the mailing \nindustry. The rate caps would be linked to an inflation indicator \nselected by the Postal Regulatory Commission. The goal would be to make \nrate increases more predictable and less frequent and to provide \nincentives for the Postal Service to operate efficiently. Price changes \nfor market-dominant products would be subject to a 45-day prior review \nperiod by the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n\n  Our bill would introduce new safeguards against unfair competition by \nthe Postal Service in competitive markets. Subsidization of competitive \nproducts by market-dominant products would be expressly forbidden, and \nan equitable allocation of institutional costs to competitive products \nwould be required.\n  The President's Commission recommended that the regulator be granted \nthe authority to make changes to the Postal Service's universal service \nobligation and monopoly. The vast majority of the postal community, \nhowever, shared my belief that these are important policy \ndeterminations that should be retained by Congress. The\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\nCollins-Carper bill keeps those public policy decisions in \ncongressional hands.\n  The existing Postal Rate Commission would be transformed into the \nPostal Regulatory Commission with greatly enhanced authority. Under \ncurrent law, the Rate Commission has very narrow authority. We wanted \nto ensure that the Postal Service management has both greater latitude \nand stronger oversight. Among other things, the Postal Regulatory \nCommission will have the authority to regulate rates for non-\ncompetitive products and services; ensure financial transparency; \nestablish limits on the accumulation of retained earnings by the Postal \nService; obtain information from the Postal Service, if need be, \nthrough the use of new subpoena power; and review and act on complaints \nfiled by those who believe the Postal Service has exceeded its \nauthority. Members of the Postal Regulatory Board will be selected \nsolely on the basis of their demonstrated experience and professional \nstanding. Senate confirmation of all Board Members will be required.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee dedicated two hearings to the \nexamination of the Commission's workforce-related recommendations. The \nPostal Service is a highly labor intensive organization, using $3 out \nof every $4 to pay the wages and benefits of its employees. Their \nworkforce is comprised of more than 700,000 dedicated letter carriers, \nclerks, mail handlers, postmasters, and others, who place great value \non their right to collectively bargain. Our bill reaffirms that right. \nThis bill only makes changes to the bargaining process that have been \nagreed to by both the Postal Service and the four major unions. We \nreplace the rarely used fact-finding process with mediation, and \nshorten statutory deadlines for certain phases of the bargaining \nprocess.\n  Additionally, the Collins-Carper bill corrects what I believe to be \nan anomaly in the Federal workers' compensation law that results in \nhigh costs for the Postal Service. Under the Federal Employees \nCompensation Act (FECA), Federal employees with dependents are eligible \nfor 75 percent of their take-home pay, tax free, plus cost of living \nallowances. In addition, there is no maximum dollar cap on FECA \npayments. As a result, employees often opt not to retire, staying on \nthe more generous workers' compensation program permanently.\n  According to a March 2003 audit issued by the Postal Service's Office \nof Inspector General, the Postal Service's workers' compensation rolls \ninclude 81 cases that originated 40 to 50 years ago, with the oldest \nrecipient being 102 years old. The IG's office found 778 cases that \noriginated 30 to 40 years ago; and 1,189 cases that originated 20 to 29 \nyears ago.\n  The Collins-Carper bill works to protect the financial resources of \nthe Postal Service by converting workers' compensation benefits for \ntotal or partial disability to a retirement annuity when the affected \nemployee reaches 65 years of age. This change would reflect the fact \nthat disabled postal employees would likely retire at some point were \nthey not receiving workers' compensation. I would like to note that the \naverage postal employee retires far earlier than age 65, so this is \nstill a generous program. It is important to point out that the Postal \nService has reduced their workplace injury rate by twenty-eight percent \nover the past three years.\n  The Collins--Carper bill also puts into place a three-day waiting \nperiod before an employee is eligible to receive 45 days of \ncontinuation of pay. This is consistent with every state's workers' \ncompensation program that requires a three- to seven-day waiting period \nbefore benefits are paid.\n  Our bill has reached an important compromise on the issue of \nworkshare discounts. Some have raised concerns that the Postal Service \nhas set rates so that mailers get a discount greater than the cost \navoided by the Postal Service. While this may have occurred in a \nhandful of instances, those mailers are still covering their \nattributable costs, as well as making a healthy contribution to \noverhead. The language in our bill sets a policy that the Postal \nService shall not create new discounts greater than the cost avoided by \nthe Postal Service. The only exception is in those cases where the \nPostal Regulatory Commission believes those rates are necessary.\n  The bill has also, for the first time, explicitly created the \nauthority for the Postal Service to enter into negotiated service \nagreements with individual customers. This will allow the Postal \nService to create agreements with customers to increase its revenue. I \nwould point out that these agreements must cover all attributable \ncosts, and will likely result in greater contribution to overhead. In \naddition, our bill requires that other similarly situated mailers will \nbe able to enter into such agreements with the Postal Service.\n  Finally, our bill would repeal a provision of Public Law 108-18 which \nrequires that money owed to the Postal Service due to an overpayment \ninto the Civil Service Retirement System Fund be held in an escrow \naccount. Repealing this provision would essentially ``free up'' $78 \nbillion over a period of 60 years. These savings would be used to not \nonly pay off debt to the U.S. Treasury and to fund health care \nliabilities, but to mitigate rate increases as well. In fact, failure \nto release these escrow funds would mean, for mailers, a double-digit \nrate increase in 2006--an expense most American businesses and many \nconsumers are ill-equipped to afford.\n  The bill would also return to the Department of Treasury the \nresponsibility for funding CSRS pension benefits relating to the \nmilitary service of postal retirees. No other agency is required to \nmake this payment. Ratepayers should not be held responsible for this \n$27 billion obligation.\n  The Postal Service has reached a critical juncture. If we are to save \nand strengthen this vital service upon which so many Americans rely for \ncommunication and their livelihoods, the time to act is now.\n  Our bill has the strong endorsements of the National Rural Letter \nCarriers Association, the National Association of Letter Carriers, the \nNational Association of Postmasters of the United States, and the \nCoalition for a 21st Century Postal Service--which represents thousands \nof the major mailers, employee groups, small businesses, and other \nusers of the mail. I am also very pleased to add Senators Ted Stevens, \nGeorge Voinovich and John Sununu as originated cosponsors of this bill.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in the Senate, \nand House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Tom Davis, \nwho just last week passed a postal reform bill out of his committee by \na vote of 40-0.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, along with a letter sent to me from David Walker, Comptroller \nGeneral of the General Accounting Office, addressing the need for \ncomprehensive postal reform.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Susan M. Collins,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States \n         Senate.\n\n     Need for Comprehensive Postal Reform\n       Dear Chairman Collins: This letter responds to your request \n     for our views on the need for postal reform and is based upon \n     our prior testimonies related to this issue. In summary, we \n     believe that comprehensive postal reform is urgently needed. \n     The ability of the Service to remain financially viable is at \n     risk because its current business model--which relies on mail \n     volume growth to cover the costs of its expanding delivery \n     network--is not well aligned with 21st century realities. \n     Since we placed the Postal Service's transformation efforts \n     and financial outlook on our High-Risk List in April 2001, I \n     have testified on several occasions about the governance, \n     financial, operational, and human capital challenges that \n     threaten the Service's ability to carry out its mission. If \n     not effectively addressed in a timely manner, these \n     challenges serve to threaten the Service's ability to remain \n     self-supporting while providing affordable, high-quality and \n     universal postal services to all Americans.\n       The following key trends serve to reinforce our view that \n     enactment of postal reform legislation is needed:\n       Declining mail volume: Total mail volume declined in fiscal \n     year 2003 for the third year in a row--a historical first for \n     the Service, which has depended on rising mail volume to help \n     cover rising costs and mitigate rate increases. First-Class \n     Mail volume declined by a record 3.2 percent in fiscal year \n     2003 and is projected to decline annually for the foreseeable \n     future. Some of this decline is due to technology advances \n     (e.g. E-mail, digital phones, faxes, and electronic bill \n     payments) that are likely to increase in the future. This \n     trend is particularly significant because First-Class Mail \n     covers more than two-thirds of the Service's institutional \n     costs.\n       Changes in the mail mix: The Service's mail mix is changing \n     with declining volume for high-margin products, such as \n     First-Class Mail, and increasing volume of lower-margin \n     products, such as some types of Standard Mail. These changes \n     reduce revenues available to cover the Service's \n     institutional costs.\n       Increased competition from private delivery companies: \n     Private delivery companies dominate the market for parcels \n     greater than 2 pounds and appear to be making inroads into \n     the market for small parcels. Priority Mail volume fell 13.9 \n     percent in fiscal year 2003 and over the last 3 years has \n     declined nearly 30 percent. Once a highly profitable growth \n     product for the Service, Priority Mail volume is declining as \n     the highly competitive parcel market turns to lower-priced \n     ground shipment alternatives. Express Mail volume is \n     declining for the same reason. In addition, United Parcel \n     Service (UPS) and FedEx have established national retail \n     networks through UPS's acquisition of MailBoxes Etc., now \n     called UPS Stores, and FedEx's recent acquisition of Kinko's.\n       Subpar revenue growth: The Service's revenues are budgeted \n     for zero growth in fiscal year 2004, which would be the first \n     year since postal reorganization that postal revenues have \n     failed to increase. However, as the Service has recognized, \n     even the zero-growth target will be challenging. In the \n     absence of revenue growth generated by increasing volume, the \n     Service must rely more heavily on rate increases to cover \n     rising costs and help finance capital investment needs.\n       Declining capital investment: The Service's capital cash \n     outlays declined from $3.3 billion in fiscal year 2000 to \n     $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2003, which was the lowest level \n     since fiscal year 1986, and far below the level of the late \n     1990s, when the Service spent more than $3 billion annually. \n     Capital cash outlays are budgeted to increase to $2.4 billion \n     in fiscal year 2004, but this level may not be sufficient to \n     enable the Service to fully fund its capital investment \n     needs. In the longer term, it is unclear what the Service's \n     needs will be to maintain and modernize its physical \n     infrastructure, as well as how these needs will be funded.\n       Renewed difficulties in substantially improving postal \n     productivity: The Service's productivity increased by 1.8 \n     percent in fiscal year 2003 but is estimated to increase by \n     only 0.4 percent in fiscal year 2004. In the absence of mail \n     volume growth, substantial productivity increases will be \n     required to help cover cost increases generated by rising \n     wages and benefit costs and to mitigate rate increases.\n       Significant financial liabilities and obligations: Despite \n     the passage of legislation that reduced the Service's pension \n     obligations, the Service has about $88 billion to $98 billion \n     in liabilities and obligations that include $47 billion to \n     $57 billion in unfunded retiree health benefits. Under the \n     current pay-as-you-go system, the Service may have difficulty \n     financing its retiree health benefits obligation in the \n     future if mail volume trends continue to impact revenues \n     while costs in this area continue to rise. The Service has \n     recently proposed two options to Congress, so the Service \n     could prefund this obligation to the extent that it is \n     financially able.\n       Uncertain funding for emergency preparedness: The Service \n     requested $350 million for emergency preparedness for fiscal \n     year 2004, which it did not receive, and $779 million for \n     fiscal year 2005. If the money is not appropriated, funding \n     for this purpose may have to be built into postal rates.\n       Challenges to achieve sufficient cost cutting: The Service \n     achieved additional cost cutting to compensate for below-\n     budget revenues in fiscal year 2003. Despite this progress, \n     in the longer term it is unclear whether continued cost-\n     cutting efforts can offset declines in First-Class Mail \n     volume without impacting the quality of service.\n       Although we have discussed numerous actions that the Postal \n     Service can take within its existing authority to improve its \n     overall efficiency and effectiveness, we do not believe that \n     incremental steps toward postal transformation can resolve \n     the fundamental and systemic issues associated with the \n     Service's current business model. To avoid the risk of a \n     significant taxpayer bailout or dramatic postal rate \n     increases, we believe that Congress should enact \n     comprehensive postal reform legislation that includes the \n     Service's overall statutory framework, resolution of issues \n     regarding the Service's pension and retiree health benefits \n     obligations, and whether there is a continued need for an \n     escrow account.\n       The key areas of the Service's statutory framework that \n     need to be addressed include:\n       Clarifying the Service's mission and role by defining the \n     scope of universal service and the postal monopoly and by \n     clarifying the role of the Service in regard to competition \n     and its regulatory functions.\n       Enhancing governance, transparency, and accountability by \n     delineating public policy, operational, and regulatory \n     responsibilities; by ensuring managerial accountability \n     through a strong, well-qualified corporate-style board that \n     holds its officers responsible and accountable for achieving \n     real results; and by defining appropriate reporting \n     mechanisms to enhance the Service's transparency and \n     accountability for financial and performance results.\n       Improving flexibilities and oversight by balancing \n     increased flexibility for the Service--through streamlining \n     the rate-setting process and allowing a certain amount of \n     retained earnings--with appropriate oversight by a \n     independent regulatory body to protect postal customers \n     against undue discrimination, to restrict cross-subsidies, \n     and to ensure due process. In addition, the Service\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\n     needs additional flexibility to rationalize its \n     infrastructure and reshape its workforce. Any such additional \n     flexibility should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards \n     to prevent abuse along with enhanced transparency and \n     accountability mechanisms.\n       Making needed human capital reforms such as (1) determining \n     the Service's responsibility for pension costs related to \n     military service, funding retiree health benefits, and \n     determining what action to take on the escrow account \n     established in recent pension legislation; (2) deciding \n     whether postal workers' compensation benefits should be on \n     par with those in the private sector; and (3) clarifying pay \n     comparability standards.\n       We believe that Congress now has a rare opportunity to \n     assure the Service's long-term financial viability through \n     comprehensive postal reform legislation that addresses the \n     Service's key structural and systemic deficiencies, its \n     unfunded obligations, including its retiree health benefits \n     obligation, and the escrow requirement. Key legislative and \n     administrative actions in connection with transforming the \n     Postal Service can also serve as positive examples for other \n     key government transformation efforts.\n       As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce \n     the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further \n     distribution until 30 days from the date of this letter. At \n     that time, we will provide copies to interested congressional \n     committees. We will also make copies available to others on \n     request. In addition, the report will be available at no \n     charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.\n       For additional information about this report, please \n     contact Mark L. Goldstein, Director, Physical Infrastructure \n     Issues at (202) 512-2834 or at goldsteinm@gao.gov. Please \n     contact me if I can be of any further assistance to help make \n     comprehensive postal reform a reality.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  David M. Walker,\n                         Comptroller General of the United States.\n\n   Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Collins in \nintroducing the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2004, \nlegislation that makes the reforms necessary for the Postal Service to \nthrive in the 21st Century and to better serve the American people.\n   This bill is based in part on S. 1285, the comprehensive postal \nreform legislation I introduced nearly a year ago. S. 1285 was itself \nbased on ten years of work on postal reform in the House of \nRepresentatives, led by Congressman, John McHugh from New York. It is \nalso inspired by the work of the postal commission formed by President \nBush last year, called the President's Commission on the United States \nPostal Service, which studied all aspects of the Postal Service and \nmade recommendations on how it could be modernized.\n   When I rose to introduce S. 1285 last June, the House Government \nReform Committee had only recently failed to report out the latest \nversion of the McHugh reform bill and the President's Commission was \nonly weeks away from issuing its final recommendations. Along with a \nnumber of other observers, I feared that the McHugh bill's fate might \nhave spelled the end of postal reform for some time. I also feared that \nthe Commission's recommendations would focus on some of the more \nextreme reform proposals floated in the past, such as postal \nprivatization. While the Commission did make a handful of \nrecommendations that I believe go too far, I was pleased to see that \nits work largely mirrored the provisions in S. 1285 and the various \nHouse reform bills we have seen in recent years.\n   I'd like to begin, then, by thanking Congressman McHugh  and his \ncolleagues on the House Government Reform Committee for its visionary \nleadership on postal reform over the years. I'd also like to thank the \nmembers of the President's Commission, especially co-chairs James A. \nJohnson and Harry J. Pearce, for their service. Postal reform is a \ndifficult issue. It is also a vitally important issue for every \nAmerican who depends on the Postal Service every day. Their willingness \nto listen to all sides of the debate and to craft what is, for the most \npart, a set of balanced reform recommendations is admired and \nappreciated. The work they have done has brought to light a number of \nthe key issues facing the Postal Service and has made it possible to \nget a bipartisan postal reform bill signed into law this year.\n   Senator Collins also deserves our thanks and applause for her hard \nwork on this issue. Under her leadership, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held a series of eight excellent hearings on postal reform \nover the past few months. She and I and our staffs have also held \ncountless meetings with the various stakeholders for more than a year \nnow. Everyone with an interest in the Postal Service was given an \nopportunity to have their say, and I think that's reflected in the \nbalanced bill we're introducing today.\n  It's always a pleasure working with Senator Collins. We've worked \ntogether on a number of issues over the years--from welfare reform to \nhomeland security and the future of passenger rail in our country. Her \ndedication to bipartisanship, and simply doing the right thing, is rare \nthese days. It's a honor to be introducing this historic bill with her \ntoday.\n  Let me also express to Senator Lieberman, our Committee's Ranking \nMember, my appreciation for giving me the opportunity as a freshman \nSenator to work so closely on one of the most important issues to come \nbefore Governmental Affairs. The support he and his staff have offered \nus throughout this process has been invaluable.\n  Some of our colleagues may wonder why we need postal reform. They \nprobably receive few complaints about the service their constituents \nget from the Postal Service and its employees. In fact, a survey \nconducted by the President's Commission indicated that the American \npeople like the Postal Service just the way it is. We must keep in \nmind, however, that, despite the fact that the mailing industry, and \nthe economy as a whole, have changed radically over the years, the \nPostal Service has, for the most part, remained unchanged for more than \nthree decades now.\n  In the early 1970s, Senator Stevens and others led the effort in the \nSenate to create the Postal Service out of the failing Post Office \nDepartment. At the time, the Post Office Department received about 20 \npercent of its revenue from taxpayer subsidies. Service was suffering \nand there was little money available to expand.\n  By all accounts, the product of Senator Stevens' labors, the Postal \nReorganization Act signed into law by President Nixon in 1971, has been \na phenomenal success. The Postal Service today receives virtually no \ntaxpayer support and the service its hundreds of thousands of employees \nprovide to every American, every day is second to none. More than \nthirty years after its birth, the Postal Service now delivers to 141 \nmillion addresses each day and is the anchor of a $900 billion per year \nmailing industry.\n  As we celebrate the Postal Service's successes, however, we need to \nbe thinking about what needs to be done to make them just as successful \nin the years to come. When the Postal Service started out in 1971, no \none had access to fax machines, cell phones and pagers. No one imagined \nthat we would ever enjoy conveniences like e-mail and electronic bill \npayment. Most of the mail I receive from my constituents these days \narrives via fax and e-mail instead of hard copy mail, a marked change \nfrom my days in the House and even from my more recent days as Governor \nof Delaware.\n  This continuing electronic diversion of mail, coupled with economic \nrecession and terrorism, has made for some rough going at the Postal \nService in recent years. In 2001, as Postmaster General Potter came \nonboard, the Postal Service was projecting its third consecutive year \nof deficits. They lost $199 million in fiscal year 2000 and $1.68 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001. They were projecting losses of up to $4 \nbillion in fiscal year 2002. Mail volume was falling, revenues were \nbelow projections and the Postal Service was estimating that it needed \nto spend $4 billion on security enhancements in order to prevent a \nrepeat of the tragic anthrax attacks that took several lives. The \nPostal Service was also perilously close to its $15 billion debt \nceiling and had been forced to raise rates three times in less than two \nyears in order to pay for its operations, further eroding mail volume.\n\n  Good things have happened since 2001, though. First, General Potter \nhas led a commendable effort to make the Postal Service more efficient. \nBillions of dollars in costs and have been taken out of the system. \nThousands of positions have been eliminated through attrition. \nSuccessful automation programs have yielded great benefits. Perhaps \nmore dramatically, the Postal Service also learned that an unfunded \npension liability they once believed was an high as $32 billion was \nactually\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n$5 billion. Senator Collins and I responded with legislation, the \nPostal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act, signed into \nlaw by President Bush last year, which cuts the amount the Postal \nService must pay into the Civil Service Retirement System each year by \nnearly $3 billion. This has freed up money for debt reduction and \nprevented the need for another rate increase until at least 2006.\n  Aggressive cost cutting and a lower pension payment, then, have put \noff the emergency that would have come if the Postal Service had \nreached its debt limit. But cost cutting can only go so far and will \nnot solve the Postal Service's long-term challenges. These long-term \nchallenges were laid out in stark detail earlier this year when \nPostmaster General Potter and Postal Board of Governors Chairman David \nFineman testified before the House Government Reform Committee's \nSpecial Panel on Postal Reform. Chairman Fineman pointed out then that \nthe total volume of mail delivered by the Postal Service has declined \nby more than 5 billion pieces since 2000. Over the same period, the \nnumber of homes and businesses the Postal Service delivers to have \nincreased by more than 5 million. First Class mail, the largest \ncontributor to the Postal Service's bottom line, is leading the decline \nin volume. Some of those disappearing First Class letters are being \nreplaced by advertising mail, which earns significantly less. Many \nFirst Class letters have likely been lost for good to the fax machine, \ne-mail and electronic bill pay.\n  Despite electronic diversion, the Postal Service continues to add \nabout 1.7 million new delivery points each year, creating the need for \nthousands of new routes and thousands of new letter carriers to work \nthem. In addition, faster-growing parts of the country will need new or \nexpanded postal facilities in the coming years. As more and more \ncustomers turn to electronic forms of communication, letter carriers \nare bringing fewer and fewer pieces of mail to each address they serve. \nThe rate increases that will be needed to maintain the Postal Service's \ncurrent infrastructure, finance retirement obligations to its current \nemployees, pay for new letter carriers and build facilities in growing \npart of the country will only further erode mail volume.\n  As I've mentioned, the Postal Service has been trying to improve on \nits own. They are making progress, but there is only so much they can \ndo. Even if the economy begins to recover more quickly and the Postal \nService begins to see volume and revenues improve, we will still need \nto make fundamental changes in the way the Postal Service operates in \norder to make them as successful in the 21st Century as they were in \nthe 20th Century.\n\n  This is where the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act comes in. \nFirst, our bill begins the process of developing a modern rate system \nfor pricing Postal Service products. The new system, to be developed by \na strengthened Postal Rate Commission, re-named the Postal Regulatory \nCommission, would allow retained earnings, provide the Postal Service \nsignificantly more flexibility in setting prices and streamline today's \nburdensome ratemaking process. To provide stability, predictability and \nfairness for the Postal Service's customers, rates would remain within \nan inflation-based cap to be developed by the Commission.\n  In addition, the new rate system will allow the Postal Service to \nnegotiate service agreements with individual mailers. The Postal Rate \nCommission in recent years did approve a service agreement the Postal \nService negotiated with Capital One, but the process for considering \nthe agreement took almost a year and the Postal Service's authority to \nenter into such agreements is not clearly spelled out in law. The \nPostal Accountability and Enhancement Act allows the Postal Service to \nenter into agreements if the revenue generated from them covers all \ncosts attributable to the Postal Service and will result in no less \ncontribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service than \nwould have been generated had the agreement not been entered into. No \nagreement would be permitted if it resulted in higher rates for any \nother mailer or prohibited any similarly situated mailer from \nnegotiating a similar agreement.\n  The new rate system also includes some important safeguards meant to \nprohibit worksharing discounts that exceed costs avoided by the Postal \nService. Now, worksharing on the part of mailers has been an important \npart of the productivity improvements at the Postal Service in recent \nyears. Mailers should get credit in the form of a discount for work \nthey do to their mail, such as presorting and barcoding or transporting \nmail deeper into the postal system. The discounts they receive, \nhowever, should have some rational relation to the benefit the Postal \nService gets from the worksharing. The Postal Service should continue \nto be free to use discounts to incent mailers to be more efficient. \nThey also should not be forced to impose large rate increases on \nworkshared mail in order to comply with a strict prohibition on \ndiscounts in excess of costs avoided. Discounts in excess of costs \navoided, however, should be temporary and reasonable. Our worksharing \nlanguage strikes a good balance in that it prohibits the Postal Service \nfrom outsourcing work that could be performed cheaper in house while \nmaintaining pricing flexibility.\n  The second major provision in the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act requires the Postal Regulatory Commission to set strong \nservice standards for the Postal Service's Market Dominant products, a \ncategory made up mostly of those products, like First Class mail, that \nare part of the postal monopoly. The Postal Service currently sets its \nown service standards, which allows them to pursue efforts like the \nelimination of Saturday delivery, a proposal floated three years ago. \nThe new standards set by the Commission will aim to improve service and \nwill be used by the Postal Service to  establish performance goals, \nrationalize its physical infrastructure and streamline its workforce.\n\n   In a rate system featuring rate caps, as any system established \nunder the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act must, I believe it \nis especially important that the Regulatory Commission, not the Postal \nService, be charged with determining the appropriate level of service \npostal customers should receive. This will prevent the Postal Service \nform cutting service as a way to keep rates below the cap. The Postal \nService should be forced to look to productivity enhancements, not \npoorer quality service, to find savings.\n  Third, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act ensures that the \nPostal Service competes fairly. The bill prohibits the Postal Service \nfrom issuing anti-competitive regulations. It also subjects the Postal \nService to state zoning, planning and land use laws, requires them to \npay an assumed Federal income tax on products like packages and Express \nMail that private firms also offer and requires that these products as \na whole pay their share of the Postal Service's institutional costs. \nThe Federal Trade Commission will further study any additional legal \nbenefits the Postal Service enjoys that its private sector competitors \ndo not. The Regulatory Commission will then find a way to use the rate \nsystem to level the playing field.\n   Fourth, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act improves \nPostal Service accountability, mostly by strengthening oversight. \nQualifications for membership on the Regulatory Commission would be \nstronger than those for the Rate Commission so that Commissioners would \nhave a background in finance or economics. Commissioners would also \nhave the power to demand information from the Postal Service, including \nby subpoena, and have the power to punish them for violating rate and \nservice regulations. In addition, the Commission will make an annual \ndetermination as to whether the Postal Service is in compliance with \nrate law and meeting service standards and will have the power to \npunish them for any transgressions.\n  Fifth, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act revises two \nprovisions from the Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding \nReform Act in an effort to shore up the Postal Service's finances in \nthe years to come. As our colleagues may be aware, that bill requires \nthe Postal Service, beginning in 2006, to deposit any savings it enjoys \nby virtue of lower pension payments into an escrow account. In this \nbill, we eliminate that requirement in\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\norder to allow the Postal Service to spend the money that would have \ngone into escrow according to the plan submitted by the Postal Service \nin September of last year, which called for using most of the savings \nto begin paying down the Postal Service's $50 billion retiree health \nobligation. The bill Senator Collins and I are introducing today also \nreverses the provision in the Postal Civil Service Retirement System \nFunding Reform Act that made the Postal Service the only Federal agency \nshouldered with the burden of paying the additional pension benefits \nowed to their employees by virtue of past military service.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the bill preserves universal service \nand the postal monopoly and forces the Postal Service to concentrate \nsolely on what it does best--processing and delivering the mail to all \nAmericans. Our bill limits the Postal Service, for the first time, to \nproviding ``postal services,'' meaning they would be prohibited from \nengaging in other lines of business, such as e-commerce, that draw time \nand resources away from letter and package delivery. It also explicitly \npreserves the requirement that the Postal Service ``bind the Nation \ntogether through the mail'' and serve all parts of the country, urban, \nsuburban and rural, in a non-discriminatory fashion. Any service \nstandards established by the Postal Regulatory Commission will continue \nto ensure delivery to every address, every day. In addition, the bill \nmaintains the prohibition on closing post offices solely because they \noperate at a deficit, ensuring that rural and urban customers continue \nto enjoy full access to retail postal services.\n  The President's Commission, while calling for the preservation of \nuniversal service and the postal monopoly, opened the door for future \nchanges by recommending that the Regulatory Commission be given the \nauthority to make them themselves. While I believe that Congress will \nfind it difficult to roll back universal service or limit the postal \nmonopoly in the future if it is deemed necessary to do so, I believe \nthe recommendation from the President's Commission would give too much \npower to a relatively small, political body. In order to keep Congress \nfocused on the Postal Service's future, however, our bill asks the \nRegulatory Commission to report every three years on the state of \nuniversal service and the postal monopoly. When necessary, they would \nalso make recommendations to Congress when they feel like one is \nnecessary.\n  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity this year to enact \nmeaningful postal reform legislation. The House Government Reform \nCommittee marked up its version of the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act last week by a unanimous 40-0 vote. The President has \nindicated his support for a bill, releasing a set of postal reform \nprinciples at the end of last year calling on Congress to make some key \nchanges to the way the Postal Service operates. We now have everyone \nfrom the National Association of Letter Carriers to former opponents of \nreform like UPS supporting our efforts, as well as those in the House. \nI know there are still some concerns about certain provisions in our \nbill, but I look forward to working with Senator Collins and each of \nour colleagues in the coming weeks to continue this momentum and get a \nbill through Congress that can be signed into law this year.\n  It's amazing to me to think that the Postal Service, something \nSenator Stevens was able to put together at the beginning of his \ncareer, could have lasted so long and had such an impact on every \nAmerican. I'm hopeful that the model Senator Collins and I have set out \nin this bill today can last at least that long and have just as \npositive an impact on our nation and our economy as the Postal Service \ndid so many years ago.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Collins and \nSenator Carper as an original cosponsor of S. 2468, the Postal \nAccountability and Enhancement Act. In 2002, the President formed a \nCommission to evaluate the operations of the United States Postal \nService. Earlier this year, the President's Commission issued a \ncomprehensive report filled with suggestions on how to improve the \nPostal Service. Senator Collins became actively engaged on the issue of \npostal reform and held a series of hearing this year on postal reform. \nThis bill is the product of the postal reform hearings held before the \nGovernment Affairs Committee.\n  I expect I will have suggestions on this legislation as the bill \nmoves through the legislative process. However, I support Senator \nCollins's commitment to postal reform. I look forward to working with \nher and Senator Carper in Committee and on the Senate floor to ensure \nthe success of this legislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Collins \nand Senator Carper, who today have introduced the Postal Accountability \nand Enhancement Act. I commend both of my Governmental Affairs \nCommittee colleagues for their leadership in crafting a postal reform \nbill.\n  For some time, the General Accounting Office has warned that the \nlong-term financial outlook for the U.S. Postal Service was at risk \nwithout significant changes. At the request of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the U.S. Postal Service developed a transformation plan that \noffered its vision for the future. Late in 2002, a Presidential Postal \nCommission was convened, which issued a number of recommendations in \n2003.\n  Over the past 6 months, I have participated in a series of hearings \nchaired by Senator Collins which examined the recommendations of the \nPostal Commission. I commend Senator Collins for guaranteeing that the \ndivergent views were seriously considered throughout our eight \nhearings. I also wish to commend my colleague from Delaware, Senator \nCarper, for his strong and early commitment to postal reform.\n  I support modernizing the U.S. Postal Service to ensure that its \nmission of providing 6 days a week universal service at an affordable \nrate is preserved. Although the legislation introduced today responds \nto many of the recommendations and concerns we heard in our hearings, \nit wisely rejects others. However, like most bills, there are \nprovisions that trouble me. I am particularly concerned with the \nsections relating to worksharing and changes to the Federal Employees' \nCompensation Act (FECA). I will continue to work with the bill's \nsponsors to address these provisions, which I believe do not promote \ncost savings for the Postal Service or fairness for postal workers.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation to \nguarantee that the U.S. Postal Service will be in position to best \nserve the public in the 21st century, be a model employer, and protect \nthe retirement future of its employees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Talent, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 2470. A bill to enhance navigation capacity improvements and the \necosystem restoration plan for the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois \nWaterway System; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I join my colleagues, Senators \nHarkin, Durbin, Talent, Grassley, Coleman, Fitzgerald and Pryor to \nintroduce bipartisan legislation to provide transportation efficiency \nand environmental sustainability on the Mississippi and Illinois \nRivers.\n  As the world becomes more competitive, we must also. In the \nheartland, the efficiency, reliability, capacity, and safety of our \ntransportation options are critical--often make-or-break. As we look 50 \nyears into the future, and as we anticipate and try to promote \ncommercial and economic growth, we have to ask ourselves a fundamental \nquestion: should we have a system that permits and promotes growth, or \nshould we be satisfied to restrict our growth to the confines of a \ntransportation straight jacket designed not for 2050, but for 1980?\n  Further, we must ask ourselves if dramatic investments should be made \nto address environmental problems and opportunities that exist on these \ngreat waterways.\n  In both cases, the answer is, ``Of course we should modernize and \nimprove.''\n  We have a system which is in environmental and economic decline. Jobs \nand markets and the availability of habitat for fish and wildlife are \nat stake.\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\n  We cannot be for increased trade, commercial growth, and job creation \nwithout supporting the basic transportation infrastructure necessary to \nmove goods from buyers to sellers. New efficiency helps give our \nproducers an edge that can make or break opportunities in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Seventy years ago, some argued that a transportation system on the \nMississippi River was not justified. Congress decided that its role was \nnot to try to predict the future but to shape the future and decided to \ninvest in a system despite the naysayers. Over 80 million tons per year \nlater, it is clear that the decision was wise.\n  Now, that system that was designed for paddlewheel boats and to last \n50 years is nearly 70 years old and we must make decisions that will \nshape the next 50-70 years. As we look ahead, we must promote growth \npolicies that help Americans who produce and employ.\n  We must work for policies that promote economic growth, job creation, \nand environmental sustainability. We know that trade and economic \ngrowth can be fostered or it can be discouraged by policies and other \nrealities which include the quality of our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  So in 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 years, where will the growth in \ntransportation occur to accommodate the growth in demand for commercial \nshipping? The Department of Transportation suggests that congestion on \nour roads and rails will double in the next quarter century. The fact \nof the matter is that the great untapped capacity is on our water.\n  This is good news because water transportation is efficient, it is \nsafe, it conserves fuel, and it protects the air and the environment. \nOne medium-sized barge tow can carry the freight of 870 trucks. That \nfact alone speaks volumes to the benefits of water. If we can, would we \nrather have 870 diesel engines on the roads of downtown St. Louis, or \ntwo diesel engines on the water watching the traffic buildup and smog \nglide by?\n\n  The veteran Chief Economist at USDA testified that transportation \nefficiency and the ability of farmers to win markets at higher prices \nare ``fundamentally related.'' He predicts that corn exports over the \nnext 10 years will rise 45 percent, 70 percent of which will travel \ndown the Mississippi.\n  Over the past 35 years, waterborne commerce on the Upper Mississippi \nRiver has more than tripled. The system currently carries 60 percent of \nour Nation's corn exports and 45 percent of our Nation's soybean \nexports and it does so at two-thirds the cost of rail--when rail is \navailable.\n  Over the previous 11 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have \nspent $70 million doing a six year study. During that period, there \nhave been 35 meetings of the Governors Liaison Committee, 28 meetings \non the Economic Coordinating Committee, among the States along the \nUpper Mississippi and Illinois waterways, and there have been 44 \nmeetings of the Navigation and Environmental Coordination Committee. \nAdditionally, there have been 130 briefings for special interest \ngroups, 24 newsletters. There have been six sets of public meetings in \n46 locations with over 4,000 people in attendance. To say the least, \nthis has been a very long, very transparent, and very representative \nprocess.\n  However, while we have been studying, our competitors have been \nbuilding. Given the extraordinary delay so far, and given the reality \nthat large scale construction takes not weeks or months, but decades, \nfurther delay is no longer an option.\n  This is why I am leased to be joined by a bipartisan group of \nSenators who agree that we must improve the efficiency and the \nenvironmental sustainability of our great resources. Today, we \nintroduce legislation to adopt the initial recommendations of the Corps \nof Engineers and their public and private partners to increase the lock \ncapacity on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and the begin an \nambitious program of ecosystem restoration.\n  This plan gets the Corps back in the business of building the future, \nrather than just haggling about predicting the future. More will need \nto be done later on ecosystem and lock expansions further upstream, but \nthis begins the improvement schedule underway.\n  In this legislation, we authorize $1.46 billion for ecosystem \nrestoration--two times the federal share of lock capacity expansion \nwhich we authorize on locks 20-25 on the Mississippi River and Peoria \nand LaGrange on the Illinois. The new 1,200 foot locks on the \nMississippi River will provide equal capacity in the bottleneck region \nbelow the 1,200 foot lock 19 at Keokuk above locks 26 and 27 near St. \nLouis. Half the cost of the new locks will be paid for by private users \nwho pay into the Inland Waterways Trust fund. Additional funds will be \nprovided for mitigation and small scale and nonstructural measures to \nimprove efficiency.\n  As we look ahead, the locks at 14-18 will have to be addressed as \nwill further investments to ecosystem restoration efforts.\n  This effort is supported by a broad-based group of the States, farm \ngroups, shippers, labor, and those who pay taxes into the Trust Fund \nfor improvements.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work together on this bipartisan \neffort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in section 1103(a)(2) of the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 4225), Congress recognized \n     the Upper Mississippi River System as ``a nationally \n     significant ecosystem and a nationally significant commercial \n     navigation system'' and declared that the system ``shall be \n     administered and regulated in recognition of its several \n     purposes'';\n       (2) inaction on construction of new locks will lead to \n     economic decline, and inaction on implementation of an \n     enhanced ecosystem restoration program will lead to further \n     environmental decline;\n       (3) the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway carry \n     approximately 60 percent of the corn exports of the United \n     States and 45 percent of the soybean exports of the United \n     States, providing a significant positive balance of trade \n     benefit for the Nation;\n       (4) the movement of more than 100,000,000 tons of product \n     supports 400,000 full- and part-time jobs in the United \n     States, generating over $4,000,000,000 in income and \n     $12,000,000,000 to $15,000,000,000 in economic activity;\n       (5) Midwestern utilities use coal, the second largest \n     category of cargo shipped on the Upper Mississippi River \n     System, to produce cost-efficient energy;\n       (6) keeping the cost of transportation lower through \n     competition between transportation modes is the United States \n     farmer's competitive advantage in capturing future global \n     growth in agricultural exports;\n       (7) United States farm and trade policies work to open \n     world markets and promote United States exports, and water \n     resource policy has provided a low-cost transportation \n     alternative to other modes;\n       (8) the Department of Agriculture projects that corn \n     exports will grow 44 percent over the next decade, with a \\1/\n     3\\ increase in growth exported through the Gulf of Mexico;\n       (9) those transportation savings--\n       (A) provide higher income to farmers and rural communities; \n     and\n       (B) generate Federal and State taxes to support community \n     activities, quality of life, and national benefits;\n       (10) the construction of new 1,200-foot locks and lock \n     extensions will provide more than 48,000,000 man-hours of \n     employment over 10 to 15 years;\n       (11) foreign competitors have worked over the last 10 years \n     to improve foreign transportation infrastructure to compete \n     more effectively with United States production;\n       (12) the inland waterway transportation system moves 16 \n     percent of the freight in the United States for 2 percent of \n     the cost, including more than 100,000,000 tons on the Upper \n     Mississippi River System;\n       (13) the Department of Transportation projects that freight \n     congestion on the roads and rails in the United States will \n     double in the next 25 years and that water transportation \n     will need to play an increasing role in moving freight;\n       (14) the movement of 100,000,000 tons on the river system \n     in 4,400 15-barge tows out of harms way would require an \n     equivalent of 4,000,000 trucks or 1,000,000 rail cars moving \n     directly through our communities;\n       (15) econometric models are useful analytic tools to \n     provide valuable information, but are unable to account for \n     every market trend, development, and public policy impact;\n       (16) the current capacity of the Upper Mississippi River \n     System is--\n       (A) declining by 10 percent annually because of unplanned \n     closures of a 70-year old infrastructure; and\n       (B) reducing the potential for sustained growth;\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n       (17) the current 600-foot lock system was designed for \n     steamboats, at a time when 4,000,000 tons moved on the \n     Mississippi River and a total of 2,000,000,000 bushels of \n     corn were produced nationally, compared to today, when \n     100,000,000 to 120,000,000 tons are shipped and the national \n     production of corn exceeds 10,000,000,000 bushels;\n       (18) the 600-foot locks at Locks and Dam Nos. 20, 21, 22, \n     24, and 25 on the Upper Mississippi River and LaGrange and \n     Peoria on the Illinois Waterway are operating at 80 percent \n     utilization and are unable to provide for or process \n     effectively the volatile growth of traditional export grain \n     markets;\n       (19) based on the current construction schedule of new \n     locks and dams on the inland system, lock modernization will \n     need to take place over 30 years, starting immediately, as an \n     imperative to avoid lost export grain sales and diminished \n     national competitiveness;\n       (20) the Corps of Engineers has been studying the needs for \n     national investments on the Upper Mississippi River System \n     for the last 15 years and has based initial recommendations \n     on the best available information and science;\n       (21) the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers ecosystem \n     consists of hundreds of thousands of acres of bottomland \n     forests, islands, backwaters, side channels, and wetlands;\n       (22) the river ecosystem is home to 270 species of birds, \n     57 species of mammals, 45 species of amphibians and reptiles, \n     113 species of fish, and nearly 50 species of mussels;\n       (23) more than 40 percent of migratory waterfowl and \n     shorebirds in North America depend on the river for food, \n     shelter, and habitat during migration;\n       (24) the annual operation of the Upper Mississippi River \n     Basin needs to take into consideration opportunities for \n     ecosystem restoration;\n       (25) development since the 1930's has altered and reduced \n     the biological diversity of the large flood plain river \n     systems of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers;\n       (26) Congress recognizes the need for significant Federal \n     investment in the restoration of the Upper Mississippi and \n     Illinois River ecosystems;\n       (27) the Upper Mississippi River System provides important \n     economic benefits from recreational and tourist uses, \n     resulting in the basin's receiving more visitors annually \n     than most National Parks, with the ecosystems and wildlife \n     being the main attractions; and\n       (28) the Upper Mississippi River System--\n       (A) includes 284,688 acres of National Wildlife Refuge land \n     that is managed as habitat for migratory birds, fish, \n     threatened and endangered species, and a diverse assortment \n     of other species and related habitats; and\n       (B) provides many recreational opportunities.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bipartisan measure on \nwhich I have worked closely with my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nBond. The purpose of this bill is to expand the transportation \ninfrastructure and improve the ecosystem of the upper Mississippi \nRiver.\n  I have been deeply involved with Mississippi navigation issues \nbecause of their enormous importance to farmers in Iowa. Efficient \nriver transportation is critical to keeping Iowa commodity costs \ncompetitive with foreign and domestic alternatives. When shipping on \nthe river is constrained, costs rise. That, in turn, leads to price \nincreases for moving bulk farm commodities by alternative means, mainly \nrail. These price differentials seem relatively small compared to the \ntotal price, but they make a huge difference in farm income.\n  Clearly, river traffic on the Mississippi is incredibly important to \nproducers in my State. As a result of traffic congestion on the \nMississippi, producers in the upper Midwest face longer shipping times, \nhigher costs, and lost revenue. In the short run, enhanced traffic \nmanagement can improve the situation. And it is important to have \nhelper boats to push long barges through crowded locks. This bill \naddresses these two matters. But we need a longer-term solution, too. \nIt is incredibly important that we modernize a number of the locks on \nthe upper Mississippi--and we need to get started as soon as possible.\n  Existing law requires exhaustive analysis of river-use levels looking \ndecades into the future. The studies required for such predictions are, \nby their very nature, highly speculative at best. There is no shortage \nof critics of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its methods. But we \ncan all agree that, to remain competitive, America needs to keep the \narteries and veins of America's river transportation system in smooth \nrunning order. Last year, I visited Brazil and saw first-hand their \nremarkable efforts to modernize and improve their river transportation \nsystem. We need to keep up with countries like Brazil, if we are going \nto remain competitive. We simply cannot wait any longer to authorize \nconstruction of 1,200-foot locks so barge tows can move through the \nupper Mississippi and Illinois without being split.\n  However, this is not an easy issue. Over the years, I have heard time \nand time again from constituents and national leaders who are concerned \nabout the environment, as I am. People correctly insist that we \nmaintain a balance between navigation, flood control, and environmental \nprotection. Habitat for many species, and the Mississippi river \necosystem as a whole, has deteriorated since the construction of the \noriginal lock system in the 1930's.\n  The Mississippi River is home to a wide variety of fish and birds, as \nwell as other wildlife. All of this wildlife, and the abundant plant \nlife, too, are important to the character and life of the Mississippi \nRiver. Approximately 40 percent of North America's waterfowl and \nshorebirds use the Mississippi Flyway. Parts of the Upper Mississippi \nRiver serve could well be the most important area for migrating diving \nducks in the United States. The Mississippi River also serves as \nhabitat for breeding and wintering birds, including the bald eagle.\n\n  We are all aware of the problems that have plagued the Corps' past \nwork on the Mississippi River. But the Corps has pledged to \ndramatically step up its emphasis on environmental protection. We need \nto work with the Corps to ensure that all updates and renovations of \nlocks and dams are done with keen concern for the environment and for \nthe fish and wildlife that depend on the Mississippi River habitat. At \nthe same time, we need to give the Corps the authorization and funding \nit needs to accomplish real ecosystem restoration, and not just make up \nfor the lost habitat of specific identified species. The legislation we \nare proposing accomplishes this.\n  We understand that this bill is going to be a challenge in these \ndifficult budget times. But to not act would be penny wise and pound \nfoolish. We need to be thinking of the long-term economic health of our \nagricultural producers and shippers, hand in hand with the long-term \nhealth of the diverse ecosystems in the river. I believe the \nlegislation we are proposing strikes a careful balance. I look forward \nto working closely with my colleagues to achieve those goals.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to as a cosponsor of \nlegislation to modernize our aging waterways infrastructure on the \nUpper Mississippi River and the Illinois River.\n  I am glad to join my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond as well as \nSenators Harkin and Grassley in introducing a bill to upgrade and \nmodernize the failing infrastructure on the Upper Mississippi and \nIllinois Rivers.\n  This $2.9 billion authorization will also bring great benefits to the \nfish habitat along the river through construction of fish passages, \nfloodplain restoration and side channel restoration. I commend Senators \nBond and Harkin for working to find some balance in this important \nissue. I have always said, navigation and habitat restoration do not \nhave to be mutually exclusive.\n  The locks and dams that are in place today are vital to our national \neconomy. These national waterways serve as our competitive advantage to \nour overseas competitors, and this a clean and efficient way to move \ngoods and commodities for export. The Upper Mississippi River and \nIllinois Waterway carry approximately 60 percent of the country's corn \nexports and 45 percent of our soybean exports, providing a significant \npositive balance of trade benefit for the Nation. Over half of the \nSoybeans produced in Missiouri head down the Mississippi River to the \nGulf where they are shipped to markets overseas.\n  To me, this issue is a question of common sense. Water transportation \nis safe, clean and efficient. One medium barge tow can carry the same \nfreight as 870 tractor trailer trucks. This relieves highway \ncongestion, reduces shipping costs, and reduces fuels consumption and \nair emissions. Despite this, we'll still have opponents to this bill \nsaying that it isn't good for the environment.\n  This bill is a win-win. It will take steps to reduce some of the \nburdens on our transportation systems, as well as providing more \nopportunities for our agricultural producers to export their products.\n  These locks are old and outdated. The current 600-foot lock system \nwas designed for streamboats, at a time when 4 million tons moved on \nthe Mississippi River and a total of 2 billion bushels of corn were \nproduced nationally, compared to today, when 100 million to 120 million \ntons are shipped and the national production of corn exceeds 10 million \nbushels. We need to bring these locks into the 21st Century.\n  If we don't fix this aging infrastructure now, it will only become \nmore costly. If I get a hole in the roof of my house, my wife and I may \ndiscuss how to fix it, but we know we will make the repair. If you \ndon't make the repairs and upgrades, the problem only gets worse. That \nis what we have done to the locks and dams on the Mississippi River. I \ndon't want this to be a situation where the roof actually falls in--we \nmust modernize the system.\n  I commend my colleague from Missouri and his leadership on this \nissue. This is a good bill and I am happy to join him as a cosponsor. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with him on this important issue.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof bipartisan legislation to authorize the modernization of the lock \nand dam infrastructure and enhanced environmental restoration on the \nUpper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n  Modernizing the inland waterway transportation system remains a high \npriority for the Upper Mississippi River basin and for agricultural, \ncommercial, and labor interests that rely on the river to transport \ntheir products. In addition to strong grassroots support for this \nendeavor, the State legislatures have passed resolutions endorsing lock \nand dam modernization, ecosystem restoration, and Congressional action.\n  Agriculture and related industries in Iowa and the other States on \nthe Upper Mississippi remain competitive in world markets, despite \nhigher production costs, because of the efficiencies inherent in river \ntransport. More than 60 percent of all grain exports move from the \nUpper Mississippi, making\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nthis competitive advantage vital to their ability to operate their \nbusiness. Over 400,000 full and part-time jobs in our basin are \nconnected to the river. Without modernization, Midwest producers will \nnot be able to compete in anticipated world grain export growth.\n  Furthermore, a recent study estimates the loss of 30,000 jobs \nnationwide, $562 million annually in lost farm income and $185 million \nannually in lost State and local tax receipts if the lock and dam \nsystem is not upgraded. Providing U.S. agricultural producers every \nopportunity to export their products to world markets is essential for \ntheir financial well-being and future viability.\n  While it is important to consider economic benefits, we must also \nprotect the ecosystem of the river. A cooperative solution can meet the \nneeds of farmers and waterway users while at the same time improve the \nenvironment and stem the decline of the Rivers' ecosystems through \nenhanced authorities. Restoring the ecosystem is not mutually exclusive \nto lock modernization.\n  After 12 years and $70 million of study, we firmly believe that the \ntime has come to take action. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation providing initial authorization to begin the modernization \nprocess and enhance the authorities to address broader ecosystem \nrestoration. Without immediate action, the health of both the \nagriculture economy and river ecosystem will continue to decline.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the Mississippi River is a national \ntreasure and this legislation authorizes programs that will help \nrestore water quality and rehabilitate wildlife and wildlife habitat on \nthe river.\n  The annual operation of the Upper Mississippi River Basin needs to \ntake into consideration opportunities for ecosystem restoration. The \nUpper Mississippi River ecosystem consists of hundreds of thousands of \nacres of bottomland forests, islands, backwaters, side channels and \nwetlands. The Upper Mississippi River system includes 284,688 acres of \nNational Wildlife Refuge land that is managed as habitat for migratory \nbirds, fish, threatened and endangered species and a diverse assortment \nof other species and related habitats.\n  I am very pleased that this bill gives ecosystem restoration the \nattention that it deserves.\n  The Department of Transportation projects that water transportation \nwill play an increasing role in moving freight due to congestion on \nroads and railways. More efficient use of river transportation will \nhelp the environment reducing traffic congestion and emissions on our \nNation's highways. For example, a 15 barge tow can carry as much as 870 \nsemi-tractor trailer trucks. Fuel efficiency for barge transportation \nis 2.5 times that of rail transport and nearly 10 times that of truck \ntransport.\n  Improving navigation efficiency on the upper Mississippi and Illinois \nRivers has been a high priority issue for Midwest farmers for years. \nOur agricultural competitive position in accessing world markets is \ngreatly impacted by the efficiency of our transportation system. \nFarmers depend on the lock system to move grain efficiently to market. \nThey also depend on the locks for the movement of crop production \ninputs up the Mississippi River.\n  Our entire region benefits as commercial barge traffic moves not only \nagricultural products, but also aggregate, cement, salt, and other \nimportant items efficiently, safely and in an environmentally sound \nmanner.\n  The Upper Mississippi River Ecosystem Restoration and navigation bill \nalso represents a landmark opportunity to address environmental and \neconomic ramifications of the entire lock and dam system, rather than \nthe previous piecemeal approaches. The Corps of Engineers has responded \nto critics who called for a comprehensive evaluation, coupling an \nassessment of the economic need for navigation improvements and the \necosystem restoration components necessary to protect our region in the \nprocess. As outlined in this legislation, the $1.46 billion ecosystem \nrestoration package includes the construction of fish passages, \nfloodplain restoration on thousands of acres and side channel \nrestoration, along with other measures.\n  This is indeed a new approach to improving our economy, by providing \nconstruction jobs and boosting our farm economy, and protecting our \nenvironment, by increasing the efficiency of barge traffic while \ninitiating important water quality measures.\n  I am proud to be a coauthor of this important legislation.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Bond in \nsupport of a bill to put into place recommendations by the Army Corps \nof Engineers for navigation capacity improvements and ecosystem \nrestoration for the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers Waterway \nSystem.\n  Modernizing the inland waterway transportation system is a high \npriority for the Upper Mississippi River basin and for agricultural, \ncommercial, and labor interests that rely on the river to transport \ntheir products. Without modernization, Midwest producers will not be \nable to fully participate in growing world markets.\n  On April 29, 2004, the Army Corps of Engineers released its proposal \nto upgrade the locks and to provide for ecosystem restoration on these \ntwo waterways. I have consistently fought for funding to revitalize \nthese locks to help Illinois producers more easily transport their \nproducts to market. I have joined Senator Bond as a cosponsor to this \nbill because our country's agriculture and business interests have \nwaited far too long for these improvements.\n  The Mississippi River plays a vital role in our economy. The \nMississippi and Illinois Rivers are two of the major routes by which \nIllinois agricultural commodities are distributed to the world. In \nfact, roughly 70 percent of U.S. agricultural products are transported \nthrough the Mississippi River system. More than 60 million tons of \ncommodities are transported on the Illinois River alone, including more \nthan half of Illinois' annual corn crop.\n  By controlling the water's flow, locks and dams help facilitate the \ntransportation of commodities along rivers. The outdated and \ndeteriorating 600-foot locks on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers \ncreate unnecessary delays because the locks are too small to \naccommodate modern size barge tows. This causes transportation costs to \nrise and results in lost market share for Illinois agriculture \nproducers.\n  Along with modernizing this river system's locks, we must not allow \nthe deterioration of its ecosystem. A cooperative solution can meet the \nneeds of waterway users and, at the same time, improve the environment \nand stem the decline of the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers' \necosystems. This legislation strikes a good balance by upgrading the \nlock system while protecting the ecosystem of these rivers.\n  I commend Senator Bond for introducing this important legislation and \nam pleased to join him in cosponsoring this bill. Illinois farmers and \nother producers have waited far too long for these improvements. This \nbill brings the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers Waterway System \ninto the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 2472. A bill to require that notices to consumers of health and \nfinancial services include information on the outsourcing of sensitive \npersonal information abroad, to require relevant Federal agencies to \nprescribe regulations to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive \npersonal information outsourced abroad, to establish requirements for \nforeign call centers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcern about an issue that illustrates the continuing erosion of \nAmericans' privacy rights. My concern is related to the practice of \noutsourcing. When U.S. companies outsource sensitive customer \ninformation for processing overseas, they may be outsourcing our \nprivacy rights along with it.\n  We all know that recently it has become popular for American \ncompanies to send internal paperwork to be done in other countries, by \nforeign companies.\n  When a U.S. company allows a foreign company to process customer \ndata, the foreign company may be given access to the most sensitive \ntypes of customer information. Our health records, bank account \nnumbers, social security numbers, tax forms, and credit card numbers \nare now being\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nshipped abroad--without the knowledge of the customer and beyond the \nreach of U.S. privacy laws.\n  This phenomenon means that consumers are almost powerless to stop \nforeign scam artists from misusing their sensitive information. What \ntypes of abuses can occur under this scenario?\n  In one recent shocking example, a U.S. hospital hired a medical \ntranscriber in Pakistan through a subcontractor to work with sensitive \npatient health  information. Later, the foreign worker claimed that she \nhad not been paid for her work.\n\n   So, you know what she did? She threatened to post patients' medical \nrecords online unless she was paid. Luckily, she got her paycheck and \ndoesn't seem to have posted anything online.\n   But this situation shows us the potential for gross violations of \nconsumer privacy. The U.S. hospital said that it never even knew that \nthe foreign transcriber had been hired through a subcontractor and it \ntherefore had never bound her contractually to follow any privacy or \nsecurity standards.\n   Another potential abuse of offshoring sensitive customer data is \nidentity theft. The illegal theft of someone's identity is a profoundly \ndisturbing and costly problem in this information age.\n   Moreover, illegal misuse of sensitive information also can have \nnational security implications. For example, data about some of our \nNation's power grids allegedly has been outsourced to companies \noverseas. Imagine the harm that terrorists might do if they got hold of \nthat type of confidential information.\n   As our global economy expands at such a rapid pace, we simply cannot \ntolerate the outsourcing of American's privacy rights overseas. We need \nto be proactive on this potentially explosive issue. Make no mistake, \nthe Pakistani transcriber incident is not the first or the last time \nthat sensitive customer information becomes endangered in a foreign \ncountry. The time to act is now, instead of reacting only after our \nprivacy rights are further eroded.\n   In light of these circumstances, today I am introducing a bill--\nalong with Senator Feinstein--that begins to address these privacy and \nsecurity concerns. The bill is called the INFO Act, which is short for \nThe Increasing Notice of Foreign Outsourcing Act.\n   The INFO Act is designed to help ensure that sensitive consumer \ninformation is protected and that U.S. companies can be held \naccountable for breakdowns in the security of customer information.\n   Specifically, the INFO Act that we are introducing today would \nrequire the following things: First, U.S. companies in the health care \nindustry and the financial industry must tell their customers that \ntheir sensitive health information and financial information is being \nprocessed by companies in foreign nations, where privacy safeguards may \nbe less stringent.\n   Second, U.S. companies in the health care industry and the financial \nindustry must promise their customers that they are complying with U.S. \nprivacy laws, which are designed to keep sensitive customer information \nsecure even when it is outsourced.\n   Third, U.S. companies in the health care industry and financial \nindustry must make sure that each foreign company that is handling \nsensitive customer information has agreed by contract to meet U.S. \nprivacy standards and to keep sensitive customer information secure.\n\n  Fourth, U.S. companies may examine the business operations of the \nforeign company to make sure the foreign company is meeting privacy \nstandards and is keeping sensitive customer information secure.\n  Fifth, a foreign company must notify the U.S company of any data \nsecurity breach. The U.S. company must then notify the U.S. regulatory \nagency, which can then hold the U.S. company accountable for the \nactions of the foreign company.\n  Finally, an employee of a foreign call center must tell a U.S. \ncustomer where the employee is located, if the U.S. customer asks for \nthis information.\n  I strongly believe that we need to act now, before the privacy issues \nraised by offshoring begin to explode.\n  Let me emphasize that I see this bill as both pro-consumer and pro-\nbusiness. Consumers will be informed about how their sensitive \ninformation is handled and they can learn when security breaches occur. \nAdditionally, foreign companies that handle customer data will be held \naccountable to the U.S. company that gives them their work. And U.S. \ncompanies will be upfront in informing their customers about offshoring \nsensitive data before customer backlash occurs.\n  With this sort of system in place, we hopefully can reduce the \nchances of customer data being misused, and allow U.S. companies to \nplay on a level playing field where all interested parties know the \nrules of the game.\n  I have a history of trying to solve consumer issues in ways that are \nnot needlessly burdensome to U.S. businesses. That is why my office, as \nwell as Senator Feinstein's office, has met several times with industry \nrepresentatives during the development of this bill.\n  I was interested to find ways for businesses to protect consumer \nprivacy rights without having to sharply raise prices or limit products \nand services. I believe that the INFO Act has achieved those goals.\n  Consumer privacy has always been one of my top priorities. Now, as \nalways, I look forward to working with all interested parties to \nresolve this consumer privacy issue in a timely and effective manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Bill Nelson, the Increasing Notice of Foreign \nOutsourcing Act, or the INFO Act. This legislation will help safeguard \nAmericans' most important and sensitive personal information when it is \nsent abroad for processing to countries that may have lax security and \nprivacy standards.\n  The bill will ensure that American companies notify consumers of a \nbusiness's outsourcing practices. It will require American companies to \ncertify the adequacy of their outsourcing protections. And it will \nrequire American companies to hold their foreign business partners \naccountable for protecting Americans' data.\n  In order to protect the information of Americans that is now \nvulnerable abroad, this bill calls for the following key safeguards:\n  First, the bill requires American health and financial companies to \nnotify consumers when sending their information abroad, and to certify \nthe safety of the overseas processing. We drafted provisions carefully \nto minimize the burden on businesses, so they will expand on privacy \ndisclosures that companies already make under Federal law.\n  Second, American companies processing health or financial data must \ninclude clauses in contracts with their foreign partners to allow \naudits of their foreign information processors and to enforce American \nprivacy standards.\n  Third, the bill creates a system to inform American companies and \nFederal regulators of any security breaches involving American health \nor financial information at facilities operated outside the United \nStates.\n  And fourth, the bill gives Americans the right to have workers at \nforeign call centers disclose where they are calling from.\n  The bill also gives Federal agencies the power to enforce these \nprovisions. It is important to emphasize that this bill is drafted to \nminimize the burdens on businesses, by expanding on existing privacy \ndata and security laws.\n  While many are concerned about how outsourcing abroad hurts American \nworkers, outsourcing also poses risks to the security and privacy of \nAmerican consumers' personal data. The recent wave of international \noutsourcing means that we are flooding the entire world with our most \nsensitive information.\n  Once sent abroad, the information is at risk because our Federal laws \ndo not apply to foreign companies operating overseas. Another reason is \nbecause many foreign countries have far weaker security laws than our \nown. For instance, India still has no laws to protect personal and \nprivate data. And still another reason is because it is extremely \ndifficult for Americans to use foreign courts to sue foreign companies \nthat misuse American data.\n  These factors leave the most intimate details of the lives of \nuncountable Americans vulnerable to lax security and to malicious \nidentity thieves.\n  And there is even more at stake. Information outsourcing poses a \ndirect risk to national security. We are painfully aware that some \npeople want to steal the identity of individual Americans in order to \nevade our homeland defenses and harm us all.\n  International information outsourcing has skyrocketed in recent \nyears. Consider the following:\n  Tax returns for about 200,000 Americans were prepared in India this \nyear. To put this number in context, India workers processed only about \n1,000 U.S. tax returns 2 years ago. Tax returns have Americans' names, \nSocial Security numbers, income, employers, addresses, and other \ndetails.\n  The American Association of Medical Transcription estimates that 10 \npercent of all medical transcription of doctors' notes is being done \nabroad.\n  An executive from Trans Union, one of the major credit agencies in \nthe United States, told The San Francisco Chronicle that:\n\n       A hundred percent of our mail regarding customer disputes \n     is going to go to India at some point.\n\n  If anyone doubts the risk that international outsourcing poses to \nAmericans, consider these incidents:\n  Recently, a low-paid transcriber in Pakistan was working as a \nsubcontractor to the University of California Medical Center in San \nFrancisco. That foreign worker threatened to post confidential patient \ninformation on the Internet unless the university coaxed her boss into \npaying some of her bills.\n  Three weeks later, a strikingly similar incident occurred with a \nworker in Bangalore, India.\n  In another incident, in Noida, India, an employee working at a call \ncenter used an American's credit card information to buy electronics \nequipment from Sony.\n  Also in India, there is a burgeoning black market in personal \nidentity information. According to one report, stolen names, addresses, \nphone numbers, the bank a person has an account with, and even bank \naccount numbers are sold on the streets for mere pennies.\n  These are just a few incidents. No one knows how many other times \nworkers have done similar things. And that is a big part of the \nproblem. It is not merely that Americans' identities are vulnerable \nwhen sent abroad. The problem is that American companies obscure how \nmuch outsourcing they do, and when they are doing it.\n  For example, according to the San Jose Mercury News, a worker at a \ncall center dealing with State benefits refused to identify his \nlocation. The supervisor, when she picked up the call, refused to say \nanything more than that she worked for Citicorp.\n  In essence, the problem of obscurity is so bad that we can list only \na few incidents reported by the media. How many security breaches have \ntaken place? Have consumers been informed when their information is \nabroad and at risk? How much money has this cost consumers? We don't \nknow.\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\n  And so far, American regulatory agencies have been unable to say \ndespite their oversight of these industries. And American companies \nhave stayed mum. We need to break the silence.\n  The fact is, our Government is simply not doing enough to protect \nconsumers. Earlier this month I received a letter from John D. Hawke, \nJr., who is the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. He heads one of the \nagencies that regulates U.S. financial institutions and banks.\n  Mr. Hawke wrote to me that the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, known as the OCC, does not directly regulate foreign \ncontractors that work for U.S. banks. Specifically, he wrote:\n\n       [T]he OCC focuses its supervisory reviews regarding foreign \n     servicing relationships on whether the serviced banks have \n     adequate procedures in place. . . .\n\n  That means the OCC is focusing on the American companies, not the \nforeign ones.\n  I also learned from the OCC that it already suggests certain \nsafeguards for American banks to use when they hire foreign information \nprocessors. The OCC asks U.S. banks to use contract provisions to make \nsure that foreign companies use secure methods to process data, and to \nlet the U.S. companies audit the foreign companies.\n  But the OCC only suggests that companies adopt these safeguards. The \nlegislation we are introducing today would take safeguards like the \nOCC's a step further, and make them mandatory.\n  Now is the time to act. We know that there are criminal syndicates, \nsuch as in Nigeria, that have fraudulently obtained bank information to \nsteal untold fortunes. We can hardly imagine the damage such \norganizations can do with a vast new source of sensitive financial data \nfrom international information outsourcing.\n  In short, this bill accomplishes four goals crucial to protecting \nAmericans' sensitive data sent abroad. It requires companies to give \nnotice that they send consumers' sensitive data abroad. It ensures that \nU.S. companies can audit their foreign partners, and impose U.S. \nprivacy standards on them. It establishes a system to ensure that \nforeign and U.S. companies will report security breaches to the U.S. \nGovernment.

Mr. BROWNBACK submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 2400, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2005 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nServices, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable, as follows:\n\n       On page 280, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1068. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN \n                   AMERICANS TO THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) From the inception of our Nation, many African \n     Americans have given their lives in service to this country \n     in order that Americans could enjoy freedom and prosperity.\n       (2) Nowhere is this sacrifice more apparent than in the \n     history of the Armed Forces of the United States, and in the \n     current fight against the threat of terrorism within the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (3) It is important to recognize the extraordinary \n     contributions of African American soldiers enlisted in the \n     Armed Forces during the era of segregation, when these brave \n     soldiers fought valiantly to ensure freedom and democracy for \n     Americans that they were not, in many instances, able to \n     enjoy.\n       (4) In September 1945, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson \n     appointed a board of 3 general officers, which became known \n     as the Gillem Board, to investigate the policy of the United \n     States Army with respect to African Americans and to prepare \n     a new policy that would provide for the efficient use of \n     African Americans in the Army.\n       (5) The April 1946 Gillem Board report, titled \n     ``Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Postwar Army Policy,'' \n     concluded that the future policy of the Army should be to \n     ``eliminate, at the earliest practicable moment, any special \n     consideration based on race.''\n       (6) On October 29, 1947, the President's Committee on Civil \n     Rights issued a landmark report titled ``To Secure These \n     Rights'', which condemned segregation, in particular \n     segregation in the Armed Forces. The report recommended \n     legislation and administrative action ``to end immediately \n     all discrimination and segregation based on race, color, \n     creed or national origin in . . . all branches of the Armed \n     Services.''\n       (7) On July 26, 1948, President Truman signed Executive \n     Order 9981, which stated that ``there shall be equality of \n     treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed \n     services without regard to race, color, religion, or national \n     origin.'' The order also established the President's \n     Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the \n     Armed Services, which included two African American members \n     among its initial members.\n       (8) On April 1, 1949, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson \n     issued a directive to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and \n     Air Force that stated that it was the policy of the \n     Department of Defense that there should be equality of \n     treatment and opportunity for all in the armed services, and \n     that ``qualified Negro personnel shall be assigned to fill \n     any type of position . . . without regard to race.''\n       (9) On May 11, 1949, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson \n     approved the integration plans of the Air Force, but rejected \n     those of the Army and the Navy.\n       (10) On June 7, 1949, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson \n     accepted a revised Navy integration plan.\n       (11) On March 13, 1950, the Army agreed to abolish its 10 \n     percent recruitment quota for African Americans.\n       (12) On March 18, 1951, The Department of Defense announced \n     that all basic training within the United States had been \n     integrated.\n       (13) In October 1953, the Army announced that 95 percent of \n     African American soldiers in the Army were serving in \n     integrated units.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--\n       (1) to apologize for the racial segregation that was \n     enforced by the United States Government upon African \n     American soldiers who defended the United States prior to the \n     desegregation of the Armed Forces;\n       (2) that the United States has been richly blessed by the \n     contributions and sacrifices of African Americans;\n       (3) that the African Americans who served in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States were heroes who were willing to \n     see beyond their own oppression and envision a future society \n     that would be fully inclusive of all citizens, regardless of \n     their race; and\n       (4) because of the sacrifices of these heroes, our Nation \n     has prospered and grown into a symbol of freedom emulated by \n     countries around the world.\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\n       (c) Claims Not Authorized.--This section shall not be \n     construed to authorize any claim against the United States \n     and shall not be construed as a settlement of any claim \n     against the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3233.

Res. 366) supporting May 2004 as National \n     Better Hearing and Speech Month, and commending those States \n     that have implemented routine hearing screenings for every \n     newborn before the newborn leaves the hospital.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, every day, more than 1.2 million children \nwill struggle to hear their teacher's voice. Every day, more than 26 \nmillion adults will miss important pieces of conversations. Every day, \nmore than 10 million older Americans will consider early retirement in \nthe face of hearing loss.\n  Mr. President, hearing is not an accessory, but a necessity--a \nnecessity to success in school, business, and life.\n  In recognition of the importance of hearing, I have introduced this \nresolution.\n  This resolution recognizes May as ``National Better Hearing and \nSpeech Month,'' and transforms its ideals into action by encouraging \nall Americans to have their hearing checked regularly and to seek \ntreatment for hearing loss.\n  Despite the necessity of hearing to success, one third of all \nnewborns leave the hospital without having their hearing tested. As a \nresult, thirty-three babies are born each day with hearing loss, making \ndeafness the most common birth defect in America.\n  Mr. President, it doesn't have to be like this. Study after study has \nshown that through regular testing and early treatment, hearing loss \ncan be prevented not only in infants, but in adults as well.\n  This resolution can take the first step in preventing hearing loss. \nEarly prevention and treatment is the key to preventing future hearing \nloss, but we must also care for the 28 million Americans currently \nsuffering from deafness.\n  Today, 95 percent of individuals with hearing loss can be \nsuccessfully treated with hearing aids. However, only 22 percent of \ndeaf Americans can afford to use this remarkable technology. In other \nwords, over 21 million Americans will be denied the sensation of sound \nbecause they cannot afford a remedy. For this reason, I introduced the \nHearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act or S. 2055.\n  S. 2055 provides financial assistance for those who need it most, our \nelderly and young. Under this legislation, minors and seniors can take \na tax credit of up to $500, once every 5 years, toward the purchase of \nany hearing device that is considered a ``qualified hearing aid'' under \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n  Hearing aids are not just portals to sound, but portals to success--\nsuccess in school, business, and life. With your support 1.2 million \nchildren will hear their teacher's voice for the first time as they \nlearn to read and write. With your support, ten million older Americans \nwill be able to hear their grandchildren's voices and continue working \ndespite age-related hearing loss. With your support, we can give \nmillions the gift of sound.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that statements relating to the measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life of a very \ndear friend who passed away on March 24 of this year. Millie Jeffrey is \nan icon in the State of Michigan and in our country for civil rights, \nwomen's rights, and worker's rights. Her life has epitomized the \nprinciples by which we all strive to live our lives--justice, equality, \nand compassion.\n  Although small in stature, Millie has been a giant among all of us \nwho have known her. Words cannot express the depth of affection and \nrespect in which Millie is held, nor can words quantify the lives that \nshe has touched.\n  Mildred McWilliams Jeffrey, social justice activist, retired UAW \nDirector of the Consumer Affairs Department and a Governor Emerita of \nWayne State University, died peacefully surrounded by her family early \nthis morning in the Metro Detroit area. She was 93. In 2000, President \nWilliam Clinton awarded here the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian \naward bestowed by the United States government.\n  In seeking world peace by ensuring equality for all, Millie spent a \nlifetime working on labor, civil rights, education, health care, youth \nemployment, and recreation issues. She brought inspiration and humor to \nthe many people she touched--and did so with optimism and undaunted \nspirit.\n  Millie's list of accomplishments and awards is long but what she is \nmost remembered for is her zest for organizing. She mentored legions of \nwomen and men in the labor, civil rights, women's rights, and peace \nmovements. As President Clinton noted: ``Her impact will be felt for \ngenerations, and her example never forgotten.''\n  Born in Alton, IA, on December 29, 1910, Millie was the oldest of \nseven children. She graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1932 \nwith a bachelor's degree in psychology and received a master's degree \nin social economy and social research in 1934 from Bryn Mawr College. \nIn graduate school, she realized that to improve the lives of working \nwomen and men she would have to change the system. In the 1930s, that \nmeant joining the labor movement.\n  Millie became an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of \nAmerica in Philadelphia and then Educational Director of the \nPennsylvania Joint Board of Shirt Workers. In 1936, she married fellow \nAmalgamated organizer Homer Newman Jeffrey, and they traveled \nthroughout the South and East organizing textile workers. During World \nWar II, the Jeffreys worked in Washington, DC, as consultants to the \nWar Labor Board, where they became close friends with Walter, Victor, \nand Roy Reuther.\n  Mildred and Newman Jeffrey moved to Detroit in 1944 when victor \nReuther offered Millie a job as director of the newly formed UAW \nWomen's Bureau. Millie's commitment to equal rights fueled here career \nat the UAW. She organized the first UAW women's conference in response \nto the massive postwar layoffs of women production workers replaced by \nreturning veterans. From 1949 until 1954, Millie ran the union's radio \nstation. She moved on to direct the Community Relations Departments. \nShe was director of the Consumer Affairs Department from 1968 until her \nretirement in 1976.\n  Millie joined the NAACP in the 1940s and marched in the South with \nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. Former executive secretary of \nthe Detroit Branch of the NAACP, Arthur Johnson, said that ``in the \ncivil rights movement, she knew how to fight without being \ndisagreeable.''\n  Mildred Jeffrey also was very active in the Democratic Party, \npreferring to work behind the scenes organizing, canvassing, \nconsulting, and fundraising. She was the consummate strategist. Millie \nprovided savvy advice to Democratic officeholders and presidents from \nJFK to Bill Clinton. Senator Edward Kennedy observed, ``whether it was \na worker in a plant, or whether it was a Congressman or Senator or \nPresident, Millie inspired people.''\n  As a founding member and chair of the National Women's Political \nCaucus, Millie supported female candidates for public office. Twenty \nyears ago she led the effort to nominate Geraldine Ferraro as Walter \nMondale's running mate. Most recently, Millie delighted in being \nrepresented by Michigan women she supported, Governor Jennifer \nGranholm, and myself. Millie is the ``political godmother'' for many of \nus, and we are extremely grateful for her love and support. Millie was \none of the most important mentors in my life and I will always be very, \nvery grateful to her.\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\n  Millie ran for public office in 1974 and was elected by the people of \nthe State of Michigan to the Wayne State University Board of Governors, \nan office she held for 16 years--1974-1990. She was so proud of her \nrole in supporting this wonderful university. She served three terms as \nboard chair. Millie loved Wayne State University and was a long-time \nresident on campus. She never tired of showing visitors around her \n``neighborhood''--the Adamany Undergraduate Library, the Hilberry \nTheatre, and the Walter P. Reuther Library. Millie thrived in the \nacademic environment enriched by Wayne State University students.\n  Her friendships extended worldwide across all ages and nationalities. \nWhether discussing math with teenagers in Wayne State's Math Corps, or \nstrategizing at the UN Conference on Women about the plight of \nsweatshop workers, Millie's capacity for connecting with people was \nunmatched.\n\n  Millie's capacity for connecting with people was unmatched. As one \nwho traveled with her to the Fourth World Conference on Women in \nBeijing, it was amazing to see people from all over the world, hearing \nwe were from Michigan, asking if we knew Millie Jeffrey and if we could \ntell them where she was; or that their grandmother, their aunt, \nsuggested they meet Millie Jeffrey.\n  I often said the way to world peace was to let Millie loose; sooner \nor later, we would all know Millie Jeffrey and come to understand each \nother.\n  Millie was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame and was an \noriginal board member of the Michigan Women's Foundation. She served in \nvarious leadership roles in a wide variety of national and State \norganizations such as the Michigan Women's Political Caucus, the \nCoalition for Labor Union Women, Americans for Democratic Action, \nNational Abortion Rights Action League, Voters for Choice, EMILY's \nList, and the American Civil Liberties Union. She served on the peer \nreview board of Blue Cross and was an active member of the First \nUnitarian Universalist Church in Detroit.\n  She was also an adoring mother of a son and a daughter and adoring \ngrandmother who developed and nourished creativity and curiosity in her \ntwo grandchildren who she loved dearly, Erica Jeffrey and Thomas \nJeffrey. She encouraged Erica's love of ballet. She urged Thomas to \ntravel to learn about the world and was so proud of his AmeriCorps \nService.\n  All of these lists of awards, duties, responsibilities, and \ncommittees do not say what Millie is all about: Millie Jeffrey was a \none-of-a-kind woman of great passion, of great commitment, of great \ninterest in knowing about each one of us and what we were doing and \nwhat we cared and how she could help.\n  Yesterday, 250 people came to Washington, DC, from all over the \ncountry to remember Millie and to share how Millie had touched their \nlives. Millie's life was celebrated and honored by her family and \nfriends through photos, speech and song. Many of her friends gave \nheartwarming accounts on how she helped them as well as our country. As \nthe memorial service concluded, one thing became very clear. Millie is \nno longer with us, but she will be with us forever because her spirit \nwill continue in all of us.\n  I thank my colleagues for the support of this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n   Mr. LEVIN. Today, Mr. President, I join Senator Stabenow in \nintroducing a resolution to celebrate and to honor the life of an \nextraordinary American woman, Mildred Jeffrey. Millie Jeffrey was a \nshining star in the firmament of our State and Nation. Her legendary \ncourage and her incredible tenacity were an inspiration to all who came \nwithin her orbit.\n   Throughout her life, Millie fought tenaciously to advance civil \nrights and break down the racial barriers that divide us. She fought \nfor workers' rights, making sure that the people who make up the \nbackbone of our business and industry are given a voice and afforded \nfair treatment. She was a pioneer for women's rights, opening doors and \nproviding opportunities for women that were merely a dream for women \nbefore her. We can all say that our world is more just and more humane \nbecause of Millie.\n   We couldn't begin to count all of the people she assisted, all of \nthe careers she helped launch, and all of the walls she broke down. She \nwas a major force in the election of Michigan's first female Senator \nand first female governor; how wonderful it is that she lived to see \nboth Senator Debbie Stabenow and Governor Jennifer Granholm take \noffice.\n   It is a mystery how her larger-than-life passion, energy, \nenthusiasm, and kindness fit into such a tiny frame. Every person who \never met with her or talked with her or felt her spirit was left with a \ndeep sense of awe and respect for her extraordinarily good nature and \nher commitment to good deeds. It is a badge of honor to be able to say \n``I knew Millie Jeffrey.''\n   Millie famously said that she would retire only when she died, and \nshe certainly lived up to that promise, working and fighting until the \nvery end. We all wish her retirement could have been later, but her \nlegacy and her inspiration will be a major presence in Michigan and the \nNation forever.\n   I know all of my colleagues will join me in celebrating her life and \nhonoring her memory.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the measure be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 367) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 367\n\n       Whereas Mildred McWilliams ``Millie'' Jeffrey, a social \n     justice activist, a retired UAW Director of the Consumer \n     Affairs Department, and a Governor Emerita of Wayne State \n     University, died peacefully surrounded by her family on March \n     24, 2004, in the Metro Detroit, Michigan area at the age of \n     93;\n        Whereas in 2000, President Clinton awarded Millie the \n     Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award bestowed by the \n     United States Government;\n       Whereas in seeking world peace by ensuring equality for \n     all, Millie spent a lifetime working on labor, civil rights, \n     education, health care, youth employment, and recreation \n     issues;\n       Whereas Millie brought inspiration and humor to the many \n     people she touched and did so with optimism and undaunted \n     spirit;\n       Whereas Millie, a woman of influence and of great moral \n     character, was always a voice of conscience and reason;\n       Whereas Millie provided a voice for those that could not be \n     heard and hope for those that no longer believed, and because \n     of this her legacy will continue to live on for generations \n     to come;\n        Whereas Millie's list of accomplishments and awards is \n     long but what she is most remembered for is her zest for \n     organizing, including mentoring legions of women and men in \n     the labor, civil rights, women's rights, and peace movements;\n        Whereas President Clinton stated that ``her impact will be \n     felt for generations, and her example never forgotten'';\n        Whereas Millie was born in Alton, Iowa on December 29, \n     1910, and was the oldest of 7 children;\n       Whereas in 1932 Millie graduated from the University of \n     Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in psychology and in 1934 \n     Millie received a master's degree in social economy and \n     social research from Bryn Mawr College;\n        Whereas Millie became an organizer for the Amalgamated \n     Clothing Workers of America in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, \n     and later became Educational Director of the Pennsylvania \n     Joint Board of Shirt Workers;\n       Whereas in 1936, Millie married fellow Amalgamated Clothing \n     Workers of America organizer Homer Newman Jeffrey, and they \n     traveled throughout the South and East organizing textile \n     workers;\n        Whereas during World War II, the Jeffreys worked in \n     Washington, D.C., as consultants to the War Labor Board, \n     where they became close friends with Walter, Victor, and Roy \n     Reuther;\n        Whereas the Jeffreys moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1944 \n     when Victor Reuther offered Millie a job as director of the \n     newly formed UAW Women's Bureau;\n        Whereas Millie's commitment to equal rights fueled her \n     career at the UAW;\n        Whereas Millie organized the first UAW women's conference \n     in response to the massive postwar layoffs of women \n     production workers, who were replaced by returning veterans;\n        Whereas from 1949 until 1954, Millie ran the UAW's radio \n     station;\n        Whereas Millie moved on to direct the Community Relations \n     Department of the UAW;\n        Whereas Millie served as Director of the Consumer Affairs \n     Department of the UAW from 1968 until her retirement in 1976;\n        Whereas Millie joined the NAACP in the 1940s and marched \n     in the South with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s;\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\n        Whereas Former Executive Secretary of the Detroit Branch \n     of the NAACP, Arthur Johnson, said that ``in the civil rights \n     movement, she knew how to fight without being disagreeable'';\n        Whereas Millie ran for public office in 1974 and was \n     elected by the people of Michigan to the Wayne State \n     University Board of Governors, an office she held for 16 \n     years (1974-1990);\n        Whereas Millie served 3 terms as chair of the Wayne State \n     University Board of Governors;\n        Whereas Millie loved Wayne State University and was a \n     long-time resident on campus;\n        Whereas Millie never tired of showing visitors around her \n     ``neighborhood''--the Adamany Undergraduate Library, the \n     Hilberry Theatre, and the Walter P.
