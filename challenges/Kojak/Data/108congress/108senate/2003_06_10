Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. Under the order from last \nnight, Senator Dorgan's amendment regarding hydrogen fuel cells will be \ndebated under a 30-minute time limit. A vote will occur in relation to \nthat amendment at sometime this morning before the recess for the \npolicy luncheons. The Senate will recess for the policy meetings from \n12:30 to 2:15 today. Other Energy amendments will be debated during \ntoday's session, and therefore Senators can expect votes throughout the \nday.\n  Again, I will state that each day we continue to work towards a \nfiling deadline or a list of amendments to the Energy bill. I will be \nconsulting with the Democratic leadership to see when we might lock in \na list of amendments to this bill. I am very hopeful we can do that as \nsoon as possible. It is also our hope to reach a consent agreement to \nallow the Senate to consider the Burma sanctions bill introduced by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, the majority whip. He will want to \nspeak on this issue shortly. We will continue to press for a consent \nagreement on this measure.\n  At this juncture, I will withhold a few of the comments I want to \nmake on an issue we will be addressing in 2 weeks on Medicare and \nstrengthening Medicare, but at this juncture I will yield to the \nassistant minority leader for comments and then the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, responding to the majority leader, we are \nhotlining later today a time tomorrow people would have to give us a \nlist of their amendments, that we would have a finite list. As I \nindicated, Senator McConnell and I and the two managers of the bill \nwould immediately begin working through that to see what we can do to \nexpedite passage of the Energy bill. We are on track to do that \nsometime tomorrow. We have the ranking member of the Finance Committee \nhere today to deal with the matter about which Senator McConnell is \ngoing to shortly make a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7561-6", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7561-S7562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 182\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will take very little time.\n  To underscore where we are on the Burma sanctions issue, I tried to \nget this bill cleared for this morning for an hour equally divided and \na rollcall vote, but there was an objection on the other side with the \nsuggestion that we modify the bill to have the sanctions end in 1 year. \nOf course, that is exactly the wrong message to send to the military \njunta in Burma. That is not acceptable to this side.\n  The Washington Post, in this morning's editorial, gets it right by \nsaying: Senators supportive of democracy in Burma should vote for the \nbill without condition for expiration dates. That is the way the bill \nought to pass. That is the way the bill was introduced. That is the way \nI hope we will be able to reach consent to take it up in the near \nfuture.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee be discharged from further action of S. 182, the Burma \nsanctions legislation; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; further that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided \nin the usual form and that no\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\namendments be in order; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the \nbill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the measure, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is \nobviously a very important matter, and we should address this in a very \ncareful and appropriate way. I might say to Senators, this matter has \nnot been referred to the Senate Finance Committee. The committee has \njurisdiction on it. Rather, it is coming straight to the floor with a \nrequest that there be no amendments, which I think is a little bit \nbizarre.\n  I might also point out that in other sanctions areas, for example, \nChina, we had a long, deep, involved debate a few years ago and agreed \nto how we should address sanctions, particularly trade sanctions \nagainst China.\n  I might also inform Senators, I have been in consultation with the \nchairman of the Finance Committee who agrees with me that it would be \ninappropriate to proceed at this time, certainly in the manner \nsuggested by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I might ask the Senator if he will agree to modify his request in a \nway I think is much more appropriate, particularly even stronger than \nthe resolution suggested by the Senator. And that would be for similar, \nas was the case with China MFN, annual extensions or annual sanctions, \nbut that the President would suggest that the sanctions be continued \nand that would be the case unless there is a motion of disapproval \npassed by both Houses of Congress. I believe the executive branch \nshould be part of this. This is not just a legislative branch issue. \nWhen it comes to sanctions, clearly the executive branch should play a \nvery important role.\n  I might ask the Senator if he would agree to modify his request in \nthe nature of an annual request. If the President wants to continue, he \ncertainly could make an annual request, and that would be subject to \ndisapproval by both Houses of Congress.\n  Is the Senator agreeable to make that change?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Montana, there is \nalready a sunset provision in the bill. It occurs as soon as democracy \nis restored in Burma. There was a legitimate election there in 1990. \nAung San Suu Kyi and her party won 80 percent of the vote. She has been \nunder house arrest now for 14 years. The sanctions would terminate \nunder the bill that I hope we will pass just as soon as she is allowed \nto take power. Such a provision is already in the bill. I am happy to \ncontinue the discussions with my friend from Montana.\n  The reason the Finance Committee didn't get the bill is because the \nParliamentarian sent it to the Foreign Relations Committee and both the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member \nsupport the bill, as do the majority and minority leaders of the \nSenate.\n  I know the majority leader is waiting to speak on another issue. If I \ncould, I will proceed to try to get this on the calendar. I understand \nS. 1215 is at the desk and is due for its second reading.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I know the \ndeepness of the feelings of the Senator from Kentucky. I want the \nrecord to reflect that this is bipartisan legislation. One of the chief \ncosponsors is the Senator from California. This was not an objection \nmade on the other side; it was an objection made by the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee. I hope this most important \nissue can be resolved along the lines suggested by the ranking member \nand the chairman of the Finance Committee, that this resolution will be \npassed and that each year it would stay in effect until both Houses of \nCongress say it should stay in effect. I think that would be a \nreasonable resolution of this most important issue. I, therefore, \nobject.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHarkin be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I understand that S. 1215 is at the \ndesk and due for its second reading; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to read \nthe title of the measure.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will read the title of the bill for the second time.\n\n       A bill (S. 1215) to sanction the ruling Burmese military \n     junta, to strengthen Burma's democratic forces and support \n     and recognize the National League of Democracy as the \n     legitimate representative of the Burmese people, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask that the Senate proceed to the measure and \nobject to further proceeding.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The item will be \nplaced on the calendar under rule XIV.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this measure has broad bipartisan \nsupport. It was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee, not the \nFinance Committee. Both the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand the ranking member support this measure, as do the majority and \nminority leaders of the Senate.\n  It is time to act. Aung San Suu Kyi, we hope, is still alive. There \nis some urgency about this. This is an unusual situation. The U.S. \nneeds to send a message about this now and lead the rest of the world \ninto a policy of multilateral sanctions that truly squeeze this regime. \nI hope we can continue our discussion and get this bill up for a vote \nno later than sometime today.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on Medicare \nand the importance of strengthening and improving Medicare. We are \naddressing this in the Finance Committee currently and will have it on \nthe floor of the Senate. I want to take this opportunity first to \ncomment on the exchange that we heard on the floor.\n  As my friend and distinguished colleague from Kentucky stated, both \nthe majority leader and the minority leader are sponsors and strongly \nsupport the legislation on Burma. Burma's brutal military regime is \nperpetrating a wave of crackdowns, including incarcerating the Nobel \nPrize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi. That is why there is this sense of \nimmediacy and why we feel very strongly that this bill should be \naddressed on the floor of the Senate. I am very hopeful, in spite of \nthe reaction to the unanimous consent request we just heard on the \nfloor, that over the course of the morning we can work out what is \nnecessary to bring this legislation to the floor and have a vote on it \ntoday.\n  I do join my colleagues in supporting this and the Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act of 2003, introduced by Senator McConnell and \ncosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators \nFeinstein, McCain, Leahy, Specter, Kennedy, Mikulski, Kyl, Daschle, and \nmany others who will be added over the course of the morning.\n  The legislation, importantly, among other things, would impose a U.S. \nimport ban on goods manufactured in Burma and those made by what is \ncalled the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, and companies \nthat are owned by the SPDC. It would also freeze the assets of the \nregime itself that are held in the U.S. and require the U.S. to oppose \nand vote against loans or other assistance proposed for Burma by \ninternational financial institutions.\n\n  Why? Because the situation in Burma indeed is severe. After what \napparently was an assassination attempt of Aung San Suu Kyi, who won a \nlandslide victory in Burma's last election, authorities now hold, as we \nall know, this duly elected leader and numerous other activists--we \ndon't know exactly how many--incommunicado. Reports indicate that Suu \nKyi is being held in a military camp about 40 kilometers outside of \nRangoon. It is believed that she does suffer from some injuries and \nlacerations of her face and an injured\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\nshoulder. This is all current news. Again, there is a sense of urgency \nfor us as a government to act and demonstrate our focus on this issue.\n  Meanwhile, it is reported that the military regime has raided the \noffices of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for \nDemocracy, tearing down party flags and padlocking doors all across the \ncountry. Reportedly, military intelligence agents are posted outside \nthe offices, preventing any entry at the offices in Rangoon and \nMandalay. The regime has placed numerous democracy movement leaders \nunder house arrest, surrounding their homes and severing telephone \nlines. I mention this again to explain why we are attempting to bring \nthis legislation directly to the floor.\n  I commend my colleagues for their efforts on behalf of the Burmese \npeople. As the strongest and most free nation in the world, I do \nbelieve we have a profound duty to support that struggle for freedom. \nAgain, I am hopeful that we can address it this morning and over the \ncourse of the day.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor of this resolution on Burma with my friend from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7563-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to comment on \nwhat is taking place today in the release of some initial working \ndocuments on Medicare modernization by members of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Prefacing that, I will say that we have a lot of work to do over the \nnext 3 weeks in order to address an issue that is important to every \nsingle American, and that is giving our seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities health care security.\n  Today there are about 35 million seniors on Medicare and about 5 \nmillion individuals with disabilities. We are also speaking to and \nacting for those soon-to-be seniors in future generations.\n  I commend my colleagues who have done yeoman's work--Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley--and for their commitment to advancing Medicare \nmodernization, strengthening and moving Medicare down the field so we \ncan deliver that health care security to our seniors. The goal is \ntwofold: to strengthen and improve Medicare and, at the same time, \nprovide meaningful prescription drug benefits to seniors and Americans \nwith disabilities.\n  I recognize it is a huge challenge to address this very complex \nprogram but it is one that I know this body is up to, one we have been \nworking very hard on for years, and it is one that I believe we can \naccomplish in the next 3 weeks in the Senate.\n  There were a couple of concerns raised in the last several days that \nI briefly want to mention. First, where are we and why act now? Why can \nwe not wait and put this off? It is driven very much by the \ndemographics of the aging population, where, over the next 30 years, we \nwill have a doubling in the number of seniors; but in terms of workers \nactually paying into the program itself, that will be falling off \ncontinually over time. Thus, we need to take this opportunity while we \nare adding this prescription drug benefit to modernize the program so \nseniors and individuals with disabilities will continue to get good \ncare and hopefully improve that care in this environment where we have \nto address the issues of solvency and sustainability.\n  The Finance Committee has held over 30 hearings on Medicare over the \npast 4 years, at least 7 devoted to prescription drug coverage alone. \nLast Friday, now 4 days ago, the Finance Committee had another hearing \nto focus very specifically on the proposal put forth by Chairman \nGrassley and Senator Baucus. That was the third committee hearing this \nyear on Medicare.\n  On Thursday of this week, the day after tomorrow, the Finance \nCommittee will meet in executive session to amend and vote on the \nGrassley-Baucus proposal. And then the following week, on that Monday, \nthat bill will be brought to the floor of the Senate and will be \ndebated and likely amended in some shape or form over a 2-week period.\n  We are approaching this issue in a systematic way, in an orderly way, \nin a way that is reasonable, and in a way that is thoughtful.\n  Some concerns people are talking about are that Medicare denies some \nseniors coverage. Let me be clear, we will make sure this coverage is \navailable to every senior everywhere. We will specifically be working \nto ensure access in rural areas. We will be creating public-private \npartnerships that will offer choice--again, it is voluntary--but will \nbe offering choice for all seniors in every corner of America.\n  Secondly, many seniors want the certainty of knowing nothing is going \nto be taken away from them. Seniors might ask: Do I have to give up \nwhat I have now? Are you forcing me into some new system? The answer is \nno. This is a voluntary program. All of us will be able to look every \nsenior in their eyes and say: You can keep exactly what you have now if \nthat is what you want, if that is what you desire. We will be able for \nthe first time to say there are options that include choices you may \nnot have today in Medicare, such as preventive care, such as chronic \ndisease management.\n  The fact is the current program is fragmented. It does not provide \nadequate coverage. I know as a physician and I strongly believe as a \npolicymaker it does not adequately cover preventive care. It does not \ncover disease management or chronic disease management. As we all know, \nit does not cover outpatient prescription drugs. I do believe good \nhealth depends on giving seniors good options, the opportunity to \nchoose the plan that best meets their needs.\n  I have also heard about Medicare reform proposals relating to HMOs, \nforcing people into HMOs. This plan does not do that. Simply, this plan \ndoes not force anybody into an HMO. It is a voluntary proposal. Some \nHMOs have performed very well. But the better comparison, instead of \nlooking at HMOs, is the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. \nSeniors will have the option to get a plan similar to what we have as \nSenators, Members of the House, and other Federal employees have. I \nshould add, this program has a longer history than Medicare. We have \nlearned how to improve it, modify it, and make it a better program over \nthe last 40 years.\n  I close by saying I believe seniors deserve the options that Federal \nemployees have. We know Federal employees are very satisfied with the \nquality of care they receive. Seniors deserve this opportunity to \nchoose. They deserve the opportunity to obtain care that is more \nflexible, that is less bureaucratic, and that has less paperwork.\n  Seniors deserve care that keeps them healthy by incorporating those \npreventive measures. Seniors deserve care that protects them from \ncatastrophic out-of-pocket expenses. America's seniors should have the \nability to see the doctor they choose, even if that doctor is outside \nthe network. America's seniors deserve a system that focuses on their \nneeds to keep them healthy and not just to respond to acute episodic \nillness.\n\n  Since 1965, Medicare has admirably served a generation of America's \nseniors. We owe tomorrow's seniors no less. That will take a response \nin this body to give seniors access to the care they truly deserve. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen and improve \nMedicare over the next few weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7563-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7563-S7564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair, and, Mr. President, I thank my \ncolleagues for their courtesy, particularly Senator Dorgan. I am very \nappreciative.\n  Mr. President, seniors are facing a crisis, and it is caused by the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs. For so many years, Congress has talked \nabout prescription drugs in Medicare.\n  Let me tell you what my seniors say: Talk, talk, talk. They are fed \nup with our talk, and they want us to take action. They tell me: You \ncan't talk yourself out of high cholesterol; you need Lipitor. You \ncan't talk your way out of diabetes; you need insulin.\n  The problem with the Senate, they say, is when all gets said and \ndone, more gets said than gets done. The time for talking is over, and \nwe need to listen to the seniors, to business, and we need to act.\n  I have been in communities all over Maryland, from diners to \nboardrooms, listening to seniors who are desperate, listening to their \nfamilies who want to help their parents and listening to employers in \nboardrooms who really want to help their retirees but are wondering if \nthey can afford to do so.\n  Here is what they tell me: Congress must do something about the \nprescription drug benefit, and they want us to do it now to help our \nseniors, our families, business, and our economy.\n  There are several different plans floating around, and a lot of them \nhave wonderful new language: Medicare Choice, Medicare Advantage, et \ncetera. I am not sure what will happen, but what I know is, we must \nhave a meaningful prescription drug benefit, not just slogans and sound \nbites, not just something out of the Heritage Foundation, not something \nout of a think tank, but something that enables seniors to afford the \nprescription drugs, which they paid for the research to develop.\n  I have five principles for a prescription drug benefit. These \nprinciples are the yardstick by which I am going to measure any \nproposal.\n  First, the cornerstone of any prescription drug benefit must be \nMedicare. It must be in Medicare. It must stay in Medicare. Medicare \nmust be the cornerstone. I am absolutely opposed to the privatization \nof Medicare either overtly or covertly. Let me repeat, I am absolutely \nopposed to the privatization of Medicare.\n  Any prescription drug benefit that has a private insurance component \nto it must be in addition to a Medicare benefit, not in lieu of a \nMedicare benefit. It must keep a traditional Medicare component to it. \nAny private insurance program must be an option, and it must not be \nmandatory.\n  That goes to my second principle: voluntary. No one should be coerced \nor forced into a private program or forced to give up coverage if they \nalready have it.\n  It must be affordable. Benefits must be affordable to business and \naffordable to seniors. That means a definite premium and a reasonable \ncopayment.\n  It must be accessible, available to all seniors regardless of where \nthey live, and it must be portable so they can take it with them if \nthey visit their grandchildren in another State.\n  It must be meaningful and genuine. It must cover the drugs that \ndoctors say they need, not what insurance executive gatekeepers say \nthey are willing to give them.\n  Let's talk about the meaningful benefit. Congress cannot leave this \nup to the insurance companies.\n  We have been down that road in Maryland, and it was a rocky road, not \nonly filled with potholes but with landmines. We had something called \nMedicare+Choice that turned out to be nothing more than a racket for \nseniors to be gouged and abandoned in my own State. I am not going to \nsupport any more rackets or gimmicks under the illusion of being able \nto help our seniors. Insurance companies came in. Seniors were going to \nhave choice. They ended up with no choice and no coverage. The \ncompanies came in. They took the money from our seniors. Then they \nsaid, oh, it is too expensive to do this, and they left town. They left \nover 100,000 Maryland seniors without coverage. We are not going to go \nthat way.\n  So I do not trust the insurance companies to be there for the \nseniors. Getting rid of Medicare by forcing them into this is not going \nto be the way we go. Medicare is the answer. Medicare is not the \nproblem.\n  I believe honor thy mother and father is not just a good commandment \nto live by, it is good public policy to govern by. That is why I feel \nso strongly about Medicare. Congress created Medicare to provide a \nsafety net for seniors. In 1965, seniors' biggest fear was the cost of \nhospital care. One heart attack could put a family into bankruptcy. \nThat is what Medicare Part A is all about. Then Congress added Medicare \nPart B to help seniors pay for doctor visits, an important step to keep \nseniors healthy and financially secure.\n  New advances in medicine mean seniors are living longer. New \ntreatments and therapies such as prescription drugs prolong life and \nmaintain quality of life. These costs were not envisioned in 1965.\n  So as we look at this problem, we need to know that Medicare has \nserved the Nation well. Now we know it is time to expand it to a \nprescription drug benefit. We have covered hospitalization. We have \ncovered doctor visits. Yet because of the advances in medical science \nin this country, prescription drugs and medical devices save lives and \nhelp manage chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and \ndiabetes. This is what we need to be focusing on. Let's focus on the \nAmerican people for a change and not on the so-called hollow \nopportunities of structural reform. It is a problem for middle class \nfamilies. Families worry about their jobs and the weak economy. They do \nnot know how they are going to take care of their children and their \nelderly parents.\n  American businesses are wondering about things such as legacy costs, \nand small business is wondering how they can afford health insurance as \nwell. A lot of companies want to do the right thing for their employees \nand retirees. They want to offer comprehensive health care benefits, \nbut they are struggling under the cost. That is why I fought for tax \nincentives for small businesses to provide health coverage for their \nemployees. But those who supported the tax bill care more about special \nbreaks for Joe Billionaire than about basic health care for families.\n  Our businesses do not get any help, but their competitors sure do. \nThe playing field is not level. When competitors in other countries do \nnot have to pay for prescription drug coverage because they have a \nnational health care system, in my own State of Maryland this means \npeople are losing jobs in the automobile industry and the steel \nindustry. That is why I fought for tax incentives for small businesses \nto provide health coverage for their employees, but those who \nsupported the tax bill care more about special breaks for Joe \nBillionaire than about basic health care for families.\n\n  We have to get real, and the first place we have to get real is to \nhave a real prescription drug benefit. The Nation cannot afford to do \nnothing. Prescription drugs are lifelines to millions of Americans. \nThey enable seniors to prevent and manage disease. Without access to \nmedication, seniors are going to end up with trips to the hospital, \nlonger hospital stays, more visits to emergency rooms.\n  All the great research done at NIH is meaningless if people cannot \nafford the cures. It is time to make prescription drug coverage a \nnational priority so we can help our seniors, families, American \nbusiness, and our economy.\n  When we stand up for America, we stand up for what America stands \nfor, which is a safety net for our seniors and really helping our \nfamilies be able to help themselves.\n  By passing a real prescription drug benefit, Congress will deliver \nreal security to America's seniors. Retirement security means more \npension security. Seniors need healthcare security to be at ease in \ntheir retirements. In today's world, we cannot have healthcare security \nwithout prescription drug coverage. Congress must keep this promise to \nAmerica's seniors.\n  I now yield the floor, but if they come in with some more gimmicks, I \nwill not yield the floor in this debate.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7565-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 14, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 14) to enhance the energy security of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Campbell/Domenici amendment No. 864, to replace ``tribal \n     consortia'' with ``tribal energy resource development \n     organizations''.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 865, to require that the hydrogen \n     commercialization plan of the Department of Energy include a \n     description of activities to support certain hydrogen \n     technology deployment goals.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes equally divided for debate in relationship to the Dorgan \namendment No. 865.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 865\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is an \namendment we will vote on this morning. I was disappointed yesterday to \ndiscover that there was opposition to the amendment. This is an \namendment that passed without opposition in the last Congress. So \nsurprisingly now I am discovering that some have changed their mind.\n  I will describe why, if this Congress has any gumption at all to \ndecide that we ought to change course and move in a new direction and \nbe bold and big when we think about our energy future, they will \nsupport this amendment.\n  President Bush said the following about our dependence on foreign oil \nin his State of the Union Address: America's energy security is \nthreatened by our dependence on foreign oil. He said: We import 55 \npercent of the oil we consume. That is expected to grow to 68 percent \nby 2025. Nearly all of our cars and trucks run on gasoline. They are \nthe main reason America imports so much oil--that, from President \nBush--two-thirds of the 20 million barrels of oil we use each day for \ntransportation.\n  Fuel cell vehicles offer the best hope of reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil. The President said that because he was proposing a new \ndirection for America's energy supply: Hydrogen and fuel cells.\n  Following his State of the Union Address in which he proposed that, \nhe had a gathering at the Building Museum in Washington, DC. He invited \nall of the industry leaders throughout the country to come. He gave a \ngreat speech. I was there with my colleague Senator Domenici. We were \ninvited to be a part of it. He talked again about striking out in this \nnew direction and talked about developing hydrogen and fuel cells as \npart of our future. That made sense to me.\n  I have spoken often of the first old car I had when I was a young \nkid. I bought a Model T Ford and restored it as an old antique. The way \nyou gas up this 1924 Model T Ford is you pull up to a pump, stick a \nhose in the tank, and pump it full of gas. And what do you do with a \n2003 Ford? Exactly the same thing. Nothing has changed in almost a \ncentury. We are still running gasoline through those carburetors.\n  What the President says--and I agree with him--is let's decide to \nchange that and reduce our dependence on foreign oil because that is \nwhere the growth in energy use is coming; that is, on America's roads \nand America's vehicles. Do we want to be at a point where we have over \none-half of our oil coming from off our shores, much of it from very \ntroubled parts of the world? Do we want to be at the point where we \nhave 68 percent of it coming from other parts of the world, where if, \nGod forbid, some morning we woke up and discovered terrorists had \ninterrupted the supply of oil and this American economy would be flat \non its back? Is that how what we want to be held hostage? I do not \nthink so.\n  So the President says let's strike out in a new direction. He \nproposed $1.2 billion on a hydrogen program. It is exactly the right \nthing to do. I commend him for it. But $1.2 billion is timid; it is not \nenough. Nonetheless, it is moving in the right direction, and for this \nAmerican President to put his administration on the line to move in \nthat direction is not insignificant at all; it is very significant.\n  I have pushed and pushed, and now this Energy bill has almost tripled \nthe amount the President recommended for a new hydrogen-based economy \nand fuel cell future.\n\n  I proposed $6.5 billion over 5 years, an Apollo-type program. \nPresident Kennedy said: Let's put a man on the Moon by the end of the \ndecade. He set a goal. And we did. I said: Let's have an Apollo \nprogram, decide we are going to move toward a hydrogen fuel cell future \nfor our vehicles.\n  Do my colleagues know that a vehicle is twice as efficient using a \nfuel cell as it is using gasoline through a carburetor? It is double \nthe efficiency getting power to the wheel. And what do you get out the \nback end of a vehicle that uses hydrogen in a fuel cell? Water vapor. \nYou are not driving around town belching black smoke. You get water \nvapor. It is good for the environment, good for this country's energy \nsecurity, and good for this country's economy. The fact is, this is \nmoving in exactly the right direction. So I commend President Bush.\n  We also made progress in the Energy Committee, saying let's increase \nthat which the President recommended, but it is still short of where we \nought to be, No. 1. No. 2, it does not include targets and timetables. \nI do not suggest they be mandatory, but I do say this: Let's decide \nwhere we are headed, and when we give the Department of Energy and \nothers $3 billion plus, let's say here is where we would like to go, \nhere is our destination, here is our map. I say let's aspire to have \n100,000 vehicles on the road in the year 2010 that are hydrogen-powered \nfuel cell vehicles and 2\\1/2\\ million vehicles by 2020.\n  My colleague yesterday said, well, we think maybe it is a mandate. I \nsaid, no, it is not a mandate at all. Just ask the Department of Energy \nto develop a strategy that says here is what we would like to do. We \ncannot force that to happen, but at least a goal is established.\n  Japan has goals and strategies with respect to hydrogen and fuel \ncells. They are moving very quickly. Europe is moving very quickly. \nJapan wants 50,000 by 2010 and 5 million vehicles by 2020. General \nMotors has a goal of having 1 million vehicles by 2010--Ford, Nissan, \nDaimlerChrysler. The fact is, the industry is moving very quickly as \nwell.\n  I just do not happen to think we ought to throw a bunch of money at \nEnergy and say: Do what you can with it and report back. I guarantee, \nif $3 billion or $3.5 billion is put into a bureaucratic envelope and \nsent down to an agency and they are told to report to us when they have \nhalf a notion and tell us what they have done, we are not going to make \nmuch progress.\n  What I believe this Congress ought to do is say: Here is what we \naspire to achieve. This is a big, bold plan, and we want to make \nprogress. We would like by the year 2010 on the streets in this country \n100,000 automobiles that are powered by hydrogen and use fuel cells. We \nwould like 2\\1/2\\ million by the year 2020.\n  Why do I say we need some targets and timetables? Because this is not \neasy to do. This is not something that one company can do or one \nindustry can do. This requires a combination of private sector \ninvestment and initiative, and it requires public policy that \naccommodates this conversion.\n  First of all, we have to deal in a whole range of areas. How do you \nproduce hydrogen? Hydrogen is everywhere. It comes from everything. It \ncan come from natural gas, from coal, you can take hydrogen from water. \nYou can use a wind turbine and produce electricity from the air and use \nthat electricity to separate oxygen and hydrogen in water, store the \nhydrogen, use it in a fuel cell, and double the efficiency of how you \npower an automobile and have water vapor coming out of the tail pipe of \nthe automobile. How wonderful this country's future. But it will not \nhappen unless the Congress and the President decide we are going to \nmove to a different future.\n  The first antique car I bought and restored when I was a kid was 75 \nyears old. I put gas in it the same way I put gas in a car today. It is \nnever going to\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\nchange unless in public policy we accommodate the private sector's \ninvestment and the initiative that comes from both the private sector \nand public policy, to say here is where our country aspires to be. Here \nis where we want our country to move with respect to an energy bill.\n  There is a lot to this Energy Bill. Any energy bill worth anything, \nin my judgment, has to incentivize additional production. It has to \nprovide for significant amounts of conservation because we are wasting \na great deal of energy. It has to provide for new efficiencies with \nrespect to all the appliances we use. Most importantly, in my judgment, \nthe fourth title of an energy bill has to be limitless renewable \nsources of energy. Yes, that is ethanol, which we debated last week; it \nis biodiesel; but most importantly, it is trying to move toward a new \nenergy future with respect to our vehicle fleet. That is hydrogen and \nfuel cells.\n  I am not talking during this conversation about stationary engines, \nalthough that is another application for fuel cells, and we have fuel \ncells that are deployed and being used in this country. We also have \nfuel cells and vehicles using hydrogen. I have driven one. We have had \na fuel cell vehicle drive from California to New York. It is not as if \nthis technology does not exist. It does. Like all other new \ntechnologies, it is originally very expensive. As the research and \ndevelopment into the new models and prototypes are done, it is very \nexpensive. But those costs come down, down, way down, as our country \nembraces the notion that we want a different future for our vehicle \nfleet; we want a hydrogen fuel cell future that relieves this country \nof being held hostage by sources of oil that come from out of our \ncountry.\n  If we just think for a moment about that, this American economy is \nthe strongest economic engine in the entire world by far. There is \nnothing close to it. Yet some catastrophic event could happen that \ncould shut off this supply of oil to this country because over half of \nit comes from outside of our shores. Something could happen to shut off \nthe supply and this economy would grind to a halt. It would be flat on \nits back. And everybody knows it. When it happens, if it happens, and \nGod forbid it happens, but if it happens everyone will say, We told you \nso. That is why this President wants to move to a different path, go to \na different place, to embrace hydrogen and fuel cells, and has stated \nso in a State of the Union Address. He is dead right. We have to do \nthat.\n  I don't understand why establishing an aspired-to target and \ntimetables engenders opposition. A year and a half ago when I offered \nthis amendment it was accepted by voice vote. I have no idea why all of \na sudden some people say, this is radical. What a bunch of nonsense. \nRadical? Yesterday, I was told, what we are talking about are wild \nguesses: 100,000 vehicles by 2010, 2.5 million by 2020. Do you think \nGeneral Motors has an aspiration of putting 1 million cars on the road \nby producing 1 million fuel cell cars by 2010? Do you think they go to \nthe board of directors and say, We have a wild guess to talk to you \nabout. These are not wild guesses. This is public policy, from our \nstandpoint, of stating our goals.\n\n  I find it fascinating; although this is not a mandate at all, it is \ntrying to establish some benchmarks. Instead of just giving money to \nbureaucrats or a Federal agency and saying report back when you get \nhalf a notion and let us know how you are doing--the report will show \nnot much is going on. Instead of mandates, I put some targets in and \nsay, aspire to achieve these. We ask the Department of Energy to give \nus a strategy on how they will achieve these.\n  Some who would not want to put this kind of a strategy or this sort \nof a target in law will come to the Senate and say, on national missile \ndefense, we are going to spend $9 billion this year on national missile \ndefense and we demand you deploy a system. It does not matter whether \nit is not ready or whether the technology does not exist, and it does \nnot matter if you cannot hit a bullet with another speeding bullet; we \ndemand you deploy that system by 2004. So the mandated targets are fine \nwith respect to a national missile defense system for which you want to \nspend $9 billion.\n  All of a sudden, when the President says, do a hydrogen fuel cell \ninitiative for America's energy security and you put in a rather weak, \nin my judgment, set of targets, just so you have targets rather than no \ntargets and timetables, they say, gosh, what on Earth are you doing \nhere? Why would you suggest that?\n  I suggest this, because I think if we are going to spend money, we \nought to spend it effectively. If you are going to go on a journey, you \nmight want to get a map. If you want to take a trip to go to a \ndifferent kind of energy future, you might want to have a spot in mind \nabout your different nation. Those who want to take the taxpayers' \nmoney and throw it at a problem and send it to an agency and say, do \nthe best you can, I say, God bless you, but I will show you how not to \nmake progress. Just do that, keep doing that, and you will never, ever, \nmake progress.\n  If we want a different energy future, then we have to be driving the \ntrain. We have to decide this is what we aspire to achieve; these are \nthe goals we set for our country. If you do not want to set goals, do \nnot tell me you support an energy future different from today. Don't \ntell me you want to withdraw and disconnect from 55 percent dependence \non foreign energy--55 percent going to 68 percent. This is a habit that \nis destructive to this country. It is destructive to our future, and it \nis destructive to our security. It is a habit we must end. This \nPresident has supported an approach to do that.\n  I have worked on hydrogen for some while, as have others in the \nCongress, Republicans and Democrats. But working on hydrogen and fuel \ncells to try to move to a different energy future, while a worthwhile \nenterprise, is not going to move us down the road unless this Congress \ndecides to be bold and decides to have big dreams and big goals. The \nfact is, we try to incrementalize everything. We talk big and think \nlittle. If we want to do something, this amendment should be attached \nto this Energy Bill. As I said before, this amendment was accepted by \nvoice vote 2 years ago. I don't have the foggiest understanding of why \nsomeone would oppose this. It is not a mandate. It is not a wild guess. \nIt is not radical. In fact, in many ways it is the most conservative of \napproaches to say, let's not spend money unless we know what we are \ngoing to do with it, unless we have a strategy, unless we aspire to \nachieve certain goals good for this country and that fit with what the \nPresident intends to have happen with respect to a hydrogen and fuel \ncell future.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Feinstein be added as a cosponsor to \nmy amendment No. 865 to Senate Bill S. 14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes and the \nother side will be added 5 additional minutes to the closing side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me show a couple of photographs that \nmight be helpful for people to understand what this issue is about. \nThis is a DaimlerChrysler fuel cell bus introduced in Germany in 1997 \nthat runs on fuel cells. I rode on a fuel cell bus in California. For \nanyone who thinks this technology does not exist, it does. We have fuel \ncells. We use hydrogen.\n  Let me give another example of what is happening in the private \nsector: The Ford Focus fuel cell vehicle, 2002.\n\n  This is a Nissan Xterra, fueled by compressed hydrogen that was \ntested on a California road beginning in 2001.\n  This General Motors Hy-Wire fuel cell concept car was unveiled in \nAugust of 2002.\n  Let me make a point about all of this. You can't convert a vehicle \nfleet in this country from a fleet that pulls up to the gas pump and \nyou take the cap off and you stick a hose in and pump away--you can't \nconvert a vehicle fleet from a gasoline-powered vehicle fleet to a \nhydrogen-powered fleet without substantial public policy initiatives \nthat complement where the private sector wants to go. One cannot do it \nwithout the other.\n  That is why, even as all these companies are working very hard on \nthese\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\nissues, they need public sector and public policy support. This is a \npicture of a hydrogen fueling station at Power TechLabs. So if you had \na car with a fuel cell that uses hydrogen, where would you go to fuel \nthat car? Where would you go to power it? Where would you find a supply \nof hydrogen? So you have a whole series of questions.\n  As I mentioned earlier, you have to develop the question of how do \nyou produce hydrogen in large quantities. It is not terribly difficult. \nYou can produce it in many ways, but what would be the predominant \nmethod of production? How do you store it? Where do you store it? How \ndo you transport it? All of those are important issues that the private \nsector and public policy will answer, in my judgment.\n  Then, what kind of infrastructure can develop and how do you \nincentivize its development so those who are purchasing the new fuel \ncell vehicles powered by hydrogen have a place to come where they can \nfuel those vehicles?\n  We have plans for many areas of public policy, whether it is Social \nSecurity or Medicare--a whole series of issues. We have all these \nstudies and plans of where we aspire to be and what we aspire to do. \nThe goals in this amendment, while not mandates, are very simple. In my \njudgment they are reasonable goals and ones that ought not frighten \nanyone in this Chamber into believing they are mandates.\n  We know California's Clean Air Act requirements will ensure there \nwill be many fuel cell vehicles on the road in California in the \nfuture. By this year, 2003, 2 percent of California's vehicles have to \nbe zero emission vehicles, and around 10 percent must be zero emission \nby 2018. California will have nearly 40,000 to 50,000 fuel cell \nvehicles on the road by the end of the next decade.\n  One of the other considerations in public policy is Federal fleet \npurchase. We can be the first purchaser of these technologies and put \nthousands, tens of thousands of vehicles on the road through the \nFederal fleet purchase. Those are the kinds of activities I think can \nmake a big difference.\n  Let me finish as I started. I am very disappointed. I hope perhaps a \ngood night's sleep will have persuaded those who came yesterday, who \nwere a little cranky about this amendment and wanted to see if they \nshouldn't maybe oppose this amendment--I am hoping maybe a good night's \nsleep would have provided some sort of epiphany to those who would have \notherwise opposed it and they will decide that they should support what \nthe Senate unanimously supported 2 years ago. This is not anything \nother than a step in exactly the right direction.\n  If you want to be big, you want to be bold, you want to agree with \nPresident Bush that we ought to move to a new energy future, if you \nwant to do all that and believe hydrogen and fuel cells, as the \nPresident says, are the future--and I do--if you believe all that, then \nlet's do this the right way: Set timetables and targets and goals. If \nyou want to spend money, then let's make those who are going to receive \nthe money give us the strategies that relate to where we want our \ncountry to move. Or do we just want to throw money in the air and sort \nof mill around and thumb our suspenders and smoke our cigars and say we \ndid a great job; we spent $3 billion on hydrogen, and boy, we hope \nsomething comes of that. That is not the way you do business. The way \nyou do business is you have a plan. You decide where you want to go for \nthe future of this country and what you want to do and how you want to \nachieve it. That is what this amendment does. It just sets out those \ngoals. I am hoping when we have this vote it will have a very sizable \nvictory here in the Senate later this morning.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and the Senator from Louisiana be allowed to \noffer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 871\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are today continuing a very important \ndebate on fashioning an energy policy for our Nation. We will be voting \non many key amendments as we attempt to move this very important bill \noff the Senate floor, to conference with the House, and to the \nPresident's desk for signature.\n  It is crucial that we increase domestic production of oil and gas.\n  It is crucial that we invest more money in research and technologies \nfor alternate fuels that are more environmentally friendly. It is \ncrucial that we reduce our consumption, particularly of oil, as well as \nhave a revitalization, in my opinion, in the appropriate ways, of our \nnuclear industry--they are all important aspects of this bill--as well \nas have the deregulation components of electricity and the expanding of \nthe electric grid, in the appropriate ways, which is quite difficult \nbecause there are regions of the country that come at that issue from a \nvariety of different standpoints, and it has been very difficult to \nnegotiate those particular aspects of the bill.\n  But I compliment the chairman from New Mexico and our ranking member \nfrom New Mexico who have worked beautifully together trying to fashion \na bill that is balanced and is actually possible to pass and not get \nlogjammed in ideological battles; it is something that will help our \ncountry move toward more energy efficiency and security; increasing our \nnational security and improving efficiency in our economy, hopefully \nputting people to work in developing these new technologies. So I \ncommend them for their patience and persistence and their guidance.\n  I believe the amendment I offer today will go a long way to \nminimizing the consumption of oil in this country. We are a nation that \nhas only 3 percent of the world's known oil reserves. Yet we consume \nmore oil than any country per capita or in any way you might\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nwant to arrive at that conclusion. It is simply essential that we \nreduce our consumption of oil.\n  You might say to me, Mr. President: That is strange, Senator, since \nyou are from a State that produces oil. We are a proud producer, as you \nknow, of oil and gas. We believe we contribute to the wealth and \nsecurity of this Nation. We believe and know that these oil and gas \nwells have brought jobs and wealth and opportunity and prosperity to \nour State. Yes, it has come at some environmental cost, particularly 40 \nand 50 years ago, where the science was not where it is today, the \ntechnology was not where it is today, the safety measures were not \nwhere they are today. We made mistakes, but we are quickly learning \nfrom our experience, as any smart individual or enterprise does. We are \nnow engaged in new technologies that minimize the footprint. We are \nengaged in making tremendous improvements in environmental restoration \nprojects.\n  So I hope people will not think it is strange that a Senator from \nLouisiana would be offering what I consider a very reasonable amendment \nto reduce oil consumption in this Nation because even our oil and gas \nproducers themselves are willing, and know, in the long run it is in \neveryone's interests, including theirs, to diversify our source of \nsupply, to minimize our consumption and our dependence on foreign oil \nby improving and increasing domestic production of oil and gas, which \nis a centerpiece of this bill which I am proud to support.\n  So, therefore, I offer this amendment which will save, if adopted--\nand I am pleased to offer this amendment with the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, as the lead cosponsor; Senator Lamar \nAlexander, from the great State of Tennessee; as well as Senator \nCollins from Maine--so we offer this as a bipartisan amendment to save \nthe taxpayers and the businesses and the consumers in this Nation 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. That is the essence of this amendment.\n  Before I explain the details of the amendment, let me just talk a \nmoment about the importance of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. \nAs I said, we need to develop alternative fuel sources. One of the \nreasons is because oil provides nearly 40 percent of U.S. energy \nconsumption. Sixty percent of the oil we consume today is imported, and \nthat number is set to rise. Unless this amendment and others like it \nare adopted, that trend will continue to go up, putting at risk our \nnational security and putting at risk our international economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Because oil is truly an international commodity, and the United \nStates is the world's largest consumer of oil, it is particularly \nvulnerable to any event that would affect supply and demand. As I said \nearlier, our daily consumption of oil is almost four times the next two \nlargest oil consumers, Japan and China. Let me repeat: Our daily \nconsumption of oil is four times the next two largest oil consumers, \nJapan and China.\n  The price of oil in our country is at the mercy of world events, and \nnot just in the Middle East, which we see played out on television \nevery day, but in Venezuela, which might be off the front pages but, \nbelieve me, it is not off the front pages of the business journals in \nthis country where they see their prices and their businesses \njeopardized because of the turmoil in Venezuela and Nigeria.\n  We owe it to ourselves to try to minimize the volatility of oil \nprices. We do that in two ways: increasing domestic production, which \nobviously Louisiana would support; and also by reducing our \nconsumption, which people in Louisiana--average families, businesses \nlarge and small--all would agree to.\n  I continue to advocate for responsible and robust domestic oil \nproduction, as I said, but we need to do more to reduce consumption. \nOil is a critical component of nearly everything that affects our daily \nlives: from transportation, to food production, to heating. And rising \noil prices actually act like a tax by foreign oil exporters on the \naverage American. We have spent a great deal of time trying to reduce \ntaxes on the floor of the Senate. We have done that sometimes in a \nbipartisan way. Sometimes the majority has pushed through tax relief. \nWe can debate that issue at another time. But there is no disagreement \nthat when we can reduce taxes in a responsible manner, we most \ncertainly should do so.\n  This amendment, which asks the President to reduce the consumption of \noil in this Nation by 1 million barrels a day--we are consuming about \n19 million barrels a day, so this would require and basically meet his \ngoals, as outlined in his State of the Union speech--gives him broad \nlatitude as to how to do that. It would be like a tax reduction because \ncurrently middle-class families pay about 5 percent of aftertax income \nfor energy needs. As the price of oil increases, family aftertax income \ncontinues to decline.\n  When businesses pay higher taxes, pay for higher oil prices and \ndisruptions in oil supply, this increases inflation and reduces \nprofits, production, investment, and employment. Let me repeat: It \nincreases inflation, reduces profits, reduces production, reduces \ninvestment, and reduces employment. We need to be increasing \nproduction, investment, and employment. My amendment will help us to do \njust that.\n  Consumers are spending $50 billion more in annual energy bills than a \nyear ago. If we could reduce our consumption by the amount that our \namendment suggests, we would begin to save consumers money they could \nspend on other most needed and necessary things for themselves, their \nchildren, their grandchildren, or their businesses.\n  The amendment I offer today, as I said, would direct the President to \ndevelop and implement a plan to reduce oil consumption by 1 million \nbarrels a day by the year 2013.\n  I show you a chart I have in the Chamber because this amendment would \nactually put into law--I am hoping we can get a broad bipartisan vote \non this amendment--it would actually put into law the words the \nPresident himself spoke in his State of the Union speech when he said \nU.S. oil consumption would be about 1.8 million barrels per day lower \nin 2020.\n  So what my amendment says is, instead of saying there would be a 1.8 \nmillion reduction by 2020, let's try to shoot for a 1-million-barrel-\nper-day reduction by 2013, which is just about the equivalent--a little \ndifferent goal but you could argue an equivalent goal. The benefit and \nbeauty of this amendment is that it does not tie the President's hands, \nbut it gives him great flexibility in how to achieve the goal he has \noutlined.\n  There are any number of reasonable and simple measures the President \ncould adopt that would help us to consume a less significant amount of \noil and reduce taxes on the American people, increase our national \nsecurity, improve our environment, and create jobs. It almost sounds \ntoo good to be true, but it is true.\n  We are not mandating a specific approach, which is the beauty of it, \nbecause the approach some have argued for I have actually disagreed \nwith and want to give the President great flexibility but hold to this \nimportant goal.\n  There are any number of ways we could do that. The President could \nconsider renewable fuels standards. A different approach could save \n175,000 barrels of oil per day by 2013. Weatherizing of homes under \ncredit enhancements or encouragement or new techniques that some local \nand State governments have found very helpful could save 80,000 barrels \nper day. Air traffic improvements, just simple improvements in the way \nand timing of our airplanes taking off and landing, which can be \nincreased effectively by additional technologies, could save 50,000 \nbarrels of oil per day. As to reducing truck idling, there are several \nnew technologies being developed, employing scientists and engineers \nand putting Americans to work developing these new kinds of \ntechnologies which make the engines more efficient. They don't have to \nidle or, at the idling stage, don't use as much oil. That could save \n50,000 barrels of oil a day. Just replacing tires, using our tires and \nkeeping them filled with air as opposed to flat, new technology \nregarding the tires could save money.\n  The point of this list--and I could go on because I could speak about \n30, 40, or 50 known actions that could be taken by the President in \nthis realm without dictating exactly how the savings would occur--is to \nillustrate the plethora of choices where he could go to achieve these \nsavings.\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n  The amendment I offer today with Senators Alexander, Bingaman, \nSpecter, and Collins is a clear and reasonable objective for oil \nsavings. It will reduce our dependence on oil.\n  Let me show a couple of examples of the way the President could \nachieve these goals, some of which we have already passed on the Senate \nfloor. Ethanol is now a part of this bill. There were some Members who \ndisagreed with the ethanol fuels standard. I actually supported, along \nwith Senator Daschle, Republicans and Democrats, that new standard. \nThis will save oil consumption in the country. The President would have \nthat option. In addition, I talked about the tire savings, replacement \ntires with the appropriate rules and regulations could save us 270,000 \nbarrels of oil. And finally, the idling engines, this is a visual to \nshow that with some new technologies to keep our airplanes flying and \nspending less time on the ground and more time in the air, which \npassengers would appreciate--believe me, as a frequent flier myself, if \nwe could just keep our airplanes flying and keep them from idling; \nthere are new technologies helping to do this--we could save oil.\n  In the past, we have focused the debate on just one way of saving oil \nwhich was directed at our transportation sector. My amendment does not \ndirect these savings at the transportation sector, although I \nacknowledge that the transportation sector is the largest user of oil. \nThis amendment provides flexibility. It sets a realistic goal that \nmatches the President's, basically the equivalent of the President's \nown goals. And I think it would create, if adopted, a tremendous \nbalance in the bill because again we have increased opportunities for \nproduction. We have given incentives for more domestic production. But \nthat has to be coupled with Senator Bingaman's leadership on energy \nefficiency and savings to reduce our consumption of oil as we promote \nin the appropriate ways over the appropriate timeframe the use of other \nalternative sources of energy.\n\n  I offer the amendment in good faith. There will be Members who will \nspeak hopefully for the amendment. Hopefully we can pass it by a good \nmargin to show we are indeed serious about a balanced energy policy \nwhich promotes in the right ways domestic production but also oil \nsavings.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a Business Week \narticle that had a great impact with me as I read it, ``Taming the Oil \nBeast.'' It is time, since the business community realizes we can and \nshould get smart about oil, that we do so. I think this is a very good \namendment about getting smart about oil because it sets a goal of \nreduction, but it gives the President and his departments flexibility \nas to how this would work.\n  I would like to submit that for the Record because it would serve as \na basis for the offering of the amendment today.\n  I would also like to reference an article by the Concerned Scientists \nAssociation, over 2,000 scientists who have written a paper, very \nillustrative, encouraging action on this subject. I say that because \nsome of our brightest minds, some of the best scientists in the country \nare thinking along these lines and fully support this amendment to save \n1 million barrels of oil. Perhaps we can save more. I would actually be \nopen to saving more. If someone wants to offer an additional amendment, \nI would consider voting for it. But I am certain this is something we \ncan accomplish. The President himself outlined this as a goal. The \nPresident's own budget that he laid down cited as a goal the \nequivalent, basic goal of what I am offering.\n  We have voted any number of times in the Senate and have come very \nclose to reaching this goal. So while some may argue that we should try \nto save more, I think this is an amendment that can pass, that can get \nus moving in the right direction. I submit both of these from a \nbusiness perspective, from an environmental perspective for the Record, \nto substantiate the value of the amendment.\n  I see my colleague from Tennessee on the floor who has probably come \nto add his good words as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the document I referenced.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From BusinessWeek, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n                          Taming the Oil Beast\n\n\nA sensible, step-by-step energy policy is within our reach--Here's what \n                                 to do\n\n       American troops are massing outside of Iraq, preparing to \n     strike against Saddam Hussein. And as war jitters rattle the \n     world, there's one inevitable effect: a rise in the price of \n     oil. Crude is up more than 33 percent over the past three \n     months, climbing to $35 per barrel in the U.S. Economic \n     models predict that if the price stays high for three months, \n     it will cut U.S. gross domestic product by $50 billion for \n     the quarter. If the war goes badly, with Saddam destroying \n     oil fields in Iraq and elsewhere, or if disaster or unrest \n     chokes off oil flowing from other countries, the whole \n     world's economy is in for a major shock.\n       There's no escaping the consequences of our thirst for oil. \n     It fuels a vast engine of commerce, carrying our goods around \n     the nation, taking mom and dad to work, and carting the kids \n     to soccer practice. As long as the U.S. imports more than 11 \n     million barrels a day--55 percent of our total consumption--\n     anything from a strike in Venezuela to unrest in the Persian \n     Gulf hits us hard in the pocketbook. ``We are vulnerable to \n     any event, anyplace, that affects the supply and demand of \n     oil,'' says Robert E. Ebel, director of the energy program at \n     the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS). In a \n     Feb 6. speech, President Bush put it bluntly: ``It \n     jeopardizes our national security to be dependent on sources \n     of energy from countries that don't care for America, what we \n     stand for, what we love.''\n       It wasn't supposed to be this way. Remember how Richard \n     Nixon insisted in 1973 that the nation's future ``will depend \n     on maintaining and achieving self-sufficiency in energy''? Or \n     how Jimmy Carter proclaimed in 1979 that ``beginning this \n     moment, this nation will never again use more foreign oil \n     than we did in 1977--never.'' Even Ronald Reagan said in 1982 \n     that ``we will ensure that our people and our economy are \n     never again held hostage by the whim of any country or \n     cartel.''\n       How empty those vows seem now, when one nation, Saudi \n     Arabia, is sitting one the world's largest proved reserves--\n     265 billion barrels, or 25 percent of the known supplies--and \n     can send global prices soaring or falling simply by opening \n     or closing the spigot. For now, the Saudis are our friends. \n     They are boosting production to keep prices from spiking too \n     high. But what if Saudi Arabia's internal politics change? \n     ``The entire world economy is built on a bet of how long the \n     House of Saud can continue,'' says Philip E. Clapp, president \n     of the National Environmental Trust.\n       The good news is that we can make a safer bet. And it \n     doesn't entail a vain rush for energy independence or \n     emancipation from Middle East oil. Based on interviews with \n     dozens of economists, oil analysts, environmentalists, and \n     other energy experts, BusinessWeek has crafted guidelines for \n     a sensible and achievable energy policy. These measures build \n     on the positive trends of the past. If implemented, they \n     would reduce the world's vulnerability to wars in the Middle \n     East, production snafus in Russia, turmoil around the Caspian \n     Sea, and other potential disruptions. The plan has the added \n     benefit of tackling global warming, which many scientists \n     consider the greatest economic threat of this century.\n       The energy policy BusinessWeek advocates comes down to six \n     essential steps. To deal with oil supplies, the U.S. should \n     diversify purchases around the world and make better use of \n     strategic petroleum reserves. It must also boost energy \n     efficiency across the economy, including making dramatic \n     improvements in the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. How \n     do we accomplish this? Nurture new technologies and \n     alternative energy sources with research dollars and tax \n     incentives, and consider higher taxes on energy to more \n     accurately reflect the true costs of using fossil fuels. \n     Projecting the precise effects of these policies is \n     impossible, economists warn. But BusinessWeek estimates that, \n     at a cost of $120 billion to $200 billion over 10 years--less \n     than the cost to the economy of a major prolonged oil price \n     rise--it should be possible to raise energy efficiency in the \n     economy by up to 50 percent and reduce U.S. oil consumption \n     by more than 3 million barrels a day.\n       These steps draw on the lessons of history and help \n     highlight what not to do. Meaningful progress has long been \n     held up by myths and misconceptions--and by the scores of bad \n     ideas pushed in the name of energy independence. Remember \n     ``synfuels'' in the 1970s? Today's misguided notions include \n     trying to turn perfectly good corn into ethanol and rushing \n     to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife refuge. Indeed, \n     looking over the past couple of decades, ``my reaction is, \n     thank God we didn't have an energy policy,'' says David G. \n     Victor, director of Stanford University's Program on Energy \n     Sustainable Development. ``The last one had quotas and \n     rationing, causing lines at the gas pumps and incredible \n     inefficiencies in the economy.''\n       One false notion is that making the U.S. self-sufficient--\n     or doing without Middle Eastern oil--would protect us from \n     supply cutoffs and price spikes. In fact, oil has become a \n     fungible world commodity. Even if we cut the umbilical cord \n     with the Persian Gulf by buying more oil from Canada, Mexico, \n     or Russia, or by producing more at home, other nations will \n     simply switch over\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n     to buy the Middle eastern oil we're shunning. The world oil \n     price, and the potential for spikes in that price, remains \n     the same. As long as there are no real oil monopolies, it \n     doesn't matter so much where we get oil. What really matters \n     is how much we use. Reducing oil use brings two huge \n     benefits: Individual countries have less leverage over us, \n     and, since oil costs are a smaller percentage of the economy, \n     any price shocks that do occur have a less dramatic effect.\n       Yet reducing oil use has to be done judiciously. A drastic \n     or abrupt drop in demand could even be counterproductive. \n     Why? Because even a very small change in capacity or demand \n     ``can bring big swings in price,'' explains Rajeev Dhawan, \n     director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State \n     University's Robinson College of business. For instance, the \n     slowdown in Asia in the mid-1990s reduced demand only by \n     about 1.5 million barrels a day, but it caused oil prices to \n     plunge to near $10 a barrel. So today, if the U.S. succeeded \n     in abruptly curbing demand for oil, prices would plummet. \n     Higher-cost producers such as Russia and the U.S. would \n     either have to sell oil at a big loss or stand on the \n     sidelines. The effect would be to concentrate power--you \n     guessed it--in the hands of Middle Eastern nations, the \n     lowest-cost producers and holders of two-thirds of the known \n     oil reserves. That's why flawed energy policies, such as \n     trying to override market forces by rushing to expand \n     supplies or mandating big fuel efficiency gains, could do \n     harm.\n       The truth is, the post-1970s de facto policy of just \n     letting the markets work hasn't been all bad. painful oil \n     shocks brought recessions. But they also touched off a \n     remarkable increase in the energy efficiency of the U.S. \n     economy. From the 1930s to the 1970s, America produced about \n     $750 worth of output per barrel of oil. That number doubled, \n     to $1,500, by the end of the 1980s. But the progress largely \n     stopped in the past decade. Now we need policies to continue \n     those fuel-efficiency gains, without the pain of sudden oil \n     shocks.\n       The critical balancing act is reducing oil use without \n     hurting the economy--or without allowing energy prices to \n     fall so low that companies and individuals abandon all \n     efforts to conserve. Successfully walking this tightrope can \n     bring big gains. The next time we are hit with a spike in the \n     price of oil, or even of natural gas or electricity, we may \n     be able to avoid the billions in lost GDP that would \n     otherwise result. Here are the details:\n\n                       1. Diversify Oil Supplies\n\n       The answer to the supply question is a delicate combination \n     of technology, market forces, and diplomacy. New tools for \n     drilling in waters nearly two miles deep, for instance, are \n     opening up untapped sources in the Atlantic Basin, Canada, \n     the Caribbean, Brazil, and the entire western coast of \n     Africa.\n       That's helping to tip the balance of power among oil \n     producers. In 1973, the Middle East produced nearly 38 \n     percent of the world's oil. Now, that percentage has dropped \n     below 30 percent. ``Our policy has been to encourage oil \n     companies to search for oil outside the U.S. but away from \n     the Persian Gulf,'' explains CSIS's Ebel. ``It's been rather \n     successful.''\n       There's plenty of oil to be tapped. While there are now \n     about 1 trillion barrels of proved reserves, estimates of \n     potential reserves keep rising, from 2 trillion barrels in \n     the early 1980s to more than 3 trillion barrels today.\n       The Caspian Sea area, for instance, promises proved \n     reserves of 20 billion barrels to 35 billion barrels--but \n     could have more than 200 billion barrels. Skeptics argue that \n     this Caspian resource, surrounded as it is by Iran, \n     Kazakhstan, Russia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, is a bastion of \n     instability and could easily become the backdrop for a future \n     war linked to oil. But history shows that even bad guys are \n     eager to sell their oil.\n       If energy policy were only about economics, we might argue \n     that the world should take advantage of the ample supplies \n     and relatively cheap prices and just keep consuming at a \n     rapid rate. But there are additional costs of oil not \n     included now in the price (step 6). And we have other \n     important goals, such as doing more to protect the \n     environment and reducing the political leverage of the Middle \n     East. Says ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) Chairman and CEO Lee R. \n     Raymond: ``The key to security will be found in diversity of \n     supply.'' In other words, whimsical though it may seem, we \n     should strive to maintain a Goldilocks price for oil: It \n     should be high enough to keep companies and countries \n     investing in oil fields but not so high that it sends the \n     world into a recessionary tailspin.\n\n                       2. Use Strategic Reserves\n\n       The nation now has 599.3 million barrels stored in \n     underground salt caverns along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf \n     Coast. That's enough to replace Iraq's oil production for at \n     least six months. Yet this stockpile isn't being used \n     correctly, and it never has been, many experts believe. In \n     the 1991 Persian Gulf War, ``oil prices were back to the \n     normal level by the time the U.S. got around to releasing the \n     strategic petroleum reserve,'' says energy economist W. David \n     Montgomery of Charles River Associates, Inc. We shouldn't \n     make that mistake again. With oil prices already up, ``we \n     should release the stockpile immediately,'' he says.\n       Other experts argue that the reserve should be used as a \n     regular hedging tool rather than being saved for extreme \n     emergencies, which so far have never materialized. One idea: \n     Allow companies to contract with the government to take out \n     barrels of oil when they want to--as long as they agree to \n     replace it later, along with a bit extra. That way, this big \n     store of oil would smooth out glitches in supply and demand \n     while also taking away some of OPEC's power to manipulate the \n     market. There are similar reserves in Europe, Japan, and \n     South Korea--for a total of 4 billion barrels, including \n     the U.S.--that should be used in this way as well. And by \n     making the reserves bigger, we gain more leverage to \n     dampen the shocks.\n\n                     3. Boost Industrial Efficiency\n\n       After decades of concern over energy prices and the big \n     improvement in the overall energy efficiency of America's \n     economy, you would think that U.S. companies would be hard-\n     pressed to find new gains. ``In my experience, the facts are \n     otherwise,'' says Judith Bayer, director of environmental \n     government affairs at United Technologies Corp. (UTX) UT \n     discovered savings of $100,000 in just one facility by \n     turning off computer monitors at night. ``People talk about \n     low-hanging fruit--picking up a dollar on the floor in \n     savings here and there,'' Bayer says. ``We picked up \n     thousands off the ground. It's embarrassing that we didn't do \n     it earlier.''\n       Just last year, Salisbury (N.C.)-based Food Lion cut its \n     energy consumption by 5 percent by using sensors to turn off \n     lights in bathrooms and loading-dock areas and by installing \n     better-insulating freezer doors. ``The project saves millions \n     a year,'' says Food Lion's energy-efficiency expert, Rick \n     Heithold.\n       Even companies with strong efficiency track records are \n     doing more. 3M Corp. (MMM) has cut use of energy per unit of \n     output by 60 percent since the Arab oil embargo--but is still \n     improving at about 4 percent a year. One recent innovation: \n     adjustable-speed factory motors that don't require energy-\n     sapping brakes. The efficiency gains ``help us reduce our \n     operating costs and our emissions--and the impact that sudden \n     price increases have on our businesses,'' says 3M energy \n     manager Steven Schultz.\n       Last year, the New York Power Authority put in a digitally \n     controlled power electronics system--essentially, a large \n     garage packed with semiconductor switches and computers--in a \n     substation that handles electric power coming in from Canada \n     and northern and western New York. Along with conventional \n     improvements, this vastly improved the system's ability to \n     manage power. The state now has the capacity to transfer 192 \n     more megawatts of available electricity, or enough to power \n     about 192,000 homes.\n       The nation's entire antiquated electricity grid should be \n     refashioned into a smart, responsive, flexible, and digitally \n     controlled network. That would reduce the amount of energy \n     required to produce $1 of GDP by 30 percent and save the \n     country $100 billion a year, estimates Kurt E. Yeager, CEO of \n     the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). It would \n     eliminate the need to build dozens of power plants, cut \n     carbon emissions, and slash the cost of power disruptions, \n     which run about $120 billion a year. Such a network would \n     also break down existing barriers to hooking up new sources \n     of power to the grid, from solar roofs on thousands of houses \n     to small, efficient heat and power generators at businesses. \n     And soon, it will be possible to rack up big efficiency gains \n     by switching to industrial and home lights made from light-\n     emitting diodes (LEDs), which can use less than one-tenth the \n     energy of incandescent bulbs.\n       These are exciting developments, but what do they have to \n     do with oil? The answer lies in the idea of fungible energy: \n     Eliminate the need for a power plant running on natural gas, \n     and that fuel becomes available for everything from home \n     heating to a source of hydrogen for fuel-cell vehicles. A \n     subset of the nation's energy policy, therefore, should be \n     doubling Federal R dollars over the next five years to \n     explore technologies that can boost energy efficiency, \n     provide new sources of power, and, at the same time, address \n     the problem of global warming.\n\n                       4. Raise Car and Truck MPG\n\n       To make a real dent in oil consumption, the U.S. must \n     tackle transportation. The numbers here dwarf everything \n     else, accounting for a full two-thirds of the 20 million \n     barrels of oil of oil the U.S. uses each day. And after \n     rising from 15 miles per gallon in 1975 to 25.9 mpg in 1988, \n     the average fuel economy of our vehicles has slipped to 24 \n     mpg, dragged down by gas-guzzling SUVs and pickup trucks. \n     Boost that to 40 mpg, and oil savings will top 2 million \n     barrels a day within 10 years.\n       Detroit says that's too high a goal. But the technology \n     already exists to get there. In early January, General Motors \n     Corp. (GM) rolled out ``hybrid'' SUVs that use a combination \n     of gas-engine and electric motors to bump fuel economy by 15 \n     percent to 50 percent. That same technology is already on the \n     road. Honda Motor Co.'s (HMC) hybrid Civic and Toyota Motor \n     Corp.'s (TM) Prius, both big enough to carry four adults and \n     their cargo, each top 45 mpg in combined city and highway \n     driving.\n       Adding batteries and an electric motor to vehicles is just \n     one of many ways to increase gas mileage. Researchers can \n     also improve the efficiency of combustion, squeezing more \n     power out of a given amount of fuel. In an approach called \n     variable valve timing, they can adjust the opening and \n     closing of an engine's intake and exhaust valves. Such \n     engines, made by Honda, BMW, and others, are\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\n     more efficient without sacrificing power. Researchers are now \n     working on digitally controlled valves whose timing can be \n     adjusted even more precisely. The gains? Well over 10 percent \n     in many cases.\n       More improvement comes from reducing the power sapped by \n     transmissions. So-called continuously variable transmissions \n     eliminate individual gears so that engines can spend more \n     time running at their most efficient speed. And auto makers \n     can build clean-burning diesel engines, which are 20 percent \n     to 40 percent more efficient than their gas counterparts.\n       Estimates vary widely on what it would cost to raise gas \n     mileage to 40 mpg or higher for the entire U.S. fleet of \n     cars. Assuming a combination of technologies, we figure the \n     tab could be $1,000 to $2,000 per car, or $80 billion to $160 \n     billion over 10 years. That's less than fuel savings alone \n     over the life of the new vehicles. Carmakers already have the \n     technology. What we need now are policies, ranging from \n     higher gasoline prices to tougher fuel-economy standards, \n     that will give manufacturers and consumers incentives to make \n     and buy these vehicles.\n       The ultimate gas-saving technology would be a switch to a \n     completely different fuel, such as hydrogen. Toyota, Honda, \n     and GM already are testing cars that use fuel cells to power \n     electric motors. Such vehicles are quiet, create no air \n     pollution, and emit none of the carbon dioxide linked with \n     global warming. They also are expensive, and 10 to 20 years \n     away from the mass market.\n       There's one other problem: Where would the hydrogen come \n     from? The element must now be extracted from gas, water, or \n     other substances at relatively high cost. But there are \n     intriguing ideas for lowering the tab, such as genetically \n     engineering bacteria to make the gas or devising more \n     efficient ways to get it from coal. We need a strong research \n     program to explore these ideas, plus incentives to test fuel-\n     cell technology in power plants and vehicles. President \n     Bush's $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative is just a start.\n\n                      5. Nurture Renewable Energy\n\n       Tim Grieves shares a vision with a growing number of energy \n     giants: harnessing the wind to generate cheap, clean power. \n     The superintendent of schools in Spirit Lake, Iowa, Grieves \n     has overseen the installation of two wind turbines that hum \n     away in a field not far from his office. They generate enough \n     juice to allow Spirit Lake to proudly call itself the only \n     electrically self-sufficient school district in the nation. \n     ``We're not dependent on the Middle East,'' says Grieves. \n     ``This is just smarter.''\n       Although less than 0.5 percent of our power now comes from \n     wind, it's the cheapest and fastest-growing source of green \n     energy. The American Wind Energy Assn. believes the U.S. \n     could easily catch up with Northern Europe, where wind \n     supplies up to 20 percent of power. In the U.S., that's the \n     equivalent of 100,000 megawatts of capacity--or more than 100 \n     large fossil-fueled plants. The Great Plains could become \n     the Middle East of wind.\n       Without tax credits and other incentives, wind power \n     couldn't flourish. but oil and other fossil fuels also have \n     big subsidies. So we should either eliminate those or provide \n     reasonable incentives for alternatives such as wind, solar, \n     and hydrogen. Even if the new sources still cost more than \n     today's power, continued innovation, spurred by the \n     incentives, will lower the price. Moreover, having some \n     electricity produced by wind turbines and solar panels helps \n     insulate us from spikes in natural-gas prices. Some states \n     now require that a percentage of power come from renewable \n     sources. We should consider this nationwide, with a target of \n     perhaps 15 percent, up from the current 6 percent.\n\n                         6. Phase in Fuel Taxes\n\n       The main reason fuel-efficiency gains in the U.S. slowed in \n     the 1990s is that the cost of oil--and energy in general--was \n     so low. ``Yes, we are energy hogs, but we became energy hogs \n     because the price is cheap,'' says Georgia State's Dhawan.\n       Even though it seems like the market is working in this \n     regard, it really isn't. There's widespread agreement that \n     the current price of oil doesn't reflect its true cost to the \n     economy. ``What Americans need to know is that the cost of \n     gasoline is much more than $1.50 a gallon,'' says Gal Luft of \n     the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. But the \n     invisible hand could work its magic if we include costs of \n     so-called externalities, such as pollution or the tab for \n     fighting wars in the Middle East. That would raise the price, \n     stimulating new energy-efficiency measures and the use of \n     renewable fuels.\n       The tricky part is pricing these externalities. Some \n     economists peg it at 5 cents to 10 cents a gallon of gas. \n     Others see the true cost as double or triple the current \n     price. Just by adding in the more than $100 billion cost of \n     having troops and fighting wars in the Persian Gulf, \n     California State University economist Darwin C. Hall figures \n     that oil should cost at least $13 per barrel more. ``That is \n     an absolutely rock-bottom, lowball estimate,'' he says. More \n     dollars come from adding in numbers for the costs of air \n     pollution, oil spills, and global warming.\n       Imagine, though, that in an ideal world, we could settle on \n     the size of the externalities--maybe $10 per barrel. We \n     obviously don't want to suddenly slap a $10 tax on oil. Doing \n     so would slice more than $50 billion out of GDP and send the \n     economy into a recession, forecasters calculate.\n       But phasing it in slowly, over 10 years, would give the \n     economy time to adopt fuel-efficiency measures at the lowest \n     costs. We should also consider additional taxes on gasoline, \n     since a $10-per-barrel price rise amounts to only about 25 \n     cents per gallon of gas--not enough to make a big change in \n     buying habits. This approach works even better if the revenue \n     from these taxes is returned to the economy in a way that \n     stimulates growth and productivity--by lowering payroll \n     taxes, for example. Plus, there are big environmental \n     benefits from reduced pollution.\n       There's a fierce debate about whether the economy gains or \n     loses from such tax-shifting. Many economists agree, however, \n     that the bad effects would be relatively small. ``There may \n     not be a free lunch, but there is almost certainly a lunch \n     worth paying for,'' says Stanford economist Lawrence H. \n     Goulder.\n       If energy taxes prove politically impossible, there's \n     another way to achieve realistic fossil-fuel prices: through \n     the back door of climate-change policy. Already, Europe is \n     toying with carbon taxes to fight global warming and \n     multinationals are experimenting with carbon-trading schemes \n     to get a jump on any future restrictions. Even Republicans \n     such as Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) are pushing curbs on \n     carbon dioxide. If the U.S. put its weight behind efforts to \n     fight climate change, it could help push the entire world \n     toward lower emissions--and moderately higher oil prices. \n     The best approach: a combination of carbon taxes and a \n     cap-and-trade system, wherein companies can trade the \n     right to emit. That way, the market helps find the \n     greatest reductions at the lowest cost. Economists figure \n     that a $100-per-ton tax on carbon emissions, for example, \n     would equal a rise of 30 cents in the cost of a gallon of \n     gas.\n       Under the Bush Administration, this too, may be difficult \n     to enact. What's left are regulations and mandates. There may \n     be just enough political will to boost CAFE (corporate \n     average fuel efficiency) standards for vehicles--and to \n     remove the loopholes that hold SUVs to a lower standard. But \n     we need a smarter rule than the current one.\n       One good idea: give companies whose cars and trucks do \n     better than the fuel-economy target credits that they could \n     sell to an auto maker whose fleet isn't efficient enough. \n     That way, ``good'' companies such as Honda are strongly \n     motivated to keep improving technology. By being smarter \n     about regulations and mandates, ``we could do a lot better \n     than what we are doing now,'' explains Stanford professor \n     James L. Sweeney.\n       If we implement these policies, here's what we'll get: A \n     reduction in projected levels of oil consumption equal to 3 \n     million barrels a day or more within 10 years. That means we \n     could choose not to import from unfriendly countries \n     (although they will happily sell their oil to others). In \n     addition, oil-price shocks should be fewer and smaller, \n     allowing us to avoid some of those $50 billion (or more) hits \n     to GDP. A more fuel-efficient economy will free up oil for \n     countries such as China and India, notes Platts Global \n     Director of Oil John Kingston. And the technologies we \n     develop will help those economies become more efficient.\n       Economists will argue about the costs of these measures. \n     But the benefits of greater energy efficiency and reduced \n     vulnerability should, over the long run, outweigh the $120 \n     billion (or more) cost of getting there. Painful though they \n     were, the oil shocks of the 1970s sent the U.S. down the road \n     toward a more energy-efficient--and less vulnerable--economy. \n     Our task now is to find a smoother path to continue that \n     journey.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Iowa has been waiting for a while. I \nwould like to set the vote for the Dorgan amendment if I may, and then \nI would be glad to yield to the Senator from Iowa to let him make his \nremarks. Then I would like as a cosponsor to speak in support of the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case, that Senator \nHarkin be recognized followed by the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, pursuant to the order of last night, I \nask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment \nNo. 865 occur at 11:30 today with two minutes equally divided prior to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, I would \nhope that we could also line up the Senator from Louisiana to have her \nvote in a reasonably short period of time. She has indicated she thinks \nthere may be a number of others who wish to speak in favor of the \namendment. We would hope we could move on to that. We want to get to \nthe Wyden amendment. There is an order in effect that would set up 2 \nhours on that amendment. Senator Wyden will be ready immediately after \nthe caucus. He would have\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\nbeen ready this morning. He would be ready after the caucus to move on \nthat. I hope we can get do that amendment right after the caucus and \ndispose of this even prior to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I have a question. Does \nthe Senator think it would be possible to do that before lunch? I think \nmy colleague would probably only need 30 minutes for our debate, \nequally divided between the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Mr. REID. I hope that will be the case. Until Senator Domenici gets \nhere, we cannot agree to that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Chair please state the unanimous \nconsent now before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment \nwill take place at 11:30, with 2 minutes of debate.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, briefly, the Dorgan amendment to \nput 100,000 hydrogen-powered vehicles on the road by 2010 and 2.5 \nmillion by 2020, with the requisite fueling infrastructure, is one that \nis going to help grow our economy, make our economy stronger. The \namendment by Senator Landrieu and others to cut down on the use of oil \nby a million barrels a day also is going to help improve our economy by \nmaking us focus on things such as ethanol, for example, alternative \nfuels, renewable energy and, of course, along with the Dorgan \namendment, fuel cell vehicles. It all has to do with making us more \nenergy independent, and that has to do with growing our economy. The \nmore we continue to send our hard-earned dollars out of the country for \nthe energy we need, the less dollars we are going to have to rebuild \nour economy here at home.\n  Yesterday, I attended a hearing Senator Dorgan had that was devoted \nto the question of our economy. The question was: Will the Bush \neconomic plan create jobs?\n  Well, I think throughout the hearing what became clear was that the \nBush economic plan will not create jobs, unfortunately. The plan \nadvocated by the majority rewards their friends and supporters with \nlarge tax cuts but will do very little to create jobs. Many respected \neconomists warned of this months ago, but Republicans and the \nadministration paid them no heed.\n  Unfortunately, it is not only experts who believe this prediction; \nhistory gives the same warning. These trickle-down economic policies \nhave been tried before, and they have failed before. In 1981, Congress \npassed massive tax cuts for the rich, just like we did here. Then \nDirector of OMB David Stockman called it a ``riverboat gamble.''\n  Well, it was a gamble. Within 2 years, following the 1981 supply \nside, trickle-down tax bill, we lost 1.4 million jobs. In 2001, the \nBush administration tried it again. They passed the first round of \nmassive tax cuts. And guess what. We lost 2 million jobs. As all major \nnewspapers reported this weekend, the national unemployment rate is now \nat 6.1 percent, its highest level in 9 years.\n  Despite these two previous losing gambles, the President and the \nmajority party in Congress decided to give it a third try last month. I \nthink we ought to call the tax bill that was passed and sent to the \nPresident the ``Bill Bennett betting bill'' because it is going to have \nthe same effect on our country that Bill Bennett's gambling addiction \nhad on him. It cost him, as I understand it, lost millions. It is going \nto cost our economy lost billions.\n\n  But in the midst of it all, the wealthiest Americans will have \nmassive tax breaks. In fact, on average, those Americans making over $1 \nmillion a year are going to receive a tax cut of $93,000 a year. They \nare going to have a great time. Unfortunately, who is going to pay the \nbill? Well, it will be paid by the rest of us, especially the younger \ngeneration--those now going through college, going out to make their \nway in life. They will be saddled with a huge, new debt.\n  As pointed out on the editorial pages of the Des Moines Register this \nweekend, these irresponsible policies will create pressure for higher \nState and local taxes, tuition hikes at State colleges and \nuniversities, rising health care costs to those lucky enough to have \ninsurance, and further cuts to important initiatives.\n  The wealthiest in America got more than their share under this tax \nbill, but the folks in the middle class pay the bills. By contrast, the \nUnited States took a fiscally responsible approach in the 1990s. In \n1993, Congress passed a budget to grow the economy, create jobs. In the \n2 years following that passage, 6.4 million jobs were created. That \nplan put us on a path not only toward the lowest levels of unemployment \nin memory, but also to balanced budgets, the largest projected budget \nsurpluses ever.\n  I find it most remarkable and disheartening that at the very time \nwhen it is obvious that economic policies should seek to stimulate \ndemand, stimulate new jobs, the majority party opposes those things \nthat would stimulate the economy the most, such as increasing the child \ncredit for working families making under $26,000 a year.\n  Well, the Democratic priority may yet prevail, as it did in the \nSenate last week. I hope it does. But further stimulus, such as putting \npeople directly to work, building new schools, roads, and bridges, \ncommunications systems, upgrading our water and our waste water \nsystems, making sure we weatherize homes all over America, will also \nsave us on imported fuel. These are the things we can do now that will \nput people to work now. But the majority party says no.\n  I also fear that their policies will lead to exploding Government \ndebt. On the same day we passed this ``Bill Bennett betting bill''--\nthat is what I call the tax bill--the debt limit was increased by an \namount equivalent to putting an additional $3,500 on the credit card of \nevery man, woman, and child in America--$3,500 on the credit card of \nevery man, woman, and child in America--to pay for this ``Bill Bennett \nbetting bill.''\n  Most of us are aware that the real cost to the Treasury of this \nrecent tax cut will be higher than advertised because the bill used \ngimmicks and tricks to stay within some nominal budget limit. The \nSpeaker of the House was quoted as saying the real cost will be a \ntrillion dollars, at a time when our exploding deficit is approaching \n$500 billion for this year alone. Well, with typical British clarity, \nthe Financial Times wrote on May 23, the day the tax bill passed: On \nthe management of fiscal policy, the lunatics are now in charge of the \nasylum.\n  The result, as this administration is well aware, is that it will put \npressure on Social Security and Medicare. These programs are targeted \nby the administration for reforms, which means privatizing Medicare and \nSocial Security. We are going to have a debate here, I assume, in the \nSenate in the coming weeks on how we are going to provide prescription \ndrug benefits under Medicare. But as I see the Medicare bill \nprogressing and developing, it is nothing more than a shell, a \nsubterfuge to move toward the privatization of Medicare, which, of \ncourse, has been the Republican Party's dream for many years. Don't \ntake my word for it. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said \nMedicare ought to wither on the vine. The third ranking Republican in \nthe Senate, my friend from Pennsylvania, said the Medicare benefit \nshould be phased out.\n  So make no mistake, when we are debating the Medicare bill coming up, \nwe have to get out of the weeds. What they are really talking about is \ntaking the first step toward privatizing Medicare. The President's own \npress secretary was quoted in the story:\n\n       There is no question that Social Security and Medicare are \n     going to present future generations with a crushing debt \n     burden unless policymakers work seriously to reform those \n     programs.\n\n  You pass a tax cut for the richest in the country that the Speaker \nsays is going to cost us a trillion dollars, and then you say we are \ngoing to have a lot of pressure on Social Security and Medicare because \nthe money will not be there for them, so now we have to reform them, \nwhich is their way of saying privatize them. I hope we now understand \nthe picture: A tax cut for the wealthiest, huge debts for the rest, \nimmense pressure on Social Security and Medicare; therefore, you have \nto privatize them; turn them over to Wall Street. That is where we are \nheading.\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\n  Exploding deficits and the debt will act like a cap on our economy. \nIt will increase interest rates when the economy does begin to recover. \nIt will undermine confidence. We need to create jobs in the short term, \nbut we need to do it in a way that is fiscally responsible, to take \ncare and protect the retirement security and health needs of seniors. \nWe need to change course. The course set by this administration will \nonly lead to further deficits, further debts piling up on our kids and \ngrandkids, economic stagnation, importing more oil from abroad--which \nis why I am such a strong supporter of the Landrieu amendment and the \nDorgan amendment.\n  I am afraid the administration may be opposed to these amendments, \njust as they are opposed to a sound rational means of getting our \neconomy moving again. As I said, the Federal Government can be a great \ninstrument, doing it in a fiscally responsible manner that actually \nprovides the basis for further private sector growth in our country.\n  I was listening to former Congressman Jack Kemp, an old friend of \nmine of long standing, go on and on about how we need to make sure we \nhave more money in the private sector for investments. I understand \nthat, and that is a legitimate argument, but what about the need for \nsocietal investments? What about the need for investing in human \ncapital? What about the need for investing in education? You can give \nall the tax breaks you want to the richest in this country and the \ncorporations. Are they going to turn around and invest in higher \nteacher pay, better teacher training? Are they going to invest in \nrebuilding and modernizing schools all over America? There is no return \non that capital, at least not in the short term and not in a way that \nwould accrue to the bottom line of a company.\n  As we all know, that kind of an investment accrues to our national \neconomy. Rebuilding our schools all over America--this is something \nthat is estimated to be in the neighborhood of $180 billion. Think of \nthe jobs it would create. When you give someone an extra dollar for \nconsumption right now in our society, they may buy a new shirt, but \nthat shirt may be made in Malaysia, Thailand, or India. They may buy a \nnew TV set, but that TV set sure is not made in America, or a stereo \nnot made in America. They may buy a new car. Maybe that car is not made \nin America. To be sure, some of that money does fall out in this \ncountry because we have people selling those items, storing them, and \nshipping them. But the bulk of it could go outside the country.\n  If, however, you make a societal investment in building a new school, \nall of the workers are in America. Almost all of the materials used \nfrom the lighting to the heating to the wallboard to the sheetrock--\neverything, building materials--almost all, I would not say all--almost \nall are made in America. Not only do you put people to work, you build \nsomething of a lasting nature that provides for a strong foundation for \nthe private sector in America.\n  Take the issue of weatherization. We could save huge amounts of oil \nand natural gas each year simply by weatherizing homes, and I do not \nmean just in the North where it gets cold, but I mean in the South \nwhere it gets hot in the summertime. Guess what, these are not jobs \nthat take a lot of training. These are jobs we could fill with \nunemployed people right now. We can put them to work weatherizing homes \nall over America.\n  What do we get? We get immediate job creation. We use materials \nbasically that are made in this country. And we get something out of it \nthat is going to help us: more fuel-efficient homes of low-income \npeople who will not be using their money to pay high heating bills or \ncooling bills to pay for imported oil.\n  Yet, for some strange reason, we cannot seem to do that here. But, \nboy, we can sure give billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest in our \nsociety.\n  I will have more to say about this in the weeks ahead. There is \nanother pathway--that is my point--there is another pathway to economic \ngrowth and jobs in our country, to which this administration has turned \na blind eye, by investing in the veins and arteries--the roads and \nbridges, the highways, the sewer and water systems, the schools, the \neducation, the scientific research, the mathematical research, the \nphysics research, the chemistry research, the medical research--that \nwill set the stage for future economic growth and prosperity in our \ncountry.\n  That will not come about by giving more tax breaks to the wealthy or \nbusiness tax breaks. It comes about by us in the Congress of the United \nStates fulfilling our responsibility to pass tax bills and energy bills \nthat are responsible, that are commonsense, and that will lay this kind \nof secure foundation for the future. That is why I support the Landrieu \namendment so strongly, because it will start to do that, and so will \nthe Dorgan amendment that has been set aside. These are commonsense \napproaches. These are the programs we should be doing for our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I stand to \ncongratulate the Senator from Louisiana and join with her as a \ncosponsor of her amendment. She and I are members of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. We are very proud of what our chairman and \nranking member have done this year in taking a diverse array of \nopinions and coming up with a very good bill with a very good amount of \nbipartisan consensus.\n  There is consensus about supporting a diverse array of energy \nsources. The Energy bill, which the Senators from New Mexico have led \nus to fashion, encourages hydrogen fuel cell cars in the economy. It \nencourages renewable energy. It encourages clean coal. It encourages \noil and gas. And it encourages nuclear power.\n  What I think it is important we also do is make sure we encourage \nconservation, and to do that in a way that puts conservation high on \nthe list of priorities. It is a low-cost way to have more energy. It is \na no-pollution way to have more energy.\n  In my way of thinking, the Senator from Louisiana has come up with a \nsensible approach. It also helps to have the President involved. When \nthe President said, let's build a hydrogen fuel cell car, he was not \nthe first to say that, but everybody heard it when he said it and it \ngave a lot of impetus to the work on hydrogen that had been going on in \nthis body from both sides of the aisle.\n  So the Senator's idea is to reduce our petroleum import dependence by \nhaving the President come up with a plan to conserve oil throughout our \neconomy, not just in transportation but throughout the economy; to \nreduce our total demand by a million barrels per day by 2013. By my \ncomputation, that would cause us to reduce that by about 5 percent by \n2013.\n  We ought to be able to do that. We ought to be able to go ahead with \nnuclear powerplants, with all the gas explorations. We ought to be able \nto go ahead with renewable energies and coal gasification. We ought to \nconserve at the same time.\n  Just one example. The Senator from Iowa was mentioning weatherizing \nhomes. That is one good way, if we paid more attention to it. Another \ngood way is idling trucks. Truckers who are so frequent on our highways \noften idle their trucks in order to keep their air-conditioner and all \nthe other services going that they have in the truck. There are \ncompanies that permit the truckers now to turn off their truck and to \nplug in a device and by doing that enabling operation of the appliances \nthey have but they do not pollute the air at the same time. It is such \na simple idea that we would hope any one of us could have thought of \nthat but, in fact, having the President develop a plan that will focus \non reducing our consumption of oil by 2013 would include such ideas as \nweatherizing homes, as encouraging truckers not to idle, keeping tires \nproperly inflated. These may seem to be small ideas but they can add \nup, we suggest, to a million barrels per day by the year 2013.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Louisiana on what I think is a \ncommonsense, reasonable approach to add conservation to our arsenal of \nactivities, to give it a higher profile in this bill, and I am glad to \njoin in cosponsoring her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Landrieu, Specter, Bingaman, and Alexander, in offering this \namendment to reduce our consumption of oil by a million barrels a day \nby the year 2013. This is a very reasonable and achievable goal, and I \ncongratulate the Senator from Louisiana for coming up with this \ninitiative and reaching out to those of us who share her concern that \nour Nation is too dependent on foreign oil.\n  Increasing energy efficiency is the single most effective way to \nreduce our reliance on foreign oil. Without a greater focus on energy-\nefficiency measures, the Energy legislation before us, which has many \nvaluable provisions, will not be effective in reducing our dependence \non foreign oil. As long as we continue to guzzle foreign oil, we will \nbe at the mercy of those nations that control that oil. We are already \nnearly 60-percent reliant on foreign sources, and the Energy \nInformation Administration projects that our dependence will increase \nto 70 percent by the year 2010 if we do not act. If we do not do more \nto improve the energy efficiency standards, America will only grow more \ndependent on foreign oil and the price of gas and home heating oil will \nonly rise accordingly.\n  Our amendment would help to reduce oil consumption by a million \nbarrels a day by the year 2013. It would do so by giving the President \nthe flexibility to decide among any number of simple energy saving \nmeasures to achieve these savings. For example, simply weatherizing \nhomes which use home heating oil could save 80,000 barrels of oil per \nday. Using energy-efficient engine oil could save another 100,000 \nbarrels per day. Just keeping our tires on our automobiles properly \ninflated could save 200,000 barrels per day. In short, by taking a few \neasily adopted measures, we could reduce our consumption of oil by a \nmillion barrels a day.\n  We currently use about 19 million barrels a day. So this would make a \nreal difference. It would result in a reduction of consumption of \nimported oil. Reducing our consumption by 1 million barrels per day \nwill also help to keep energy prices down and will keep billions of \nAmerican dollars at home where they belong. In fact, this proposal we \nhave advanced could save American consumers upwards of $20 billion each \nyear.\n  I call upon my colleagues to join us today in supporting our \ncommonsense measure to reduce our reliance on foreign oil by reducing \nour consumption of oil by a million barrels a day. It is right for our \nenvironment. It is right for our economy. It is right for the American \nconsumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 865\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Am I correct that there will be \na vote on the Dorgan amendment at 11:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask to speak to that amendment until \n11:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have already agreed to 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided at 11:28 so we can vote, but the time until 11:28 is \navailable so the Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have already spoken, as have Senator \nAlexander and others, against this amendment. By being against the \namendment, it does not mean we are in any way in derogation of the \nefforts by the distinguished Senator, Mr. Dorgan, in his efforts to \npursue a hydrogen economy for the United States, in his efforts to move \nforward with the hydrogen cell and with the hydrogen car. I compliment \nhim for that.\n  His amendment, which says we should move ahead with certain quotas, \nwith specific amounts, with goals, with mandatory achievements, should \nnot be done. It would not be of any benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of time equally divided on the Dorgan amendment.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This amendment is very simple. It establishes timelines \nand targets: 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2010, 2\\1/2\\ million by \nthe year 2020. It is not a mandate, it is not enforceable, but at least \nit sets targets that we aspire to achieve. The opposition would say, \nwell, let's just throw money at the Department of Energy and hope \nsomething good comes of it. That is not the way to address this issue, \nin my judgment.\n  I know my colleague complimented me but the greatest compliment, of \ncourse, would be voting for my amendment. What is disappointing is that \nthis amendment passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote a year and a \nhalf ago. This amendment has already been embraced by the Senate. I am \ndisappointed that it will not be passed by a voice vote today because \nif we are, in fact, going to move toward a hydrogen fuel cell future, \nwe need to think big and bold. Then we ought to set some targets and \nhave some aspirations and say to the Department of Energy, here is \nthree-plus billion dollars and, by the way, this is what we would like \nto see achieved with that money. We would really like to see these \ngoals achieved--not mandates, just strategic goals.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I compliment the Senator but I cannot vote for his \namendment. This committee has added to the $1.3 billion proposal by the \nPresident for the hydrogen car, $1.6 billion suggested by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and others on that side.\n  The issue is whether we want to add to the bill a target that we have \n100,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the United States by 2010. I \nrespectfully suggest that is a wild guess. I drove a $2 million Ford \nhydrogen car around the block in Washington. I did that, I believe the \nSenator and several others did, and it costs $2 million to make the \ncar. It actually works. We drove around and got so excited we came up \non the Senate floor and put into law that we ought to have 100,000 of \nthem by the year 2010. It is not mandatory.\n  It reminded me, as I mentioned yesterday, my friends were guessing \nwrong about the facts technology. I respectfully will vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 871\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 12:15 be equally divided in the usual form for debate in relation \nto the Landrieu-Domenici amendment; provided, further, that at 12:15 \nthe Senate proceed to a vote in relation to that amendment, with no \nsecond degrees in order to the amendment prior to the vote; and, \nfinally, that following the vote the Senate stand in recess under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike incorporated in the unanimous consent request 5 minutes. This \namendment was offered as the Landrieu-Specter amendment.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection.\n  Mr. President, I add 5 minutes to the time in the request, with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania having that 5 minutes. The vote would occur \nat 12:20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sorry, we did not know that, I say to the Senator. \nWe would have asked you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. President, the amendment is at the desk. We will be voting \nshortly on the Landrieu-Domenici-Specter-Alexander-Bingaman-Collins-\nSchumer-Feingold oil savings amendment. It is a very reasonable \napproach to an extremely serious problem. That problem is, unless we \nmake some adjustments--and the time to make those adjustments is now--\nto our policy regarding the consumption of oil, we will be seriously \nincreasing, as opposed to decreasing, our dependence on foreign oil and \nhurting the American economy and taxing American citizens and \nbusinesses unnecessarily.\n  The amendment has been developed by many of us--Democrats and \nRepublicans--and it is based on lots of good work. Two issues I pointed \nout earlier this morning in the debate are in a lengthy article \nrecently published by Business Week--not a liberal magazine by any \nstretch, a middle-of-the-road business organization that argues that we \nneed to get smart about oil.\n  As a Senator from an oil-producing State, let me say I agree 100 \npercent. We like to produce oil. We are proud to produce oil. But we \nknow it is in the interest of our State in the short, intermediate, and \nlong run to have greater supply, a diversity of supply of fuels, and \nnot be overreliant. Why? Because it puts our economy, our industrial \nbase at risk.\n  I also mentioned earlier today the statement by the Union of \nConcerned Scientists, over 60,000 scientists and citizens working \ntogether to come up with some proposals for reducing our dependence on \noil, and they are clearly outlined in these articles and these papers.\n  What this amendment simply does--submitted on behalf of those I \nmentioned--is give the President all the flexibility he needs in his \nadministration but to reach very specific goals. This amendment, when \nadopted, will save 1 million barrels of oil a day by the year 2013, \nwhich is equivalent to the President's own goals, but it will put this \nin law in the underlying Energy bill.\n  I propose this amendment to the Senate for its careful consideration \nand hope we will get a broad vote.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania would like to add some \nremarks, as well as other cosponsors who may be in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be the original, \nprincipal cosponsor, along with Senator Landrieu, on the Landrieu-\nSpecter-Bingaman-Collins amendment. I am pleased to see that now the \nSenate is on the verge of taking a significant step, albeit a modest \none, on petroleum conservation, a step long overdue in this country.\n  Last year, I cosponsored, along with Senator Carper, an amendment \nwhich would have targeted reduction in oil consumption, and it was \ndefeated on a tabling motion 57 to 42. A few days ago, I introduced S. \n1169, which was a repeat of the Carper-Specter amendment. And today I \nam pleased to join with Senator Landrieu on a broader amendment which \ngoes for reduction of oil dependency beyond transportation but calls on \nthe President to set a standard for reduction of oil by 1 million \nbarrels a day from a projected use of some 24 million barrels.\n  This is a significant step, albeit a modest one. It is a first step. \nBut it is very important for the United States that we reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil for many reasons. First of all, simply \nstated, we use too much foreign oil. Secondly, we are dependent upon \nthe OPEC countries, especially upon Saudi Arabia, and it has an effect \non influencing our foreign policies in ways which may well be \nundesirable. There have been very serious charges as to the Saudis on \nsponsoring al-Qaida and sponsoring terrorism. There is much yet that \nhas to be proved on that subject, but we should not be tied to or \ndependent upon any nation, especially Saudi Arabia.\n  The dependence on foreign oil results in a tremendous amount of our \nimbalance on foreign trade, with oil imports now accounting for one-\nthird of the Nation's trade deficit which exceeded $400 billion in the \nyear 2001.\n  There is much we could do to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil. \nI am pleased to report on a $100 million grant by the Department of \nEnergy to a plant in Pottsville, PA; a $612 million plant which will \nturn sludge into high-octane fuel is now moving forward. We have \ntremendous coal resources in this country, some 20 billion tons of \nbituminous coal alone in Pennsylvania, 7 billion tons of anthracite, \nand coal across this country which can be turned, with clean coal \ntechnology, into reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I am pleased to see the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nchairman of the Energy Committee, is now cosponsoring this amendment so \nthat what you have, although slightly different than last year on a \ntabling at 57 to 42, is an amendment gaining very substantial momentum. \nThat is a very good sign for conservation, a very good sign for the \nfuture of the American economy, and a very good sign for environmental \nprotection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original \ncosponsor of what we are going to call the Landrieu-Domenici amendment. \nI note the presence of Senator Alexander who was one of the original \nSenators who spoke to this matter on the floor. I hope in the remaining \ntime he gets a chance to speak. Let me say there are a lot of people \nwho come up with new formulas, attempt to set new formulas on \nautomobiles, on the mileage that cars will have, and the like. None of \nthem seem to work, and none of them seem to get through this body. This \nis an ingenious idea of my friend from Louisiana who has been extremely \nhelpful in getting an Energy bill passed. I think when we pass it in a \nfew weeks, and we will, she can take a great deal of pleasure in \nknowing that much of it was due to her interest, enthusiasm, and \nsupport.\n  I hope we will vote for it unanimously, saying to our President, find \nways to do this. I believe it is the best way for the Senate to handle \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Ms. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor of the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. How much more time remains under the unanimous consent?\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to have 1 minute to close and then turn to \none of the original cosponsors, the Senator from Tennessee, who may \nwant to add. Let me again thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir able help because without their support, this amendment would not \nhave been possible. We worked on many different approaches, several \ndifferent drafts. Finally, we did come upon a way that sets a very \nclear goal.\n  I would agree with Senator Specter, it is somewhat modest, but it is \na compromise. It is a clear goal. It is an attainable goal. It is a \nreachable goal. It gives the President and the administration the \nflexibility they need to do it in a way that is most helpful to this \neconomy. It will create jobs, reduce taxes that people pay because of \nthe price of oil and energy, and it gives the flexibility necessary to \ncome up with a smart approach to this very serious problem.\n  I yield to my friend from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. We \nshould not pass an Energy bill that does not put conservation up on the \nplatform along with our encouragement of nuclear power, oil \nexploration, and hydrogen fuel cell; all of that is important. And this \namendment by the Senator and various cosponsors makes it clear to the \ncountry that commonsense ways to conserve oil are equally important in \nour arsenal of having an economy that is less dependent on foreign oil \nand in a better position to produce clean air.\n  I am proud to join as a cosponsor. I congratulate the Senator and \ncongratulate our chairman for being able to move this bill forward with \nsuch a bipartisan consensus.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back the time I have. I might \nsay to Senators, we tried very hard to get the vote within 15 minutes \nlast time. I was asked by a number of Senators to please try to do that \non the votes. I have no authority to say that will be the rule, but as \nthe floor manager, we have a 15-minute rollcall vote on this amendment. \nIt is a simple one. It is not too hard to find your way to the floor.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 875\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provision relating to deployment of new nuclear \n                             power plants)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself, Mr. \n     Sununu, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Reid, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n     Jeffords, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 875.\n\n       Strike subtitle B of title IV.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, this amendment is sponsored \nby three Democrats, three Republicans, and one Independent. I hope this \nafternoon that it will have the support of Senators with varying \ndegrees of views about the advisability of nuclear power. I am \nparticularly pleased that the lead cosponsor, Senator Sununu, is with \nus today.\n  I will make a few brief remarks to begin the debate and then I am \nanxious to have plenty of time for colleagues.\n  The reason three Democrats and three Republicans and one Independent \nare sponsoring this amendment is that I think many of us in the Senate \nare neither pronuclear nor antinuclear but we are definitely \nprotaxpayer. That is why we are on the floor this afternoon, because \nthe loan guarantees that are in this legislation to construct nuclear \npower facilities are unprecedented and represent, in my view, \nparticularly onerous and troublesome risks to the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  Frankly, people in my part of the country know a bit about this. It \nis not an abstraction for the people of the Pacific Northwest where we \nhad the WPPSS debacle and 4 out of 5 facilities were never built. It \nwas the biggest municipal bond failure in history, and it has certainly \ncolored my thinking with respect to why we are on the floor today.\n  The loan guarantees--we did some research into this--are \nunprecedented with respect even to nuclear power. As far as I can tell, \nin the early days of nuclear power, there were subsidies for nuclear \npower but never before were the taxpayers on the hook from the get-go. \nThat is what the Senate is confronted with now.\n  When it comes to the question of risk, I hope the Senate will focus \non what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said on this \ntopic. I will quote. It is at page 9 of the Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis that we have made available to Senators. The Congressional \nBudget Office considered:\n\n       The risks of default on such loan guarantees to be very \n     high, well above 50 percent.\n\n  Colleagues, first, when we are talking about risk--because nothing in \nlife is foolproof and there are no guarantees of anything--I hope in \nlooking at these guarantees you will first focus on the fact that the \nCongressional Budget Office has specifically said in their analysis \nthat the risk of default on the\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\nguarantees is very high. If those plants default, the exposure to \ntaxpayers is enormous.\n  I will quote from the Congressional Research Service report they did \nwith respect to these subsidies. They said:\n\n       . . . the potential cost to the federal government of the \n     nuclear power plant subsidies that would be provided by [this \n     title] would be in the range of $14-$16 billion in 2002 \n     dollars.\n\n  I think it is worth noting that the Senate spent a great deal of time \non the child tax credit last week. There we were focusing on something \ninvolving $3 billion. If one or two of these plants go down, taxpayers \nare on the hook for a sum greater than that child tax credit.\n  Now, in the course of today's discussion, we will hear a number of \narguments against the Wyden-Sununu amendment. One of the first will be: \nThere are tax credits for a variety of energy sources in this \nlegislation, for wind and solar and a variety of energy alternatives. \nThat is correct. But those tax incentives are fundamentally different \nthan the loan guarantees because in those instances the producer faces \nsubstantial risk.\n  With respect to, say, a wind facility, if the producer takes the \ninitial risk and later on produces some wind power, they would get a \ncredit in order to defray some of their costs. With respect to the loan \nguarantees for nuclear power, the producer faces no such risk. The \nproducer has the Government, in effect, guaranteeing, right at the \noutset, much of the risk.\n  So with respect to these nuclear loan guarantees, unlike the \nincentives for wind or solar, what we are talking about is that the \nGovernment will socialize the losses but will let private investors \npick up the gains. The losses will be socialized; the gains will be \nprivatized. And that is unique in this legislation.\n  I also say to my colleagues in the Senate, the White House has never \nasked for these loan guarantees. These loan guarantees are not in the \nHouse bill. Senators' phones are not ringing off the hook from the \nSecretary of Energy or others clamoring that this must be done. This is \nsomething that, in my view, is far out of the mainstream in terms of \nenergy policy, not because I am antinuclear--and I don't intend to talk \nabout safety issues--but because it is such a large exposure to \ntaxpayers.\n  For example, a number of reports have come out already with respect \nto how nuclear power stands up with respect to other costs such as \nnatural gas or coal. One of the reasons, in my view, the Congressional \nBudget Office believes there is such a high risk of default is that the \nobjective analyses show that nuclear has not been competitive with \nother sources such as coal.\n  I hope Senators will look at those two reports: a report done by the \nCongressional Budget Office documenting a high likelihood of default, \nand a report done by the Congressional Research Service talking about \nexposure to taxpayers.\n  I would finally say to the Senate, it did not have to be this way. I \nknow the distinguished chairman of the Energy Committee feels very \nstrongly about this subject. He is a longtime family friend. I was very \nwilling, and I think other Senators were as well, to have had a modest \nprogram. We had been talking, for example, about one experimental \ninitiative to look at advanced technologies of one sort or another. I \nthink that would have been acceptable. But here we are talking about \nguarantees for up to seven plants.\n  I will make reference to the legislation. The bill authorizes DOE to \nprovide loan guarantees for up to 50 percent of the construction costs \nof new nuclear plants and, on top of that, would authorize the \nDepartment of Energy to enter into long-term contracts for the purchase \nof power from those plants. The Secretary could provide loan guarantees \nfor up to seven plants.\n\n  That is not a modest experiment that would have been acceptable to \nthis Member of the Senate, but it is a very significant exposure to the \ntaxpayers of this country at a time when every Senator is concerned \nabout deficits.\n  Mr. President, I intend to allow time for my colleagues. I see \nSenator Sununu is on the floor. Senator Reid has strong views on this.\n  I also express my appreciation to the distinguished ranking minority \nmember of the Energy Committee. He has worked very closely with me. He \nembodies the philosophy of a lot of our colleagues in that he has been \nsupportive of nuclear power in the past but believes these subsidies \nare too rich.\n  I am hopeful that today Senators with varying degrees of views on the \nnuclear power issue will agree with the Congressional Budget Office, \nwill agree with the Congressional Research Service on these issues with \nrespect to the taxpayers, and support the Wyden-Sununu amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield at this time so other colleagues who have time \nconstraints may speak. I will have the opportunity to speak later in \nthe debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleague from \nOregon for his work on this amendment. I am pleased to join as a \ncosponsor. As he pointed out, this is ultimately about what kind of an \nenergy policy we want, what kind of an economic policy makes sense, and \nwhether we can do the right thing and protect taxpayers from being \nexposed to the potential liability and cost that Senator Wyden \ndescribed.\n  This provision we are trying to strike in this bill guarantees 50 \npercent of the construction costs of up to six nuclear powerplants. \nThose plants could cost anywhere from $2 to $4 billion. And any \ntaxpayer out there can simply do the math as to what kind of exposure \nthis would provide.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with the Senator from Oregon. We are \ngoing to get into the substance of this debate and the details of this \ndebate over the next couple of hours, but at this time I yield the \nfloor to the Senator from Nevada, who has been a very strong voice on \nthis and other matters having to do with energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for allowing me to speak. I have to speak at a \nmemorial service in just a short time, and but for his kindness and \ngenerosity I would have had to either miss the ability to debate this \nmatter or be late to debate this matter. So I appreciate very much the \ncomity of my friend from New Hampshire.\n  I express my appreciation to my longtime friend and colleague, \nSenator Wyden, for this legislation. I also say the way this \nlegislation has been approached is the way to approach legislation. \nThis is a bipartisan amendment. This is a good debate we are having on \nthe Senate floor.\n  My friend from New Mexico, the manager of this bill, believes very \ndeeply in the renewal of nuclear power. I understand how he feels about \nthis.\n  As I say, this is the way legislation should be handled. This is a \ngood, fair, open debate. I approach this more from an environmental \nperspective than my friend from New Hampshire does. Even though he has \nbeen here just a short period of time, the Senator from New Hampshire \nis always focused on numbers, taxpayer dollars.\n  I rise in support of this amendment offered by my colleagues, the \nSenator from Oregon and the Senator from New Hampshire. I really do \nappreciate their efforts to bring to light the tremendous financial \nrisks this Energy bill places on the backs of American working men and \nwomen and their families.\n  Let me underline and underscore, my opposition to this amendment has \nnothing to do with the longstanding, seemingly never-ending debate on \nnuclear waste. This has nothing to do with nuclear waste.\n  This Energy bill contains a provision, which this amendment would \nstrike, that would make the Federal Government the guarantor of the \ncosts of building new nuclear powerplants.\n  The Energy bill would allow the Secretary of Energy to enter into \nagreements with nuclear powerplant owners to give Federal loan \nguarantees for loans to construct new reactors or to enter into new \ncontracts for guaranteed purchases of power from these reactors.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, what we refer to as \nCBO, this is an extremely risky financial endeavor. In fact, the CBO \nconsiders ``the risk of default on such a loan guarantee to be very \nhigh--well above 50 percent.''\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\n  That means the American taxpayer will be footing the bill for \nconstruction of these nuclear powerplants, the way the Senator from \nOregon indicated we would have really a socialization of the costs and \nthe nonbenefits of this legislation. If this provision remains in the \nbill, the Federal Government will be entering into loan guarantees and \npower purchase agreements that could cost at least $14 billion.\n  CBO is not alone in its assessment of the financial risk of backing \nthe new reactor construction.\n  We have from Standard & Poor's a document I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Time for a New Start for U.S. Nuclear Energy?\n\n                            (By Peter Rigby)\n\n       Since its beginnings, commercial nuclear energy has offered \n     the tantalizing promise of clean, reliable, secure, safe, and \n     cheap energy for a modern world dependent upon electricity. \n     No one did more than Lewis Strauss, chairman of the U.S. \n     Atomic Energy Commission, to define expectations for the \n     industry when he declared in 1954 that nuclear energy would \n     one day be ``too cheap to meter.'' But the record proved far \n     different. Nuclear energy became the most expensive form of \n     generating electricity and the most controversial following \n     accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. And today's \n     electricity industry's credit problems of too much debt and \n     too many power plants will do little to invite new interest \n     in an advanced design nuclear power plant. Yet energy bills \n     circulating through the U.S. Senate and House of \n     Representatives hope to change that perception and perhaps \n     lower the credit risk sufficient enough to attract new \n     capital. Will Washington, D.C.'s new energy initiatives lower \n     the barriers to new nuclear construction? Many would like to \n     think so, but it will be an uphill battle.\n       The House version of the Energy Bill modestly ``. . . sets \n     the stage for building new nuclear reactors by reauthorizing \n     Price-Anderson. . . .'' Since 1957, the Price-Anderson Act \n     has indemnified the private sector's liability if a major \n     nuclear accident happens on the premise that no private \n     insurance carriers could provide such coverage on commercial \n     terms. Without Price-Anderson, it is difficult to envision \n     how nuclear plants could operate commercially, now or in the \n     future. The more ambitious Senate version of the Energy Bill \n     seeks to jump-start new nuclear plants in the U.S. by \n     providing measurable financial resources for new projects. \n     According to the latest version of the Senate Energy Bill, \n     the Secretary of Energy could provide financial assistance to \n     supplement private sector financing if the proposed new \n     nuclear plant contributes to energy security, fuel, or \n     technology diversity or clean air attainment goals. The bill \n     would limit financial assistance to 50% of the project costs \n     with financial assistance being defined as a line of credit, \n     secured loan, loan guarantee, purchase agreement, or some \n     combination of these assistance plans.\n       In light of how well U.S. nuclear plants have generally \n     been operating recently and with promising new technology on \n     the horizon, nuclear energy would seem to have a future. \n     Currently, about 20% of the nation's electricity comes from \n     nuclear power plants. The introduction of competition and \n     deregulation in the U.S. has helped drive the nuclear fleet \n     into achieving record availabilities and load factors, as \n     independent owners have taken ownership from utilities that \n     divested generation. Even utilities that did not divest their \n     nuclear plants have experienced greatly improved performance \n     across the board. Today's nuclear power plant operation and \n     maintenance and fuel costs are remarkably low compared with \n     many fossil fuel plants--as low as 1.68 cents per kWh \n     according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Although the high-\n     profile accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl greatly \n     raised the threshold for safer operations, operating success \n     stories may overstate what may be achievable with new \n     designs. Nuclear operators in the U.S. have had a few decades \n     to work out operationsl problems, and with original debt paid \n     off, more cash resources have been dedicated to improving \n     performance. Providers of new capital for advanced, nuclear \n     energy will want some comfort that credit and operating risks \n     are covered. But the industry's legacy of cost growth, \n     technolgy problems, cumbersome political and regulatory \n     oversight, and the newer risks brought about by competition \n     and terrorism concerns may keep credit risk too high for even \n     the Senate bill to overcome.\n\n\n                      Historic Risks Will Persist\n\n       A nuclear power plant's life cycle exposes capital \n     providers to four distinct periods of credit risk that \n     history has shown will persist. These periods are pre-\n     construction, construction, operations, and decommissioning. \n     The risks tend to be asymmetrical with an enormous downside \n     bias against credit providers and little or no upside \n     benefits. To attrack new capital, future developers will have \n     to demonstrate that the risks no longer exist or that the \n     provisions of the Energy Bill can effectively mitigate the \n     risks.\n       During a nuclear plant's pre-construction, phase, lenders, \n     as they do with other projects, face the risks of cost growth \n     and delay. When nuclear engineers encountered technology \n     problems during the planning stages in the 1960s and 1970s, \n     solutions inevitably resulted in scope changes or re-designs, \n     or both. A 1979 Rand Corp. study for the U.S. Dept. of Energy \n     still serves as a warning to investors in new, untested \n     nuclear technology. The study found that cost budget \n     estimates grew on average 114% over first estimates and that \n     final actual costs exceeded those estimates by 141%. Half of \n     the plants in the study never reached commercial operations. \n     An extreme example of delays and cost overruns, which remains \n     fresh in investors' minds, is Long Island Lighting Co.'s \n     Shoreham nuclear power station. Begun in 1965 at an initial \n     cost estimate of $65 million-$75 million, Shoreham endured 20 \n     years of construction delays and design changes due to legal \n     battles, local opposition, regulatory and political \n     intervention, and technical problems that pushed the final \n     cost to almost $6 billion. In the end, a complete and fully \n     licensed power plant never went operational, and ratepayers, \n     investors, and taxpayers are still footing the bill. Another \n     example is TXU Corp.'s 2,300 MW Comanche Peak Units 1 and 2, \n     which took longer than any nuclear plant to build and saw \n     costs mushroom to nearly $12 billion by the time full \n     operations began in 1993.\n       That no new nuclear plant construction has begun in the \n     U.S. for over 2 years suggests that a new one would be \n     susceptible to cost growth risk as engineers incorporate \n     advances in control and power systems, fuel systems, safety \n     and regulatory requirements (which could become more onerous \n     during the years of design and construction), material \n     sciences and information technology. Even promising new \n     designs, such as the pebble bed reactor (PBR) design that \n     Eskom Holdings Ltd. of South Africa plans to build soon, \n     would likely risk design changes and attendant cost growth \n     if built in the U.S. Cost growth and delay can also arise \n     from design and scope changes due to the efforts of \n     effective interveners, such as the anti-nuclear citizen \n     activist groups that successfully delayed Shoreham and \n     ultimately prevented it from going commercial.\n       History also suggests that the construction and start-up \n     phases of new nuclear power will likely encounter problems \n     that will result in increased costs and delays. Licensing \n     delays, construction management problem procurement holdups, \n     troubles with new technologies and construction defects, \n     among other problems extended construction beyond 10 years \n     for some U.S. nuclear power plants. It would be overly heroic \n     to assume that the first nuclear plant to be built in more \n     than two decades would escape the industry's legacy of \n     construction problems. For a debt-financed construction \n     endeavor, likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars \n     (possibly into the billion dollar plus range), these \n     problems, or even the possibility of such problems, will \n     likely drive risk-averse lender to demand a significant risk \n     premium unless a third party assumes completion and delay \n     risks. In the world of cost-of-service, rate-of-return \n     environments, utilities could, and did, pass these costs onto \n     ratepayers to a certain extent. The bankruptcies of El Paso \n     Electric Co. and Public Service Company of New Hampshire in \n     the 1980s, however, attest to the limits of ratepayers' \n     capacity to absorb construction risk.\n       Today, no utility or independent power producer or their \n     capital provide will want to take unmitigated construction \n     risk, particularly if it is difficult to quantify. In \n     addition, given the possibility that much of the construction \n     risk of a new nuclear plant may lay outside of the \n     engineering, procurement, and construction contractor's \n     control, no contractor will want to risk its balance sheet to \n     provide the fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey construction \n     contracts that have given great certainty to the cost of \n     today's new fossil-fueled power plants. Because of the long \n     lead-time historically associated with nuclear power, \n     securing 100% financing upfront, as the industry has become \n     accustomed to, may be difficult. That could introduce \n     financing risks if projects encounter problems during \n     construction; delays in securing final financing would, among \n     other problems, drive up capitalized interest costs during \n     construction and ultimately the project's cost.\n       While U.S. nuclear power plants have operated without major \n     mishap for over 20 years, unexpected costs during the \n     operational phase of a nuclear plant can be substantial. And \n     it is unclear whether and if proposed government programs \n     will be able, or willing, to offset the risk of these costs. \n     Still, today's operators have demonstrated that they can \n     safely operate older nuclear power plants. Yet the potential \n     that incidents,such as last year's wholly unanticipated \n     corrosion problem at FirstEnergy Corp's Davis Besse 900 MW \n     plant, are not unique, one-time affairs will keep credit risk \n     high for nuclear plant owners. In addition, investors will \n     remember that the Davis Besse repair costs of about $400 \n     million, not including replacement power, are unrecoverable \n     from ratepayers, leaving investors to shoulder the costs, \n     incidentally, had the outage occurred during a period of high \n     power prices and tight supply, as was the case two years ago, \n     the cost to investors would have been much higher.\n       Decommissioning costs, which entail the considerable \n     expense of tearing down a plant and safely disposing or \n     storing the radioactive waste, remain uncertain at best given\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\n     how few U.S. nuclear plants have undergone decommissioning. \n     Progress toward creating a permanent disposal site for \n     nuclear waste at the government's Yucca Mountain site in \n     Nevada will help mitigate decommissioning risk, as well as \n     spent fuel disposal costs. Again, it is not clear who will \n     bear decommissioning costs, but if lenders foresee any lender \n     liability risk, they will steer clear of new nuclear \n     investments or require steep compensation. That, as a point \n     aside, may be one of the reasons so many plants have been \n     granted license extensions. Refurbishing a depreciated \n     nuclear power plant costs far less than decommissioning one.\n       Finally, for many of the reasons described above and all \n     else being equal, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has \n     found that an electric utility with a nuclear exposure has \n     weaker credit than one without and can expect to pay more on \n     the margin for credit. Federal support of construction costs \n     will do little to change that reality. Therefore, were a \n     utility to embark on a new or expanded nuclear endeavor, \n     Standard & Poor's would likely revisit its rating on the \n     utility.\n\n\n          competition introduces new risks for nuclear energy\n\n       As electricity deregulation and industry reform have \n     progressed, capital providers to the nuclear power sector \n     face some of the same risks as capital providers to other \n     power generation technologies. Again, if policymakers want to \n     attract capital to the industry, lenders in particular will \n     likely have to be convinced that at least some of the risks \n     are covered or mitigated. The sheer size of most new nuclear \n     investments suggests that downside risk for lenders could be \n     considerable indeed.\n       Clearly, buying and selling electricity in a competitive \n     environment comes with its risks, both market and political. \n     The wake of California's electricity reform problems forced \n     one utility into bankruptcy and brought another to the brink \n     of bankruptcy. Independent power producers are resisting \n     efforts by California and its Department of Water Resources \n     to abrogate or renegotiate recently executed power sales \n     agreements. These events, combined with the credit crunch \n     that has hit many other utilities and energy merchants, have \n     understandably moved public utility commissioners and capital \n     providers into more risk-averse postures. Absent these \n     problems, nuclear power would still be challenged to attract \n     new capital; in this environment, however, the task is all \n     the more difficult. Competition has dramatically shifted \n     risks from ratepayers to lenders and other investors; that is \n     not likely to change.\n       In a competitive wholesale power environment, nuclear \n     plants would likely sell power as a base load generator \n     behind hydroelectric and ahead of coal and gas. Capital costs \n     would be higher than coal plants and much higher than natural \n     gas plants, but marginal operating costs would be very low, \n     as they are now. Nonetheless, an owner of a new nuclear plant \n     would likely want a long-term--20 years or more--\n     power contract with a creditworthy utility to ensure that \n     fixed and variable cost are covered in order to attract \n     the massive amount of capital needed for construction. \n     Alternatively, a utility that wants to add a new nuclear \n     plant to its portfolio would need regulatory assurances \n     from its public utility commission that the entire cost of \n     the plant would be recoverable from its rate base. In the \n     first instance, few utilities, or their regulators, want \n     such long-term contract obligations, especially in an \n     environment of excess generation that can be purchased on \n     the cheap. That gas costs and clean-air compliance costs \n     could be on the rise might offset some of those concerns. \n     For some of the same reasons, public utility commissioners \n     may not be so forthcoming with their authority to grant \n     rate-based treatment of a new nuclear plant, especially in \n     the preconstruction period if cost growth risk remains \n     uncovered. For many commissioners, the all-in costs of \n     alternative generation will likely seem more predictable \n     and cheaper than a new nuclear plant.\n       The current backlash against regulatory reform and open \n     markets in parts of the country could also put a new nuclear \n     plant at risk. A large, new nuclear plant will typically need \n     access to a large electrical network with a geographically \n     dispersed customer group--the network that a structured \n     regional transmission organization, as envisioned by FERC, \n     could provide. However, if transmission access is limited or \n     if states have chosen to maintain barriers to electricity \n     trading and marketing, physical or otherwise, as many have, a \n     new nuclear power plant may find itself operating within a \n     much smaller system, a situation that could raise its credit \n     risk, all else being equal. One obvious mitigant to this rise \n     would be to build much smaller nuclear plants, such as the \n     100-MW modular PBR designs.\n       Whether a new nuclear plant is financed directly from the \n     wallets of captive ratepayers or with long-term contracts, a \n     large nuclear plant's size relative to its market raises \n     outage-cost risk. A nuclear plant with a long-term power \n     contract will likely contain provisions to provide \n     replacement power, or the financial equivalent, if the plant \n     becomes temporarily unavailable. Given nuclear power's \n     vulnerability to rare, but extended forced outages, \n     replacement power costs for 1,000-2,000 MW of base load power \n     could be considerable, which would factor into credit risk. \n     Similarly, a utility that owns a large nuclear station could \n     find itself spending hundreds of millions of dollars to cover \n     its short position while its station was down without \n     assurances of recovery from ratepayers. Again, smaller PBRs \n     would mitigate this risk.\n       Some the preliminary provisions of the Senate Energy Bill \n     contemplate some of these risks. A long-term power contract, \n     for example, with the federal government that covers 50% of \n     the plant's costs might mitigate some of concerns of \n     operating in a competitive environment. Similarly, loan \n     guarantees or lines of credit could also offset the costs. \n     However, if gas- and coal-fired plants can be built for much \n     less (e.g., 50% less) and the operational risk of extended \n     nuclear plant outages remains uncovered, a government program \n     could fall short of relieving investors' credit concerns. \n     Moreover, as with any government subsidy program, offenders \n     would invariably factor U.S. government counterparty risk in \n     the form of subsidy re-authorization uncertainty. Would the \n     programs envisioned by the Senate bill last through the \n     capital recovery period? Maybe. Maybe not.\n       A new risk for nuclear energy that has caught everyone's \n     attention is terrorism. Because of the dangers that nuclear \n     energy brings, security and insurance costs for nuclear \n     facilities--new and old--are much higher than for fossil or \n     renewable power plants. Therefore, in a competitive power \n     environment, stakeholders in power generation may be \n     reluctant to assume new risks that cost more to mitigate. \n     Again, if a government subsidy can put security costs for new \n     nuclear plants on an even playing field with conventional \n     power generation, the industry could attract new capital. \n     However, most new programs envisioned by Washington only \n     address the construction risk.\n       As a note aside, some power generators and utilities may \n     oppose efforts to support new U.S. nuclear generation \n     capacity beyond existing subsidies, such as Price-Andersen, \n     if they are heavily invested in coal and gas. New nuclear \n     energy's low variable operating costs would likely displace \n     existing coal-fired and gas-fired generation units in today's \n     environment. It will do little, however, to displace oil-\n     fired generation or lower U.S. oil imports because so little \n     electricity, about 2% of the U.S. load, is actually generated \n     by oil and much of that is for peak load, which nuclear \n     energy would not serve anyway. But for stakeholders--\n     investors, state politicians and regulators, lenders, \n     customers--the risk that new nuclear generation could strand \n     investment in conventional fossil-fuel-fired generation may \n     be unacceptable unless the government provides financial \n     compensation. And for a government trying to contain federal \n     spending, those costs could be prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n                an energy bill could mitigate the risks\n\n       To attract new capital to build the next generation of \n     nuclear power plants in the U.S., developers will need to \n     convince capital providers that the following risks are not \n     materially greater than for fossil fuel power plants:\n       The expense of cost growth, scope change, technology risk \n     and start-up delay.\n       The costs of unforeseen design problems that manifest \n     themselves well after commercial operations begin.\n       The costs resulting from the activities of effective \n     interveners.\n       The costs resulting from regulatory changes, including \n     growth in oversight and compliance costs.\n       The cost arising from forced outages in a competitive \n     wholesale environment.\n       The costs of replacing credit counterparties who are \n     unwilling or unable to honor obligations or commitments upon \n     which a nuclear plant's financing decisions were made.\n       The added and uncertain expense of providing insurance and \n     terrorism protection that nuclear plants need and that would \n     disadvantage a nuclear plant operating in a \n     competitive wholesale market.\n       The versions of the Energy Bill circulating around Capital \n     Hill may indeed mitigate enough of the risks that would \n     otherwise dissuade investors from financing new nuclear \n     capacity. The key drivers will be not so much in the broad \n     generalities of the authorizing legislation, but the details \n     of the enabling regulations promulgated by the Department of \n     Energy. That could take some time to draft. However, the \n     Senate markup of the bill appears to recognize the issues. \n     Absent an affordable alternative, if Price-Anderson is not \n     re-authorized, existing nuclear power plants could be forced \n     to close because of the potential liability of an accident \n     that could run into the billions of dollars. Beyond Price-\n     Anderson, however, considerable government financial support \n     will like be needed to attract capital, given the perceived \n     credit risks.\n       The proposed Energy Act's subtitle section, the ``Nuclear \n     Energy Finance Act of 2003.'' provides support for ``advanced \n     reactor designs'' that covers reactors that enhance safety, \n     efficiency, proliferation resistance, or waste reduction \n     compared with existing commercial nuclear reactors in the \n     U.S. In addition, financial support would consider ``eligible \n     costs'' that would cover costs incurred by a project \n     developer to develop and construct a nuclear plant, including \n     costs arising from regulatory and licensing delays. Financial \n     assistance may take the form of a loan guarantee of principal \n     and interest, a power purchase agreement, or some combination \n     of both.\n       The government's proposed support of new nuclear \n     construction will come with limits.\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\n     The objective is to cover the risks of new nuclear general \n     technology and construction until capital providers gain \n     confidence that a new generation of nuclear power plants is \n     commercially sustainable. The act would limit support to 50% \n     of eligible project costs and to the first 8,400 MW of new \n     nuclear generation. The 50% limit would certainly control the \n     government's exposure, as well as mitigate the risks of moral \n     hazard that a complete guarantee would invite. However, as \n     the industry has learned, some of the costs that could \n     undermine new nuclear power are not those of construction and \n     design, but are the operational ones that could arise after \n     government assistance has ended. In addition, given the risk \n     of cost growth and the likely high capital costs of a new \n     nuclear plant, a 50% level of financial assistance may not be \n     enough to entice a developer comparing uncertain estimates of \n     $1,500-$2,000 per kW capital cost of a new generation nuclear \n     plant with more certain $500 per kW combined-cycle gas \n     turbine or $1,000 per kW coal capital costs.\n       Whether or not the nuclear energy provisions of the \n     Senate's version of the Energy Bill are good ecomonic or \n     energy policy is beyond the scope or intent of this article. \n     New nuclear energy has compelling attributes, such as \n     supporting energy diversity, replacing an aging U.S. nuclear \n     fleet, offsetting rising natural gas prices, and reducing \n     greenhouse gases and NOX, SOX, and \n     particulate airborne pollutants. Once the capital costs are \n     sunk, the variable operating cost can indeed be quite low. \n     However, nuclear power tends to raise credit risk concerns \n     during construction and well after construction. Investors, \n     particularly lenders who rarely see any upside potential in \n     cutting-edge technology investments, including energy, will \n     likely find the potential downside credit risk of an \n     advanced, nuclear power plan too much to bear unless a third \n     party can cover some of the risks. An Energy Bill that covers \n     advanced design nuclear plant construction risk may go a long \n     way toward allaying those concerns, but if operational and \n     decommissioning risks remain uncovered, look for lenders to \n     sit this opportunity out.\n\n  Mr. REID. I will only read one sentence:\n\n       But the industry's legacy of cost growth, technology \n     problems, cumbersome political and regulatory oversight, and \n     the newer risks brought about by competition and terrorism \n     concerns may keep credit risk too high for even the Senate to \n     overcome.\n\n  In addition, we have the Economist magazine of May 19 which says, \namong other things:\n\n       That is why the real argument over nuclear's future should \n     rest on economics. Given the industry's history of cost \n     overruns and wasted billions, the claim of dramatically \n     improved economics would, if true, support a revival. Alas, \n     as our special report makes clear . . . the claim is dubious.\n       Why in the world should a mature, well-capitalized industry \n     receive subsidies, such as government liability insurance or \n     help the costs of waste disposal and decommissioning?\n\n  The article closes by saying:\n\n       If the private sector wishes to build new nuclear plants in \n     an open and competitive energy market, more power to it. As \n     subsidies are withdrawn, however, that possibility will \n     become ever less likely. Nuclear power, which early advocates \n     thought would be ``too cheap to meter'', is more likely to be \n     remembered as too costly to matter.\n\n  These statements hardly sound like a sound investment for the Federal \nGovernment to make at this time. The simple truth is if investors on \nWall Street won't invest in new nuclear powerplants, we should not \nforce the families on Main Street to back them with their hard-earned \nincome. We have an obligation to protect the American taxpayer from \nhaving his or her money guarantee investments by the Federal Government \nin these risky programs. This amendment is not about whether you \nsupport or oppose nuclear power; it is about keeping the Federal \nGovernment from making risky investments.\n  A wide range of national taxpayer, environmental, and public interest \ngroups understand these risks. That is why more than a dozen of these \ngroups signed a letter supporting the Wyden-Sununu amendment. The \ngroups include the National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common \nSense, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, the U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group, and the National Resources Defense Counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from these organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Support Wyden-Sununu-Bingaman-Ensign amendment To Strike Taxpayer \n                   Financing for New Nuclear Reactors\n\n                                                     June 5, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: As national taxpayer, public interest, and \n     environmental organizations, we are writing in support of the \n     Wyden-Sununu-Bingaman-Ensign amendment to strike Title IV, \n     Subtitle B from S. 14, the ``Energy Policy Act of 2003.'' \n     This irresponsible provision makes taxpayers liable for up to \n     half the cost of constructing new reactors, a new and \n     unprecedented extreme in the long history of subsidizing the \n     mature nuclear industry. We urge you to support the Wyden-\n     Sununu-Bingaman-Ensign amendment to strike Title IV, Subtitle \n     B of S. 14.\n       Subtitle B authorizes the Department of Energy to provide \n     federal loan guarantees to finance half the cost of bringing \n     on line an additional 8,400 megawatts of nuclear energy) \n     amounting to an estimated taxpayer subsidy of $14 to $16 \n     billion. There are no guidelines regarding interest rates and \n     repayment for the loan guarantees, and the Congressional \n     Budget Office considers the risk of default on such a loan \n     guarantee to be ``very high--well above 50 percent.''\n       Additionally, this provision authorizes the federal \n     government to enter into purchase agreements to buy power \n     back from these new reactors. The legislation does not state \n     how much energy the federal government will purchase and at \n     what rate, but Department of Energy documents recommend that \n     the federal government contract to purchase nuclear power at \n     above market rates. Offering these subsidies to a mature \n     industry would further distort electricity markets by \n     granting nuclear power an unfair and undesirable advantage \n     over other energy alternatives.\n       Even the first nuclear reactors did not require this level \n     of taxpayer financing. Since then, federal taxpayers have \n     already provided $66 billion in research and development \n     subsidies to the nuclear power industry. Nearly five decades \n     and more than 100 reactors later, it is time for the industry \n     to support itself. If proposed new reactors are as economical \n     as the industry claims, they should be able to finance them \n     privately.\n       There is no justification for providing the mature nuclear \n     industry with these massive subsidies.

The nuclear power industry is a mature, developed industry. \nIt has had more than 30 years to convince the wizards on Wall Street of \nits financial merit. The truth is Wall Street is not convinced, and \nuntil Wall Street is convinced, Congress should stay out of the risky \nfinancial deals.\n  The New York Times today had an article about the empty energy bill. \nOne of the paragraphs from the New York Times article reads:\n\n       The biggest addition to this dreary lineup [of matters in \n     this bill] is a huge $30 billion subsidy for nuclear power.\n\n  It goes on to say that this is simply bad. Even pronuclear allies \nregard this package as being excessive.\n  The Washington Post today says:\n\n       . . . taxpayers should not be asked to provide subsidies \n     for new nuclear power plants either. As it stands, Senate \n     legislation would provide loan guarantees for up to half of \n     the construction costs of new nuclear plants.\n       If the Senate wants to encourage nuclear power plant \n     construction, it should find means to do so that don't risk \n     such a high price to the [American] taxpayer.\n\n  I don't believe my colleagues should guarantee these loans, and that \nis what we are doing. They wouldn't do it with their own money, so we \nshould not allow the Federal Government to do it with taxpayer money.\n  I commend and applaud the sponsors of the amendment, the Senator from \nOregon and the Senator from New Hampshire. I hope their amendment will \npass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly also in support of \nthe amendment by Senator Wyden and Senator Sununu. This is an amendment \nI offered in the committee markup with Senator Wyden. We were not \nsuccessful at that time, obviously. I congratulate both sponsors of the \namendment for offering it again here.\n  Clearly, I am not opposed to the building of new nuclear powerplants. \nI believe nuclear power makes a very major contribution to our energy \nneeds. It supplies about 20 percent of our Nation's electricity today. \nIt does so safely. It does so reliably. It does not generate greenhouse \ngases. And it does so at prices that are competitive with coal and \nnatural gas.\n  I hope in the future we will see additional nuclear power production \nin this country and worldwide. I think it is a technology that provides \nmany benefits to us.\n  There are provisions in the bill that are strongly in support of the \nnuclear power industry and its future: The renewal of the Price-\nAnderson Act, for example, that protects the nuclear industry against \nliability from accidents. There are provisions in there to carry out \nresearch and development to help with the training of a workforce. \nThere are many provisions in this bill that are very strongly in \nsupport of the nuclear power industry.\n  The provision this amendment goes to would authorize the Secretary of \nEnergy to guarantee up to half the cost of 8,400 megawatts of nuclear \ncapacity. That translates into at least six large nuclear powerplants. \nWe do not know with any precision how much these loan guarantees would \nwind up costing taxpayers. That depends on many variables, such as how \nmany plants are actually built under the program, how much they cost, \nwhether in fact there is a default, what the interest rates might be on \nthe defaulted loans, whether the plants would still be able to operate \nif there were default.\n\n  There is a lot of uncertainty in the provision that is the subject of \nthis debate. The Congressional Budget Office has made a number of \nassumptions that are favorable to the industry in coming up with its \nestimate. It assumes, for example, that the Government would only \nguarantee one, not six, plants during the next 10 years. It also \nassumes that it would cost about half as much as Seabrook and Shoreham \ndid two decades ago and that it would still be able to operate after a \ndefault. Under these assumptions, CBO has concluded that the loan \nguarantees would cost in the range of $275 million for the one plant.\n  The Nuclear Energy Institute takes strong exception to these \nCongressional Budget Office conclusions. NEI doubts the industry will \ndefault on its loans. It believes CBO's estimate is based on \nnoncredible, illogical assumptions and that the CBO estimate is \nunrealistically high.\n  So we have experts on all sides of this issue. The debate is \nimportant, but I do think it glosses over some of the fundamental \nquestions: Does this nuclear power industry need these loan guarantees \nat this point? Is guaranteeing the nuclear power industry's loans sound \npublic policy? On both of those issues, I believe the preponderance of \nthe argument is on the side of the Wyden-Sununu amendment. I do not \nbelieve loan guarantees are necessary in this magnitude at this time.\n  This is a mature industry. We have been building nuclear powerplants \nin this country for nearly half a century. We have over 100 nuclear \npowerplants now operating. The nuclear industry did not need loan \nguarantees to get off the ground 50 years ago, and I do not believe \nthose guarantees are required at this point.\n  Moreover, the companies that are most likely to build these new \nnuclear powerplants are the ones that have built them before and the \nones that are operating them now. These are not small businesses.\n  As a result of the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, there are \na dozen utilities that now own 75 percent of the Nation's nuclear \ncapacity and two-thirds of its nuclear reactors. Each of these \nutilities generates billions of dollars in revenues each year. Many \ngenerate tens of billions of dollars in revenue each year. \nCollectively, these 12 utilities had nearly $12 billion in revenues in \n2001.\n  There is no evidence of which I am aware in the record before us that \nthe nuclear industry needs loan guarantees of this magnitude to build \nnew nuclear powerplants. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nheld hearings on the state of the nuclear industry in the past \nCongress. We heard from both the utility industry and the financial \ncommunity, and neither one suggested that loan guarantees were \nappropriate or required.\n  The utility representative said that the state of the nuclear \nindustry is ``very sound'' and that new plants would be ``economically \ncompetitive'' and acceptable to investors. The Wall Street \nrepresentative at our committee hearing testified that a large \nsuccessful utility could finance the construction of a new nuclear \npowerplant, and nobody mentioned the need for a Federal loan program of \nthis type or a loan guarantee program of this type.\n  Second, I do not believe that shifting the financial risk of \nconstructing these plants from industry to the Federal Government or to \nthe taxpayers is sound public policy.\n  For most of the last century, utilities built powerplants in this \ncountry, whether nuclear or non-nuclear plants, under what is called \nthe regulatory compact. Utilities were State-regulated monopolies. They \naccepted an obligation to serve everyone in their service territories \nat State-set rates. In return, they were shielded from competition. \nThey were guaranteed recovery of their prudently incurred costs plus a \nreasonable profit.\n  The regulatory compact has largely been abandoned in this country \nduring the last couple of decades. It has been replaced by deregulated, \ncompetitive, wholesale electricity markets. So instead of wholesale \nelectricity prices being set based on the utility's cost of production, \nthey are now being set more by the market, and title XI of the bill \nbefore us is intended to further these developments.\n  Giving Government loan guarantees of this magnitude to one segment of \nthe utility industry--indeed one of the better financed segments of the \nindustry--I think unduly interferes with the\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nfree market. It runs counter to efforts to establish competitive \nelectricity markets in this country.\n  In a competitive market, utilities are supposed to decide whether to \nbuild new powerplants by weighing the economic risk involved against \nthe economic reward they might receive. Loan guarantees skew the market \nby shifting the risk to the taxpayers while keeping the rewards for the \nutility shareholders.\n\n  We have had this debate before, 50 years ago, at the dawn of the \nnuclear era. The House and Senate debated whether nuclear powerplants \nshould be built and operated by the private sector or by the \nGovernment. The decision was made to leave the construction and \noperation of nuclear powerplants to the utilities, to the private \nsector.\n  The Federal Government encouraged support of the utilities through \nnuclear research programs, through fuel subsidies, and through \nindemnification against accidents. It did not use loans or grants or \nloan guarantees.\n  The Federal Government's faith in the utilities 50 years ago was \njustified as the more than 100 nuclear powerplants operating today \nattest, and we should continue to have faith in the free market today \nand not subsidize the next generation of nuclear powerplants to this \nextent by shifting economic risks from utility shareholders to the \ntaxpayers.\n  I urge colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, for his comments and his very well-reasoned \nargument on behalf of our amendment.\n  As I indicated in my earlier comments, this is part and parcel of a \ndebate as to what an energy policy really should be in our country. I \nsupport a number of initiatives that I think would help ensure access \nto stable, reliable sources of energy for our country's economy so it \ncan continue to grow. That means conservation, and we just had an \namendment that sets a target of conserving some 1 billion gallons of \ngasoline in our automotive industries over the next decade.\n  We also need to make sure we have good, sound infrastructure for \ntransporting electricity or natural gas across State lines and around \nthe country. We want a good strong electricity title. That has been the \neffort and the work of the Energy Committee. We need to make sure we \nstreamline and reduce unnecessary regulations. I will come back to this \npoint shortly, but that is one of the real problems the nuclear \nindustry faces right now: uncertainty due to complexity in the \nregulatory environment where the process of building or licensing a \nplant can be halted multiple times throughout the licensing process.\n  Of course, I believe, as I hope most Americans do, that we need \naccess to new energy sources and new energy reserves, and that is why I \nsupported exploration in the northern slope of Alaska.\n  At the same time, we need to be careful that our energy policy is not \nabout trying to pick winners and losers in the energy markets; that we \nnot digress toward a subsidy ``arms race.'' We heard people argue if we \ngive a subsidy to this industry, we should give it to another, tax \ncredits there or how about a subsidy here. We should not have a subsidy \n``arms race'' where we burden the taxpayers because that is who is \npaying for all of this policy, giving out subsidies to industries that \nare favored at a particular point in time. And we certainly should not \nsingle out an industry, as unfortunately a portion of this bill does, \nfor an unprecedented loan guarantee, unprecedented taxpayer guarantees \nfor the construction of new powerplants. Whether this is targeted at \nthe coal-fired electricity industry or natural gas-fired plants or, as \nin this case, nuclear plants, I think it is questionable public policy \nto provide such loan guarantees.\n\n  We are putting the taxpayer at risk, and we can call five different \neconomists to try to estimate the size and scope of that risk, but the \nprovision of the bill we seek to strike allows the Secretary of Energy \nto provide loan guarantees for up to half the cost of up to six plants. \nThat is 50 percent of the cost for six plants, each perhaps costing \nbetween $2 billion and $4 billion. That is a $10 billion to $15 billion \nsubsidy.\n  The Congressional Research Service, which is about as nonpartisan as \nyou can get, states that the maximum Federal cost will be in the range \nof $14 billion to $16 billion in 2002 dollars. The Congressional Budget \nOffice states that the risk of default on these guarantees would be \nquite high, well above 50 percent.\n  It is difficult to forecast risk. It is difficult to forecast cost. \nWhether these were guarantees for 25 percent of the cost or 50 or 100 \npercent or for one plant or for 71 plants, my concerns and I think the \nconcerns of the Senator from Oregon would still be the same: this sets \na bad precedent in singling out one industry for this type of a \nconstruction loan guarantee. It sets a bad precedent because in all \nlikelihood other areas of private industry would, in the long run, seek \nto be treated in the same way. Of course, it sets a bad precedent in \nthat it is an unprecedented sum, an unprecedented guarantee.\n  I would very much like to see a strong and revitalized nuclear \nindustry, and I credit the chairman of the Energy Committee for \nfocusing on this issue in his bill, extending Price-Anderson, investing \nin basic research, physics and nuclear technologies, and pushing \nforward scientific and research initiatives that he has included in the \nbill.\n  I disagree on some of the slight nuances of those provisions, whether \nthey are exactly the right size or targeted to the right areas, but I \ngive him a lot of credit for focusing on strengthening our nuclear \npower industry. I simply do not believe this kind of a guarantee is \nright for any industry. Equally important, perhaps more important, I do \nnot believe this kind of a taxpayer subsidy is right for the men and \nwomen of our nation who are working long and hard, sending their taxes \nto Washington, and expecting them to be used fairly and equitably.\n  There is a lot of uncertainty in the energy markets and in the \nnuclear power industry in particular, and we can ask the question why \nare not more plants being built, why have we not had a new plant \nlicensed in over 20 years? I think the answer can be found in the \nuncertainty and the risk created by the regulatory markets, created by \nthe litigious society that we live in and the fact that the licensing \nprocess can be brought to a dead halt time and again. Whether or not we \nhave the technology that would allow us to build a nuclear powerplant \nfor $100 million or $500 million versus $2 billion, this uncertainty is \nenough to discourage capital markets from lending to the large private \ncompanies that are engaged in the nuclear power industry.\n  I think we will not find private resources being attracted to the \nnuclear industry, and we should not find taxpayer resources subsidizing \nthe industry, until something is done about that uncertainty and that \nregulatory complexity.\n  We have an interest rate environment right now that benefits anyone \nbuilding anything just about anywhere in our country, the lowest \ninterest rates in 40 years. That is about as big as an incentive as one \ncould possibly have for undertaking new construction projects. I \ncertainly do not believe we need to put the taxpayers on the hook in \norder to provide even more incentive.\n  We are reaching out trying to protect the taxpayers, trying to do the \nright thing, I think trying to make this bill better and trying to set \na good precedent. Again, I thank Ron Wyden, the Senator from Oregon, \nfor his work. We have bipartisan support for this amendment, three \nRepublican and three Democrat cosponsors. As we move toward a vote, I \nthink we will see bipartisan support for the amendment.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the committee for being thoughtful \nenough to work with us so we could get a consent agreement to bring \nthis amendment up today, to have a fair and thoughtful debate, and to \nbe able to have a straight up-or-down vote on the amendment at the \nconclusion of the debate. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I might speak with the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon about the\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\nfinal vote. We are wondering, from our side, for no reasons other than \ntime--the more time we have left, the more we might get done--whether \nwe might be able to vote at 3:45 instead of 4:15, saving half an hour. \nWe would be delighted to not ask the Senator to give up very much of \nthat time but I wonder if he would consider a consent agreement for \n3:45, which will give us, instead of our hour, 40 minutes, and what is \nleft would belong to the Senator, or 35 minutes. Would that be fair \nenough for the Senator?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to be accommodating to the distinguished chairman \nof the committee. Let me spend a couple of minutes looking into it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will try to ascertain how many Senators on our side of \nthe proposition would like to speak, but the Senator has always been \nfair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's not agree. Let's put that before them as a \npossibility. Right now we are exploring the notion of voting at 3:45 \ninstead of 4:15. If we did that, we would allocate the time away from \neach hour in order to get there. In the meantime, we will both ask our \ncloakrooms if there is any problems with any Senators. The Senator from \nOregon will do it on his side and I will do it on mine.\n  Mr. President, I assume I can speak at this point; I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think we may need to go to 4 rather than 3:45, but I \nwill try to accommodate the distinguished chairman. We will spend some \ntime checking his desire to move the legislation, which has transcended \nany particular amendment, and we are anxious to accommodate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For the benefit of the Senators who would like to \nspeak, Senator Alexander has indicated a desire to speak for a few \nmoments. He is here. Senator Voinovich, who occupies the chair, desires \nto speak; Senator Landrieu, from the other side of the aisle, desires \nto speak. Senator Inhofe and Senator Larry Craig.\n  I say to all of them, if they would let us know through the \ncloakroom, we will try to put some times opposite their names. We will \nbe using 4 as kind of our scheduling time to see what we can do about \nsetting up a time.\n  Would the Senator from Tennessee like to speak at this time or would \nhe rather that the Senator from New Mexico speak for a few moments?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will listen to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I will try to be brief.\n  My colleagues know I have been in the Senate 31 years and that for \nthe better part of that time I spent my time on energy matters but \nprincipally, from the standpoint of the floor of the Senate, I was \nknown as the person who handled the budget for the Senate. That is \nwhere I had the luxury and privilege of meeting the distinguished \nSenator, who opposes me on the floor, Mr. Wyden, and many others who \nserve with me. In fact, that is where I became a very good friend of \nthe distinguished majority leader of the Senate, who served, as the \nSenator might recall, on that Budget Committee way down at the end of \nthe Republican side. One of the Senators who served for most of that \ntime, that the Senator from Oregon will recognize and remember, was \nprobably one of the most astute and knowledgeable Senators who we have \nboth had the luxury of knowing. We might both put some other attributes \nalong with those but he was that, and that was Senator Gramm of Texas.\n\n  One day I was exploring a matter with the Senator from Texas. I said: \nSenator, you know I have been on this Budget Committee for so long, and \nI am thinking about moving over to the Energy Committee where I have \nbeen in the second position for all of these years. You are from Texas \nand I noticed you never did bother to even get on the Energy Committee.\n  He said: Yes, that is right.\n  I said: Why is that?\n  Listen carefully. He said: Senator Pete, energy is one of the most \ndifficult things to do anything about, nigh on impossible to effect by \nlaw any real policy regarding energy, if you are talking about advanced \npolicy that has any impact.\n  I said: Well, Senator Gramm, I might agree with you but--and before I \ncould finish he said: However, I would like to correct that and say one \nthing to you.\n  Now, this was 5 years ago.\n  Senator Domenici, there is indeed a probability that you can do \nsomething if you take over the Energy Committee, and I tell you for \nsure there is only one thing and that is to reestablish nuclear power \nas an option for these United States and the world.\n  I wish he were here. I am not quoting him exactly so do not put it in \nquotes, but he would remember that.\n  When I decided to take this job and give up the Budget Committee, I \nremembered that and I even told my wife, when discussing at home my \nnext few years in the Senate, that some pretty good people think I am \ntaking on a committee that does not have a lot of potential because \nenergy is too tough to legislate and make policy about. It just sort of \nhappens, except for that rascal nuclear power.\n  Well, he said it. He may not be right but I am trying to prove him \nright in this debate today and in this Energy bill that we are going to \ntry to finish this week, perhaps with 1 additional week.\n  On May 21 of this year, Alan Greenspan, speaking to the House Energy \nCommittee, said: If we're going to continue to expand our energy base, \nwe're going to have to be starting to look at nuclear power as a \npotential reservoir of new sources of energy which are not available by \nother means.\n  He continues: I think that we ought to be spending more money and \nmore time looking and contemplating the issue of nuclear power since \nnatural gas is a serious problem.\n  This morning I happened to hear a talk show with typical Americans \ncalling talking about energy. It was rather nice to hear people from \nOklahoma City, from somewhere in Tennessee, California, Oregon, \nobviously average citizens who were calling in on a radio show asking \nquestions. Most questions had to do with, why don't we have more \nnatural gas? Finally someone asked, aren't there other things we can \nuse? What about nuclear power? Of course, as one might suspect, the \nanswers were rather muddled.\n  The real question now before this institution is, can nuclear power, \nheld in abeyance for about 14 to 16 years in the United States while \nJapan built new facilities, the country of France is 80 percent \ndependent upon nuclear power, a little country like Taiwan, which is \nbooming, is currently constructing two facilities with General Electric \nengineering and design--I cannot recall the name of the contractor. And \nthe United States sits with everybody saying it is almost impossible. \nWith the exponential growth in electricity needs, where we all expect \nto use natural gas in the burners, to create the heat and electricity, \nit is nearly impossible that we will have enough natural gas. It is not \na question of whether we have a lot of it. It is a question that we do \nnot use anything else because we are frightened to death of using \nanything else.\n  Some in this country, a small group, have scared us to death about \nnuclear power. When we add up all the energy produced by nuclear power \nin the world, including the terrible accident in Russia, which was \nattributable to a very old-fashioned nuclear powerplant that we would \nnot dare license in America, add these together and nuclear power has \nbeen safer than any of the other power sources combined--be it coal or \nany other--save and except for energy produced by dams. I am speaking \nof large quantities. Certainly, if we speak of windmills, we speak of \nsolar, we can produce clean energy.\n  Having said that, the issue before the Senate today is, do we want to \nsupport a committee that put together a bill that said, fellow \nAmericans, the time has come to quit playing around with energy and do \nsomething about a myriad of sources. And to say, wherever you can, we \nare going to produce more energy.\n  We have tried to produce or cause to be produced every natural gas \nsource we know of that had impediments. If it was too deep, we gave it \na benefit of some sort so it could get taken out, anyway. If it was too \nfar away in the ice lands of Alaska, we gave those companies something \nso they could get it down here. If it is coal, we said subsidize.\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\n  They are talking that we should not be granting a loan guarantee, \npresumably at market value, to a first-class company that might want to \ntake a risk at building a powerplant. They are saying we should not do \nthat. But when it comes to coal, we are going to spend over $2 billion \non pure research to try to get to that miracle place of clean coal.\n  We did not say, my, you just should not put your tax dollars in a big \nwaste.\n  Last but not least, while our opponents will find this is not \nrelevant, we already have a subsidy for wind energy, those 50-foot-tall \nwindmills. Without the new one contemplated to be added to this bill, \nthat has the potential of producing 245,000 windmills, equivalent \nsource of energy. The powerplants we contemplate lending money to, or \noffering a loan guarantee, the same amount. Guess how much the taxpayer \nwill have given if that occurs. Thirty-one billion is the direct source \nfor those windmills.\n  Now, the opposition to ours might say, but you are going to get \nwindmills. When you say to the American power industry, if you want to \ncome along and try to build a new nuclear powerplant, modern type, you \nhave to go get your money, you have to take all the risks, and we will \nunderwrite half of it with a loan, they would have us say that is a \nterrible risk even if it is only $2 billion to $5 billion. But that $31 \nbillion that might occur for windmills is not? Of course, the windmill \nis not a risk, but it certainly is throwing your money at something \nthat most Americans would wonder seriously about.\n  Having said that, this Senator is not against any of the sources. I \nthink we will win today. When we win, we will go to conference \neventually and come out with a major new impetus for nuclear power in \nthis country. For the first time somebody is going to say, let us build \none or two new nuclear powerplants. And the greenhouse gas issue that \nhas been raised will not be there because there is no pollution from \nthose two plants that I have just described, if they come into being--\nnone. Zero. Absolutely clean.\n  We are going to have to find some way to take care of the waste \nsomeday. If we want to have a debate here today, or next week, on the \nwaste, suffice it to say that the United States has scared herself \nsilly about waste. Waste is nothing but a technical problem. If you \nwant to go see all the waste in France, get a ticket and go to a city, \nask them where it is, and they will take you to a building, and you can \ngo see it all.\n  You might say: Who would want to see it?\n  They will just take you to a building that looks like a schoolhouse. \nYou walk in and say: Can I see the waste? And they will say: You are \nwalking on it. They will say: Just take a look down.\n  You look down. It looks like glass, and there sits the waste, \nencapsulated, and it will be there for as long as 50 years, if that is \nwhat is needed by the French scientists to find out how to put it away \nor how to reuse it.\n  Here we sit fooling around because somebody convinced us we ought to \nbecome immobilized, when it comes to an alternative, until we have a \nhole in the ground so deep, so big, in such hard rock that we can \nfigure out, way in advance, a way to put the waste in it and monitor it \nwith calculators and say to America and the world: We just monitored \nit, and we can tell you there will be no radiation for 10,000 years.\n  That is the test because we want to be so careful we don't hurt \nanybody ever. The test of the technology that is going to have to \nmonitor that--and you can hardly draw the plans, it is such an \nabsurdity--is 10,000 years.\n  Having said all that, we are back to a simple proposition: Do you or \ndo you not want to let the Energy Committee go to a conference with the \nHouse and to take with it a bill that says: All the rest of these \nenergies get their help: Biomass gets its assistance, coal gets its \nhelp, the renewables are helped immeasurably with tax assistance, every \nsingle thing we know how to do to produce more oil and gas is done--\nright?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I could go on and on. That is all going to be there. \nBut also in the event--and I am looking for the language in the statute \nas to when the Secretary can issue these--we have statutory language \nthat says, very simply--and I will read it and close:\n\n       Subject to the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform \n     Act [et cetera, et cetera, et cetera], the Secretary may, \n     subject to appropriations, make available to project \n     developers for eligible project costs such financial \n     assistance as the Secretary determines is necessary to \n     supplement private-sector financing for projects if he \n     determines that such projects are needed to contribute to \n     energy security, fuel or technology diversity, or clean air \n     attainment goals. The Secretary shall prescribe such terms or \n     conditions for financial assistance as the Secretary deems \n     necessary. . . .\n\n  That then is provided as up to 50 percent of the cost, by way of a \nloan.\n  Frankly, it is all a question of risks. It is not a question of \nphilosophy. It is not a question of whose party wants to get on what \nslope, a slope of entrepreneurship or a slope of guaranteeship. All of \nthat is meaningless. What this is about is: Is it worth this little \nrisk we are speaking of--to get what I just described going again \nfor America?\n\n  I say, overwhelmingly, absolutely, positively, yes. I do hope, come \nthat vote time, there will not be 50 Senators, or half of those who \nvote today, who will say we want to strike this and kill this \nopportunity for America.\n  With that, I will yield the floor to Senator Alexander for his time.\n  Senator Landrieu, are you on some time frame that is urgent?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I can yield to the Senator from Tennessee. He was here, \nof course, prior to my arrival. How much time would he like?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to him and then to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like about 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the chairman in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  In 1987 our family, which included three teenagers and a 7-year-old, \nvisited the Peace Park in Hiroshima, Japan. We thought twice before we \ntook our children there because it is such a staggering experience to \nsee what happened on that August day in World War II when the atomic \nbomb was dropped.\n  I marvel even more that today Japan, because it knows of the \nimportance of energy, now relies on nuclear energy--the same process \nthat wiped out half the lives in Hiroshima--for peace, for the peaceful \nproduction of electricity for homes and jobs for about 80 percent of \ntheir electric needs. They are producing about one new reactor a year.\n  In France, as the chairman said, about 80 percent of the electricity, \nI believe, is produced by nuclear power. We have about 100 ships in our \nNavy that operate with little nuclear reactors. Yet, for some reason, \nover the last 30 years we became afraid to start a new nuclear \npowerplant. I guess we became so accustomed to abundant supplies of \ncoal and oil and relatively cheap gasoline that we thought it would \nlast forever. But I think we have gotten over that. At least it is time \nfor us to get over that and to break away from this national attitude \nthat, since the 1970s, has kept us from starting a new nuclear \npowerplant.\n  Why not nuclear? That is the question we should be asking. We have \nheard the testimony of the terrible price increases in natural gas and \nthe projections that we have a really serious problem with continuing \nnatural gas prices.\n  This Senate voted not to go explore for more oil in Alaska.\n  Windmills are promising, but the promise of 245,000 of them to \nproduce 2 percent of our energy and to see them all over our deserts \nand ridgetops--there is some limit to what windmills will be able to do \nfor us. Coal produces half of our electricity, but it produces carbon \nand it produces pollution and we have not yet quite developed the clean \ncoal technology we all want.\n  Nuclear power more and more seems to be imperative. So what are we \ndoing about it in this bill? We are basically adding nuclear to the \narsenal of weapons we want to use to make ourselves less dependent on \nforeign oil and more likely to have clean air and a cheap and abundant \nsupply of electricity.\n  It is said that we are subsidizing the idea of nuclear power. In a \nway we are: A new type of advanced nuclear powerplant that has the \npromise of building plants for $1.5 billion--much cheaper,\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nmuch more efficient, safer, to start up that industry, to stimulate it. \nBut we are doing exactly the same thing as the chairman said with wind \npower. We are doing exactly the same kind of thing with clean coal \ntechnology to the tune of $2.2 billion. We are doing exactly the same \nthing with oil and gas, and $2.5 billion is in the bill for that.\n  This morning, we talked about putting a Presidential emphasis, thanks \nto the Senator from Louisiana, on conservation. We need to add nuclear \nto our list. The larger question would be, Why would we keep it out? \nWhy would we encourage every other form of energy and not nuclear \nenergy?\n  I strongly urge that we keep in this bill nuclear power as an option \nfor our future. There will be great discussions in this body about \ncarbon and the concern of greenhouse gases. Nuclear power is carbon \nfree. It is carbon free. There will be a lot of talk about our \ndependence on oil. The most reliable and largest opportunity to replace \noil in the next 20 years is nuclear power.\n  There is a lot of talk about the worry of natural gas prices. The \nbest way to keep natural gas prices under control is to have an \nalternative. That would be nuclear power. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto vote no on the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the pending amendment occur at 3:50 with the remaining time \nto be divided with 20 minutes for the proponents and 10 minutes under \nthe control of the opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \nwill take 3 or 4 minutes. I understand that the Senator from Alabama \nwould like to speak in opposition to the amendment as well.\n  In all due respect to my colleagues who are offering this amendment \nto strike this very important provision from the bill, I wanted to come \nto the floor to strongly disagree and to add my voice at the outset of \nthe debate and on the points which the chairman of the committee \nbrought to the fore on this very important part of the Energy bill.\n  I wish to begin by saying that our Nation has 103 nuclear \npowerplants. The nuclear industry provides 20 percent of our \nelectricity. I don't believe we will strip the Energy bill of this \nprovision, but if we did, we would jeopardize the reliable and \naffordable source of electricity that this Nation needs to stay \ncompetitive in this world economy.\n  It will cost jobs and cause hardship. People would lose their jobs \nwith this amendment.\n  I am not sure my colleagues are aware that over the next 20 years the \nUnited States doesn't need to move backwards as this amendment would \nsuggest. We need to move very quickly in the other direction. We need \nto build 1,300 new powerplants in this Nation, which is the equivalent \nof 60 to 90 new powerplants per year to keep up with the increased \ndemand of electricity. Why? Because our economy is more productive; \nbecause technology is demanding it; because good, old Yankee know-how \nmakes it crucial that we provide our businesses with electricity and \nwith power. If we don't give them power, they can't operate. If we \ndon't give them power that is reliable and affordable, then we will \nlose jobs to our international competitors. It is as simple as that. We \nneed everything and more, everything we thought of and more than we \nthought of.\n  Nuclear is a very important component of that. The amendment's \nauthors argue that this is a subsidy. It is not a subsidy. It is a loan \nguarantee. It is our intention that these loans be fully paid with \ninterest. We do this. There are 100 examples in the Federal rule book \nwhere we do this. We want to encourage the development and movement in \na certain way. We can give loan guarantees, and we have done it time \nand again. It is time we do it for the nuclear industry to keep them \nmoving in the right direction.\n  Let me say to the chairman that I went down to Louisiana. We have two \nnuclear powerplants. Seventeen percent of Louisiana's fuel is nuclear. \nAs the chairman knows, one out of five has the clean benefit of nuclear \npower.\n  My producers of natural gas said to me, Senator, please go and fight \nfor nuclear energy. If we don't get more energy into the marketplace, \nthe demands on natural gas will become so high that we cannot pay our \ngas bills, and it is driving our industry to its knees. They said, \nSenator, please go and fight for an increase in all sources, including \nnuclear.\n  Nuclear energy currently generates electricity for one in every five \nhomes and businesses.\n  It is important not only in Louisiana, where two nuclear plants \nproduce nearly 17 percent of my State's electricity, but also in States \nsuch as Connecticut, Illinois, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South \nCarolina, and Vermont where nuclear generates more electricity than any \nother source.\n  Nationwide, 103 reactors provide 20 percent of our electricity--the \nlargest source of U.S. emission-free power provided 24-7.\n  Nuclear energy is one of the most competitive sources of energy on an \noperational cost basis.\n  While I strongly support the use of natural gas for our energy needs, \nwe cannot rely, as we have in recent years, on any one source of energy \nto meet our Nation's increasing electricity demand.\n  Over the next 20 years, U.S. natural gas consumption is projected to \ngrow by over 50 percent while U.S. natural gas production will grow by \nonly 14 percent.\n  The CEO of Dow Chemical recently wrote that the chemical industry--\nthe Nation's largest industrial user of natural gas--is particularly \nvulnerable to high natural gas prices.\n  To remain an economic leader we must promote a diversified and robust \nenergy mix, including the full range of traditional and alternative \nenergy sources.\n  Nuclear energy is also vitally important for our environment and our \nNation's clean air goals.\n  Nuclear energy is the Nation's largest clean air source of \nelectricity, generating three-fourths of all emission-free electricity.\n  Nuclear energy will be an essential partner for future generations of \nAmericans, whose reliance on electricity will increase and who \nrightfully will demand a cleaner environment.\n  Just this past Sunday, the Washington Post highlighted the problems \nthat the Shenandoah National Forest now faces with pollution. Think how \nmuch worse our Nation's air pollution would be if nuclear energy did \nnot generate one fifth of our electricity.\n  To preserve our current levels of emission-free electricity \ngeneration, we must build 50,000 megawatts of new nuclear energy \nproduction by 2020.\n  In addition to providing the largest source of emission-free \nelectricity, nuclear energy possesses the most viable solution to our \nover reliance on foreign oil, i.e., the potential to someday cogenerate \nhydrogen as a clean transportation substitute to oil.\n  The Wyden amendment will hurt our Nation's long-term economic, \nenvironmental and security goals if passed.\n  Building a windmill that has a generating capacity of 2 megawatts \nshould not be compared to building a nuclear power plant that produces \n1,000 megawatts or more.\n  I agree with my ranking member that the nuclear industry is mature in \nthe sense that it has been safely, efficiently, and effectively \nproducing electricity for several decades. But we have not brought a \nnew nuclear plant on line in this country for over a decade and a new \nproject will face some uncertainties.\n  The costs of the first few plants will be higher than those that are \nbuilt later. Because the business risks will be greater for the initial \nfew projects, financing will be more difficult to obtain. That is why \nthe Federal Government needs to step in and provide an incentive to \nallow the industry to get over that hurdle.\n  Some rather large numbers have been thrown around as to the costs of \nthis provision. Were theses numbers accurate, I would share the \nconcerns voiced by my colleagues.\n  The construction costs as derived by CBO would be $2,300 per kilowatt \nof capacity is inconsistent with current cost incurred by other nations \nbuilding similar types of advanced nuclear reactors.\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\n  According to a detailed cost analysis developed by industry the first \nfew plants will cost less than $1,400 per kilowatt hour and will later \nfall to less than $1,000 per kilowatt hour, making nuclear plants very \ncompetitive with the costs of other technologies.\n  My colleagues who are opposed to these loan guarantees are assuming \nthat a new nuclear plant could rise to costs over $3,800 per killowatt, \nbased on questionable CBO projections.\n  In addition my colleagues also fail to mention that the Secretary of \nEnergy will be required to use stringent criteria to provide loan \nguarantees.\n  I concede that we probably don't know what the exact cost will be, \nbut the economic, environmental, and security benefits of investing in \nnew nuclear plants for our future generations are many and great while \nthe financial risk to the public sector is by comparison rather small. \nLet's give this idea a chance.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Wyden \namendment. And I thank the chairman for all his efforts in helping to \npromote a vital source of energy and for helping to pave the way \ntowards improving our Nation's energy security.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment on the floor to strip the provision \nin this bill, and I support the chairman's mark.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New \nMexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my deep appreciation \nto Senator Domenici. He, more than any other person in this body, \nunderstands what role nuclear power must play in America and in the \nworld if we are to maintain a clean environment and a healthy energy \nsource. In nations that have readily available electricity in the \nworld, compared to those that do not, the lifespan is twice as long.\n  This is a matter of extreme importance. We are trying to \nsimultaneously increase our power sources in America and improve the \ncleanliness of our air and protect our environment. The only way that \ncan be done is with nuclear power.\n  I feel very strongly about this. It is important for America's \neconomy. Alan Greenspan testified at the Joint Economic Committee last \nweek and raised again the crisis that we are facing in natural gas. \nNatural gas is a source for all new electric plants in America today. \nWe are driving up this tremendous demand on natural gas. If we drive up \nthe cost for natural gas, as we certainly will at the rate we are \ngoing, homeowners are going to pay so much more for their heating. \nBusinesses that use natural gas are going to have to pay twice as much. \nWe can meet that demand without any air pollution by expanding nuclear \npower.\n  There are 29 nuclear plants being built around the world. France gets \n80 percent of its power from nuclear power. Nearly 50 percent of \nJapan's power comes from nuclear power.\n  We have not built a nuclear plant in America in 20 years. It is time \nfor that to change. Twenty percent of our electricity comes from \nnuclear power producing no adverse environmental impacts to the \natmosphere.\n  I would like to read what we save for the atmosphere by having \nnuclear power. A recent study showed that nuclear energy has prevented \nthe release of 219 million tons of sulfur dioxide, 98 million tons of \nnitrogen oxide polluted in the atmosphere, and prevented the emission \ninto the air of 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide. That is considered by \nsome to be a global-warming gas. We can stop that. We may have offset \nthe effects of carbon dioxide already by producing 20 percent of our \nenergy with nuclear power.\n\n  We have to include a provision like this in the bill. Last year, I \nintroduced a bill that would provide a tax credit, similar to that for \nrenewable energy, for the production of nuclear energy. The tax credit \nwould have cost only one-fifth the amount of tax credits that other \nforms of clean energy receive, and it would have encouraged the \nproduction of a steady, reliable source of energy. The provision in \nthis bill likewise encourages nuclear energy, and I support it. I \nreject the notion that there would be a high rate of default on these \nloans. I have studied nuclear energy and I have visited plants. These \nloans are needed to provide the nuclear industry a small incentive to \ntake a big step towards constructing a plant. We need to go to \nconference with it. If we do, I would be willing to work with Senators \nwho oppose this. But I think we have to have something in this bill \nthat will allow us to encourage nuclear power. Not to do so would be a \nfailure of incredible proportions.\n  I thank the chairman. I feel very strongly about it. I thank Senator \nDomenici again for his historic leadership that can lead us into a new \nway to produce large sources of energy without pollution costs to the \nenvironment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Oregon would \nyield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, I agree with the comments of the \nSenator from Alabama that we ought to be promoting nuclear power. I am \na strong advocate of that. I compliment the chairman of committee, \nSenator Domenici, for being very strong in his support for nuclear \nenergy and for being totally consistent in the positions he has taken.\n  I want to argue against hypocrisy. An environmental group handed me a \nsheet of paper a while ago. They are very much against subsidies. As it \nturns out, a subsidy for nuclear energy would be very bad. They are \nright about arguing against subsidies. That is why I am going to \nsupport this amendment.\n  But all of the environmental arguments I have seen have been for \nsubsidies when it comes to ethanol, solar power, biomass, wind energy, \nand you name it. The point here is that we ought to be consistent. If \nyou think subsidies are a wonderful idea for these other things, then \nmaybe you ought to support the loan guarantee for this additional \nmethod of producing power. But if you think subsidies are wrong, then \nyou shouldn't support them for anything.\n  As the chairman of the committee knows, I opposed all of these \nsubsidies in the Finance Committee. I will offer amendments again to \ntry to strip them out of the finance part of the bill when it is added \nto the Energy bill on the floor.\n  I wish to make the point that if you want to be hypocritical--I am \ntalking about these organizations and not Members of the Senate--then \nfine. Oppose this subsidy for nuclear and continue to support it for \nall of the rest. But if you want to be honest about it, like the \nchairman and I, though we have come to a different conclusion, but at \nleast the chairman has been consistent and I hope I have been \nconsistent.\n  I oppose these subsidies, even for those sources of energy which I \nthink are critical for this country to continue to develop, and that \nincludes nuclear energy.\n  I support the amendment in order to remain consistent in opposing \nsubsidies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nsupport for our amendment. I will pick up a little bit where he left \noff talking about the issue of subsidies across a range of areas.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee spoke earlier about the \nclean coal subsidy, the $2 billion in clean coal subsidy. He suggested \nthat supporters of this amendment also supported that subsidy.\n\n  I just want to be clear. I do not support $2 billion for clean coal. \nI have, in my service in the House of Representatives, opposed the \nclean coal technology program. In addition to that, I oppose the fossil \nfuel research and development fund that is in this bill because they \neffectively provide a subsidy for research and development in the areas \nof fossil fuel, areas where private companies operate in a very \nprofitable and successful way.\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\n  It is not to hold anything against those fossil fuel firms or those \ncoal firms, but it is to stand up for some of the concerns expressed by \nthe Senator from Arizona that we should try to be as consistent as \npossible in striking these unnecessary subsidies.\n  The suggestion was made earlier on the floor--in fact, the statement \nwas made specifically--that this loan guarantee program is ``not a \nsubsidy.'' I reject that out of hand. If this was not a subsidy, then \nit would convey no benefit to those who sought the loan guarantee. And \nif there were no benefit, then people should have no objection to \nremoving it from the bill. But, of course, there is a lot of objection \nto removing this from the bill because there is a big benefit to be \ngained by having a federally subsidized loan guarantee for the \nconstruction of new nuclear plants.\n  It was also suggested that perhaps this is an attack on nuclear \npower. Let me close by reemphasizing that is simply not the case. I \nsupport the Price-Anderson provisions in the bill. I supported the \neffort to establish a long-term storage facility for nuclear waste at \nYucca Mountain that could be operated for the long-term, safely for our \nutilities and energy industries.\n  In an effort to suggest this is an attack on nuclear power, the big \nguns have also been rolled out: there's been a suggestion that Alan \nGreenspan, of all people, might somehow harbor some support for this \nloan guarantee program. Let me say, clearly, like Alan Greenspan, I am \na proponent and supporter of the concept of using nuclear power to help \nmeet our energy needs, but I do not believe, for a moment, that means \nAlan Greenspan is a supporter of federally guaranteed loans to private \nindustry. And if someone can produce testimony from Alan Greenspan \nsupporting a Federal loan guarantee program for private industry to \nbuild nuclear powerplants, I will quite literally eat my hat. I simply \ndo not believe that to be the case.\n  I join with the Senator from Oregon in support of this amendment to \nstrike one provision from this very large Energy bill; and that will \nprotect taxpayers by preventing them from being exposed to $14 or $16 \nbillion in loan guarantees to private industry. I do not think we need \nit.\n  I look forward to a vote on this amendment. I certainly ask my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment. Nuclear \npower is a clean, reliable, stable, affordable, and domestic source of \nenergy. It is an essential part of this Nation's energy mix. And if we \ncare about energy stability and the environment, then nuclear power \nmust play an important role in our energy future.\n  I am a strong supporter of nuclear power and I want to commend \nSenator Domenici for his commitment to nuclear energy in this bill. His \nlegislation provides incentives to enhance and expand our energy base \nand usher new advanced-design nuclear power technologies. It has been \nnearly 20 years since a new nuclear plant has been built. The safety \nand efficiency record of the industry over that time has been \nastounding. Through increased efficiency, nuclear plants have increased \ntheir clean generation of energy. The increased electricity generation \nfrom nuclear powerplants in the past 10 years was the equivalent of \nadding 22 new 1,000-megawatt plants in our Nation's electricity grid. \nBut with energy demand increasing by at least 30 percent over the next \n15 years, more generation will be necessary to meet our needs. As we \nlook to the future, if we are to meet those needs, provide stability in \nthe marketplace, and ensure clean air, then we will have to continue to \nexpand our nuclear base load. Nuclear energy is America's only \nexpandable large-scale source of emission-free electricity.\n  The Environment & Public Works Committee--the committee of which I \nhave the honor to serve as chairman--has jurisdiction over the Nuclear \nRegulatory Agency and I have been active in overseeing that agency, \nboth as the nuclear subcommittee chairman, and now as chairman of the \nfull committee. In 1998 I began a series of NRC oversight hearings. I \ndid so with the goal of changing the bureaucratic atmosphere that had \ninfected the NRC. By 1998, the NRC had become an agency of process, not \nresults. I knew that if we were to have a robust nuclear energy sector, \nwe needed a regulatory body that was both efficient and effective--and \none in which the public could be sure that safety is the top priority. \nIf the agency was to improve it had to employ a more results-oriented \napproach--one that was risk-based and science-based, not one mired in \nunnecessary process and paperwork. I am pleased that in the last 5 \nyears, we have seen tremendous strides at the NRC. It has become a lean \nand more effective regulatory agency. I have the utmost confidence in \nthe NRC ability to ensure that nuclear energy in this country is safe \nand reliable.\n  We have all of the pieces in place to move to the next generation of \nnuclear power. If we are to meet the energy demands of the future and \nwe are serious about reducing utility emissions, then we should get \nserious about the zero emissions energy production that nuclear power \nprovides. And that means that we should not be discouraging the \ndevelopment of new, safe nuclear technologies. Quite the opposite, we \nshould provide the incentives and the assurances in order to meet the \nenergy needs of this country.\n  The bill before us provides a sensible incentive for future nuclear \npower projects. Unfortunately, the Wyden/Sununu amendment will remove \nthose incentives--it is a step backward--away from long-term stable and \nclean energy supplies.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment and want to detail the reasons for my support. The amendment \nstrikes subtitle B of title IV of the bill, the section on deployment \nof new nuclear plants. This section would provide new loan guarantees \nfor the construction of new nuclear plants. In addition to providing \nthe nuclear industry loan guarantees, the Senate Energy Bill appears to \nalso authorize the Federal Government to enter into power purchase \nagreements to buy power back from new reactors--potentially at rates \nabove market prices.\n  I think subtitle B goes too far and the amendment to strike is \nnecessary for several reasons. First, the bill places no ceiling on \nthese loans, making the Federal Government liable, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, for between $14-$16 billion in loan \nguarantees.\n  Second, I feel strongly that if private investors are not willing to \nput their own money on the line to support new nuclear plants, then the \nFederal Government should not put taxpayers' money at risk either. Yet, \nunder the provisions currently included in the Senate bill, taxpayers \nwould be required to subsidize up to 50 percent of the cost of \nconstructing and operating 8,400 megawatts of power. The Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated the risk of default would be ``well above \n50 percent.'' I feel that $14-$16 billion is a lot of money to gamble \non an investment that has a 50/50 risk of failure.\n  Finally, as I have expressed in the past, I am concerned that our \ncurrent nuclear waste storage program is of insufficient size to handle \nour current nuclear waste problem. I do not think it is wise to build \nmore plants, when we do not have enough storage for our current waste. \nYucca Mountain is not authorized at a size that is big enough to take \nall of the current nuclear waste. Among the reasons that I opposed the \nYucca Mountain resolution was its insufficient size. I was concerned \nthat my home state of Wisconsin would go back on the list as a possible \nsite for a large-scale nuclear repository. Constructing new nuclear \nplants does nothing to relieve those concerns, and instead makes it \nmore likely that we will have a growing nuclear waste problem for which \nwe will need a permanent storage solution, putting Wisconsin back at \nrisk.\n  I think this amendment makes fiscal and policy sense, and deserves \nthe support of the Senate.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of nuclear energy and \nin support of the provisions in S. 14 that promote the use of this \nvital component of our energy portfolio.\n  Nuclear energy accounts for 20 percent of our electricity \ngeneration--one in five American homes and businesses are powered by \nnuclear energy. It is an important energy source now, and will\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nbecome even more important in the future--as we strive to meet growing \nenergy demands while protecting our environment.\n  As many of my colleagues know, nuclear energy provides emissions-free \nelectricity--no emission of airborne pollutants, no emission of carbon \ndioxide or other greenhouse gases. In fact, nuclear energy provides \nthree-fourths of the emissions-free electricity generated in the United \nStates--more than hydro, wind, solar and geothermal energy combined.\n  President Bush has said many times that energy security is a \ncornerstone of national security. He is right--and nuclear energy is a \nvital component of our energy supply.\n  Uranium--the fuel for our nuclear fleet--is mined domestically and by \nmany of our allies.\n  Unlike oil, nuclear energy is not subject to foreign manipulation.\n  Unlike natural gas, nuclear energy does not have domestic shortages \nand importation problems.\n  Unlike wind, solar and geothermal energy, nuclear energy provides \nhighly affordable and reliable power.\n  Production costs of nuclear energy were 1.76 cents per kilowatt-hour \nversus 1.79 cents for coal and 5.69 cents for natural gas in 2000.\n  Plant capacity utilization exceeded 90 percent in 2002--the fourth \nyear in a row that the industry set a record for output without \nbuilding any new plants.\n  Nuclear energy is safe. Our nuclear plants are the most hardened of \nany commercial structures in the country and have a superb safety \nrecord and few, if any, industries have oversight comparable to that \nprovided by the NRC for nuclear plants.\n  Our nuclear Navy is a great example of the safety of nuclear energy--\n  The U.S. Navy has safely traveled over 126 million miles without a \nsingle reactor incident and with no measurable impact on the world's \nenvironment.\n  Sailors on a nuclear submarine, working within yards of a reactor, \nreceive less radiation while on active duty than they would at home \nfrom natural radiation background.\n  However, we must act now if we want to preserve the benefits of \nnuclear energy.\n  The last license for a domestic reactor was issued in 1978--and the \ntechnologies used to power our nuclear plants are over 30 years old.\n  Our industry has developed advanced nuclear technologies--and the NRC \nhas licensed them--but new plants have only been built overseas, not in \nAmerica.\n  Our nuclear plants were built in a highly regulated market--where \nreturns on these investments were guaranteed--not in today's highly \ncompetitive energy markets.\n  Nuclear plants present unusual risks to the financial community due \nto the significant up-front capital investments that are required years \nbefore they generate any returns--as opposed to natural gas generators \nthat are relatively inexpensive and easy to build.\n  Without new interest in nuclear power, our pool of qualified nuclear \nworkers is drying up.\n  From 1990-95, the number of students in nuclear engineering dropped \nby 30 percent.\n  In 1975, there were 76 research reactors on American college \ncampuses--today there are 32.\n  Current estimates project that domestic energy demand will increase \nby almost 50 percent by 2030. Without a significant effort to increase \nour nuclear capacity--which must include construction of new nuclear \nfacilities--we will have no other choice than reliance on natural gas \nto meet that demand, which will drive up the costs for both electricity \nand natural gas through the roof.\n  The nuclear energy provisions in S. 14 are essential to assure that \nnuclear energy continues to thrive and provide its benefits to our \nNation:\n  Price-Anderson reauthorization: The bill permanently reauthorizes the \nPrice-Anderson liability protection that is so crucial to all nuclear \nfacilities.\n  Advanced reactor construction: The bill will authorize construction \nof a new advanced reactor as a research test-bed using the very latest \nideas developed in the Generation IV reactor program.\n  Advanced fuel cycle initiative: Authorizes funding for development of \ntechnologies to reduce the volume and toxicity of final waste projects, \nsimplify siting for future repositories and recover fuel from spent \nfuel.\n  Federal loan guarantees: The bill provides loan guarantees for new \nplant construction in order to offset the problems with new development \nthat I mentioned earlier.\n  I want to spend just a minute on the Federal loan guarantees that are \nthe subject of an amendment by Senator Wyden and Senator Sununu.\n  These loan guarantees are necessary to jumpstart construction on new \nnuclear plants. In order to begin construction of a new facility, the \nnuclear industry needs to move into uncharted waters--they need to go \nto investment bankers and say ``I know that this is a huge capital \noutlay, and that we haven't built one of these facilities in 30 years, \nbut we need to do this.'' These loan guarantees will ensure that \nprivate-sector financing will be available for utilities that make the \ndecision to move forward.\n  My distinguished colleague from Oregon has stated that we are \nthrowing away good money on these ``subsidies.'' I must respectfully \ndisagree. As Chairman Domenici pointed out earlier, this is not a \nhandout program.\n  These are loan guarantees--for up to 50 percent of the construction \ncosts for a new facility--which means that the utilities will have to \nmake payments on the loans, and that there will likely be no expenses \nto the Government.\n  I applaud the work that Chairman Domenici has done on these \nprovisions--all of these provisions--and I will oppose any efforts to \nstrip them from the energy bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Wyden-Sununu amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment \noffered by Senators Wyden, Bingaman, Sununu, and Enzi to strike the \nsection of the energy bill providing Federal subsidies for the \nconstruction of new nuclear plants.\n  Title IV of the energy bill includes loans, loan guarantees, and \nother forms of financial assistance to subsidize the construction of \nnew nuclear powerplants.\n  In the past 50 years, California has built 5 commercial nuclear \npowerplants and one experimental reactor. Today, just two of these \nnuclear powerplants are still operating in the State. The plants at San \nOnofre and Diablo Canyon are running at diminished capacity but still \nprovide 4,400 megawatts of power in California--close to a fifth of \nCalifornia's energy supply.\n  Impressive as these numbers may be in terms of the power-generating \ncapacity of nuclear energy, they tell only part of the story of \nCalifornia's experiment with nuclear power. Of six nuclear powerplants \nbuilt in California, four have been decommissioned due to high \noperating costs and excessive risk.\n  In the late 1950s, an experimental reactor at the Rocketdyne site in \nVentura County was shut down after a severe meltdown.\n  In 1967, the Vallecitos plant closed its doors after 20 years of \noperating because its owner, General Electric, was unable to obtain \naccident insurance due to the high risk of operating a nuclear power \nplant.\n  In 1976, the Plant at Humboldt Bay shut its doors after 13 years of \noperation as a result of the discovery of a fault line near the plant \nthat would have required millions of dollars in seismic retrofits.\n  And in 1989, the Rancho Seco plant near Sacramento was closed by \npublic referendum after 14 years of operation plagued by mismanagement \nthat resulted in cost overruns.\n  Nuclear power is expensive and risky. Yet I believe that if private \ninvestors are not willing to put their own money on the line to support \nnew nuclear plants, then the Federal Government should not put \ntaxpayers' money at risk either. However, under the nuclear subsidy \nprovision in this energy bill, taxpayers would be required to subsidize \nup to 50 percent of construction costs of new nuclear plants--costs \nthat CRS estimates to be in the range of $14-16 billion. CRS also \nestimates the risk of default on these loan guarantees to be ``very \nhigh--well above 50 percent.''\n  I strongly believe it is not in the public interest for our Nation to \nsubsidize\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\ncostly nuclear plants. Instead we should devote more resources to the \ndevelopment of renewable energy.\n  I strongly believe we should be doing more to encourage the \ndevelopment of renewable power such as, wind, geothermal, and biomass, \ninstead of providing subsidies to an industry that has not built a new \npowerplant since the 1970s.\n  Unfortunately, this Energy bill currently has an over-reliance on \npromoting traditional energy resources, such as nuclear power.\n  The U.S. nuclear power industry, while currently generating about 20 \npercent of the Nation's electricity, faces an uncertain long-term \nfuture. No nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978 and more than \n100 reactors have been canceled, including all those ordered after \n1973. No units are currently under construction.\n  The nuclear power industry's troubles include high nuclear powerplant \nconstruction costs, public concern about nuclear safety and waste \ndisposal, and regulatory compliance costs.\n  Controversies over safety have dogged nuclear power throughout its \ndevelopment, particularly following the March 1979 Three Mile Island \naccident in Pennsylvania and the April 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the \nformer Soviet Union. These events shaped much of our opinions about \nnuclear power.\n  Safety continues to raise concerns today. In a recent example, it was \ndiscovered in March 2002 that leaking boric acid had eaten a large \ncavity in the top of the reactor vessel in Ohio's Davis-Besse nuclear \nplant. The corrosion left only the vessel's quarter-inch-thick \nstainless steel inner liner to prevent a potentially catastrophic \nrelease of reactor cooling water.\n  Furthermore, nuclear powerplants have long been recognized as \npotential targets of terrorist attacks, and I remain skeptical that \nthere are enough safeguards in place to defend against potential \nterrorist attacks on our nuclear plants.\n  Concern about nuclear safety and waste disposal makes Californians \napprehensive about nuclear power. California has shifted away from \nnuclear power over the years and activists in the communities \nsurrounding the Diablo Canyon and San Onofre plants continue to express \nconcerns about the safety of the remaining reactors in California.\n  The construction of new nuclear reactors would also exacerbate the \nnuclear waste problem. Since the volume of nuclear waste in the United \nStates is expected to exceed capacity at the controversial Yucca \nMountain repository by 2010, any new plants will create even more waste \nstorage problems.\n  I voted with Senator Bingaman to strike these nuclear subsidies in \ncommittee and today I will vote with Senator Wyden to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains for each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have 14 \nminutes 18 seconds; the opponents of the amendment have 2 minutes 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I could engage the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, I would like to close the debate. At this \npoint, I believe the Presiding Officer said I have in the vicinity of \n14 minutes. I say to the Senator, you have in the vicinity of 2 \nminutes. Would you like to speak now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I would not.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Then I will take 5 minutes of our time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, at that point we have 9 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 8\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, a couple of arguments need to be addressed at this \npoint. The Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, just recently said the \nWyden-Sununu provision would, in some way, jeopardize the reliability \nof power and cost jobs today. That is simply not correct. No plant that \nis operating today--not one--would be affected by this amendment, and \nnot a single job in America would be lost. Now, with respect to jobs of \nthe future--and I think this is important to note--if you look at the \nofficial figures of the Federal Government--these are supplied by the \nEnergy Information Agency--the fact is, you can build four or five gas-\nfired plants for the cost of one nuclear facility. That is, again, not \nsomething just made up. Those are the official figures of the Federal \nGovernment with respect to the comparative costs of this amendment.\n  I think we ought to note, for example, just how unprecedented this \nis. When people began to debate nuclear power decades ago--50 years \nago--when the commercial nuclear industry was first getting started, \nthere were not any loan guarantees. In fact, even during the early \ndays, there was no subsidy along these lines. People would say, let's \nsupport research, let's support various opportunities to assist with \nthe nuclear reactors but not even in the early days was there a \nconstruction subsidy. In fact, in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 there \nwas an explicit prohibition on subsidizing any of these facilities.\n  So what we are talking about is something where a nonpartisan \nanalysis from the Congressional Budget Office has made it clear it is \nrisky. They said there is upwards of a 50-percent likelihood of \ndefault. The Congressional Research Service has said it is going to be \ncostly. Mr. President, $14 to $16 billion is the appraisal of the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  I have made it clear it is unprecedented both with respect to this \nbill and the history. Finally, it is simply unfair when you compare it \nto other sources of power.\n  I wrap up this part of the discussion by making sure Senators are \nclear on the distinction between nuclear power and various other \nsources of power under this proposal.\n  Under the way the Domenici legislation is written, if you do not \nproduce any wind, you get no direct subsidy. But under the legislation \nas it stands today, if you do not produce any nuclear power, you get a \nsubsidy. That is as clear a distinction as we could possibly make. For \nall the other sources of power, if you produce nothing, no subsidy; for \nnuclear, if you produce nothing, you get a big subsidy. The \ndifference--what it all comes down to--is whether Senators believe that \none particular source of power deserves cash up front and, in effect, \nputting taxpayers on the hook at the outset before anything is \nproduced.\n  On a bipartisan basis--three Democratic Senators, three Republican \nSenators, and an Independent--we think that is unwise.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been asked because of other \npeople--not me--that we commence this vote at 3:45. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the case.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request has been made. \nIs there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if we could just take a second to make sure \nwe are fair, I note that the Senator from Nevada would like to have \nseveral minutes, and we would like the opportunity to close. So if we \ncan work out the opportunity----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, they want a vote at 3:45, so we \ndon't need any time. He can have 3 minutes and you can close.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I just want to make a couple points and \nkeep it fairly brief.\n  The nuclear power industry has been around for a long time. We hear \nabout other new sources of energy that this country is trying to \ndevelop, and it seems to make sense we would subsidize some of that new \nresearch. It is basic research that the Government is involved in. \nWhether it is health care, whether it is energy, that seems to be an \nappropriate role for the Federal Government.\n  But nuclear energy has been around for a long time, and it is \ncommercially viable in many other countries in the\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nworld. To this Senator, it does not seem to be the right thing to do to \nbe subsidizing nuclear power because it should have already proven its \nmerit in the marketplace and been able to stand on its own.\n  Unfortunately, we have a situation where we had a vote last year on \nthe Yucca Mountain project, which is the Nation's nuclear waste \nrepository, and this Senate decided to continue to build Yucca \nMountain. What that indicates is that the Senate is already subsidizing \nnuclear power. People say, no, Yucca Mountain is being built by the \nratepayers, the people who receive the benefits of nuclear energy. They \npay a tax on that or a rate on that and, therefore, they pay into the \nnuclear fund that will build on Yucca Mountain.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, that is not going to be \nenough. So we are going to be subsidizing nuclear power as it is. To \nadd another subsidy would be wrong at this time. Whether you look at \nJapan or Germany, these other countries, they are building them \ncommercially; they are operating them viably.\n  If nuclear power is so good commercially, then it should stand on its \nown. We have several other provisions in the bill that Senators Sununu \nand Wyden have not touched on nuclear power. But to actually have \nFederal loan guarantees that will leave the taxpayer holding the bill \nwould be wrong at this time. If nuclear power is going to stand, let it \nstand on its own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator could do me one \nfavor. Let Senator Graham have 1 minute. Then you wind up with the time \nyou have, the same time you have.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to accommodate the Senator from South Carolina. \nHow much additional time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nvote was to occur at a quarter to 4. You have the time between now and \nthen.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We don't need to have the Senator speak. Go ahead.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina have 2 additional minutes and if I could have 3 \nadditional minutes after he is done speaking.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We cannot do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is not me. I have just been told, after instructions \nfrom the leadership.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, then I would like to accommodate the \nSenator from South Carolina. I have a couple of minutes to go.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You don't have a couple minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 2 minutes at this point. The Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as we move to the vote, basically all the \narguments made against the\nWyden-Sununu-Snowe-Ensign-Binga-\nman amendment, all of the arguments made against us were made for the \nWPPSS facilities which resulted in the biggest municipal bond failure \nin history. Back then they said it wouldn't be unduly risky. They said \nthere wouldn't be any questions with respect to exposure to those who \nwere financing it. Look at what happened. Four out of those five \nfacilities did not get built.\n  I say to my colleagues, those who are pronuclear, those who are \nantinuclear, this is not about your position with respect to nuclear \npower pro or con. It is about whether or not you are going to be \nprotaxpayer. The Congressional Research Service says the taxpayers are \non the hook for $14 to $16 billion. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays there is upwards of a 50-percent likelihood of default. Under this \nprovision, the loan guarantees provide opportunities to construct \nnuclear facilities that no one else is getting. Other people don't get \nthe break unless they produce something. Here you get the break even if \nyou produce no nuclear power whatsoever and you get it directly out of \nthe taxpayer's pocket.\n  It is unwise. I hope my colleagues will vote with three Democratic \nSenators, three Republican Senators, and an Independent for this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n875.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, as the author of amendment No. 864, the \nIndian provision to the Energy Bill, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I inquire as to what the order is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous consent agreement at \nthis time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 876\n\n           (Purpose: To Tighten Oversight of Energy Markets)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senators Fitzgerald, Harkin, Lugar, Cantwell, Wyden, Boxer, \nand Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. FEINSTEIN], for herself, \n     Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 876.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I heard the comments of the \ndistinguished ranking member that they had not had an opportunity to \nsee the amendment. Of course, we will allow that opportunity to take \nplace. This amendment closes a major loophole which allows energy \ntrades to take place electronically, in private, with no transparency, \nno record, no audit trail, or any oversight to guard against fraud and \nmanipulation.\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\n  This amendment will close a loophole created in 2000 when Congress \npassed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which exempted energy \nand metals trading from regulatory oversight and excluded them \ncompletely if the trade was done electronically.\n  This amendment was presented by me before. Senator Fitzgerald spoke, \nSenator Wyden spoke, Senator Cantwell spoke. We got just about a \nmajority. Senator Gramm of Texas argued against it. It did go back to \nthe Agriculture Committee. The Agriculture Committee held hearings and \nboth Senators Harkin and Lugar participated in making changes, which I \nthink has made this a better amendment.\n  We were hoping for a markup, but the Congress ended without that \nmarkup having taken place. Now the Energy bill is before us, and it \nseems to me this is the time to present this.\n  This bill has had floor discussion. It has had a committee hearing. \nIt has been modified by the chairman and the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee and is now before us.\n  Today, if there is no delivery of physical energy, there is no price \ntransparency. By that I mean, if I buy natural gas from you and you \ndeliver it to me, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the \nauthority to ensure that the transaction is transparent--meaning it is \navailable to look at--and that it is reasonably priced. However, many \nenergy transactions no longer result in delivery. In other words, if I \nsell to you and you sell to Senator Craig who sells to Senator Domenici \nwho sells to somebody else who then delivers it, none of these trades \nis covered if done electronically. That means there is no record; there \nis no audit trail; there are no capital requirements; there is no \ntransparency; there is no antifraud or antimanipulation oversight \ntoday. It is a huge loophole permitted in the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000.\n  This lack of transparency and oversight applies to energy and metals \ntrading. It does not apply if you are selling wheat or pork bellies or \nany other tangible commodity. Why do we include metals? Fraud and \nmanipulation have not been confined to the energy trading sector. For \nexample, in 1996 U.S. consumers were overcharged $2.5 billion from \nSumitomo's manipulation of the copper markets.\n  Furthermore, in 1999 the President's Working Group on Financial \nMarkets recommended excluding only financial derivatives, not energy \nand metals derivatives, from the CFTC's jurisdiction.\n  After intense lobbying by, of all people, Enron, a change was made to \nthe Commodity Futures Modernization Act to exempt energy and metals \ntrading from CFTC oversight in 2000. It did not take long for \nEnronOnline and others in the energy sector to take advantage of this \nnew freedom by trading energy derivatives absent any transparency and \nregulatory oversight. In other words, a whole new niche was found where \nyou could avoid any scrutiny and do this trading.\n  After the 2000 legislation was enacted, EnronOnline began to trade \nenergy derivatives bilaterally, without being subject to proper \nregulatory oversight. It should not surprise anyone that without the \ntransparency, prices soared and games were played.\n  Three years ago this summer, California's energy market began to \nspiral out of control. In May of 2000, families and businesses in San \nDiego saw their energy bills soar. The western energy crisis forced \nevery family and business in California and many of the other States to \npay more for energy. The crisis forced the State of California into a \nsevere budget shortfall. It forced the State's largest utility into \nbankruptcy and nearly bankrupted the second largest publicly owned \nutility.\n  Now, 3 years and $45 billion in costs later, we have learned how the \nenergy markets in California were gamed and abused. Originally everyone \naround here said: Oh, it's the problem of the 1996 deregulation law. I \nwill admit that law is a faulty law. However, you cannot have the price \nof energy 1 year being $7 billion throughout the whole State and the \nnext year it is $28 billion and say that is supply and demand. You \ncannot have a 400 percent increase just based on supply and demand. \nClearly, you do not have a 400 percent increase in demand in a 1-year \nperiod of time. Nor did that happen in a 1-year period of time.\n\n  In March of this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nissued a report titled ``Price Manipulation In Western Markets,'' which \nconfirmed that there was widespread and pervasive fraud and \nmanipulation during the western energy crisis. According to the FERC \nreport, the abuse in our energy markets was pervasive and unlawful. Yet \nthis Energy bill does not prevent another energy crisis from occurring \nnor does it curb illegal Enron-type manipulation.\n  Just last week, the FBI arrested former Enron trader John M. Forney, \nsaying he was a key architect of Enron's well-known trading schemes \nblamed for worsening California's energy crisis in 2000 and 2001.\n  Mr. Forney was charged with a single count each of wire fraud and \nconspiracy. He is the third Enron trader accused by the Justice \nDepartment of criminal manipulation of western energy markets but the \nfirst who did not reach a plea agreement, leading to his arrest last \nTuesday. According to the criminal complaint, Forney is allegedly the \narchitect of the Enron trading strategies with the now infamous names \nof Ricochet, Death Star, Get Shorty, Fat Boy, and others.\n  These Enron strategies were first revealed on Monday, May 6, 2002, \nwhen the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission posted a series of \ndocuments on their Web site that revealed Enron manipulated the western \nenergy market by engaging in these suspect trading strategies.\n  Under one such trading strategy called Death Star, which was also \ncalled Forney's Perpetual Loop, for John Forney, Enron would ``get paid \nfor moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving energy \nor relieving any congestion,'' according to an internal memo. It was a \nfraud.\n  It was a fraud. A was a trading strategy which was clearly and simply \nfraudulent and manipulative.\n  In another strategy detailed in these memos, Enron would ``create the \nappearance of congestion through the deliberate overstatement of \nloads'' to drive up prices.\n  The above-mentioned strategies reveal an intentional and coordinated \nattempt to manipulate the Western energy market for profit.\n  This is an important piece of the puzzle that has been uncovered. \nSome former Enron traders helped fill in the blanks.\n  CBS News reported in May 2002 that former Enron traders admitted the \ncompany was directly responsible for local blackouts in California. \nYet, interestingly enough, no one has followed up on this report.\n  According to CBS News reporter Jason Leopold, the traders said \nEnron's former president Jeff Skilling pushed them to trade \naggressively in California and told them, ``If you can't do that, then \nyou need to find a job at another company or go trade pork bellies.''\n  The CBS article mentions that Enron traders played a disturbing role \nin blackouts that hit California. The report mentions specific \nmanipulative behavior by Enron on June 14 and 15 in the summer of 2000 \nwhen traders said they intentionally clogged Path 26--a key \ntransmission path connecting Northern and Central California.\n  Here is what one trader said about the event:\n\n       What we did was overbook the line we had the rights on \n     during a shortage or in a heat wave. We did this in June 2000 \n     when the Bay Area was going through a heat wave and the ISO \n     couldn't send power to the North. The ISO has to pay Enron to \n     free up the line in order to send power to San Francisco to \n     keep the lights on. But by the time they agreed to pay us, \n     rolling blackouts had already hit California and the price \n     for electricity went through the roof.\n\n  In other words, they waited for the weather. They calculatedly \noverbooked the line to clog the lines so that power could not be \ntransmitted to the north. Therefore, what power was transmitted went \nsky high in terms of price. Second, a blackout resulted.\n  California lost billions. Yet according to the traders, Enron made \nmillions of dollars by employing this strategy alone.\n  On top of all this, traders disclosed that Enron's manipulative \ntrading strategies helped force California to sign expensive long-term \ncontracts. It is no surprise that Enron and others were able to profit \nso handsomely during the crisis.\n  Now, after 3 years, the FBI and the Justice Department are beginning \nto\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\nbring these traders to justice. In February, Jeffrey Richter, the \nformer head of Enron's Short-Term California energy trading desk, pled \nguilty to conspiracy to commit fraud as part of Enron's well known \nschemes to manipulate Western energy markets.\n  Richter's plea followed that of head Enron trader Tim Belden in the \nfall of 2002. Belden admitted that he schemed to defraud California \nduring the Western energy crisis and also plead guilty to conspiracy to \ncommit wire fraud.\n  Nobody can believe this didn't happen, because it did. Two people \nhave pled guilty, and a third was just arrested for doing just what we \nhope to prevent happening with this amendment.\n  The plea by Jeff Richter came on the heels of FERC's release of \ntranscripts from Reliant Energy in January of this year that reveal how \ntheir traders intentionally withheld power from the California market \nin an attempt to increase prices. This is one of the most egregious \nexamples of manipulation and it is clear and convincing evidence of \ncoordinated schemes to defraud consumers.\n  Let me read just one part of the transcript to demonstrate the greed \nbehind the market abuse by Reliant and its traders.\n  On June 20, 2000 two Reliant employees had the following conversation \nthat reveals the company withheld power from the California market to \ndrive prices up:\n\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1. I don't necessarily foresee \n     those units being run the remainder of this week. In fact you \n     will probably see, in fact I know, tomorrow we have all the \n     units at Coolwater off.\n\n  The Coolwater plant is a 526 Megawatt plant.\n\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2. Really?\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1. Potentially. Even number \n     four. More due to some market manipulation attempts on our \n     part. And so, on number four it probably wouldn't last long. \n     It would probably be back on the next day, if not the day \n     after that. Trying to uh . . .\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2. Trying to shorten supply, uh? \n     That way the price on demand goes up.\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1. Well, we'll see.\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2. I can understand. That's cool.\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1. ``We've got some term \n     positions that, you know, that would benefit.\n\n  That is what existed. That is the kind of thing that went on, and it \nhas to stop. It has to be made illegal and it has to have heavy \npenalties.\n  Let's turn to some other examples.\n  On January 27, 2003, Michelle Marie Valencia, a 32-year-old former \nsenior energy trader for Dynegy, was arrested on charges that she \nreported fictitious natural gas transactions to an industry \npublication.\n  On December 5, 2002, Todd Geiger, a former vice president on the \nCanadian natural gas trading desk for El Paso Merchant Energy, was \ncharged with wire fraud and filing a false report after allegedly \ntelling a trade publication about the prices for 48 natural gas trades \nthat he never made in an effort to boost prices and company profit.\n  In other words, he is telling an energy trade publication about 48 \ngas trades that were never made. It was bogus information which was \ngiven out. Why? Simply to boost the market.\n  These indictments are just a few examples of how energy firms \nreported inaccurate prices to trade publications to drive energy prices \nhigher.\n  Industry publications claimed they could not be fooled by false \nprices because deviant prices are rejected, but this claim was \npredicated on the fact that everyone was reporting honestly which we \nnow know they weren't doing.\n  CMS Energy, Williams, American Electric Power Company, and Dynegy \nhave each acknowledged that its employees gave inaccurate price data to \nindustry participants. On December 19 Dynegy agreed to pay a $5 million \nfine for its actions.\n  Let us turn to other types of fraudulent trades that many energy \nfirms have admitted to.\n  Dynegy, Duke Energy, El Paso, Reliant Resources Inc., CMS Energy \nCorp., and Williams Cos. all admitted engaging in false ``round-trip'' \nor ``wash trades.''\n  What is a ``round-trip'' trade, one might ask?\n  ``Round-trip'' trades occur when one firm sells energy to another and \nthen the second firm simultaneously sells the same amount of energy \nback to the first company at exactly the same price. No commodity ever \nactually changes hands, but when done on an exchange, these \ntransactions send a price signal to the market and they artificially \nboost revenue for the company.\n  How widespread are ``round-trip'' trades? Well, the Congressional \nResearch Service looked at trading patterns in the energy sector over \nthe last few years and reported, ``this pattern of trading suggests a \nmarket environment in which a significant volume of fictitious trading \ncould have taken place.''\n  Yet since most of the energy trading market is unregulated by the \ngovernment, we have only a slim idea of the illusions being perpetrated \nin the energy sector.\n  Consider the following confessions from energy firms about ``round-\ntrip'' trades:\n  Reliant admitted 10 percent of its trading revenues came from \n``round-trip'' trades. The announcement forced the company's President \nand head of wholesale trading to both step down.\n  These are bogus traders.\n  CMS Energy announced 80 percent of its trades in 2001 were ``round-\ntrip'' trades.\n  Eighty percent of all of the trading this company did was bogus.\n  Remember, these trades are sham deals where nothing was exchanged, \nyet the company booked revenues from the trades. This is exactly what \nour legislation aims to stop.\n  Duke Energy disclosed that $1.1 billion worth of trades were ``round-\ntrip'' since 1999. Roughly two-thirds of these were done on the \nInterContinental Exchange owned by banks that oppose this legislation.\n\n  Let me repeat that. Duke Energy disclosed that $1.1 billion worth of \ntrades were bogus ``round-trip'' trades since 1991. And two-thirds of \nthose were done on the InterContinental Exchange, which is an \nelectronic exchange. That means that thousands of subscribers would \nhave seen false price signals.\n  A lawyer for J.P. Morgan Chase admitted the bank engineered a series \nof ``round-trip'' trades with Enron. Dynegy and Williams have also \nadmitted to this ``round-trip'' trading. And although those trades \nmostly occurred with electricity, there is evidence to suggest that \n``round-trip'' trades were made in natural gas and even broadband.\n  By exchanging the same amount of a commodity at the same price, these \ncompanies have not engaged in meaningful transactions but in deceptive \npractices to fool investors and drive up energy prices for consumers. \nIt is, therefore, imperative that the Department of Justice, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and every other \noversight agency conduct an aggressive and vigorous investigation into \nall of the energy companies that may have committed fraud and abuse in \nthe western energy market.\n  Beyond that, I believe strongly that Congress must reexamine what \ntools the Government needs to keep a better watch over these volatile \nmarkets that, frankly, are little understood. In the absence of \nvigilant Government oversight of the energy sector, firms have the \nincentive to create the appearance of a mature liquid and well \nfunctioning market, but it is unclear whether such a market exists. And \nI don't believe, for a minute, that such a market exists.\n  The ``round-trip'' trades, the Enron memos, the FERC report on \n``Price Manipulation in the Western Markets'' raise questions about the \nenergy markets of our country. To this end, I believe it is critical \nfor the Senate to approve this amendment, which would provide more \nregulatory oversight of online energy trading.\n  When the Senate Energy Committee marked up the Energy bill in April, \nthere was a consensus to include some provisions of the Energy Market \nOversight Act, S. 509, I introduced earlier this year. The Energy bill, \nS. 14, does include higher criminal and civil penalties for violations \nof the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act.\n  Under section 1173 of the bill now on the floor, fines will be $1 \nmillion instead of the current $5,000 for a one-time violation of the \nstatutes. I thank\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\nthe chairman of the committee for this. Jail time will be raised to 5 \nyears instead of the current 2 years. And I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee for this. Fines will be $50,000 per violation per day instead \nof the current $500 per violation per day for violations of the \nstatutes. And I thank the chairman of the committee for this.\n  Furthermore, section 1174 of the Energy bill will eliminate the \nunnecessary 60-day waiting period for FERC to grant refunds. I thank \nboth Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, the chairman and the \nranking member of the Energy Committee, for their efforts to include \nprovisions of S. 509, the Energy Market Oversight Act, in this Energy \nbill.\n  Now let me turn to the specifics of the amendment.\n  I am offering this amendment--and I am hopeful that Senator \nFitzgerald will come to the floor; I know he intends to speak on this \namendment, and I hope he does--I am offering this amendment to subject \nelectronic exchanges, such as EnronOnline, the InterContinental \nExchange, and any other electronic exchange, to the same oversight, \nreporting, and capital requirements of other commodity exchanges, such \nas the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, \nand the Chicago Board of Trade.\n\n  Why should there be one secret trading venue where fraud and \nmanipulation can take place abbondanza? I do not think there should be. \nI do not think it is in the interests of our citizens to have that \nhappen. And the western energy market should be a major case in point.\n  I am very pleased that Senators Fitzgerald, Harkin, Lugar, Cantwell, \nWyden, Leahy, Durbin, and Boxer have again signed on to this amendment. \nI was very proud of the work we did in the 107th Congress, and I hope \nwe can adopt this amendment on this Energy bill because without this \ntype of legislation, there is insufficient authority to investigate and \nprevent fraud and price manipulation since parties making the trades \nare not required to keep a record. That is the problem.\n  The CFTC will say: Oh, we are already doing that. But in the law \nthere is no requirement to keep a record. There is a specific exemption \nin the law. So I do not see how the CFTC has the adequate tools to do \nwhat they need to do without this amendment because this amendment \ncloses that loophole which exists just for energy and just for metals \nand, because of its existence, has allowed EnronOnline and a number of \nother exchanges--Dynegy had one; InterContinental Exchange had one as \nwell--to do all these things in secret with no audit trail, no record, \nno capital requirements. Nobody has a responsibility to set any capital \nrequirements. There is no audit trail and no antifraud and \nantimanipulation oversight. Clear and simple, it is a travesty.\n  Right now, energy transactions are regulated by FERC. When there is \nactual delivery, that is taken care of. If Senator Reid sells me energy \nand I deliver it, that is covered by FERC. But interim trades are not \ncovered by anybody. They are on their own in secret.\n  Many energy transactions no longer result in delivery, so this giant \nloophole where there is no government oversight--when these \ntransactions are done on electronic exchanges--is major. I think it is \nmega. I think a number of companies have jumped into this void simply \nbecause they thought they could make a quick buck by gaming the system, \nand in fact they have done just that.\n  As I mentioned, in 2000 Congress passed the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act, which exempted energy and metals from regulatory \noversight, and excluded it completely if the trade was done \nelectronically. So today, as long as there is no delivery, there is no \nprice transparency, there is no record, there is no audit trail, there \nis no capital requirement, there is no antifraud, antimanipulation \noversight.\n  This lack of transparency and oversight only applies to energy. It \ndoes not apply if you are selling wheat or pork bellies or any other \ntangible commodity. And financial derivatives are not included in this \namendment.\n  It did not take long for Enron and others to take advantage of this \nnew freedom by trading derivatives absent any regulatory oversight. \nThus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, EnronOnline, as I said, \nbegan to trade energy derivatives bilaterally without being subject to \nregulatory oversight. It should not be a surprise to anyone that prices \nsoared.\n  In March, Warren Buffett published a warning in Fortune magazine \nsaying:\n\n       Derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  In his annual warning letter to shareholders about what worries him \nabout the financial markets, Warren Buffett called derivatives and the \ntrading activities that go with them ``time bombs.''\n  In the letter, Mr. Buffett states:\n\n       In recent years some huge-scale frauds and near-frauds have \n     been facilitated by derivatives trades. In the energy and \n     electric utility sectors, for example, companies used \n     derivatives and trading activities to report great \n     ``earnings''--until the roof fell in when they actually \n     tried to convert the derivatives-related receivables on \n     their balance sheets into cash.\n\n  We clearly saw this with Enron. Was Enron and its energy derivative \ntrading arm, Enron Online, the sole reason California and the West had \nan energy crisis? No. Was it a contributing factor to the crisis? I \nbelieve it was.\n  Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 \nCommodities Futures Modernization Act, which took away the CFTC's \nauthority to investigate, we may never know for sure. In the 107th \nCongress, this legislation was debated during consideration of the \nSenate Energy bill, and it was a subject of a hearing in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. As I said, time ran out before it could be \nmarked up and passed. Since that time, both Senators Lugar and Harkin \nhave made significant improvements to the legislation.\n  So today I am pleased to note that the following companies and \norganizations are supporting this legislation: the National Rural \nElectric Cooperative Association; the Derivatives Study Center; the \nAmerican Public Gas Association; the American Public Power Association; \nthe California Municipal Utilities Association; Southern California \nPublic Power Authority; the Transmission Access Policy Study Group; \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group; the Consumers Union; the Consumers \nFederation of America; Calpine; Southern California Edison; Pacific Gas \nand Electric; and the FERC Chairman Pat Wood.\n  Here is a quick explanation of what this amendment does. It applies \nantifraud and antimanipulation authority to all exempt commodity \ntransactions. An exempt commodity is a commodity which is not financial \nand not agricultural and mainly includes energy and metals. The bill \nsets up two classes of swaps for those made between sophisticated \npersons, basically institutions and wealthy individuals, that are not \nentered into on a trading facility, for example, an exchange. Antifraud \nand antimanipulation provisions apply and wash trades are prohibited. \nThe following regulations would apply to all swaps made on an \nelectronic trading facility and a ``dealer market'' which includes \ndealers who buy and sell swaps in exempt commodities and the entity on \nwhich the swap takes place. Antifraud and antimanipulation provisions \nand the prohibition of wash trades apply.\n  If the entity on which the swap takes place serves a pricing or price \ndiscovery function, increased notice, reporting, bookkeeping, and other \ntransparency requirements are provided. The requirement to maintain \nsufficient capital is commensurate with the risk associated with the \nswap. We don't determine that in this legislation. The Commodities \nFutures Trading Commission would determine that. In other words, they \nwould determine what kind of net capital requirement there will be, and \nthat would be commensurate with the degree of risk involved in the \ntransaction.\n  Except for the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions, the CFTC \nhas the discretion to tailor the above requirements to fit the \ncharacter and financial risk involved with the swap or entity. While \nthe CFTC could require daily public disclosure of trading data, such as \nopening and closing prices, similar to the requirement of futures \nexchanges, it could not require real-time publication of proprietary \ntrading information or prohibit an entity from selling their data. So \nproprietary information is protected.\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\n  The CFTC may allow entities to meet certain self-regulatory \nresponsibilities as provided in a list of core principles. If an entity \nchooses to become a self regulator, these core principles would \nobligate the entity to monitor trading to prevent fraud and \nmanipulation, as well as assure that its other regulatory obligations \nare met.\n  The penalties for manipulation are greatly increased. The civil \nmonetary penalty for manipulation is increased from $100,000 to $1 \nmillion. Wash trades are subject to the monetary civil penalty for each \nviolation and imprisonment of up to 10 years.\n  The FERC is required to improve communications with other Federal \nregulatory agencies. A shortcoming in the main antifraud provision of \nthe CEA is also corrected by allowing CFTC enforcement of fraud to \napply to instances of either defrauding a person for oneself or on \nbehalf of others.\n  This would also require the FERC and the CFTC to meet quarterly and \ndiscuss how energy derivative markets are functioning and affecting \nenergy deliveries. So they are required to look at this, to monitor it \nclosely, and to sit quarterly and see how these markets are, in fact, \nfunctioning.\n  This would grant the FERC the authority to use monetary penalties on \ncompanies that don't comply with requests for information. This is \nessentially the same authority the SEC has today.\n  It would make it easier for FERC to hire the necessary outside help \nthey need, including accountants, lawyers, and investigators for \ninvestigative purposes. And it would eliminate the requirement that \nFERC receive approval from the Office of Management and Budget before \nlaunching an investigation or price discovery of electricity or natural \ngas markets involving more than 10 companies.\n  This amendment is not going to do anything to change what happened in \nCalifornia and the West. But it does provide the necessary authority \nfor the CFTC and the FERC which will help protect against another \nenergy crisis. No one is immune from this kind of thing. The gaming, \nthe fraud, the manipulation has been extraordinary.\n  Just the chutzpah to do Death Star, Get Shorty, Ricochet, just the \nchutzpah to do these kinds of trades in secret, it is a bunco \noperation. It is nothing else but. And who is buncoed? The consumer is \nbuncoed. That is why consumer organizations feel strongly about this.\n  When regulatory agencies have the will but not the authority to \nregulate, Congress must step in and ensure that our regulators have the \nnecessary tools. Unfortunately, sometimes an agency has neither. In \nthis case, I am glad to have the support of FERC, and I hope the CFTC \nwill reconsider its position and support this amendment.\n  I note that Senator Fitzgerald is on the floor. I would like to yield \nto him. But before I do, may I just say one quick thing.\n  Mr. REID. You are not yielding to Senator Fitzgerald.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Pardon me?\n  Mr. REID. You are not yielding to Senator Fitzgerald.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Senators are not permitted to \nyield the floor to one another.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair for the clarification.\n  I wish to make one comment about this amendment. This amendment has \nbeen in the Agriculture Committee. It has had a hearing. It has been \nreviewed by both staffs, Republican and Democratic. The Democratic \nchairman of the committee, Senator Harkin, worked on this. The ranking \nmember at the time, Senator Lugar, worked on this. They have both \nconcurred. They are supporting this legislation. The staffs have \nreviewed it.\n  We believe it is bona fide, that it is solid, and that it will stand \nthe test of time.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 877 to Amendment No. 876\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 877 to amendment No. 876.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To exclude metals from regulatory oversight by the Commodity \n                      Futures Trading Commission)\n\n       On page 17 after line 25:\n       ``(10) Applicability.--This subsection does not apply to \n     any agreement, contract, or transaction in metals.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, first, I commend the senior Senator from \nCalifornia and her cosponsor, the junior Senator from Illinois, for \ntheir amendment and their work on this very difficult issue dealing \nwith derivatives and how to regulate them.\n  To critics of the amendment, I suggest you put yourself in Senator \nFeinstein's shoes. She represents the largest State in the United \nStates and one of the largest governments in the world. The State of \nCalifornia's GDP is larger than most countries' of the world.\n  In the West, we are still feeling shock waves from the energy crisis \nthat threatened California's and Nevada's prosperity and brought home \nto all of us that we are in uncharted territory with energy \nderegulation.\n  Senator Feinstein inadvertently included metal derivatives with the \nenergy derivatives that are the intended target of her amendment. \nUnlike energy derivatives which raise questions because of the recent \nenergy crisis, metal derivatives have been sold over the counter for \ndecades. The amendments in 2000 to the Commodities Exchange Act did not \nchange this, and that was proper. They only clarified and confirmed the \nlegality of these markets.\n  Lumping metal derivatives together with energy derivatives would \nimpose regulatory burdens that never existed even before the 2000 \namendments and, of course, without justification; therefore, I offer \nthis second-degree amendment to restore metal derivatives trading to \nexempt commodity status. Metals would be treated as if they were under \nthe Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000.\n  Like other derivatives, metal derivatives markets help companies \nmanage the risk of sudden and large price changes.\n  In recent years, derivatives and so-called hedging transactions \nhelped the mining companies in the State of Nevada, which is the third \nlargest producer of gold in the world, second only to Australia and \nSouth Africa, with a steadily declining gold price by selling mining \nproduction forward.\n  A large mining company in Nevada, Barrick Gold, had no layoffs during \nthis period of time as a result of these forward selling programs. The \nlast couple of years illustrate the function and value in the \nmarketplace of such transactions. Some companies decided not to hedge, \nbetting the gold price would rise and hedging contracts would lock them \ninto below-market prices. Most of those companies are no longer around \nbecause the gold price has stayed relatively low.\n  In contrast, other companies hedged some or most of their production. \nThese companies have survived or even thrived, for the most part. By \nchoosing to manage their risk, they accepted the risk that the gold \nprice could rise, but they stabilized company performance, continued to \nprovide jobs and contribute to communities in rural Nevada where they \nare so important.\n  The gold mining business in America is so important. It is important \nbecause it is one of the few areas where we are a net exporter, and \nthat is the way it has always been. The Feinstein amendment includes \nmetal derivatives citing fraud in the metals markets, but there is no \nexample of fraud on any occasion regarding the metals markets in the \npast decade.\n  Examples of such fraud that did take place a long time ago are cases \nsuch as the Hunt brothers in silver and Sumitomo in copper. These were \nregulated markets and over the counter trades did not exist at that \ntime. The Hunt brothers just went out and bought silver on the free \nmarket. Neither of these fraud cases are addressed by the Feinstein \namendment.\n\n  The attempt, as I indicated, by the Hunt brothers in 1979 to ``corner \nthe silver market'' involved manipulation of the physical silver \nmarket. The\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\nHunt silver scandal involved trading on regulated exchanges, not in the \nover-the-counter derivatives markets. The trading abuses involved the \nphysical accumulation of 200 million ounces of silver. It did not \ninvolve over-the-counter derivatives.\n  I say in passing, I had a great friend. His name was Forrest Mars, \none of the richest men in the world. He lived in Las Vegas in a very \nsmall apartment above his candy store. But as you know, this giant of \ncommerce was a multi-multibillionaire. After the Hunt brothers had \nmanipulated the market, he told me: These guys are so dumb. They should \nhave come to me. I could have told them you cannot have monopolies. \nThey do not work. I tried it a couple times.\n  He said: For example, once I went out and tried to corner the market \non black pepper. Black pepper has been part of commerce for so many \ncenturies, and he figured he could corner the market on all black \npepper, and he did. He owned every producing facility, farm, and \nmanufacturing facilities related to black pepper in the world. But he \nsaid: They outfoxed me because all they did was dye white pepper and \nruined my monopoly.\n  I say this because the Hunt brothers fiasco in 1979 was an effort to \nhave a monopoly, and it did not work for a lot of reasons.\n  The Sumitomo situation involved the alleged manipulation of the \ncopper market by a Japanese company acting through a rogue trader \nacting in London and Tokyo. The trading abuses occurred on a fully \nregulated exchange, not in the over-the-counter derivatives market. The \ntrading abuses involved manipulation of the price of copper on the \nLondon Metal Exchange, a futures exchange which is fully regulated by \nthe UK's Financial Services Authority. Further, the manipulation took \nplace overseas, not in United States markets.\n  I repeat, we owe Senator Feinstein and Senator Fitzgerald a debt of \ngratitude for their interest in this issue and their work in proposing \nchanges to the Commodity Exchange Act that will ensure trading in \nenergy derivatives when it is done over the counter with transparency, \nin a way that inspires public confidence in the markets.\n  I urge my colleagues to eliminate metals from this amendment. I think \nit would help the adoption of their amendment. If they decide not to do \nthat, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment which strikes metal \nderivatives from the Feinstein amendment. My amendment would not allow \nmetal derivatives markets and participants to trade derivatives without \naccountability and transparency. Adequate recordkeeping needs to be in \nplace. The Commodity Exchange Act already requires some recordkeeping \nfor these otherwise ``exempt'' transactions.\n  Derivatives are essential to the health of the metals market, and \nfraud in metals markets did not involve over-the-counter derivatives.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I rise today to support my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, and her amendment, which I have \ncosponsored, which would very simply close the so-called Enron loophole \nin the commodity futures trading laws of this country.\n  This really is not that complex an issue. A few years ago, we passed \na reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I am \nvery familiar with the commodities industry because we are the heart of \nit in my State of Illinois, particularly the city of Chicago, where \nthey have the largest derivative exchanges in the country in the Board \nof Trade, in the Mercantile Exchange in Chicago. Those exchanges trade \nall sorts of commodities from pork bellies to Treasury bonds. They \ntrade financial commodities as well as agricultural commodities, corn \nand soybeans.\n  The Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange, like the NYMEX, the \nNew York Mercantile Exchange in New York, or the New York Board of \nTrade, are fully regulated exchanges. The reauthorization of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, which we passed a few years ago, \ncontinued that regulation that we have had in this country over our \nboards of trades and our other derivatives or futures transaction \ntrading facilities in this country.\n  Somehow, when we were working on that legislation in the House and \nthe Senate--it is funny how little codicils, little paragraphs and \nsentences get added when the bills go to conference committees between \nthe House and the Senate. I believe what happened is when that bill was \nover in the House, a couple of congressmen added some language that \nexempted from all regulation by the CFTC--and there is no regulation by \nthe SEC in this area--online facilities that trade energy, metals, and \nbroadband derivatives contracts or futures contracts. Online exchanges \nthat trade those kinds of contracts are completely exempt from \nregulation. This is the so-called Enron loophole.\n  At the time, Enron owned EnronOnline and they had an online platform \nfor trading energy contracts, which when Enron went bankrupt later they \nsold.\n  Now that EnronOnline was totally exempted from regulation--as Senator \nFeinstein very eloquently and very thoroughly described for us all of \nthe bogus trades that were done on online derivative exchanges that \ntrade metals and energy contracts, and she described the wash trades \nthat were discovered when Enron fell apart. In fact, many energy \ncompanies were simply engaging in round trip trades with trading \npartners. A round trip trade, as Senator Feinstein noted, is when one \nparty sells a commodity to another party at a certain price, and the \nother party sells that same commodity back at the very same price. \nNothing really transpired in that transaction except that the other \nparty books revenue from a sale and this party books revenue from a \nsale, but nothing really happened from an economic point of view.\n  If party A sells a barrel of oil to party B for $30, and party B \nsimultaneously sells a barrel of oil back to party A for $30, nothing \nhas really happened. Everybody is still the same. What we saw in the \nenergy industry with a whole bunch of energy companies, not just Enron, \nis they were artificially boosting their revenues by engaging in wash \ntrades, round trip trades with other energy partners.\n  I recall one energy company after this came to light had to restate \nits revenues downward by $7 billion when new auditors came in and made \nthem cancel out all these wash trades.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment simply closes this Enron loophole. It \nsays the CFTC will be able to ban wash trades on these online \nderivatives transaction facilities. That is all we are trying to do. \nShe does not impose full-scale regulation by the CFTC like we have at \nthe Board of Trade or Mercantile Exchange in Illinois or the New York \nMercantile Exchange in New York. They have far more regulation. \nHowever, we will put a light level of regulation on online derivative \ntransactions facilities that trade energy, metals, and broadband \nonline. Do not forget, Enron was a big trader of broadband, as well. In \nfact, that is why the Enron loophole as it got written in the House \ncreated a special carve-out for energy, metals, broadband, and also \nweather contracts.\n  The question is--why are we picking out energy, metal, broadband, and \nweather contracts and saying these contracts when traded online cannot \nbe regulated by anyone? What is the public policy rationale for this \nspecial carve-out? Why didn't they also include corn and soybeans in \nthis carve-out? Or other commodities? The fact is, this was a special \ninterest carve-out for a hand full of companies.\n  Now, there is a company owned by a number of banks and energy \ncompanies called the InterContinental Exchange. I believe it is opposed \nto our amendment. Why they are opposed--I gather some of their owners \nare, in fact, for this--but the majority of the owners of this exchange \nare opposed. They do not want to be regulated. Our obligation is not to \nthose banks that own the InterContinental Exchange or to the energy \ncompanies that own the InterContinental Exchange. Our obligations here\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\nare to investors around the country and to consumers around the \ncountry.\n  We saw what kind of wool can be pulled over people's eyes when online \nexchanges are allowed to go on without any regulation. Not only were a \nbunch of energy companies such as Enron doing round-trip trades to \nartificially boost their own revenues but they were also doing \nfictitious round-trip trades to set artificial prices.\n  Indeed, although I was very skeptical at first whether that was \nhappening in California but, in fact, it was. The online exchanges \nwould tell California that this is the price that has been trading on \nour online exchange, so that is the price you have to pay for the \nenergy. But, in fact, it was a fictitious market and most of the trades \nwere fictitious and no one could regulate it.\n  All we are trying to do is have a light level of regulation to ban \nwash trades, round-trip trades, ban fraud and abuse, and protect \nconsumers and investors, have some price discovery so people can know \nwhat the prices are for the commodities that are traded on these online \nexchanges, a very light level of regulation to protect the integrity of \nour derivatives market.\n  My good friend and colleague from the State of Nevada, the senior \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, has proposed exempting metals contracts \nfrom the amendment Senator Feinstein and I have put together. In other \nwords, he would go along with closing the Enron loophole with respect \nto energy and broadband but he wants to keep a carve-out for metals. I \ndon't think that is a good idea. We should not have to wait until we \nhave fraudulent transactions involving a metals contract, say, of gold, \nsilver, or platinum, before we act. We have already had fraudulent \ntransactions in energy markets on the online exchanges and we need to \nstop that. But certainly we can foresee the same problem could occur in \nan online contract of metals that is traded on one of these online \nexchanges. All commodities of which there is a finite supply should be \ntreated equally. We should not have a special carve-out either for \nenergy or for metals or for broadband.\n\n  In 1999, a working group was put together on the financial markets \nand the working group was put together ahead of our rewrite of the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act. The panel comprised in the working \ngroup was made up of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the \nTreasury Secretary, the Chairman of the SEC, and the Chairman of the \nCFTC at the time. In their report, the President's Working Group on \nFinancial Markets, as it was called, that group concluded:\n\n       Due to the characteristics of markets for nonfinancial \n     commodities with finite supplies [energy, metals broadband \n     all fit that category; they are nonfinancial commodities and \n     there are finite supplies of energy and of metals] the \n     working group is unanimously recommending that the exclusion \n     not be extended to agreements involving such commodities. The \n     exclusion should not extend to any swap agreement that \n     involves a nonfinancial commodity with a finite supply.\n\n  In other words, the President's working group was saying there should \nbe oversight, there should be regulation of swap agreements, of futures \ncontracts, of derivatives contracts, involving nonfinancial commodities \nwith finite supplies. They separated that category of commodities from \nfinancial commodities that have an infinite supply, say, interest rates \nfutures, or futures contracts or derivative contracts based on \ncurrencies. With those types of financial commodities, it is very \ndifficult for someone to corner the market in interest rates, for \nexample. I don't think it is possible. There is not a finite supply of \ninterest rates. No one could corner the market there. So they wanted to \nprovide legal certainty for derivatives involving financial commodities \nwith infinite supplies and they have done that. We did not touch \nfinancial derivatives. We allow that legal certainty to remain for the \nfinancial commodities. We do not upset that. Instead, we simply treat \nenergy, metals, and broadband, as the other finite commodities such as \ncorn and soybeans and other agricultural commodities are treated.\n  The President's working group made this recommendation that all \nnonfinancial commodities with finite supplies be treated the same. I \nhave to ask my colleagues, what possible public policy rationale could \nexplain the carve-out in the commodity futures reauthorization bill for \nenergy and metals transactions? If it is proper to exempt these finite \nphysical commodities from CFTC regulation, why not exempt agricultural \ncommodities such as corn, soybeans, and pork bellies? It does not make \nany sense and we should close this loophole.\n  Some have argued that we shouldn't have regulation in this area. I \nknow, particularly on my side of the aisle, there are a lot of \nconservative Republicans, and I am certainly a conservative Republican, \nand very pro-free markets. I am always reluctant to see Government \nregulation and I always question the need for it. However, I point out \nthat a light level of Government regulation can actually be healthy in \npromoting markets.\n  There is no finer example than our security markets in the United \nStates. Prior to the adoption of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nAct in the early 1930s, average people remained very leery of ever \ninvesting in the stock market. They thought it was a fool's game that \nwas rigged for the insiders on Wall Street and it was very risky. In \nfact, by regulating the securities markets and making it safe for \naverage people to invest in the markets by having some laws against the \ninsider dealing and so forth, and requiring a thorough dissemination of \ninformation so it could be widely shared, we have gotten to the point \nwhere over 50 percent of Americans in this country invest in the stock \nmarket.\n  I point to that example as an area where we have pretty light \nregulations in our security laws. They are simply disclosure laws. \nPublicly traded companies have to file disclosure and there is not much \nmore regulation than that, but that disclosure is very important in \nmaintaining the integrity of our markets.\n  I believe Senator Feinstein and I have an amendment that is very \nlight regulation, that simply will help restore the faith of people who \nmay want to trade, of institutions that may want to trade in an online \nderivatives facility. It will restore their faith in that market, give \nthem more trust in that market and make them more likely to use that \nmarket.\n  Since we have had this scandal in the energy industry, the \nInterContinental Exchange's volume has just plummeted and people who \nwanted to hedge their positions in energy and metals have been flocking \nback to the fully regulated exchange in New York, the New York \nMercantile Exchange.\n  So the point here, the moral of this story, I think, is by opposing \nthis regulation, the InterContinental Exchange has, in fact, hurt their \nown cause because people are staying away from their market. They do \nnot trust it, they know there is no price discovery, they know there is \nno regulator there who is going to prevent them from being defrauded. \nThere is no cop there so nobody wants to trade there.\n  So if the InterContinental Exchange and the banks that own it want to \nencourage all the Senators here to vote against this, I think they are \nactually working against their own self-interest in the long run, just \nas Wall Street would have been working against its own self-interest \nback in the 1930s if they had come to Washington and tried to block the \nimplementation of the Securities Exchange Commission Act.\n  All the bill does, and Senator Feinstein has gone through it very \nthoroughly--but specifically it requires reporting, notification, and \nrecordkeeping. In addition, it requires these energy and metal trading \nvenues to keep books and records and maintain sufficient capital to \noperate soundly. Those are just commonsense requirements. Why anybody \nwould be against this, I don't know.\n  Finally, on a somewhat more parochial basis, as someone who \nrepresents the exchanges in Chicago, the Board of Trade and the \nMercantile Exchange, they have a much heavier degree of regulation than \nwe are asking of these online exchanges that trade in energy and \nmetals. I, frankly, think it is unfair to impose super-regulations on \none type of trading facility and then no regulation at all on another \ntype of facility. I think that unfairness in the disparate treatment \nbetween different derivatives transaction facilities is a disparity and \ndisparate treatment that should be eliminated in the name of fairness.\n  The bottom line is, while there has been a lot of hype surrounding \nthis\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\nissue, I think those who study it closely will realize, will recognize \nit is good public policy. It is in the public's interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is very well \ndrafted. Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin have both signed on as \ncosponsors. It was the subject of a hearing in the Agriculture \nCommittee, as Senator Feinstein pointed out, and the Agriculture \nCommittee, of course, is where legislation dealing with the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission goes. The Agriculture Committee has worked \non this, and they produced very good legislation that will prevent, if \nwe adopt it, the kind of abuses we have seen in online derivatives \ntransactions in the last couple of years. It is a commonsense \namendment. It simply will make it easier to act against fraudulent or \nbogus energy or metals or broadband trades. It is common sense. I urge \nmy colleagues to adopt it.\n  Unless anyone further wishes to talk, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to thank the Senator from \nIllinois. We have worked on this now through two Congresses. It was \nvery clear to me that he has a great deal of knowledge in this area. \nHis advice, his support, his efforts have been very helpful. I think he \nhas very clearly stated the facts of this legislation.\n  There are those who, for purposes I do not understand, want to make \nthis legislation out to be much more than it is, some heavy requirement \nof Government. Really, all we are saying is, if you are going to trade \nonline, energy and metals and broadband, those trades are subject to \nrecordkeeping, to an audit trail, and to antifraud and antimanipulation \noversight.\n  That is the same as any other finite commodity. Anywhere else does \nthis same thing. But this loophole, at the request, as the Senator from \nIllinois said, of Enron--by the House, and then in a conference in 2000 \nthey dropped the requirement for coverage from the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act. Therefore, this loophole was created into which \nthese companies jumped and began to set up these online trading \nexchanges.\n  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that one company announced that \n80 percent of the trades they did in 2001 were round trip or wash \ntrades.\n  Senator Fitzgerald just explained that very clearly, what a round \ntrip or a wash trade is.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I ask Senator Feinstein, I was wondering, you said \none company said 80 percent of its trades had been wash trades, just \nround trip trades. Was that an energy firm?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, it was CMS Energy. The year was 2001. They \nannounced that.\n  Additionally, Duke Energy disclosed that $1.1 billion worth of trades \nwere round trip, wash trades, since 1999; roughly two-thirds of these \nwere done on the InterContinental Exchange, which means that thousands \nof subscribers would have seen these false price signals.\n  I could finish this, if you like? A class action suit accused the El \nPaso Corporation of engaging in dozens of round trip energy wash trades \nthat artificially bolstered its revenues and trading volumes over the \nlast 2 years.\n  CMS Energy Corp. has admitted conducting wash energy trades that \nartificially inflated its revenue by more than $4.4 billion.\n  So this is important. I have a hard time, I think, as you do, that if \nI sell something to you and you just sell it back to me and we both \nboost sales and yet nothing is really sold, that that is a legitimate \nway of doing business.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I ask Senator Feinstein if it is \ntrue that under the current law no one can do anything about these wash \ntrades because of this Enron loophole that is in the law. We are trying \nto take that out, so somebody could actually ban this kind of \nfraudulent trading practice. Isn't that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is absolutely correct. That is what we are \ntrying to do. For the life of me, I don't understand why people are \nagainst it.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Does the Senator know why people would oppose the \nauthority of regulators to ban wash trades? Has anybody explained that \nto the Senator?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The only thing I can figure is they want to do it. \nThey want the unabashed ability to conduct the bogus trades. That would \nbe the only reason they would want this little, dark, hidden place \nthrough electronic trading because there is no oversight for fraud or \nmanipulation. There is no record kept. There is no audit trail.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. And no one can find out what prices they were trading \nat, either. There is no price discovered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is right.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. They do not do these wash trades at the exchange in \nNew York because all of that would be transparent to the public.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is exactly right. That is why we suspect it. It \nis hard to prove.\n  Again, there have been three arrests of Enron traders who devised \nthese schemes. Actually two were plea-bargained. There was a recent \narrest last week of this fellow who apparently set these trading \nschemes up for Enron.\n  To have a transparent marketplace, I think, gives confidence to the \n50 percent of the people who are small investors who would want to \nparticipate in the market. You have to show there is oversight. You \nhave to show it is up and up, that it is a legitimate bona fide \nmarketplace with trades that mean something.\n  In my heart of hearts, I believe that a lot of this kind of activity \nis what amounted to a 400-percent increase in the cost of power in 1 \nyear in California alone.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Because they were simply trading back and forth \namongst themselves at a price that really was not determined on an \narms' length basis. They were just engaging in bogus trades back and \nforth to artificially set a price or to artificially increase revenues \nfor the companies on both sides of the trade. Some of these \ntransactions were done on the InterContinental Exchange.\n  As I recall, when we had the hearing before the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, either early this winter or maybe even last fall, some \nshareholder on the InterContinental Exchange came before the committee \nand testified that notwithstanding the official position of the \nexchange they, as an owner of the exchange, disagreed with the policy \nof the InterContinental Exchange on this, and they favored our \nelimination of this Enron online loophole in the commodities laws; they \nthought that the company in which they were a shareholder would be \nbetter off if there were some regulation of their business.\n  Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I was not at the hearing. I do not recall that. But I \nthink whomever that was, they are certainly correct because that would \ngive confidence to their company and to people to invest in that \ncompany which is on the up and up, which is regulated and which has \ntransparency.\n  I think particularly now after what we know has transpired over the \npast that this is one of the reasons why our economy has had problems \nin that people have lost confidence. They have seen these companies go \ndown.\n  The Senator mentioned some of the big companies that have gone down \nthat have done just this kind of thing. At some point, Peter has to pay \nPaul. If they don't have the capital to handle it, there is a problem.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. If we had the same problem somewhere in the stock \nmarket and people couldn't figure out the price of a stock by looking \nin the newspaper or looking on the Internet to see what the published \nprice of a stock was on the exchange, if instead you had a similar \nsituation with a stock as you have with these online energy derivatives \nexchanges, and a customer had to call the exchange and ask what the \nprice of oil is trading at, but you just had somebody telling you the \nprice of oil is such and such but you had no way of verifying that, I \nthink no one would want to invest in the stock market if you couldn't \ndiscover the price, or if there was no price discovery.\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\n  Why does the Senator think anybody would even want to trade on an \nonline exchange in which there is no price discovery, or where there is \nno regulator protecting the customers from fraud, manipulation, or \nabuse? Why is it that someone would even want to trade on such an \nexchange? Isn't it true that, in fact, the InterContinental Exchange \nvolume, the last I heard, was dropping and their legitimate customers \nwere going back to trading on a fully regulated exchange in New York, \nthe NYNEX?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is asking me to hypothesize. I sure \nwouldn't do it. I can only assume that some sophisticated trader has \nworked out some scheme and was utilizing it in this venue and knew that \nhe or she was safe because there was no way to pin it on them. There \nwere no records kept.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. If someone is operating a corrupt exchange and there \nis no price discovery and no regulation, isn't it true that a customer \ncould call into that exchange and say, I want to trade oil at $30 a \nbarrel, and the broker could tell them he could get some oil at $35 a \nbarrel and just require the customer to pay more than that customer \nreally should have had to pay because the market wasn't that high, \nthere is no way for the customer to know what the real market price is? \nThe broker could make up a price and then keep the difference for \nhimself or for the exchange. Isn't that correct, if there is no price \ndiscovery?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. It seems to me that this is an absolute no-brainer to \nclose this indefensible loophole. I can't imagine that anybody is going \nto want to defend the concept that we can have an online exchange that \nis open for business with the public, although not retail customers, I \ngather, but institutional customers, where it is just a black hole \nwhich no one can regulate and can't ban wash trades where there is no \nprice discovery. What in the world would be the objection to closing \nthis loophole and having some modicum of oversight to protect the \npeople who may want to use this exchange and to protect the integrity \nof the market?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is absolutely correct. When we had this \nvote in the last Congress, if I recall correctly, we got 48 votes. It \nwasn't really crystal clear what the excesses were at that time. Now we \nhave documentation of the excesses. We have literally billions of \ndollars of fraudulent trades, wash trades, round-trip trades, whatever \nyou call them, but fraudulent trades. So we know. We also know that Mr. \nFortney was arrested and two others have plead guilty to creating these \nschemes. To continue to allow that kind of thing to exist would be a \nreal dereliction of this Congress.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. There really is a difference between this year's vote \nand last year's. Last year when the Senator and I had this amendment on \nthe floor, it was in the immediate aftermath of all those energy \ncompanies collapsing. There were some initial reports out there about \npossibly bogus trades but we didn't have that proof yet. We had 48 \nvotes, 2 votes shy of passing it.\n  Since that time, and in the intervening year, we have had all the \nhard evidence come out proving everything the Senator and I were saying \nlast year on the floor of this body--that there were, in fact, bogus \nwash trades not only in the millions of dollars but in the billions of \ndollars. How big were some of those?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. CMS Energy admitted to conducting wash energy trades \nthat artificially inflated its revenue by $4.4 billion.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. That was probably a huge percentage of their \nrevenues--all fictitious--from doing wash trades on an online exchange \nwith no economic purpose. But that fictitious revenue was fooling the \ninvesting public, making people think that company had more revenue \nthan it actually did. They were all just ``wash'' trades.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Right. May I ask the Senator a question? Some, I \nunderstand, may come to the floor and want a study. The study has \nalready been done, and it is the ``Final Report On Price Manipulation \nin Western Energy Markets, Fact-Finding Investigation of Potential \nManipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices.'' It was prepared by \nthe staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It was put out \nin March of this year.\n  I would like to read one section of it to the Senator and see if he \nis aware of this. It reads:\n\n       Recommend that Congress consider giving direct authority to \n     a Federal agency to ensure that electronic trading platforms \n     for wholesale sales of electric energy and natural gas in \n     interstate commerce are monitored and provide market \n     information that is necessary for price discovery in \n     competitive energy markets.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. So you are saying the FERC has done a study in which \nthey have already concluded that we basically need to close this \nloophole so there can be some price discovery and some monitoring of \nthese energy markets?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct. This is the report. It is a final \nreport. It was done in March 2003, so it has been circulated for a few \nmonths.\n  Additionally, our legislation has the support of the chairman of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. We have kept in touch with him so \nhe is aware of what is in the report, and, of course, the former \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and former \nranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, and my dear colleague from \nCalifornia, I think this is simply commonsense legislation and long \noverdue. I think it is unfortunate that we made the mistake when \npassing the Commodity Futures Modernization Act back a few years ago, \nwhich created that special carve-out for energy and metals and \nbroadband contracts that were traded in an online exchange, that they \ncould be exempt from regulation by anybody. Because had we not made \nthat mistake, had Congress not made that mistake, it might have \nprevented the manipulation and fraud and abuse that was done at the \nhands of a whole bunch of energy companies. We might have prevented \nthat, if we had not allowed this loophole to be included in that \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act. And I think it is high time we \nsimply close that loophole.\n  Madam President, I will be interested to see who comes to the floor \nto make an argument that we should still have this loophole so that \nenergy and metals contracts can be traded without any oversight by any \nregulator, so no one can discover the price, so that there is no \nprotection for the customers of these exchanges.\n  I will be interested to see who comes to the floor and what their \nargument is in favor of this because, I have to tell you, on most \npieces of legislation that come before this body, it is pretty easy to \nsee what the arguments will be on the other side. There is normally at \nleast a plausible public policy rationale on both sides of the issue. \nBut in this case, I have to say that, looked at very objectively, it is \nhard to understand how anybody could oppose this commonsense measure to \nprotect the integrity of our energy and metals trading markets in this \ncountry. It seems like a very commonsense piece of legislation.\n  I compliment Senator Feinstein. She has been tenacious in bringing \nthis up, and she has been persistent to make sure that we had the \nopportunity to offer the amendment on the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would also like to point out \nanother study that has been done in a CRS report for Congress, and that \nwas dated January 28 of this year, pointing out that this bill was \npresented in the last Congress and probably would be presented in this \nCongress. One of the points it makes is that if over-the-counter \nderivatives dealers were required to keep and make available for \ninspection records of all trades and to disclose information about \ntrading volume and prices, abuses like the ones we have been talking \nabout would be easier to detect and, thus, presumably less likely to \noccur.\n  That is really the purpose of this: not to allow sort of a secret \nniche in the trading arena where people could go to hide and trade, but \nto bring the sunshine into that niche and to provide--and it is very \nconservative--regulation of what they must do.\n  I know my friend and senior Senator from Nevada has proposed an \namendment. Regrettably, I have to vote against the amendment. This bill \nhad been worked out with Senator Harkin\n\n[[Page S7599]]\n\nand Senator Lugar. My understanding is they believe we should close the \nloophole entirely, not leave one area sort of in the dark, so to speak.\n  I am troubled by the amendment because our reading of the amendment \nindicates that it effectively exempts metals entirely without any \noversight or regulation by the CFTC, even less than under current law. \nIn good conscience, I cannot do that.\n  So I think we made the arguments, Madam President. And with what has \nhappened--and now that we know the extent of the fraud that has taken \nplace online--not to close that loophole, I think, would be a terrible \nblot on this Congress.\n  So I am hopeful we will have a positive vote.\n  I thank the Chair for your indulgence and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been working with the two sponsors of \nthis legislation. They have agreed to take my amendment. I have spoken \nwith the majority and they say, no, they didn't want it to be done \ntonight, maybe tomorrow. I would simply say that we in good faith have \nworked, as I told the majority leader I would do, to try to move this \nbill along. Moving this bill along does not mean they are only going to \nbe happy if we offer amendments that they like. The Senator from \nCalifornia in good faith offered this amendment. Whether people like it \nor not, if we are going to move this Energy bill along, we have to vote \non it in some way. But it is my understanding that tonight nothing is \ngoing to happen.\n  It is pretty obvious nothing is going to happen. There has been \nnobody here. There has been nobody here to oppose her amendment. Of \ncourse, no other amendments can be offered until this one is set aside.\n  I just want the record to so reflect at a later time, when people \ncome and say, we should try to move this bill along, and there have \nbeen statements on the floor made by the manager and the majority \nleader that they wanted to finish this bill this week.\n  I was asked at lunchtime, how did I feel about finishing the bill \nthis week. I said to the reporters asking me: When you step back a \nlittle bit, there is about as much chance of our finishing this bill \nthis week as my turning a back flip here in front of the two of you.\n  The record should reflect, I can't turn a back flip and never have \nbeen able to.\n  My point, I repeat, is that I am doing my very best to cooperate as I \nhave been advised by the Democratic leader we should do everything we \ncan to help with this bill. But help is a two-way street. When an \namendment is offered that people don't like, you just can't have them \nleave rather than a single word being spoken against the amendment of \nthe Senator from California other than my amendment which they have \nagreed to accept.\n  Having said that, wanting to continue to move this important piece of \nlegislation, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent for rollcall \nvote No. 212 on the Dorgan amendment. Were I present for that vote, I \nwould have voted in favor of the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7599-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I don't want to overly belabor the \npoint but there is a very important thing happening on the other side \nof the world, in Iran, at this very time. My office has been receiving, \nnow, numerous reports of a growing protest in Iran taking place right \nnow. This is within the past couple of hours. It is dawn in Tehran, as \nI speak. It is estimated that this past evening between 5,000 to 8,000 \nstudents are joining protests against the Government's crackdown on \nstudent democracy dissidents.\n  Recently, five student leaders were arrested in advance of the July 9 \nanniversary of the original mass student protest in 1999. Even though \nit is now almost dawn in Tehran, the protest has continued.\n  I understand during the night there was a dissipation of the protest. \nA number of the student protesters--this was outside Tehran \nUniversity--who were protesting dissipated. Rather than going back to \ntheir dorm rooms, they have gone and dispersed to other places because, \nafter the 1999 protest, a number of the Iranian military guard went to \nthe dormitories and arrested en masse a number of students and they \nwere roundly punished.\n  We have also received reports that Iranian Government forces are \nbeating up on the protesters, firing warning shots at them. I do not \nhave that verified but we have received these reports.\n  I call this to the attention of Members of this body because there \nhas been a lot of discussion going on at the present time of U.S. \npolicy towards Iran. I think it is clear the United States should \nclearly stand with those who stand for democracy.\n  We don't know if the student protest is going to go ahead and mature \nfurther or not, or if it is going to further brutally be put down.\n  This is in a buildup to a July 9 protest that had been planned for a \nnumber of months, to recognize the July 9, 1999, student protest that \nwas brutally put down by the regime. This has been building. In \nanticipation of that, the regime in Tehran--and this is a dictatorial \nregime that has never been elected, the rulers have never been selected \nby the people in Iran--arrested these student leaders in advance of \nJuly 9 in an effort to put it down before it gets started.\n  This is deplorable. This is not democracy. The United States should \nstand with those who stand for democracy. We should have a clear \nofficial policy that our position toward Iran is to support those who \nsupport democracy and we support democracy in Iran. We stand for that \nwith the Iranian people.\n  There has been a growing, burgeoning movement in Iran of young people \nwho do not want anything to do with this dictatorial regime. They have \nlived, now, some 25 years, over 25 years under this militant, \ndictatorial regime that supposedly has put Islamic law in place and \nthey are tired of it and they want no more of it. They want no more of \nit and they are willing to put forward their lives in this gallant \neffort, this brave push for democracy. That is their desire.\n  I call on the Iranian Government to stop beating and harassing their \nown people. The students are shouting: Khatami, Khatami, go away.\n  These are the same students who gave President Khatami his start 7 \nyears ago. He was elected as a reformer, which he has not produced on. \nInstead, he has continued with the same totalitarian way.\n  I believe he was one of seven candidates at the time selected by the \nruling mullahs to be able to run in front of the people, and the people \nselected the most reformist, most hope minded.\n\n[[Page S7600]]\n\nHe has not produced. But they didn't get a free selection. Nor does \nKhatami--I want to identify this as well--have free control. The ruling \nmullahs continue to control the military secret police, foreign policy, \nand the treasury.\n  They control, not President Khatami. So it is a system where \nunelected, unselected dictators brutalize a country, an elected \nreformer is not allowed to reform, and he isn't even selected by the \npeople. He has to go through a selection process by the ruling mullahs, \nso only appropriate candidates can run for office. And the students are \ntired of it. They are fed up with it, they are protesting, and they are \nbeing brutalized in the process.\n  We should support the student movement for the July 9 nationwide \nprotest in Iran. We should state that it is U.S. policy to stand for \ntrue democracy in Iran.\n  This is a great nation of great people. It is going to make a \nwonderful open democracy when it is liberated and opened up. These \nstudents are trying to pave the way for that to occur.\n  This is how history is made. It is made one brave act at a time. The \nworld is watching how the regime treats the students, the protesters, \nand it will hold this regime accountable.\n  In Iran they have a saying that they yell frequently: ``Free Iran.'' \nAs these protesters are yelling ``Free Iran,'' that should be our call \nas well: Free Iran.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to an \nissue whose time for reform and resolution has come. I am speaking of \nthe so-called ``reachback'' and ``super-reachback'' issues enacted in \nthe Coal Act in the 1992 Energy bill. This insidious tax has caused \nnumerous businesses to fail over the past 10 years as a result of its \ninequitable taking from those that should not have been included in \nthis effort in the first place.\n  The Coal Act obligated companies to pay an annual tax to cover \npremiums of coal miner retirees' health care benefits. Not only did the \nCoal Act require companies then active in the coal mining business to \npay but it also retroactively required companies--referred to as the \nreachback companies--that were no longer in the coal mining business to \nparticipate and assessed them liability to pay in to the Coal Act's \ncombined benefit fund, CBF. This retroactive tax has been so crippling \nfor a number of companies that many have been driven into bankruptcy. \nThe very existence of many other companies that are subject to this tax \nis in danger due to the heavy obligation this tax imposes on them.\n  Needless to say, the provisions of the Coal Act that created the CBF \nwere hastily crafted and rushed into law without the benefit of \nhearings in the Senate Finance Committee or serious examination by the \nSenate.\n  The combined benefit fund is not only financed by the taxes on these \nreachback and superreachback companies. At its inception, the coal \nminers' pension funds were used for part of the startup money for the \nfund. It is additionally funded through current transfers of the \nsurplus interest income of the abandoned mine lands reclamation fund, \nor the AML. As of 2003, those transfers have been in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  Since the beginning, the solvency of the CBF has been in question. \nEven now, the possibility exists that, without reform in the near \nfuture, this fund could fail putting in jeopardy the coal miner \nretirees' health care benefits. To temporarily stabilize the CBF, \nCongress appropriated $68 million for fiscal year 2000 and another $96 \nmillion for fiscal year 2001 and $35 million for fiscal year 2003. \nThese ad hoc appropriations are not a permanent solution and do nothing \nto guarantee that retirees will continue to receive health benefits in \nfuture years. For some younger retirees, the benefits from the CBF is \ntheir only source of health care until they are eligible for Medicare. \nFor older retirees, it serves as a kind of Medigap policy.\n  In addition to reachback companies, the current law imposed crippling \ntaxes on companies such as Plumb Supply in my home State of Iowa. Plumb \nSupply has been designated as a superreachback company. The \nsuperreachback companies were relieved of their prospective liability \nby the U.S. Supreme Court since 1998. They were not, however, afforded \nrefunds of those improperly assessed taxes they had been required to \npay into the CBF. This hurts Plumb Supply and all other similarly \nsituated companies. The superreachback companies have been waiting \npatiently for the return of their money for nearly 7 years.\n  Many of us in the Senate, along with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, pursued legislation aimed at solving the reachback \nissue in a comprehensive manner during the 106th and 107th Congresses. \nWe took on these efforts in order to create stability and fairness in \nthe combined benefit fund, and to thereby provide a solution that would \naddress the needs of all interested parties.\n  I sincerely hope that the Ways and Means Committee will take up \nlegislation during this session of Congress to continue this program \nfor coal mine retirees and their beneficiaries in a responsible \nfashion, while ending the unfair taxation imposed on businesses no \nlonger active in the coal mining business.\n  Such legislation should do four things. First, it should provide for \npermanent solvency for the combined benefit fund. Second, it should \nrelieve all reachback companies of prospective liability. Third, the \nlong-overdue refunds to the superreachback companies should be \nsatisfied immediately. Finally companies with an ongoing reachback \nliability should be given an opportunity to prefund their obligations \non an actuarially sound basis.\n  If the Ways and Means Committee can send us this legislation, the \nFinance Committee will be most happy to receive and examine it so this \nissue can finally be resolved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7600-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7600-S7601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BURMESE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2002, introduced by Senator McConnell and Senator \nFeinstein. This legislation seeks to pressure the military junta in \nBurma to release Aung San Suu Kyi and help bring democracy and human \nrights to Burma.\n  Several days last week, Senator McConnell came to the floor to speak \non this issue. I want to commend him for his steadfast leadership, and \nassociate myself with his remarks. I have also joined as an original \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  The message that we are sending to the ruling junta in Burma is \nclear: Its behavior is outrageous. Aung San Suu Kyi is the rightful, \ndemocratically elected leader of Burma. She and her fellow opposition \nleaders must be immediately released. This legislation also sends a \nclear signal to the administration, ASEAN members, and the \ninternational community that we need to turn up the heat on this \nillegitimate regime.\n  The efforts of Senators McConnell and Feinstein are already having an \nimpact. On June 5, 2003, the State Department issued a strong statement \non this matter, which reads:\n\n       The continued detention in isolation of Aung San Suu Kyi \n     and other members of her political party is outrageous and \n     unacceptable. We call on the SPDC to release them \n     immediately, and to provide all necessary medical attention \n     to those who have been injured, including assistance from \n     international specialists. The offices of the National League \n     for Democracy closed by the SPDC should be reopened without \n     delay and their activities no longer proscribed.\n\n  But we all know that U.S. actions can only go so far. Bringing \ndemocracy and human rights to Burma will require active pressure from \nits neighbors in Southeast Asia, particularly\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\nThailand, Japan, and China. It will require these and other nations to \ndisavow the failed policies of engagement. these policies simply have \nnot worked.\n  I am pleased to see that the McConnell-Feinstein legislation attempts \nto trigger a process that will ratchet up the regional pressure on the \nBurmese Government. I am also glad to see that the United States has \ndemarched every government in Southeast Asia on this issue.\n  In closing, I want to highlight the fact that the U.N. Envoy, Razali \nIsmail, was finally able to see Aung San Suu Kyi. According to CNN, Mr. \nIsmail said that she shows no signs of injury following clashes with a \npro-government group. His exact words were ``she did not have a scratch \non her and was feisty as usual.'' That is indeed good.\n  I was also glad to see Mr. Ismail call on the members of ASEAN to \ndrop the organization's policy of nonintervention. He stated: ``ASEAN \nhas to break through the straitjacket and start dealing with this \nissue. . . . The situation in Burma can only be changed if regional \nactors take their positions to act on it.''\n  I agree. The international community has a responsibility to act \ntogether to pressure the SPDC. The time for appeasement is over.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to condemn the ongoing \nrepression of the democracy movement in Burma. This latest crackdown \nhas included the rearrest and injury of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and brutal \nattacks on her supporters. Burma's regime has ignored the basic human \nrights of its citizens and is intent only on preserving its own brutal \ngrip on power.\n  Since last May, the international community has significantly \ndecreased pressure on Burma's regime. During that time, we have seen \nonly increased abuses. The numbers are staggering: Burma's regime has \nforcibly conscripted 70,000 child soldiers, far more than any other \ncountry in the world. The regime has tortured and locked up 1,400 \npolitical prisoners. Even worse, the regime has borrowed a tactic from \nthe Bosnian war by using rape as a weapon of war, heaping misery on \ncountless women and girls.\n  Clearly, the United States and the international community must more \nactively address the situation and Burma and take available steps to \nprevent further violence against those seeking desired democratic \nreform.\n  As my colleague from Kentucky Senator McConnell has stated forcefully \nand eloquently over the last two weeks, the United States must provide \ninternational leadership. Next week, Thailand's Prime Minister Thaksin \nShinawatra will be visiting Washington, DC to meet with the President \nand other senior government officials. This meeting would provide an \nideal opportunity to urge the Prime Minister to make every effort to \nformulate a policy to help bring about positive change in Burma.\n  I say to the people of Burma that the people of the United States \nsupport you and share your values. We admire your courage, and commend \nyour bravery. We will continue to support your struggle, as long as \nthis oppressive regime remains in power.\n  The United States has a long history of supporting democratic change \nand condemning regimes that repress and disregard the will of the \npeople. This most recent attack on democratic reformers in Burma only \nunderscores the need for the U.S. to be vigilant in voicing strong \ndisapproval with the actions of the current regime, and assist the \nlegitimately elected leaders of Burma to bring much needed democratic \nreform and respect for universally recognized human rights to the \npeople of Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7601-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7601-S7602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to those \nmembers of the Armed Forces who have served and continue to serve in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Countless women and men have answered the call \nof our country to preserve and protect our freedom against those \nindividuals and regimes that would seek to compromise or destroy our \nway of life. Reservists have left civilian lives behind, parting with \nwives, husbands, parents, children, and friends in order to fulfill \ntheir commitment to our country's defense. Active Duty military members \nhave gone from merely conducting exercises mimicking war, to leaving \ntheir homes and families to engage in the real thing, on foreign soil, \nthousands of emotional and physical miles from familiarity and comfort. \nThese brave soldiers, airman, marines, and sailors do their jobs in a \nplace where injury and death lie in wait at every turn. The next rise \nin the gritty, windblown landscape may hide 160 pounds of profound \ndesperation peering from behind the barrel of a gun. The building \naround the corner needing to be secured might be rigged with enough \nexplosives to make a small child's father or mother nothing but a \nmemory. floating just beneath the roiling surface of the water, there \nmight be a mine, with deadly patience waiting for the next ship to pass \noverhead so that it can accomplish its gruesome mission. These are some \nof the hazards our military members face in their jobs. Frankly, it \nmakes our job in these marble halls seem significantly less perilous.\n  I speak today to recognize in particular those faithful men and women \nfrom my State--Idaho. We have had approximately 450 reservists and \nactive-duty members called to serve in the war. That may not seem like \na large number compared to those from some other States, but \nproportionately it represents a significant percentage of Idahoans. We \nalso have countless other soldiers who have family and friends who call \nIdaho home. This number does not include the over 160 who were \nactivated to fill positions vacated at installations here by deployed \npersonnel. We also have Idahoans continuing to serve in Operation \nEnduring Freedom, and in the fight against terrorism. I have spoken \nbefore of MAJ Gregory Stone and CPL Richard P. Carl, both soldiers from \nIdaho who lost their lives in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I now ask for a \nmoment of silent prayer and reflection from my fellow Senators as we \nconsider what their dying, as well as over 150 other men and women who \nhave met the same fate in this conflict, has accomplished for our \npersonal freedom.\n  Thankfully, many of those who were called to military service from \nIdaho have just recently returned safely home. Yet their experiences \noverseas will remain with them for the rest of their lives.\n  Some may remember lines of tanks rolling ominously forward under a \ndusty sky, marred by waves of heat emanating from the desert floor. \nThat memory may be infused with the pungent odor of layers of sweat and \ngrime under desert camies, mingled with the acrid odor of burning \ngasoline and oil. Others may remember pulling the trigger on their \nweapon and seeing death for the first time in their young life. They \nmay remember being close enough to smell it and feel it, or feel as if \ntheir own was but a whisper away. Still more may remember the sight of \ncrowds, pushing against one another, some greeting the American \nsoldiers with cheers of gratitude, some screaming epithets, some \nshamelessly begging for food and water to feed themselves or their \nstarving families, and others simply greeting this modern army in grim, \nexpressionless silence brought on by years of brutal repression and \nloss. The smell of desperate, poverty-stricken humanity, and the sounds \nof raw emotion cascading forth in an uninhibited tidal wave after a \nlifetime of unchecked tyranny, may remain forever embedded in the \nmemories of many of those soldiers. Finally, and very tragically, some \nwill never forget a life that slipped away while they clutched a \nfriend's bleeding body to their chest in shared agony.\n  I give account of these images to remind us of the grim reality of \nwar, and the tremendous sacrifice that these noble women and men have \nmade so that we can continue to live in glorious freedom. We tend to \ntake for granted, at times, the price that is paid for this amazing \ngift. The cost comes not only in the loss of life, but the loss of \ninnocence. The cost is borne by family members as well, and by those, \nwhom never having set foot outside this country, bear the scars of a \nfather, mother, husband, wife, son or daughter forever gone from this \nlife.\n  This body voted to support a decision to send these men and women \ninto harm's way. Lest the proud soldiers from Idaho, and their \npersevering families, think that I came to that decision lightly, I \nstand now before you and recognize their tremendous bravery in the\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nface of danger, their courage in the face of death, and their \nunequivocal commitment to preserving the ideals of liberty and \ndemocracy. I want to convey no doubt that their decision to become a \nmember of the most well-trained, professional military in the world \nplaces them in my highest esteem. With gravity and sincerity, I thank \nthem and I honor them. They have given me, my wife, and most \nimportantly, my children, and yours as well, the priceless gift of \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7602-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FEDERAL EMPLOYEE PROTECTION OF DISCLOSURES ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Federal Employees Protection of Disclosures Act, a bill to ensure \nthat Federal employees can report fraud, waste, and abuse within their \nemployer Federal agencies without fear of retaliation. I cosponsored \nthis much needed reform in the last Congress and commend the junior \nSenator from Hawaii for reintroducing it today. Congress must encourage \nFederal employees with reasonable beliefs about governmental misconduct \nto report such fraud or abuse, but it must also protect those who blow \nthe whistle rather than leave them vulnerable to reprisals.\n  Unfortunately, whistleblower protections under current law have been \nweakened by the Federal circuit, the court that now possesses exclusive \nappellate jurisdiction over such claims. The Federal circuit has issued \na number of rulings that erode whistleblower rights in direct \ncontradiction to the plain language of the law and the congressional \nintent of established whistleblower protections. The potential chilling \neffect of these decisions threatens to undermine the fundamental \npurpose underlying whistleblower laws. The Federal Employees Protection \nof Disclosures Act will address this problem by expanding judicial \nreview of such cases to all Federal circuit courts of competent \njurisdiction. Jurisdiction will then include the place where the \nwhistleblower lives or where the Government misconduct occurred.\n  The bill also updates the current law. For example, it clarifies that \nwhistleblower disclosures can come in many forms--such as oral or \nwritten, or formal or informal disclosures. It also broadens current \nlaw to reflect that reporting occurs in many different areas, such as \nover policy matters or individual misconduct. The law expands the \ncurrent list of prohibited personnel actions against a whistleblower in \ntwo ways: One, the opening of an investigation of the employee, and \ntwo, the revocation of a security clearance. The bill also ensures that \nappropriate disciplinary actions are taken against managers who \nnegative actions toward employees were motivated in any way by the \nemployee's whistleblowing. More practical reforms are also included, \nsuch as making the collecting of attorney's fees available to \nwhistleblowers who prevail in court. In addition, under the bill, \nconsequential damages may be suffered by the employee if they are the \nresult of a prohibited personnel practice.\n  Whistleblower information is one tool in helping the Government and \nprivate sector find ways to prevent future terrorist attacks as well. \nThough certain safeguards remain for intelligence-related or policy-\nmaking functions, the Federal Employees Protection of Disclosures Act \nmaintains existing whistleblower rights for independently obtained \ncritical infrastructure information without fear of criminal \nprosecution. These protections are needed to encourage individuals to \nsubmit information to the Government about cyberattacks or other \nthreats that might affect the Nation's critical infrastructures.\n  Whistleblowers have proven to be important catalysts for much needed \nGovernment change over the years. From corporate fraud to governmental \nmisconduct to media integrity, the importance of whistleblowers in \ngalvanizing positive change cannot be questioned. I urge my fellow \nSenators to support this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7602-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7602-S7603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN MEMORY OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN TOM GETTYS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, tomorrow I will be attending the funeral \nof a former colleague from the South Carolina congressional delegation, \nTom Gettys, and I rise to recognize this legend from Rock Hill.\n  I have known Congressman Gettys for many years. He came to Washington \n2 years before I did, having already been an officer in the Navy, a \nschool principal, a postmaster, and so he came in with a reputation of \na person's person. It did not matter who you were in the world, he was \nyour buddy; and since he was in a position to help people as a Member \nof Congress, he would and he did.\n  He stayed just 10 years, but he made an impression for the next 30. I \nnever heard a single bad thing said about him, and I don't know very \nmany politicians I can say that about. He has been out of office since \n1974, but everybody in my State still always refers to him as \nCongressman because he was just one great guy who cared about people. \nThis Senator will miss this gentleman, always the statesman, always the \none with a good story.\n  Tomorrow, I will extend the Senate's sympathy to his wife Mary, and \nhis daughters Julia and Sara. And to share just how much Tom meant to \nhis community, I ask unanimous consent that this article from the \nHerald in Rock Hill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rock Hill (SC) Herald, June 9, 2003]\n\n             Former Congressman Leaves Legacy of Dedication\n\n                            (By Andrew Dys)\n\n       He voted to create Medicaid and was proud the rest of his \n     life--but he was just as proud to know the doormen and \n     elevator operators in the U.S. Capitol by first name. Tom \n     Gettys, a working-class man from Rock Hill's Hampton Street \n     who went on to become a Congressman from South Carolina's 5th \n     District from 1964 to 1974, died Sunday at Westminster Towers \n     in Rock Hill. Gettys was 90.\n       Gettys' legacy of grace, dedication and constituent service \n     is one that current 5th District Congressman John Spratt, D-\n     York, has tried to emulate during his own 20 years in \n     Congress. Gettys' record is not in the laws he passed, but \n     the people he helped.\n       ``His life exemplified what living in a democracy is all \n     about,'' Spratt said Sunday night. ``Everybody in this \n     district not only respected Tom Gettys, but they loved him as \n     well. Tom had a natural, easygoing affinity for people and \n     the problems they had to live through. Tom Gettys will be \n     missed by all of us.''\n       Gettys was born on June 19, 1912, and was educated at the \n     public schools in Rock Hill and later at Clemson and Erskine \n     College. He was principal at the now-defunct Central \n     Elementary School in Rock Hill from 1933 to 1941.\n       Gettys volunteered for the Navy in World War II after the \n     bombing of Pearl Harbor, and Spratt remembers Gettys was fond \n     of saying ``Admiral Nimitz and I did all right over there in \n     the Pacific.''\n       5th District Congressman Dick Richards called on Gettys to \n     run his staff in Washington for seven years. A political \n     future hatched in Washington, but Gettys did more than \n     politick the back hallways of Capitol Hill--he studied law at \n     night and passed the bar exam, and even was Rock Hill's \n     postmaster upon his return from Washington from 1951 to 1954.\n       Before Gettys won his spot in Congress in 1964 against a \n     crowded four-man field, he was a lion of Rock Hill civic \n     life, serving as president of Rotary, the Chamber of \n     Commerce, the YMCA and even as chairman of the Rock Hill \n     School Board. After his return, he became a part of the civic \n     fabric of Rock Hill.\n       The city honored Gettys by naming the old federal \n     courthouse on East Main Street in his honor in 1997, a \n     building now called the Tom S. Gettys Center.\n       Gettys had a stroke several years ago and months ago moved \n     from his longtime Myrtle Drive home into Westminster Towers. \n     He maintained contact with old friends, however, and \n     regularly attended bi-weekly meetings of the Rock Hill Rotary \n     Club when his health would allow.\n       John Hardin, former Rock Hill mayor and lifelong friend, \n     said Gettys and he were part of a weekly golfing outing with \n     A.W. Huckle, publisher of The Evening Herald, and banker \n     George Dunlap.\n       ``I had known him since childhood,'' Hardin said, ``but we \n     became intimate friends after World War II.''\n       Gettys, a Navy officer, was assigned to Iowa but requested \n     overseas service and jumped at duty in the Pacific.\n       Hardin, who ran First Federal Savings and Loan, saw Gettys \n     frequently when he traveled to Washington to lobby as \n     president of the Savings and Loan League.\n       ``The thing he liked best was trying to help people,'' \n     Hardin said. ``He was great at what they call constituent \n     service. He was more interested in helping people than in \n     passing legislation.''\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\n       Gettys was a great teaser, and he often would catch people \n     by surprise by asking if they enjoyed the casserole he sent. \n     When told that, no, they hadn't gotten a casserole, Gettys \n     would respond, ``Well, I left it on the porch. The dogs must \n     have gotten it.''\n       The former congressman cultivated stories about being \n     tightfisted, but in reality, he was a gentle, caring person, \n     Hardin said.\n       ``He had the best sense of humor,'' Hardin said. ``I don't \n     know anyone who had a better one.''\n       Another former Rock Hill Mayor, Betty Jo Rhea, called \n     Gettys, ``One of my favorite people.''\n       Gettys' reputation as the hometown guy turned legislator is \n     deep in the memories of Rock Hill residents. People knew \n     Gettys had many jobs before he ran for Congress and that he \n     came home when he was finished his work in Washington.\n       ``Tom was my husband Jimmy's principal when he was at \n     Central School on Black Street in the early 30s,'' Rhea said.\n       Gettys is survived by daughters Julia and Sara and his wife \n     of 55 years, Mary Phillips Gettys. Funeral arrangements will \n     be announced later.\n       His sister Sara, who still lives in Rock Hill, said the Tom \n     Gettys people knew from public life was the same guy the \n     family loved. Even after 10 years in Congress, Tom Gettys was \n     a Rock Hill boy deep in his bones.\n       ``He was a great person who looked after all of us,'' Sara \n     Gettys said. ``The man who went to Washington was the same \n     man when he came home.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7603-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Lincoln \nPark, MI, on September 19, 2001. Mr. Ali Almansoop, a 45-year-old U.S. \ncitizen originally from Yemen, was shot to death by a man who confessed \nthe attack was in retaliation for the September 11 tragedy. The \nattacker broke into the apartment where Mr. Almansoop was asleep, \ndragged him out of bed, and shot him in the back as he attempted to \nflee. The Department of Justice investigated the slaying as a hate \ncrime murder.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7603-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ARMED FORCES DAY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on May 17, Armed Forces Day, I drove \ndown to Madisonville, TN to participate in the raising of the largest \nAmerican flag in our State. The people of Madisonville and Monroe \nCounty had been working on this for months.\n  The community joined together to make the Veterans Flag Memorial \nsomething to be proud of. Along with the impressive flag, a brick wall \nwas erected.\n  Businesses donated bricks, mortar, concrete and a variety of services \nfrom architectural to brick masonry. Citizens donated approximately \n$70,000 to the project, including contributions and brick sales. The \nbrick sales were reserved for veterans and active duty military. The \nmemorial has been a labor of love for the community. The dedication \nceremony to celebrate this hard work was an important event.\n  As I drove up to Haven Hill Memorial Gardens, where the ceremony was \nto be held, it started to rain; then it poured. Thunderstorms arrived, \nand lightning began to dance in the sky. Not many of us wanted to get \ntoo close to the 150 foot flagpole.\n  But through it all, the ceremony went forward. There must have been \n500 people who sat there in the rain, absolutely drenched. And then, \nthe sun came out as the program began.\n  The most impressive moment came with the raising of the flag. Twenty \nmen marched forward carrying the flag. It was soaking wet and very \nheavy. This is what the organizer of the event, City Alderman Irad Lee, \nwrote to me:\n\n       I was told by the commander of the Tennessee State Guard \n     that had we waited another five minutes, the flag would have \n     been too heavy for their twenty men to carry. I am unsure how \n     much a saturated 1,800 square foot flag weighs, yet one young \n     man named Dwight Taylor of 312 Atkins Road in Madisonville, a \n     city maintenance crew worker, auxiliary policeman and \n     patriot, endured while cranking the flag to the top of \n     flagpole.\n\n  I watched Dwight Taylor crank that flag to the top of the pole. I was \nastonished to see one man do that. It was a tribute to his patriotism \nand strength. It seemed at the time an impossible feat.\n  But so does the history of this country that our flag represents.\n  When Americans want to see the grandest flag in Tennessee, they will \ntravel to Madisonville. And it is appropriate that they do so.\n  Congressman Jimmy Duncan told the crowd that Monroe County sent more \nvolunteers to Desert Storm in the Gulf War for its population size than \nany other county in America. This is yet another example in our history \nof Tennessee living up to its nickname, ``The Volunteer State.''\n  I felt privileged to be a part of the Armed Forces Day event, and I \nwanted the nation to know about the patriotic citizens of Madisonville \nand Monroe County, TN.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7603-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7603-S7604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, 5 years ago, the State of Oregon witnessed \none of the greatest tragedies in its 150 year history--a senseless \nschool shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield. The shock waves \nfrom that awful event still reverberate in our State and in our \nschools. But as so often happens in the face of great evil, good people \nstand together in grief to create hope for a better future.\n  In the case of the Thurston shooting, that beacon of hope is the \nRibbon of Promise campaign. Five years after the shooting, the campaign \nis continuing its work to prevent school violence. Because of the \nimpact the campaign has made and the lives it has saved, I rise today \nto recognize this program and its volunteers as a Health Care Hero for \nOregon.\n  The Ribbon of Promise National Campaign to Prevent School Violence \nwas founded on May 22, 1998, the day after the Thurston shooting. \nThurston was one of several school attacks occurring across the Nation, \nfrom Pearl, MS, to Jonesboro, AR. While still in the throes of grief, \nthe Springfield community decided enough was enough and began the work \nof preventing future attacks.\n  Overnight, the Springfield area bloomed with miles of blue plastic \nribbons decorating cars, mailboxes, lampposts, trees and lapels, \nsignaling the community's support for the victims and their families. \nThe ribbons promised to end the specter of school violence, a promise \nrepeated at candlelight vigils, community gatherings, and funerals.\n  But the promise didn't end when the media attention subsided. The \nribbons were woven together into a grassroots organization dedicated to \nmaking a national impact on the problem of school violence. The \nresulting campaign, the Ribbon of Promise, identified its mission as \nbringing communities together with schools, law enforcement, and the \njuvenile justice system to prevent school violence. Today, the \norganization continues to fill its role by acting as resource for \ncommunication, education, and action against future attacks.\n  Since the campaign's inception, the ribbons have appeared in many \nimportant places. President Clinton wore one when he traveled to Eugene \nfor a Thurston memorial service. NASA crewmember Wendy Lawrence took \nthe ribbon on the shuttle Discovery in 1998. Since that time, over \n250,000 lapel ribbons have been distributed across the world.\n  Results of the campaign have been tremendous. The group's web site \nhas become a primary resource for violence prevention information. \nSpringfield High School's DECA class developed a video called By Kids 4 \nKids, launching the student arm of the campaign. This important \nprogram, also known as BK4K is teaching students to speak out when they \nhear threats of violence. This information, spread from student to \nstudent, is often the only way schools, parents, and law enforcement \nhave the opportunity to prevent violent attacks. The BK4K campaign is\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\nchanging the student culture of our Nation, teaching kids to break \ntheir code of silence in order to save lives.\n  Scores of other campaign accomplishments include a parent information \nprogram, a network of 24-hour report hotlines across the country, and \ncontinued research on the problem of school violence. While there \nremains much work to be done, the accomplishments of the Ribbon of \nPromise campaign are very real. But the best result of their work is \nthe safe return of students at the end of each schoolday.\n  Oregon continues to mourn for the victims of the Thurston shooting. \nBut we also have hope that through the efforts of this outstanding \norganization, further violence in our State has been prevented. I thank \nall the volunteers and staff of this great campaign and designate the \nRibbon of Promise as a Health Care Hero for Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7604-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN MEMORY OF AL DAVIS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wanted to honor the memory of a \nmember of the congressional family whose life was tragically cut short \nlast month. Albert James Davis, who was the Democratic chief economist \nat the House Ways and Means Committee, died on May 30.\n  Mr. Davis had served the Congress with distinction since 1984, first \nas a senior economist with the Democratic staff of the House Budget \nCommittee, then as chief economist for that committee, and finally as \nchief economist for the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Although Mr. Davis never worked in the U.S. Senate, his death is a \nprofound personal and professional loss for many Members and staff of \nthe Senate. Mr. Davis was a highly respected and much loved member of \nthe group of policy experts who work largely behind the scenes to \nprovide Members of Congress with information about the policies they \nare considering. Many Senate staff--and many members of my Budget \nCommittee staff--had worked with Mr. Davis, either directly in the \nHouse or through bicameral staff meetings and frequent phone \nconversations. And although few knew it, many Senators benefitted from \nMr. Davis's knowledge and wisdom because of the frequent use made by \nSenate staff of insightful memos and analyses of important issues that \nMr. Davis graciously shared with them.\n  He was one of the leading experts in the country on issues involving \ntaxes and entitlement programs. Just as important as his deep \nunderstanding of these complex issues was his ability to express his \nthoughts about them in a simple, straightforward way that others--\ncongressional staff, the press, and Members of Congress--could \nunderstand. And he could do it in a gracious and humorous way that did \nnot betray any impatience with a listener who might be a little slow to \ngrasp what was being explained.\n  Mr. Davis was a committed Democrat, but he was more committed to \nhonest and intelligent analyses of the issues. You could count on him \nto give you the straight scoop about any issue. He would not fudge the \nfacts just to fit his personal policy preferences. When my staff gave \nme information from Al Davis, I knew I could rely on it.\n  The combination of respect and affection that many members of the \nSenate family had for Al Davis is a testament to his intelligence, his \nability, and his huge and warm heart. The Senate was considering the \nconference report on the reconciliation tax bill when it became known \nthat Mr. Davis was not likely to recover. The sense of sorrow and loss \nfelt by Senate staff on the floor that day was immense. For many of \nthose staff, it was hard to imagine not being able to pick up the phone \nto ask Al about an issue. They understood the quality of reporting on \ntax and entitlement issues would be diminished because Al would not be \naround to explain a complicated issue in a way that the average reader \nor listener could understand. And they keenly felt the loss of a unique \nand wonderful person. Many people in the Senate family were touched by \nAl--benefitted from his knowledge and wisdom and were lucky enough to \nconsider him a friend. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7604-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    APPOINTMENT OF TIMOTHY A.

Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to Wind \nCave National Park on the occasion of the park's centennial \nanniversary.\n  Nestled in the southeast corner of the Black Hills of South Dakota \nand adjacent to Custer State Park, Wind Cave has a rich and colorful \nhistory that has informed and educated generations of people from \naround the world.\n  Wind Cave was established as a national park by President Theodore \nRoosevelt on January 3, 1903, as the Nation's seventh national park and \nthe first one created to protect a cave. It was designated as a \nNational Game Preserve on August 10, 1912.\n  But Wind Cave's history is recorded as part of Black Hills history \nfrom the time Native Americans told stories of holes in the ground that \nblow wind. The first recorded discovery of Wind Cave dates to 1881 when \nJesse and Tom Bingham were first attracted to the cave by a whistling \nnoise. As the story goes, wind was blowing out of the cave entrance \nwith such force it blew off Tom's hat. A few days later, when Jesse \nreturned to show the phenomena to some friends, he was astonished to \nfind the wind had changed directions and his hat was sucked into the \ncave.\n  Since that time, notable visitors have included Charlie Crary, the \nfirst person reported to enter the cave; J.D. McDonald, whose family \ngave the first cave tours and sold cave formations to J.D.'s son, \nAlvin; Alvin McDonald, who was the first explorer of the cave and who \nkept a diary and map of his findings; and ``Honest John'' Stabler who \nformed a partnership with the McDonalds to develop the first passages \nand staircases into Wind Cave. Indeed, the early history of the cave \nwas plentiful and colorful.\n  William Jennings Bryan and Governor Lee visited the cave in 1892. \nThat same year, one of the first attractions was put on display. For a \nquarter, visitors could come to the cave and view a `petrified man' \nthat had been found north of the cave. Over the years, visitors would \ncome to view the natural attractions Wind Cave would have to offer.\n  Captain Seth Bullock became the cave's first supervisor in 1902, with \nGeorge Boland serving as the area ranger. South Dakota Congressman Eben \nW. Martin was instrumental in the designation of Wind Cave as a \nnational park. General John J. Pershing visited in 1910 and took \nimportant cave room readings with his pocket aneroid barometer. In \n1914, Ester Cleveland Brazell was a ranger guide at the Cave, possibly \nmaking her the first woman to hold the title of ranger in the National \nPark Service. Walt Disney and other film and video companies have \nproduced films in the park and countless rolls of film have been shot \nby amateur photographers for display in home movies and scrapbooks.\n  Today, Wind Cave has more than 108 miles of explored and mapped \npassages, making it the fourth-longest cave in the United States and \nsixth longest in the world. Well over 5.5 million people have visited \nWind Cave over the past 100 years.\n\n  The first major improvements in the park were accomplished by the \nCivilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Wind Cave was one of many \nimportant projects CCC workers developed in South Dakota. Many of the \nprojects can still be seen today, including roads, the entrance to the \ncave, concrete stairs in the cave and the elevator building and shaft.\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\n  By 1935, the game preserve became an integral part of Wind Cave \nNational Park. Bison, elk, and pronghorn became staples of the visitor \nexperience, and the park's boundaries were expanded in 1946 to over \n28,000 acres.\n  Wildlife management was a main priority and key challenge in the \n1950s and 1960s as herds grew and restoration and management of native \ngrasses, exotic plant species, and animal herds became a main focus.\n  The unique blend of wildlife and aesthetic beauty on the park's \nsurface, combined with the beautiful cave formations, extensive \npassageways, and informative guided tours beneath the surface provide \nthe general public with a wonderful Black Hills experience and one that \nprovides young people with a unique learning opportunity. Visitors can \ntake in such attractions as Lincoln's Fireplace, Petrified Clouds, \nDevil's Lookout, Roe's Misery, Sampson's Palace, Queen's Drawing Room, \nthe Bridge of Sighs, Dante's Inferno, and the Garden of Eden.\n  I want to commend the 18 superintendents who have served Wind Cave \nNational Park, including current superintendent Linda Stoll, for their \nleadership and excellent stewardship of the park over the past 100 \nyears. I also want to applaud the dedication and commitment of the \npark's staff over the years, from rangers and administrative staff to \ntour guides and custodians. All of them have partnered to ensure the \nvisiting public's experience at Wind Cave is a memorable one. Wind Cave \nNational Park is one of the jewels in the Black Hills crown of tourism \ndestinations. Over the years, it has been a privilege for me to work on \ninfrastructure needs and issues of importance involving Wind Cave \nNational Park.\n  From earthquakes, floods and fires to the occasional lost spelunker, \nWind Cave has come a long way since the `Petrified Man' displays and \n25-cent tours. Wind Cave today offers a complete visiting and \neducational experience for people of all ages. The ever-expanding cave \ncontinues to excite and astonish scientists, cave surveyors, \nspelunkers, and the general public. I wish to congratulate Wind Cave \nNational Park on its centennial anniversary and encourage everyone to \nvisit the beautiful Black Hills of South Dakota and Wind Wave National \nPark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7605-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING KAREN McCANN ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to an exceptional educator from my home State of Michigan. On \nJune 12, Karen McCann will retire after 24 years in public education. \nKaren's creativity and dedication to her students has deeply enriched \nthe lives of thousands of young people throughout Michigan.\n  Karen has been an innovative and enthusiastic teacher throughout her \n24-year career as an educator in the Michigan public school system. \nWhile working in the Farmington schools and Troy schools with students \nfrom 4th through 9th grades, she has prided herself on developing new \nmethods of engaging and motivating her students. She truly cares about \nher students' overall well-being and strives to create an environment \nthat fosters curiosity and challenges students to apply what they have \nlearned to life outside the classroom.\n  Karen's commitment to Michigan's children has been demonstrated in \nmany ways throughout her long and distinguished career. She has \nreceived numerous awards including the Detroit News' My Favorite \nTeacher Award and has been nominated for several others, including the \nDisney American Teacher Award, the Newsweek/WDIV Outstanding Teacher \nAward, and is currently under consideration for the JASON Foundation \nfor Education's Hilda E. Taylor Award. She has earned such \ndistinguished honors because of the heartfelt respect and admiration of \nher peers, students, and parents.\n  During the past 7 years, Karen McCann has served as a Michigan JASON \nTeacher Mentor. The JASON Project is a program designed to foster \ninterest in natural sciences through imaginative hands-on experiences. \nShe has carefully created new and exciting opportunities for students \nto expand their knowledge beyond the classroom by integrating a variety \nof activities with the general curriculum established by the Troy \nSchool District. For example, she has designed field trips and \ncoordinated guest speakers to enhance her students' learning \nexperiences and also created a series of afterschool programs entitled \n``JASON U'' to enrich her students' lives beyond the normal schoolday. \nIn addition, Karen has arranged exciting new opportunities for \ncontinuing professional development in the form of seminars for \nteachers throughout the State of Michigan.\n  Michigan's children have been touched by Mrs. McCann's genuine \ninterest and unwavering desire to provide a meaningful learning \nexperience. I have no doubt that Karen's contributions to Michigan's \npublic schools will continue to foster innovation in the future. I am \nconfident my colleagues will join me in offering our heartfelt thanks \nand appreciation to Karen McCann and in wishing her well in her \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7605-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7605-S7606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BURKE MARSHALL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a life \nspent in pursuit of the highest American ideals. Burke Marshall, a \nwonderful man, a frontline soldier in the battle for civil rights, and \na deeply respected resident of Connecticut, died Monday, June 2 at the \nage of 80. I am honored to have known him and occasionally benefited \nfrom his wise counsel.\n  Burke became assistant attorney general for civil rights in the \nKennedy Administration in 1961, just 7 years after the Brown v. Board \nof Education decision had declared ``separate but equal'' schools to be \nunconstitutional. On paper, in the annals of the law, things were \nchanging. But in practice, on the streets and in the schools, those who \nsuffered under Jim Crow knew that America was still defaulting on its \npromissory note. Segregation was still fierce. America was still \nfailing to live up to its founding principles.\n  During his tenure, Burke worked tirelessly to desegregate public \nfacilities in the South. In 1961, he helped craft the Government's ban \non segregation in interstate travel. In 1962, he played a central role \nin the maneuvering that led to the admission of James Meredith to the \nUniversity of Mississippi, the first black student to pass through the \ngates of that school. In Birmingham in 1963, he negotiated a settlement \nbetween civil rights activists and the city's business community that \nhelped bring the city back from the brink of violence. And in 1964, he \nhelped shape the landmark Civil Rights Act, which would outlaw \ndiscrimination in public accommodations nationwide.\n  During his tenure, Burke Marshall traveled throughout the South, \npersuading local authorities to desegregate bus stations, train \nstations, airports. This wasn't glamorous work. It took patience and \npersistence, clarity and courage. But without that patience, \npersistence, clarity, and courage, America would have stalled. America \nwould have regressed. America would not have grown into the great \nNation, full of hope and opportunity for people of all races and \nbackgrounds, that it increasingly is today.\n  Looking back, reading history books, some might think the civil \nrights movement was inexorable or its outcome inevitable. After all, \nthe justice of the cause now seems so obvious. But in those days, \nnothing was for granted. Advancing civil rights was a struggle. Young \npeople were being beaten by mobs; fire hoses and dogs were being turned \non peaceful protestors. Many defenders of segregation would stop at \nnothing to stop the march of social progress.\n  The only reason we were able to build a better country was because of \nthe extraordinary heroism of ordinary people, and because of the \ndifficult decisions made every day by people like Burke Marshall. He \nchipped away at the evil of Jim Crow and helped open the floodgates so \nthat, as the Bible said, justice could begin to flow like water, and \nrighteousness, like a mighty stream.\n  Justice isn't yet flowing like a mighty river in America, nor is \nrighteousness flowing like a mighty stream. We still have hills to \nclimb, as Dr. King might say, before we reach the mountaintop. But \nthanks to the foothold that people like Burke Marshall have given us, \nwe have the ability to keep climbing. We can see the summit. And\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nwe have the strength and the inspiration to never give up until we \nreach it.\n  I got to know Burke Marshall because, in 1970, he moved to \nConnecticut and joined the faculty of Yale Law School, my alma mater, \nwhere he served as deputy dean and professor. I unfortunately had \nalready graduated, but I was lucky to befriend Professor Marshall \naround New Haven. He was a warm, kind, decent man, who believed that \nthe fight for justice was never-ending.\n  The dean of Yale's Law School, Tony Kronman, put it well. He said, \n``His goodness was so large that I half believed and fully wished he \nwould live forever. Burke's generosity brought out the best in others. \nHis love of justice helped change a nation.''\n  Burke Marshall was a quiet man. In fact, his wife Violet once said \nthat, because he said so few words, she wasn't sure whether he liked \nher or not until he proposed. But he wasn't quiet when it counted. On \nmatters of principle, on questions of justice, he heeded the wisdom of \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said: ``Our lives begin to end the day \nwe become silent about things that matter.''\n  Burke Marshall always spoke when it mattered, and that is why his \nlegacy will live on forever in the hearts he touched and in the country \nhe helped change for the better.\n  My condolences to his wife Violet, his daughters Katie, Josie, and \nJane, and his grandchildren. May God bless them and the memory of Burke \nMarshall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7606-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KELSEY LADT\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to honor and pay tribute to \nKelsey Ladt of Paducah, KY, for her inimitable sense of giving and \ncommunity service. Kelsey, age 8, led an art tour fundraiser for the \nCommunity Foundation of Western Kentucky, with proceeds benefitting the \nLourdes' Foundation patient care fund and the St. Nicholas Free Family \nClinic.\n  Kelsey Curd Ladt, daughter of Vicki and Ric Ladt, is a gifted and \nprecocious young lady with an exceptional sense of selflessness and \ncharity. She singlehandedly led a tour of the artwork inside her \nparents' home for 35 people. Kelsey paused by each painting to share \nhistorical insight and anecdote, a remarkable feat for someone so \nyoung.\n  Kelsey researched art at Murray State University under the tutelage \nof Dr. Joy Navan. With the encouragement from Navan and family friend \nBill Ford, Kelsey planned the fundraiser and interviewed directors of \nvarious beneficiaries before selecting the Lourdes' Foundation and the \nSt. Nicholas Free Family Clinic.\n  Kelsey, who is herself an accomplished artist and pianist, plans on \nexpanding the art tour to four homes in the coming years, in order to \nbetter serve her community. Later this summer she will participate in a \nforensic anthropology course at Murray State University and a gifted \nand talented camp at Western Kentucky University.\n  It is my pleasure to honor such an exceptional and altruistic young \nlady for her extraordinary charitable contributions to her community. I \nthank the Senate for allowing me to laud her praises. She is one of \nKentucky's finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7606-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

During a career that has spanned more than 50 years, Dr. \nHarry Begian has made numerous contributions to the music and education \ncommunities across the country and around the world. He has greatly \ninfluenced both high school and collegiate bands throughout the Midwest \nand the Nation. On June 21, 2003, a reunion and banquet will be held at \nCass Technical High School in Detroit to honor not only Dr. Begian's 17 \nprolific years as Director of Bands at Cass Technical High School but \nalso his lifetime of musical contributions that have touched so many.\n  Dr. Begian's early involvement with music included studying trumpet \nand flute with famed musicians Leonard Smith and Larry Teal. Dr. Begian \ncompleted his undergraduate and master's degrees at Wayne State \nUniversity. He also earned a doctorate in music at the University of \nMichigan.\n  Dr. Begian became Director of Bands at Cass Technical High School in \n1947, where he built one of the preeminent high school bands in the \ncountry. During the following 20 years, he served as Director of Bands \nat Wayne State University, Michigan State University, and the \nUniversity of Illinois. In addition to his work as a band director, Dr. \nBegian has served as a guest conductor and lecturer throughout the \nUnited States, Canada, and Australia. In 1987, the Detroit Symphony \nOrchestra invited him to conduct a formal concert in Detroit's \nOrchestra Hall.\n  The Music Division of the Library of Congress created the Harry \nBegian Collection in tribute to his accomplishments. The permanent \ncollection currently contains 26 reel-to-reel recordings of Dr. \nBegian's performances at Cass Tech.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to \nthe accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material \nin the territory of the Russian Federation is to continue beyond June \n21, 2003, to the Federal Register for publication. The most recent \nnotice continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Register \non June 20, 2002 (67 FR 42181).\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons \npursuant to\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\nvarious arms control and disarmanent agreements is dedicated to \npeaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and protected from \ndiversion to activities of proliferation concern. The accumulation of a \nlarge volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the \nRussian Federation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United \nStates. For this reason, I have decided that it is necessary to \ncontinue the national emergency declared with respect to the \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usuable fissible material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation and maintain in force these \nemergency authorities to response to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to reviewing and consider \n     eliminating the provisions of law which reduce or totally \n     eliminate social security benefits for those persons who also \n     receive a state or local government retirement benefit; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 39\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which reduces the \n     spousal and widow(er)s social security benefit, and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), which reduces the \n     earned social security benefit for persons who also receive a \n     state or local government retirement; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and WEP \n     provisions was to address concerns that public employees who \n     had worked primarily in state and local government employment \n     receive the same benefit as workers who had worked in social \n     security employment throughout their careers, thereby \n     providing a disincentive to ``double-dipping''; and\n       Whereas, the GPO affects a spouse or widow(er) receiving a \n     state or local government retirement benefit who would also \n     be entitled to a social security benefit earned by a spouse; \n     and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or widow(er)s \n     social security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     state or local government retirement benefit received by the \n     spouse or widow(er), in many cases completely eliminating the \n     social security benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned a \n     state or local government retirement benefit in addition to \n     having the necessary credits earned in social security \n     employment; and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned social security benefit \n     by using a modified formula of the averaged indexed monthly \n     earnings, which may reduce the earned social security \n     benefits by as much as fifty percent; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP have a disproportionately negative \n     effect on employees working in lower-wage government jobs, \n     such as policemen, firefighter, teachers, and municipal, \n     parochial, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also affect more women than men \n     because of the gender differences in salary that continue to \n     exist across of nation; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of her citizens, to encourage them to remain \n     here lifelong, and to provide for them in their retirement \n     years.\n       Therefore, be it resolved, that the Legislature of \n     Louisiana does hereby memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to review and consider eliminating the GPO and WEP \n     social security benefit reductions.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of the Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of American and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-131. A concurrent House resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the Pledge \n     of Allegiance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 121\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana is one of numerous states in which \n     students recite the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools; \n     and\n       Whereas, the practice of including ``under God'' in the \n     Pledge was established by federal law decades ago and \n     reaffirmed by a new federal law just last year; and\n       Whereas, recent polls indicate that up to ninety percent of \n     the public is overwhelmingly in favor of allowing students to \n     recite the Pledge of Allegiance; and\n       Whereas, Constitution signer George Washington declared, \n     ``the fundamental principle of our Constitution . . . enjoins \n     [requires] that the will of the majority shall prevail,'' and \n     Thomas Jefferson pronounced, ``the will of the majority [is] \n     the natural law of every society [and] is the only sure \n     guardian of the rights of man''; and\n       Whereas, Thomas Jefferson also stated, ``A judiciary \n     independent . . . of the will of the nation is a solecism--at \n     least in a republican government''; and\n       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit has violated these fundamental principles and \n     abrogated the ``consent of the governed'' as set forth in our \n     governing documents; and\n       Whereas, the will of the people can be protected against \n     further judicial usurpation by the federal courts on this \n     issue through congressional action to limit the jurisdiction \n     of the federal courts as explicitly set forth in the \n     Constitution in Article III, Section 2, Paragraph 2 (federal \n     courts ``shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and \n     fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as \n     Congress shall make''); and\n       Whereas, the intent of the Framers regarding this power of \n     Congress to limit judicial overreach was clear, such that \n     Samuel Chase, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and \n     a United States Supreme Court Justice appointed by President \n     George Washington, declared, ``The notion has frequently been \n     entertained that the federal courts derive their judicial \n     power immediately from the Constitution; but the political \n     truth is that the disposal of the judicial power (except in a \n     few specified instances) belongs to Congress. If Congress has \n     given the power to this court, we possess it, not \n     otherwise''; and\n       Whereas, Justice Joseph Story, in his authoritative \n     Commentaries on the Constitution, similarly declared, ``In \n     all cases where the judicial power of the United States is to \n     be exercised, it is for Congress alone to furnish the rules \n     of proceeding, to direct the process, to declare the nature \n     and effect of the process, and the mode, in which the \n     judgments, consequent thereon, shall be executed . . . And if \n     Congress may confer power, they may repeal it . . . The power \n     of Congress [is] complete to make exceptions''; and\n       Whereas, this position is confirmed not only by signers of \n     the Constitution such as George Washington and James Madison \n     but also by other leading constitutional experts and jurists \n     of the day, including Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth, Chief \n     Justice John Marshall, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Yates, \n     George Mason, and John Randolph; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has long \n     recognized and affirmed this power of Congress to limit the \n     appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts, as in 1847 when \n     the court declared that the ``court possesses no appellate \n     power in any case unless conferred upon it by act of \n     Congress'' and in 1865 when it declared ``it is for Congress \n     to determine how far . . . appellate jurisdiction shall be \n     given; and when conferred, it can be exercised only to the \n     extent and in the manner prescribed by law''; and\n       Whereas, congress has on numerous occasions exercised this \n     power to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts, and the \n     Supreme Court has consistently upheld this power of congress \n     in rulings over the last two centuries, including cases in \n     1847, 1866, 1868, 1878, 1882, 1893, 1898, 1901, 1904, 1906, \n     1908, 1910, 1922, 1926, 1948, 1952, 1966, 1973, 1977, and \n     others; and\n       Whereas, it is Congress alone that can remedy this current \n     crisis and return to the states the power to make their own \n     decisions on recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public \n     schools.\n       Therefore, be it resolved, That the Legislature of \n     Louisiana does hereby memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the federal \n     courts regarding the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance \n     in public schools.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\n     and chief clerical officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-132.

and\n       Whereas, the United States has interfered with these non-\n     governmental organizations through the ``global gag rule,'' \n     by which the United States refuses to fund non-governmental \n     organizations that provide legal abortion services, lobby \n     their own governments for abortion law reform, or even \n     provide accurate medical counseling or referrals regarding \n     abortion, even if no United States money is used for those \n     purposes; and\n       Whereas, in almost sixty per cent of these countries, \n     abortion in some form is legal, yet the global gag rule \n     prevents their non-governmental organizations from discussing \n     the option of performing abortions, even if this is done with \n     the non-governmental organizations' own funds and not with \n     any United States funds; and\n       Whereas, in the countries where abortion is not legal, the \n     global gag rule prevents the non-governmental organizations \n     from speaking publicly about these issues to foster informed \n     debate on abortion, even if this free speech is done with the \n     non-governmental organizations' own funds; and\n       Whereas, in rural areas, often these non-governmental \n     organizations are the only health care providers, so \n     restricting their funding affects the health of all people in \n     the community and forces the non-governmental organizations \n     to make an immoral choice: either give up desperately needed \n     funds for family planning services, or give up their right to \n     free speech and to provide their patients with full and \n     accurate medical information; and\n       Whereas, the ``global gag rule'' process hurts good family-\n     planning work that has little to do with the rights of an \n     unborn child, as these family planning services address other \n     health problems such as sexually transmitted diseases, which \n     indirectly helps with economic stability in developing \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, through the global gag rule, the United States \n     government not only stifles free speech, but affirmatively \n     discriminates against viewpoints it does not like, something \n     that would be unconstitutional in its own country; and\n       Whereas, this gag rule was created by execution order of \n     President Reagan in 1984; and\n       Whereas, President Clinton canceled the gag order in 1993, \n     but reluctantly restored it for one year in 1999 in exchange \n     for the Republicans in Congress agreeing to pay the United \n     States' back dues to the United Nations; and\n       Whereas, President Bush reimposed the global gag rule by \n     executive order in January 2001 and reaffirmed his opposition \n     to reproductive rights in his state of the union address; and\n       Whereas, the gag order is consistent with the United States \n     administration's recent announcement at an international \n     conference that they support the ``rhythm method'' of \n     contraception; and\n       Whereas, the global gag rule: undermines the human right to \n     free speech, a right so vigorously championed by our \n     government that it is part of our constitution; undercuts our \n     foreign policy; and damages women's reproductive health; and\n       Whereas, this misguided policy would be illegal were it to \n     be imposed in our own country, and it is unconscionable for \n     the United States to force it on other countries; \n     jeopardizing the health of millions of women and children; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Legislature has already demonstrated its \n     support for women's rights in the family context when it \n     adopted House Resolution No. 15 during the 1999 Regular \n     Session entitled ``Urging the United States Senate to Ratify \n     the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \n     of Discrimination Against Women''; and\n       Whereas, legislation is pending in Congress to remove the \n     global gag rule and permit the non-governmental organizations \n     to provide appropriate and legal family planning service and \n     information in their home countries; now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the \n     Twenty-second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular \n     Session of 2003, That the United States Congress is hereby \n     urged to support a ban on the global gag rule; and\n       Be it further resolved, That certified copies of this \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-139. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington relative to the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n       Whereas, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposal \n     establishing a standard market design (SMD) for electricity \n     proceeds from the premise that a single market model will \n     work for the entire nation, as a result it would \n     fundamentally change the way the transmission system is \n     operated, expand the Commission's authority in state \n     decisions regarding resource adequacy and demand response, \n     and dismantle the regional benefits derived from public \n     power; and\n       Whereas, Washington state has a comprehensive electricity \n     policy, which encourages efficiency while reflecting our \n     unique resource base; and\n       Whereas, The Northwest electricity system is different from \n     most of the rest of the nation, including substantial \n     differences in the transmission ownership, a hydro-based \n     system where the amount of energy generated is limited by the \n     amount of water in the rivers and behind the dams, complex \n     legal arrangements for multiple uses of the water to meet \n     diverse goals (power, irrigation, fisheries, recreation, and \n     treaty obligations), and a hydro-based system that requires \n     substantial coordination among plant owners and utilities, \n     rather than the competitive market-based structure the SMD \n     promotes; and\n       Whereas, The Northwest electricity system has produced \n     affordable, cost-based rates and reliable service for our \n     region; and\n       Whereas, Deregulation broke up traditional regulated \n     utilities in order to create trading markets with the promise \n     of lower costs, more consumer choice, more reliability, and \n     fewer government bailouts. It in fact produced higher prices, \n     more manipulation of consumers, volatility, brownouts, and \n     bailouts running into the tens of billions; and\n       Whereas, The SMD would harm consumers in our region through \n     increased costs and decreased reliability;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission leave the Northwest \n     electricity system in place and withdraw the Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking establishing a Standard Market Design \n     (SMD) for electricity; and\n       Your Memorialists further pray that in the event that the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not withdraw its \n     proposal, the President and Congress take action to prevent \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from proceeding with \n     their proposal.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the Honorable Spencer Abraham, the Secretary \n     of the United States Department of Energy, the Members of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Chairman Patrick Wood, \n     III, Commissioner Nora M. Brownell, and Commissioner William \n     L. Massey, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-140. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8012\n\n       Whereas, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently \n     proposed a new pricing policy for the rates of transmission \n     owners that transfer operational control of their \n     transmission facilities to a Regional Transmission \n     Organization. (RTO), form independent transmission companies \n     within RTOs, or pursue additional measures that promote \n     efficient operation and expansion of the transmission grid; \n     and\n       Whereas, The proposed policy would create rate incentives \n     based on an unproven theory that it will improve grid \n     performance, reduce wholesale transmission and transactions \n     costs, improve electric reliability, and make electric \n     wholesale competition more effective; and\n       Whereas, The proposal offers a single model for the entire \n     nation and fails to recognize regional differences in \n     electricity generation and transmission or the benefits \n     derived from public power; and\n       Whereas, Washington state has a comprehensive electricity \n     policy, which encourages efficiency while reflecting our \n     unique resource base; and\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\n       Whereas, The Northwest electricity system is different from \n     most of the rest of the nation and has produced affordable, \n     cost-based rates and reliable service for our region; and\n       Whereas, We believe the proposed pricing incentives would \n     harm consumers in our region through increased costs without \n     any positive cost-benefit analysis; and\n       Whereas, We believe the proposed pricing incentives will \n     harm the investment climate for new electricity \n     infrastructure in the region due to the Commission's \n     inability to ensure delivery of the promised incentives, and \n     because the incentives first apply to existing transmission \n     and second to new investment, but only if a utility is a \n     member of an RTO; and\n       Whereas, We believe the proposed pricing incentives will \n     make more difficult the formation of any new regional \n     transmission organization that is, in fact, well-designed to \n     fit Northwest regional circumstances because the generic \n     incentive is a new cost that outweigh any benefits of such an \n     organization;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission leave the Northwest \n     electricity system in place and withdraw its proposed new \n     pricing policy for the rates of transmission owners until \n     such time as a cost-benefit analysis is completed that \n     indicates a positive benefit from Northwest consumers, and \n     the region expresses its desire to form a new transmission \n     organizations; and\n       Your Memorialists further pray that in the event that the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not withdraw its \n     proposal, the President and Congress take action to prevent \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from proceeding with \n     their proposal.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the Honorable Spencer Abraham, the Secretary \n     of the United States Department of Energy, the Members of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Chairman Patrick Wood, \n     III, Commissioner Nora M.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan relative to fuel cell research \n     projects; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, In his State of the Union address, President Bush \n     identified fuel cell research as a national priority. While \n     this move holds great significance for our entire country, \n     the urgency for developing a new energy source is most \n     acutely understood in Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Through the resources of the automotive industry, \n     smaller companies across our state, and university research \n     being conducted at numerous locales, the drive to develop the \n     fuel cell as the next generation energy source has been in \n     high gear in Michigan for many years. The human and \n     technological resources Michigan has as the home of the auto \n     industry indicates both our state's capacity for fuel cell \n     research and its stake in advancing the next generation of \n     energy. Michigan's efforts include innovative approaches to \n     virtually all aspects of the infrastructure necessary to \n     develop fuel cells, including work on the storage and \n     transportation of hydrogen; and\n       Whereas, In addition to well-known efforts within the auto \n     industry, Michigan is also the site of research seeking to \n     develop fuel cell applications for homes and businesses. \n     Michigan businesses are working closely with university \n     researchers on these projects; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has made a significant commitment to \n     encouraging enterprise in the field of emerging energy \n     development. The Ninety-first Legislature enacted the \n     ``NextEnergy'' package of legislation to promote energy \n     research, especially fuel cell technology. These acts created \n     a series of tax credits, exemptions, and deductions for \n     businesses working on alternative energy technologies, in \n     addition to providing for alternative energy zones to spur \n     investment. The Next Energy Authority created in the \n     Department of Management and Budget reflects the depth of the \n     state's commitment. Clearly, Michigan is uniquely suited for \n     research devoted to establishing a hydrogen-based means of \n     generating energy for our cars, homes, and businesses; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representative \n     concurring), That we memorialize the President and Congress \n     of the United States to pursue and support fuel cell research \n     projects in Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United states, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-142. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Montana relative to Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, stable, affordable energy is vital to the economy \n     and security of the people of the State of Montana and the \n     United States of America; and\n       Whereas, the United States has become increasingly \n     dependent on foreign supplies of crude oil to meet our energy \n     needs and is now importing more than 55% of the nation's \n     crude oil needs; and\n       Whereas, dependence on imports is rising and could exceed \n     65% by the year 2020 due to growth in demand and falling \n     production; and\n       Whereas, the recent events in Venezuela and other \n     international problems have caused uncertainty in the \n     commodities markets about the future supply of oil; and\n       Whereas, these among other factors have resulted in an \n     increase in the price of crude oil to over $33 per barrel \n     and, with crude oil costs being the largest component of the \n     retail price of petroleum products, has resulted in a \n     significant increase in the national average price of \n     gasoline and has similarly increased the price of other \n     petroleum products vital to the economy of the United States \n     and the lives of its citizens; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates the \n     Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) \n     contains between 5.7 and 16 billion barrels of recoverable \n     oil; and\n       Whereas, production from the Coastal Plain of ANWR could \n     produce up to 1.5 million barrels of oil per day for at least \n     25 years, which is comparable to the volumes the United \n     States is expected to import from Iraq for the next 25 years \n     and which represents nearly 25% of current daily U.S. \n     production, and could save $14 billion dollars per year in \n     oil imports; and\n       Whereas, ANWR consists of 19 million acres, of which 8 \n     million are classified as wilderness, 9.5 million are \n     designated as national refuge lands, and 8% or 1.5 million \n     acres comprise the Coastal Plain for which the potential \n     for oil and gas production was acknowledged by Congress in \n     the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of \n     1980; and\n       Whereas, oil and natural gas development and wildlife are \n     successfully coexisting and advanced technology has greatly \n     reduced the ``footprint'' of Arctic oil development; and\n       Whereas, the Alaska State AFL-CIO and the Alaska Federation \n     of Natives support responsible oil and gas development on the \n     Coastal Plain of ANWR; and\n       Whereas, environmentally responsible exploration, \n     development, and production of oil on the Coastal Plain of \n     ANWR will provide incomes to federal and state governments \n     and general jobs and business opportunities for residents in \n     all 50 states; and\n       Whereas, the people of Montana, while in general and \n     qualified support of continued development of fossil fuels, \n     recognize that further development of fossil fuels addresses \n     the short-term needs of our nation's energy independence; and\n       Whereas, the people of Montana agree with the comments of \n     President Bush during the 2003 State of the Union Address \n     that the development of alternative energy sources, which \n     would make America truly independent, is the preferred path \n     for our country; and\n       Whereas, the people of Montana recognize that development \n     of alternative energy sources, including solar, hydrogen, \n     wind, fuel cell, ethanol, and biodiesel fuels, constitutes a \n     preferred alternative to long-term energy development; and\n       Whereas, people of Montana understand that development of \n     certain alternative energy sources, such as ethanol and \n     biodiesel fuel, would enhance the economic and agricultural \n     base of our great state; and\n       Whereas, people of Montana further acknowledge that the \n     efficient use of our existing energy resources in a critical \n     and strategic priority in order to ensure our energy \n     independence; and\n       Whereas, America has demonstrated the ability to \n     dramatically reduce the energy consumption in past times of \n     national crisis through fuel efficiency standards for \n     automobiles, installation of industrial efficiency measures, \n     and a conservation ethic among consumers.\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives of the State of Montana:\n       (1) That the Congress of the United States be urged to take \n     action to stabilize domestic crude oil supplies through \n     facilitating additional production, to decrease our nation's \n     need for foreign oil from undependable sources, to increase \n     federal and state revenue from oil and gas leasing, and, \n     subject to prioritizing those efforts described in subsection \n     (2), to support the economy through addition of good paying \n     jobs by opening the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing and environmentally \n     responsible exploration, development, and production of the \n     petroleum reserved.\n       (2) That the Congress of the United States be urged to:\n       (a) increase support for development of new sources of \n     renewable energy, such as biofuels (including biodiesel and \n     ethanol), wind, and solar:\n       (b) pursue development and use of fuel efficient vehicles \n     and development of new technologies such as fuel cells and \n     other potential applications of emerging hydrogen technology; \n     and\n       (c) develop programs and standards to encourage efficient \n     use of existing resources in transportation, industrial and \n     commercial processes, and consumer end uses.\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\n       Be it further resolved, That the Secretary of State send \n     copies of this resolution to the Governor, the Montana \n     Congressional Delegation, the Speaker of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the President of the U.S. Senate, and the \n     U.S. Secretary of the Interior.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM--143. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska relative to the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 4\n\n       Whereas, in sec. 1002 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act (ANILCA) the United States Congress reserved \n     the right to permit further oil and gas exploration, \n     development, and production within the coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska; and\n       Whereas the oil industry, the state, the United States \n     Department of the Interior consider the coastal plain to have \n     the highest potential for discovery of very large oil and gas \n     accumulations on the continent of North America, estimated to \n     be as much as 10,000,000,000 barrels of recoverable oil; and\n       Whereas the ``1002 study area'' is part of the coastal \n     plain located within the North Slope Borough, and residents \n     of the North Slope Borough, who are predominantly Inupiat \n     Eskimo, are supportive of development in the ``1002 study \n     area''; and\n       Whereas oil and gas exploration and development of the \n     coastal plain of the refuge and adjacent land could result in \n     major discoveries that would reduce our nation's future need \n     for imported oil, help balance the nation's trade deficit, \n     and significantly increase the nation's security; and\n       Whereas domestic demand for oil continues to rise while \n     domestic crude production continues to fall with the result \n     that the United States imports additional oil from foreign \n     sources; and\n       Whereas development of oil at Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk, \n     Endicott, Lisburne, and Milne Point has resulted in thousands \n     of jobs throughout the United States, and projected job \n     creation as a result of coastal plain oil development will \n     have a positive effect in all 50 states; and\n       Whereas Prudhoe Bay production is declining by \n     approximately 10 percent a year; and\n       Whereas, while new oil field developments on the North \n     Slope of Alaska, such as Alpine, Badami, and West Sak, may \n     slow or temporarily stop the decline in production, only \n     giant coastal plain fields have the theoretical capability of \n     increasing the production volume of Alaska oil to a \n     significant degree; and\n       Whereas opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge now allows sufficient time for planning \n     environmental safeguards, development, and national security \n     review; and\n       Whereas the 1,500,000-acre coastal plain of the refuge \n     makes up only eight percent of the 19,000,000-acre refuge, \n     and the development of the oil and gas reserves in the \n     refuge's coastal plain would affect an area of 2,000 to 7,000 \n     acres, which is less than one-half of one percent of the area \n     of the coastal plain; and\n       Whereas 8,000,000 of the 19,000,000 acres of the refuge \n     have already been set aside as wilderness; and\n       Whereas the oil industry has shown at Prudhoe Bay, as well \n     as at other locations along the Arctic coastal plain, that it \n     can safely conduct oil and gas activity without adversely \n     affecting the environment or wildlife populations; and\n       Whereas the state will ensure the continued health and \n     productivity of the Porcupine Caribou herd and the protection \n     of land, water, and wildlife resources during the exploration \n     and development of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, Alaska; and\n       Whereas the oil industry is using innovative technology and \n     environmental practices in the new field developments at \n     Alpine and Northstar, and those techniques are directly \n     applicable to operating on the coastal plain and would \n     enhance environmental protection beyond traditionally high \n     standards;\n       Be it resolved by the Alaska State Legislature, That the \n     Congress of the United States is urged to pass legislation to \n     open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, Alaska, to oil and gas exploration, development, and \n     production, and that the Alaska State Legislature is \n     adamantly opposed to further wilderness or other restrictive \n     designation in the areas of the coastal plain of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska; and be it\n       Further resolved, That that activity be conducted in a \n     manner that protects the environment and the naturally \n     occurring population levels of the Porcupine Caribou herd, \n     and that uses the state's work force to the maximum extent \n     possible; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature opposes \n     any unilateral reduction in royalty revenue from exploration \n     and development of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, and any attempt to coerce the State \n     of Alaska into accepting less than the 90 percent of the oil, \n     gas, and mineral royalties from the federal lands in Alaska \n     that was promised to the state at statehood.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     George W.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the fuel \n     cell research; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, In his State of the Union address, President Bush \n     identified fuel cell research as a national priority. While \n     this move holds great significance for our entire country, \n     the urgency for developing a new energy source is most \n     acutely understood in Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Through the resources of the automotive industry, \n     smaller companies across our state, and university research \n     being conducted at numerous locales, the drive to develop the \n     fuel cell as the next generation energy source has been in \n     high gear in Michigan for many years. The human and \n     technological resources Michigan has as the home of the auto \n     industry indicates both our state's capacity for fuel cell \n     research and its stake in advancing the next generation of \n     energy. Michigan's efforts include innovative approaches to \n     virtually all aspects of the infrastructure necessary to \n     develop fuel cells, including work on the storage and \n     transportation of hydrogen; and\n       Whereas, In addition to well-known efforts within the auto \n     industry, Michigan is also the site of research seeking to \n     develop fuel cell applications for homes and businesses. \n     Michigan businesses are working closely with university \n     researchers on these projects; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has made a significant commitment to \n     encouraging enterprise in the field of emerging energy \n     development. The Ninety-first Legislature enacted the \n     ``NextEnergy'' package of legislation to promote energy \n     research, especially fuel cell technology. These acts created \n     a series of tax credits, exemptions, and deductions for \n     businesses working on alternative energy technologies, in \n     addition to providing for alternative energy zones to spur \n     investment. The Next Energy Authority created in the \n     Department of Management and Budget reflects the depth of the \n     state's commitment. Clearly, Michigan is uniquely suited for \n     research devoted to establishing a hydrogen-based means of \n     generating energy for our cars, homes, and businesses; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the President \n     and Congress of the United States to pursue and support fuel \n     cell research projects in Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-145.

The President has called for regional \n     centers in his 2004 budget proposal; and\n       Whereas, In the Midwest, an excellent site for a regional \n     headquarters is the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in \n     Macomb County. The advantages this location offers range from \n     low costs, unsurpassed strategic significance, and facilities \n     that can provide for a swift and smooth transition to the \n     responsibilities of homeland security work; and\n       Whereas, Located at the heart of the nation's freshwater \n     network and near several of the busiest international points \n     of entry along our northern border, Selfridge is well \n     positioned to handle quickly any type of task to protect \n     America's people, resources, and infrastructure. Clearly, \n     this location offers opportunities for enhanced \n     responsiveness to the challenges before us in safeguarding \n     our nation in the years ahead; now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we urge the United States Department of \n     Homeland Security to locate its Midwestern headquarters at \n     the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland \n     Security, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-150.

However, there are numerous situations in \n     which mental health and mental health services are considered \n     far differently than physical maladies; and\n       Whereas, Under the current practices of our Medicare \n     system, several types of mental health and counseling \n     services are not covered. This omission is especially \n     inappropriate in view of the fact that senior citizens often \n     face more challenges to their emotional and mental well-being \n     than other age groups. Senior citizens suffer from depression \n     at higher rates than other age groups, for example; and\n       Whereas, Congress has before it a measure that would \n     address this gap in Medicare coverage. The Seniors Mental \n     Health Access Improvement Act, S. 310, would amend the \n     Medicare system to provide for the coverage of marriage and \n     family therapist services and mental health counselor \n     services under Part B of Medicare. The impact of adding this \n     coverage would be beneficial not only to countless \n     individuals and families, but also to the Medicare system \n     through the improved overall health it would encourage: Now, \n     therefore, be it.\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to include the \n     services of licensed professional counselors and marriage and \n     family therapists among services covered under Medicare; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       POM-151.

Such revised emergency evacuation \n     plan should pay particular attention to the recommendation \n     that the emergency evacuation plan of ``any plant adjacent to \n     high population areas should have different requirements than \n     plants otherwise situated, because protective actions are \n     more difficult and the consequences of failure or delay are \n     higher,'' and be it further\n       Resolved, That the New Castle Town Board calls upon the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission to begin the decommissioning \n     process to reduce the vulnerability of the Indian Point \n     Nuclear Power Plants at the earliest possible date, and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the New Castle Town Board hereby directs \n     that its will and its desire as expressed through this \n     Resolution be transmitted to all appropriate parties within \n     the County, State and Federal governments empowered to act \n     upon and effect the provisions as stated herein.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-152. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the \n     transportation funds; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, For several decades, Michigan has sent much more \n     federal highway tax money to Washington than it has received \n     in return. This imbalance has helped our nation build the \n     country's highway infrastructure. With the national \n     infrastructure largely completed, the continuation of the \n     imbalance has created a serious challenge for Michigan and \n     other ``donor states''; and\n       Whereas, Michigan, which typically loses between $150 \n     million and $400 million each year by sending more to \n     Washington than it receives, is severely hampered. The unfair \n     practice of contributing hundreds of millions of dollars \n     beyond the amount we receive to fund projects in other parts \n     of the country makes it far more difficult for Michigan to \n     maintain the quality of its highways. The loss of funding \n     also represents a serious loss of economic activity; and\n       Whereas, The chairman of the House Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee and the chairman of the Senate \n     Environment and Public Works Committee in Congress have \n     proposed a major change in how federal highway funds are \n     distributed. They have called for a funding formula that \n     would guarantee that all states receive a minimum of 95 \n     percent of what they each contribute to the federal highway \n     program; and\n       Whereas, The potential impact for Michigan of a guarantee \n     of at least 95 percent of this funding would be very \n     significant. Even as the economy calls for more careful \n     public expenditures, this proposed policy change would help \n     Michigan and bring greater fairness to the issue of \n     transportation spending. Citizens, visitors, and businesses \n     of this state would benefit enormously from this long overdue \n     policy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to provide that all states receive a minimum of \n     95 percent of transportation funds sent to the federal \n     government and to urge Congress to make the return of \n     transportation money to the states a higher priority within \n     existing federal revenues; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-153. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the Solid \n     Waste; to the\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, In 1992, the United States Supreme Court, in Fort \n     Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. Michigan Department of Natural \n     Resources, ruled that states could not ban the importation of \n     solid waste because Congress has the ultimate authority to \n     regulate interstate commerce. Since that time, Michigan has \n     become the dumping ground for increasing amounts of solid \n     waste from out of our state and our country; and\n       Whereas, Michigan is the third-largest importer of solid \n     waste in the country. Approximately 20 percent of all trash \n     in Michigan landfills now originate outside of Michigan. The \n     amounts have increased significantly in the past several \n     years, and recent reports of a major contract with Ontario \n     and of the closing of the nation's largest landfill in New \n     York seem to indicate this issue will loom larger in the \n     future; and\n       Whereas, An agreement between the city of Vaughan, Ontario, \n     and Carleton Farms in Wayne County's Sumpter Township will \n     thrust Michigan into being the second-largest importer of \n     solid waste in the country next year, as Michigan will be \n     accepting a large majority of the city of Toronto's municipal \n     solid waste; and\n       Whereas, Accepting unlimited volumes of trash from outside \n     our state has serious long-term consequences. Long after the \n     money from the contracts has been spent, a potential \n     environmental threat continues, as does an obligation to \n     monitor disposal sites to protect water and public health \n     from toxic releases. Clearly, any state accepting these long-\n     term risks should be able to regulate the creation of that \n     risk, regardless of where it originate; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to give states the authority to ban importation \n     of out-of-state solid waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-154.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to Emerald Ash \n     Borer; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, In an amazingly short period of time, an important \n     species of tree in Michigan faces a devastating infestation \n     from an insect known as the emerald ash borer. This beetle, \n     which has also been found in Ontario and Ohio, is thought to \n     have entered Michigan in 1997. Already, this insect has \n     killed 5 million trees in the six-county area of southeastern \n     Michigan. In response, the state has quarantined the six \n     counties, where approximately 28 million ash trees are at \n     risk; and\n       Whereas, The potential economic and ecosystem impact of \n     this invading species would be dramatic across our state and \n     potentially the entire country. In addition to what the loss \n     of all ash trees would mean to the appearance of our homes, \n     communities, and the entire state, ash trees constitute an \n     important and versatile lumber resource that may be lost \n     without swift and certain actions. As with any type of plant \n     so widespread, the loss of Michigan's estimated one billion \n     ash trees clearly could have unforeseen effects on our forest \n     ecology; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n     must establish a federal quarantine for the emerald ash \n     borer. Such action would provide uniform rules for slowing or \n     containing the northern advance of the insect; guarantee \n     sufficient protections for international commerce with \n     Canada, which is also experiencing infestation; and allow for \n     the compensation of a number of growers, distributors, \n     retailers, and contractors within the quarantine area who \n     have lost crops and sales without warning; and\n       Whereas, In an effort to save this species of tree, \n     Michigan has asked Congress to provide financial assistance \n     to state and municipal officials. In addition, these \n     officials need technical assistance to develop a sound \n     strategy of combating this destructive vermin, which clearly \n     has the potential to cause great damage not only in Michigan, \n     but across the country; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to establish a \n     quarantine for the emerald ash borer and provide assistance \n     to help Michigan combat the infestation; and be it further\n       Resolved That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the United States \n     Department of Agriculture, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-159.

In spite of a quarantine \n     in 6 southeastern Michigan counties, this beetle has killed 5 \n     million of the 28 million ash trees in the quarantined area. \n     Overall, the emerald ash borer, an invasive species that is \n     causing similar devastation in Ontario and Ohio, threatens as \n     many as 700 million trees in our state; and\n       Whereas, Ash trees are very important to the ecology of our \n     state. They are also used for many products in several \n     sectors of the economy. Beyond these factors, the ash trees \n     that grace our communities and neighborhoods are beloved \n     shade trees that contribute enormously to the character and \n     beauty of Michigan; and\n       Whereas, The Governor is working to secure quick help from \n     the federal government to deal with this swiftly escalating \n     problem. Michigan badly needs technical and financial \n     assistance in the face of this emergency. The state has taken \n     decisive actions to deal with this invasive species, but the \n     magnitude of the problem and the immediacy of the issue make \n     it clear that we need the swift assistance of Congress and \n     the United States Department of Agriculture; now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States and the United States Department of \n     Agriculture to provide assistance, including financial \n     assistance, in the effort to deal with the infestation of the \n     emerald ash borer; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-160.

It increases costs, limits markets for \n     livestock producers nationally and internationally, depresses \n     interest in the state's hunting and tourism industries, and \n     requires state resources for its eradication. These factors \n     have impacted the families of northeastern Lower Michigan \n     significantly; and\n       Whereas, Since the discovery of bovine tuberculosis in wild \n     white-tailed deer in Michigan in 1995, and in cattle in 1998, \n     the state of Michigan, in a partnership with Michigan State \n     University, the livestock industry, the hunting and outdoors \n     community, and local and federal officials, has worked \n     diligently to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; \n     and\n       Whereas, Through an aggressive testing plan for livestock \n     and wildlife, Michigan is able to demonstrate to other states \n     and the world that this disease is not present throughout the \n     entire state of Michigan and that the tremendous efforts \n     undertaken with both livestock and wildlife are moving the \n     state toward eradication; and\n       Whereas, Federal assistance on technical, financial, and \n     staff levels has been critical to\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\n     Michigan's efforts to eradicate bovine tuberculosis; and\n       Whereas, With many other current and emerging plant and \n     animal diseases, resources are challenged at both the federal \n     and state levels to address these diseases adequately; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memoralize the Congress of the United States to continue \n     providing assistance to Michigan to help eradicate bovine \n     tuberculosis; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United Stated \n     Department of Agriculture.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-162.

Simplification is to be accomplished through the use \n     of standardized, electronic transmission of administrative \n     and financial data--which if successful should simplify \n     health care record keeping and enhance the ability of private \n     health insurance providers to process claims; and\n       Whereas, While the health and insurance industries may be \n     aware of and executing the requirements of HIPAA, the \n     recipients of health care, and individuals concerned of their \n     condition, are confused and having difficulty comprehending \n     the restrictions of the new procedures; and\n       Whereas, While patients have a right to their own health \n     information, and while information regarding patients may be \n     obtained by personal representatives or establishment of \n     ``significant other'' relationships, it is urged information \n     regarding whether a person is a patient at a facility, \n     without disclosure of reason or condition, should be \n     available to interesed parties: now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State \n     of Kansas: That we urge the Congress of the United States and \n     implementing federal agencies to consider the provision of \n     the information which does not disclose medially sensitive \n     information to be available to inquiring persons; and\n       Be it further resolved: That the Chief Clerk of the House \n     of Representatives be directed to send an enrolled copy of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representative and \n     to each member of the Kansas legislative delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-164.

Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act of \n     1984; and\n       Whereas, total federal funding for career and technical \n     education in the 2003 fiscal year was $1.3 billion, of which \n     Virginia is receiving nearly $25 million in basic grant funds \n     and another $2.5 million in tech prep grant funds; and\n       Whereas, 85 percent of Virginia's state grant or nearly $18 \n     million is being distributed to local school divisions, while \n     more than $3.1 million is being distributed to the Virginia \n     Community College System and the remaining $3.7 million is \n     allocated to the Department of Education for state \n     administration of career and technical education programs, \n     including assessment, training, professional development, and \n     improvement of academic skills; and\n       Whereas, local school divisions depend on the federal \n     funding of career and technical education to accomplish many \n     goals, including, but not limited to, strengthening students' \n     academic, vocational, and technical skills, implementing \n     industry certification programs, expanding the use of \n     technology, providing professional development to career and \n     technical teachers, involving parents, local businesses, and \n     labor and industry leaders in the design, implementation, and \n     evaluation of career and technical programs in order to meet \n     the needs of the local economy and to comply with nationally \n     adopted standards; and\n       Whereas, career and technical education programs benefit \n     Virginia's economy by providing crucial training to students \n     of various ability levels and economic backgrounds, including \n     gifted and talented students, traditional high school \n     students, students with disabilities, and students who are \n     bound for college and those who are bound for the world of \n     work; and\n       Whereas, the Virginia Standards of Quality require career \n     and technical education programs in the public schools that \n     are ``infused into the K though 12 curricula that promote \n     knowledge of careers and all types of employment \n     opportunities,'' and ``competency-based career and technical \n     education programs, which integrate academic outcomes, career \n     guidance and job-seeking skills for all secondary students''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Congress will take up reauthorization of this \n     important law in the coming year and several proposals have \n     been put forth that are troubling to local school divisions \n     and suggest that consideration may be given to diverting the \n     federal dollars to other priorities; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to continue \n     the funding for career and technical education in public \n     secondary and postsecondary schools when reauthorizing the \n     Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act of \n     2003. The Congress also shall be urged, in order to maintain \n     the vitality and success of Virginia's career and technical \n     education programs in the Commonwealth's public secondary and \n     postsecondary schools, to continue the funding of public \n     career and technical education in an amount that will \n     continue Virginia's $27 million in funding or will increase \n     this amount; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation so that they may be apprised of the \n     sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7618-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7618-S7619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n       S. 1218.

A bill to provide for Presidential support and coordination \nof interagency ocean science programs and development and coordination \nof a comprehensive and integrated United States research and monitoring \nprogram; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nspur the advent of an exciting new field of research, one that explores \nthe role of the oceans in human health. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort by the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens, who \nis cosponsoring this bill. The Oceans and Human Health Act proposes to \nestablish a national interagency program that will coordinate research \nefforts and ensure the availability of an adequate Federal investment \nin this critical area. It also would establish a program at the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to strengthen and \ncoordinate its work in this very important arena.\n  In recent years, we have gained a renewed appreciation for the \nimportance of the ocean to our future and well-being. We now recognize \nthat human health is one are in which the oceans exert major influences \nthat are both positive and negative. However, studying this \nrelationship is challenging. To be successful, a research program must \nintegrate disciplines, bringing together oceanographers and biomedical \nresearchers to better understand marine processes, reduce public health \nrisks and enhance our biomedical capabilities. Pioneering scientists \nare needed to tackle marine environmental issues that affect human and \nmarine life alike, such as ocean pollution, marine pathogens and \npotential drug discoveries. A number of Federal agencies would share \nresponsibility and expertise for such a program, requiring that \ncapabilities be harnessed across such diverse entities as the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation \nand the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences.\n  The rich biodiversity of marine organisms represent an important \nbiomedical resource, a promising source of novel compounds with \ntherapeutic potential, and a potentially significant contribution to \nthe national economy. A 1999 National Research Council report, From \nMonsoons to Microbes, noted that nature has been the traditional source \nof new pharmaceuticals and found that over 50 percent of the marketed \ndrugs are extracted from natural sources or produced using natural \nproducts. Virtually every type of life that exists on this planet is \nfound in the sea and many types of plants and animals are exclusively \nmarine. While the oceans are a repository for much of our biodiversity, \nlittle of it has been catalogued or studied. One important aspect that \nwe have yet to explore is the potential of marine life to produce \nchemicals for treating diseases. There are only three marine compounds \nnow in clinical use--and these were developed in the 1950s. While there \nare some new compounds in the pipeline, we need to speed this effort up \nto ensure we get more approved sooner.\n  But our relationship to the sea also has a darker side. The oceans \ndrive climate and weather factors causing severe weather events and \nshifts in temperature and rainfall patterns. These changes in turn \naffect the density and distribution of disease-causing organisms and \nthe ability of public health systems to address them. In addition, the \noceans act as a route of exposure for human disease and illnesses \nthrough ingestion of contaminated seafood and direct contact with \nseawater containing toxins and disease-causing organisms. We need to \nknow more about how our health is affected by the\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\nmarine environment. We must ensure that the sea maintains its capacity \nto sustain itself without becoming a ``Dead Zone.'' We must find ways \nto monitor and reduce the occurrence of ocean toxins that kill marine \nmammals and taint seafood. As with cancer, our goal must be \nunderstanding and prevention, rather than relying exclusively on \ntreatment.\n\n  Research on the health of marine organisms, including marine mammals \nand other sentinel species, can assist scientists in their efforts to \ninvestigate and understand human physiology and biochemical processes, \nas well as providing a means for monitoring the health of marine \necosystems. Unfortunately such research often does not fall clearly \nwithin a single federal agency's mission. The dolphins of Florida's \nIndian River Lagoon provide an example of a marine population that is \nthe victim of contaminated habitat and food. The result is unusually \nhigh mortality rates and harmful health effects. Not only is the \npopulation at risk, but it provides a clear indicator of environmental \npollution concerns for its human neighbors. We must harness the \nsciences of genomics, forensics and ecology and put them to work in the \nmarine world, creating an ocean Center for Disease Control--a ``CDC for \nthe Oceans''.\n  An exciting example of this new interdisciplinary and medically-\noriented approach to ocean research can be found at NOAA's two marine \nlaboratories in Charleston, including a unique research partnership \namong NOAA, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), \nthe State of South Carolina, the Medical University of South Carolina, \nand the College of Charleston, formerly known as the Marine \nEnvironmental Health Research Laboratory, and now referred to as the \nHollings Marine Laboratory (HML). HML works with a variety of Federal, \nState, and academic partners around the Nation and is on the front \nlines of discovery and prevention, particularly in the emerging field \nof marine genomics. They are hard at work on today's important public \nand marine environmental health issues. Their exciting dolphin health \nresearch will for the first time utilize a traditional medical approach \nto diagnosing and documenting dolphin health, which will help us learn \nmore about dolphins in the wild than we have ever known. In addition, \nHML scientists, important partners in the Coral Disease and Health \nConsortium, are already analyzing samples from the two Florida coral \nreefs ``quarantined'' by NOAA today because of a fast-spreading coral \ndisease.\n  The HML epitomizes the variety of important disciplines that must \nwork side-by-side if we are to make progress in this area. It is home \nto cutting-edge research involving algal toxins, natural products with \npotential pharmaceutical applications, and viral and bacterial \npathogens that cause disease in marine animals, with potential links to \nhuman illness and disease processes and natural product chemistry. \nScientists at HML and its partner NOAA facility use unique medical \ntools such as nuclear magnetic resonators to help ``map'' cellular and \ngenetic structure of marine organisms and have developed methods for \ndetecting pesticides in water, sediments, fish and marine mammals that \nmay potentially affect both the health of the marine environment and \nhuman health. They also are developing exposure, toxicology and disease \nmodels to assess their effects on a variety of marine organisms. Their \nwork will better define ocean health and bridge the gap with existing \nhuman health models.\n  A number of Federal agencies are now recognizing the importance of \nunderstanding health-related ocean research and to make needed \ninvestments. Last year, initiatives began both through our ocean \nagency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as \ntwo of our Federal research institutions, the National Institute for \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, and the National Science \nFoundation, NSF.\n\n  This past year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA, received appropriations of $8 million to develop an oceans and \nhuman health initiative. Within NOAA, many programs and laboratories \nperform research and related activities that could contribute \nsignificantly to a national research effort, but such efforts have not \nrealized their potential. Establishment of this coordinated, \ninterdisciplinary program consisting of nationally-recognized research \ncenters and an external interdisciplinary research grant program will \nenhance the NOAA program. In addition, last November, the National \nInstitute for Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, National Science \nFoundation, NSF, invited applications for research programs to explore \nthe relationship between marine processes and public health. The joint \ninitiative commits $6 million annually to establish centers of \nexcellence focusing on harmful algal blooms, water and vector-borne \ndiseases, and marine pharmaceuticals and probes.\n  Taken together, the NIEHS-NSF and NOAA research initiatives offer an \nexcellent basis for building a comprehensive national program. In \naddition, a number of other Federal agencies are poised to make \nsignificant contributions.\n  The Oceans and Human Health Act provides the legislative framework \nfor a coordinated national investment to improve understanding of \nmarine ecosystems, address marine public health problems and tap into \nthe ocean's potential contribution to new biomedical treatments and \nadvances. The legislation would amend the 1976 Science and Technology \nAct to clarify the role of the National Science and Technology Council \nin coordinating interagency research efforts. It would also establish \nan interagency committee on oceans and human health to develop a \nresearch plan and coordinate participation by NOAA, NSF, NIEHS and \nother agencies. Governing NOAA's contribution to the interagency \neffort, the bill would establish a new NOAA program on oceans and human \nhealth. At the heart of this legislation and key to its success is our \ncommitment to building new partnerships--among Federal health, science \nand ocean agencies, among diverse scientific disciplines, and among \nacademic researchers and government experts.\n  A more detailed summary of the legislation follows:\n\n        Section-by-Section Analysis Oceans and Human Health Act\n\n       The Oceans and Human Health Act would authorize the \n     establishment of a coordinated federal research program to \n     aid in understanding and responding to the role of oceans in \n     human health. The bill would establish a Federal interagency \n     Oceans and Human Health initiative coordinated through the \n     National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, as well as \n     create an Oceans and Human Health program at the Department \n     of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     (NOAA). The bill also directs the Secretary of Commerce to \n     establish a coordinated public information and outreach \n     program with the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Centers for \n     Disease Control CDC, and the States to provide information \n     on potential ocean-related human health risks.\n\n\n                         Section 1. Short Title\n\n       Section 1 provides the short title of the Act is the \n     ``Oceans and Human Health Act.''\n\n\n                          Section 2. Findings\n\n       Section 2 sets forth findings and purposes for the Act.\n\n\n           Section 3. National Science and Technology Council\n\n       Section 3 would amend the National Science and Technology \n     Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \n     6616, to codify the responsibilities of the National Science \n     and Technology Council NSTC, which was established by \n     executive Order in 1993, and whose functions have superceded \n     the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, \n     and Technology, FCCSET, the functions of which were \n     transferred to the President under a 1977 executive order. \n     The Act is also amended to clarify the director of the Office \n     of Science and Technology Policy, OSTP, serves as chair of \n     the NSTC.\n       Subsection b replaces existing section 401 of the Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6651) with new text specifying NSTC functions, which \n     focus on prompting domestic and international coordination \n     among government, industry and university scientists. \n     Subsection b sets forth the following as NSTC functions: 1. \n     promote interagency efforts and communication with respect to \n     the planning and administration of Federal scientific, \n     engineering, and technology program. 2. identify research \n     needs; achieve more effective use of Federal facilities and \n     resources; 3. further international cooperation in science, \n     engineering and technology; and 4. develop long-range and \n     coordinated research plans. The NSTC is directed to carry out \n     these and other related duties with the assistance of the \n     Federal agencies represented on the Council. This subsection \n     also authorizes the NSTC Chairman to establish standing \n     committees and working\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\n     groups to assist in developing interagency plans, conduct \n     studies and make reports for the Chairman.\n\n\n    Section 4. Interagency Oceans and Human Health Research Program\n\n       Interagency Program. Section 4 provides for the \n     establishment of an Interagency Oceans and Human Health \n     Research Program, Interagency OHH Program, to be coordinated \n     and supported by the NSTC. Subsection (a) directs the NSTC to \n     establish a Committee on Oceans and Human Health comprised of \n     at least one representative from NOAA, the National Science \n     Foundation, NSF, the National Institutes of Health, NIH, CDC, \n     EPA, FDA, Department of Homeland Security, DHS, and other \n     agencies and department deemed appropriate by the NSTC. This \n     section also provides for the biennial selection of a \n     Chairman of the Committee, who shall represent an agency that \n     contributes substantially to the Interagency OHH Program.\n       10-Year Implementation Plan. Subsection b directs the NSTC, \n     through the Committee on the Oceans and Human Health, to \n     submit to Congress within one year of enactment a 10-year \n     implementation plan for coordinated federal activities under \n     the Interagency OHH Program. In developing the plan, the \n     Committee is required to consult with the Inter-Agency Task \n     Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia. The implementation \n     plan will complement the ongoing activities of NOAA, NSF, the \n     NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, \n     NIEHS, and other departments and agencies, and: 1. establish \n     the goals and priorities for Federal research related to \n     oceans and human health; 2. describe specific activities \n     required to achieve such goals; 3. identify relevant Federal \n     programs and activities that would contribute to the \n     Interagency OHH Program; 4. consider and use reports and \n     studies conducted by Federal agencies and departments, the \n     National Research Council, the Ocean Research Advisory Panel, \n     the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and other entities; 5. \n     make recommendations for the coordination of national and \n     international programs; and 6. estimate Federal funding for \n     research activities to be conducted under the Interagency OHH \n     Program.\n       Scope of Interagency Program.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the School \nService Act of 2003.\n  Across our Nation, as more and more people participate in national \nservice programs, young people, too, are making real contributions to \ntheir communities. These students are learning lessons that are more \nvaluable than any taught in the classroom, lessons about what it means \nto be a part of a community and what it means to be an American.\n  In my home State, schools and communities have seen the benefit of \nstudent service. High school kids have built community centers in run-\ndown neighborhoods. They've cleaned up polluted ponds. They've helped \nsmall children learn to read, and offered comfort to the elderly and \nsick.\n  And the students have learned that their efforts matter, a lesson \nthat they'll carry with then their whole lives. The research shows \nthis. In one study, adults who had completed service projects more than \n15 years earlier were still more likely to be volunteers and voters \nthan adults who hadn't. In another program, kids who served had a 60 \npercent lower drop-out rate and 18 percent lower rate of school \nsuspension than kids who didn't.\n  I applaud these students' dedication, as well as the dedication of \nthe teachers, parents and administrators who support them. But we \nshould do more than simply applaud these efforts--we\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\nshould provide the resources to support and expand them.\n  That is why I am introducing, together with Senator Gordon Smith and \nSenator Clinton, the School Service Act of 2003. The proposal is very \nsimple: We say to a limited number of States and cities, if you have \nschools that will make sure students engage in high-quality service \nbefore graduation, we will support those schools' efforts. All that we \nask is that you ensure that students are engaging in meaningful service \nwith real benefits to communities. We want kids seeing these \nexperiences not as another chore, but as an exciting initiation into \nlong lives of active citizenship.\n  Here in Congress, it is our responsibility to give opportunities for \nservice to our young people. We do not want to create a new national \nmandate, and we will not require any State or city to do anything. But \nfor those State and school districts with schools that are ready, we \nought to make sure every child has the opportunity and the \nresponsibility to engage in service. When we do, our country will be \nrichly rewarded in the years and decades to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, , Mr. Wyden, Mr. Smith, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Akaka, Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1220. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend reasonable cost contracts under the medicare program, to expand \nthe area in which plans offered under such contracts may operate, to \napply certain provisions of the Medicare+Choice program to such plans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, currently approximately 19,500 Colorado \nseniors are beneficiaries of Medicare health plans called ``cost \ncontracts.'' Under current law, cost contracts will expire. Along with \nSenator Wyden, Senator Smith, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, and \nSenator Coleman, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare Cost Contract \nExtension and Refinement Act of 2003 to refine and to allow seniors to \ncontinue using these valued health plans.\n  Medicare cost contracts are managed care plans that are reimbursed at \nthe cost of providing health benefits. Currently, seniors have three \nMedicare plans to choose from: basic Medicare fee-for-service, \nMedicare+Choice, and Medicare cost contracts.\n  Cost contract plans offer more benefits than basic Medicare and is \navailable in more areas than Medicare+Choice. Cost contracts also offer \nlower out-of-pocket expenses and more benefits than supplemental \nMedigap, such as preventive care and prescription drug benefits. In \naddition, cost contract premiums cover Medicare deductibles and \nadditional benefits not covered by basic Medicare. Further, for the \ncosts of a normal Medicare fee-for-service copayment, seniors with cost \ncontracts can use any Medicare provider whether they participate in the \nhealth plan's network.\n  Cost contracts are especially important in rural Colorado. Of the \n19,500 Coloradans with cost contract plans, about 90 percent live in \nrural Colorado, where few basic Medicare and Medicare+Choice providers \noperate. If Medicare cost contracts are eliminated, then thousands of \nseniors will be forced into these other Medicare programs.\n  Seniors with cost contracts value them. According to the 1999 \nMedicare Managed Care Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study, \nconducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Medicare \nbeneficiaries gave Medicare cost contract health insurers higher \nratings than non-cost contract providers. Beneficiaries noted cost \ncontracting HMOs solved problems, provided care, and provided customer \nservice better than the majority of non-cost contracting providers. \nThese ratings demonstrate that cost contract plans provide the quality \nservice seniors want and need.\n  Unfortunately, under current law cost contracts soon will terminate. \nIn 1997, in an effort to refine Medicare+Choice, Congress passed the \nBalanced Budget Act. Among other provisions, this bill terminated the \nMedicare cost contract program effective December 31, 2002. To prevent \nthe termination of this valuable plan, in 1999 I introduced legislation \nto extend cost contracts. That year Congress passed the Balanced Budget \nand Refinement Act, which extended cost contracts for two years through \n2004.\n  Congress should extend Medicare cost contracts further. Legislation I \nam introducing, the Cost Contracting Extension and Refinement Act, \nwould accomplish this by extending by ten years the cost contract \nsunset date of December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2014.\n\n  While the goal of Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was to \nprovide an alternative to basic Medicare through Medicare+Choice, \nMedicare+Choice has not yet met this goal in rural Colorado. Until \nMedicare+Choice coverage is readily available to rural cost contract \nrecipients, Congress should extend the current cost contract sunset for \nan additional 10 years.\n  This legislation would provide another reform. It would apply certain \nexisting requirements under the Medicare+Choice program to Medicare \ncost contract plans in order to allow better administration, education, \nand protections to patients, providers, and insurers. The legislation \nwould allow beneficiaries to be informed and educated about the option \nof cost contracts, apply quality assurance requirements, prevent plans \nfrom discriminating against certain patients by offering lower \npremiums, and prohibit States from taxing cost contract premiums. These \nprovisions help refine and strengthen the Medicare cost contract \nprogram, and they help streamline the dual administration of \nMedicare+Choice and cost contracts.\n  Last, the Medicare Cost Contract Extension and Refinement Act would \nallow certain health plans, called group model health plans, to offer \nMedicare patients a cost contract plan. These group model health plans \nhave traditionally been shown to provide care efficiently and at a cost \nlower than the costs that would be incurred if the services are \nfurnished under the Medicare fee-for-service program. Group health \nplans are health insurers that offer health care through providers that \nare employed by the insurer, such as the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan. \nIf, for example, Kaiser provides Medicare patients the cost contract \noption, then Colorado's approximate 50,000 seniors, who are now \nenrolled in Kaiser's Medicare+Choice plans, would be eligible to obtain \na cost contract plan.\n  Medicare beneficiaries deserve a choice in how they receive their \nhealth care. Congress should allow one of these choices to remain \nMedicare cost contracts. On behalf of the 19,500 Colorado Medicare \nbeneficiaries who obtain their health care from cost contract plans, I \nam pleased to sponsor the Medicare Cost Contract Extension Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the number of well-trained mental health \nservice professionals (including those based in schools) providing \nclinical mental health care to children and adolescents, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today because there is a crisis \nin our country that begs our attention. This crisis is the overwhelming \nlack of adequate mental health services available to the children and \nadolescents in our Nation and it is time that we address it. As I \nspeak, over 13,700,000 young people are suffering from diagnosable \npsychiatric disorders. Sadly, fewer than one-third of these have access \nto mental healthcare. Today I am introducing the ``Child Healthcare \nCrisis Relief Act'' along with Senators Collins, Jeffords, and Dodd in \nan effort to reduce the disparity between the need for mental health \nservices and resources available to meet that need.\n  The landmark report ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \nGeneral'' illuminated the crisis in 1999. 13,700,000 young people have \ndiagnosable mental disorders including 6-9,000,000 children and \nadolescents who meet the definition for having a serious emotional \ndisturbance and 5-9 percent of youth who meet the definition for having \nsevere functional impairment. Unfortunately, few of these young people \nhave access to adequate mental health services. The resulting lack of \ntreatment leads to a lifetime cycle of difficulties from unresolved \nmental health issues. These difficulties are often as severe as school \nfailure, substance abuse, job and relationship instability, and even \ncriminal behavior or suicide. In many cases, young people who do not \nreceive the mental health treatment that they need end up in foster \ncare or even in the juvenile justice system. In my state of New Mexico, \na 2002 report concluded that 1 in 7 incarcerated youth is currently in \na detention center solely because there is no appropriate treatment \noption available. These youth are actually cleared to leave as soon as \nthey have adequate treatment in place. In fact, from January 2001 to \nDecember of 2001 an estimated 718 New Mexico youth were collectively \nincarcerated for 31.3 years waiting for a treatment opening. Most other \nStates are facing similar situations. In fact, studies have found that \nnationally more than 1 in 3 youth in detention centers have a mental \nhealth disorder. Clearly, this is an issue that demands our immediate \nattention.\n  One of the key barriers to treatment is the shortage of available \nspecialists trained in the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of \nchildren and adolescents with emotional and behavioral disorders. The \n1999 Surgeon General's Report stated, ``there is a dearth of child \npsychiatrists, appropriately trained clinical child psychologists, and \nsocial workers.'' There are particularly acute shortages in the number \nof mental health service professionals serving children and adolescents \nwith serious emotional disorders as well as those serving rural areas. \nNationwide, 4,358 urban, suburban, and rural localities have been \ndesignated mental health Professional Shortage Areas by the Federal \nGovernment. The President's New Freedom Commission has recognized the \nshortage and has made a recommendation to develop a strategic plan to \naddress it. The Council on Graduate Medical Education and the State \nMental Health Commissioners have also recognized this shortage of \nmental health professionals.\n\n  The Child Healthcare Crisis Relief Act will help remove one of the \nkey barriers to treatment for children and adolescents with mental \nillnesses: the lack of available specialists trained in this field. \nThis bill creates incentives to help recruit and retain child mental \nhealth professionals providing direct clinical care and to improve, \nexpand, or help create programs to train child mental health \nprofessionals through several mechanisms. The bill provides loan \nrepayment and scholarships for child mental health and school-based \nservice professionals to help pay back educational loans. It provides \ngrants to graduate schools to provide for internships and field \nplacements in child mental health services. It provides grants to help \nwith the preservice and inservice training of paraprofessionals who \nwork in the children's mental health clinical settings. It also \nprovides grants to graduate schools to help develop and expand child \nand adolescent mental health programs. Finally, the bill allows for an \nincrease in the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists permitted \nunder the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Program, extends the \nBoard Eligibility period for residents and fellows from 4 years to 6 \nyears, and instructs the secretary to prepare a report on the \ndistribution and need for child mental health and school-based \nprofessionals.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me along with Senators \nCollins, Jeffords, and Dodd in supporting this essential legislation. \nOver 13 million children in our country are counting on us.\n  As Walt Disney once said, ``Our Nation's greatest national resource \nis the minds of our children.'' Let us not fail these 13 million \npeople.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the powers of the Attorney General to \nregulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of firearms and \nammunition, and to expand the jurisdiction of the Attorney General to \ninclude firearm products and nonpowder firearms; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Firearms \nSafety and Consumer Protection Act of 2003, legislation to protect gun \nowners and the public by establishing safety standards for firearms \nsuch as those currently in place for other consumer products.\n  Because of a loophole in current law, firearms are virtually the only \nconsumer product not subject to any Federal health and safety \nstandards. Yet firearms are the second leading cause of product-related \ndeath in America. In 2000 alone, 28,663 Americans died by gunfire and \nnearly twice that number were treated in emergency rooms for non-fatal \ngunshot injuries.\n  Of course, all firearms are lethal. But many guns are much more \ndangerous than they have to be. First, many firearms are manufactured \npoorly or with components of inadequate quality. These guns can pose a \nsevere threat to gun owners, as well as members of the public. For \nexample, one firearm manufacturer settled a class action suit for more \nthan $31 million in 1995, and thereafter improved the quality of their \nguns, after gun owners alleged that their firearms were produced from \nsteel that was too weak, and thus prone to explode.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of safety standards in current law means that \nmany defective firearms remain in circulation, with the government \nlargely unable to do anything about it. We cannot recall such firearms. \nWe cannot require that warning labels be attached to them. We can do \nvery little to protect gun owners and the public from the threat they \npose.\n  Beyond the need to better regulate firearms that are manufactured \ndefectively, we also need to do more to ensure that firearms are \ndesigned properly, with features that reduce unreasonable risks. \nUnfortunately, too many firearms lack readily available features that \ncould make them much less likely to be involved in an accident. For \nexample, many guns lack so-called magazine disconnects, which disable a \nfirearm when its magazine is removed. This feature could prevent many \naccidental deaths caused when a firearm user, seeing that the magazine \nhas been removed, wrongly concludes that a gun is not loaded. Along the \nsame lines, too few firearms include a load indicator, which allows an \nindividual to readily see whether the gun is loaded. Both of these \nfeatures would address the most common scenario for unintentional \nshootings, which involves a person who does not realize that there is \nstill a round in a gun's chamber.\n  By regulating the manufacture and design of firearms, we can \nsignificantly reduce the number of accidental shootings, and the \nserious injuries and deaths they cause. However, better safety \nregulation also holds the promise of reducing the number of deaths from \nhomicides and suicides.\n  In recent years, firearm manufacturers have taken a number of steps \nto make firearms more likely to be used in crimes, and more deadly if \nthey are. For example, many guns are being produced in a manner that \nmakes them readily concealable, and thus more attractive to criminals. \nIn addition, many manufacturers have increased the number of rounds \nthat a gun can fire without reloading, and have increased the size of \ntheir ammunition, making the firearms far more lethal.\n  Given the threat posed by unreasonably dangerous firearms to gun \nowners and the general public, there is no excuse for exempting \nfirearms from health and safety standards applicable to most other \nconsumer products. In fact, there is evidence that the public would \nsupport such regulation. A 1999 National Opinion Research Center survey \nfound that two-thirds of Americans want the Federal Government to \nregulate the safety design of guns.\n  The Firearms Safety and Consumer Protection Act would do just that. \nThe bill would give the Department of Justice the authority to: set \nminimum safety standards for the manufacture, design and distribution \nof firearms; issue recalls and warnings; collect data on gun-related \ndeath and injury; and limit the sale of products when no other remedy \nis sufficient. It is important to emphasize that the bill would not \nlimit the public's access to guns for hunting and other legitimate \nsporting purposes.\n  More than 120 national, state and local organizations support this \nbill, including: the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Bar \nAssociation, American Jewish Congress, American Public Health \nAssociation, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Coalition to Stop \nGun Violence, Consumer Federation of America, the NAACP, National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence, United Church of Christ Justice \nand Witness Ministries, and the Violence Policy Center.\n  There simply is no reason to maintain the existing loophole that \nexempts firearms from basic health and safety protections. This \nloophole is creating a serious public safety problem, especially for \ngun owners themselves.\n  In conclusion, I hope my colleagues will consider this: under current \nlaw, the safety of toy guns is regulated. The safety of real guns is \nnot. Even if my colleagues in the Senate cannot agree on much else when \nit comes to guns, surely we should all agree that this makes no sense.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to coordinate efforts in collecting and analyzing \ndata on the incidence and prevalence of developmental disabilities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a rising \nepidemic that is preventing a growing number of children in our Nation \nfrom learning and contributing fully as members of our society.\n  Twelve million children under the age of eighteen now suffer from a \ndevelopmental, learning or behavioral disability. Since 1977, \nenrollment in special education programs for children with learning \ndisabilities has doubled. In New York, there are 206,000 learning \ndisabled children--this is fifty percent of the special education \npopulation in New York.\n  While we know that developmental disabilities are affecting more \nchildren and costing us more money, we still know relatively little \nabout the causes of developmental disabilities. A National Academy of \nSciences study suggests that genetic factors explain only ten to twenty \npercent of developmental disabilities. Considerable research suggests \nthat toxic chemicals such as mercury, pesticides, and dioxin contribute \nto these problems, but proving the exact role of environmental factors \nin these problems will take time and significant research dollars.\n  We can simply not stand back and watch our children suffer from this \nincreasing epidemic. That is why I have worked hard to develop the 2003 \nAct to Prevent Developmental Disabilities in Education, which I am \nproud to introduce today with my colleague, Senator Collins. It would \nhelp us lower the costs of developmental disabilities by identifying \nthe preventable, non-genetic causes that are affecting so many children \nin our nation.\n  Our legislation would require the Department of Education to \ncoordinate with the CDC to improve data collection on environmental \nhazards that cause disabilities. At this time, the Department of \nEducation collects information on the prevalence of disabilities among \nchildren in schools and the CDC collects information on environmental \ntoxins, but the two data systems are not coordinated. If they were, \npolicymakers and researchers could better identify where environmental \nhazards may be causing developmental disabilities and target resources \nto these areas for abatement. A National Academy of Sciences study \nsuggests that 28 percent of developmental disabilities are due to \nenvironmental causes, and a recent study in the New England Journal of \nMedicine demonstrated that exposure to low levels of lead can result in \na drop of 7.4 IQ points, which can turn a healthy child into one with a \ndevelopmental disability.\n  I am working to incorporate this legislation into the reauthorization \nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act because I believe so \nstrongly that our children and families, indeed our entire society, \nbenefits when we prevent developmental diseases rather than treating \nthem after they occur.\n  And thank you to my friend Senator Collins for her hard work and \ncommitment to this important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``2003 Act to Prevent \n     Developmental Disabilities in Education''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Seventeen percent of children in the United States \n     under 18 years of age have a developmental disability.\n       (2) Since 1977, enrollment in special education programs \n     for children with learning disabilities has doubled.\n       (3) Federal and State education departments spend about \n     $43,000,000,000 each year on special education programs for \n     individuals with developmental disabilities who are between 3 \n     and 21 years of age.\n       (4) Research suggests that genetic factors explain only 10 \n     to 20 percent of developmental diseases, and a National \n     Academy of Sciences study suggests that at least 28 percent \n     of developmental disabilities are due to environmental \n     causes.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure a \n     collaborative tracking effort between the Department of \n     Education and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     for developmental disabilities and potential environmental \n     links.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TRACKING ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall coordinate \n     efforts with the Director of the National Center for Birth \n     Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Director'') in collecting and analyzing data on the \n     incidence and prevalence of developmental disabilities to \n     determine localities with a high incidence of developmental \n     disabilities and study possible causes of the increased \n     incidence of these diseases, disorders, and conditions.\n       (b) Existing Surveillance Systems, Registries, and \n     Surveys.--To the maximum extent practicable in implementing \n     the activities under this section, the Secretary and the \n     Director shall develop methods for reconciling data collected \n     in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) on the prevalence of \n     developmental disabilities with existing surveillance and \n     data collection systems, registries, and surveys that are \n     administered by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, including--\n       (1) State birth defects surveillance systems as supported \n     under section 317C of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 247b-4); and\n       (2) environmental public health tracking program grants \n     authorized under section 301 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 241).\n       (c) Privacy.--In pursuing activities under this section, \n     the Secretary and the Director shall ensure the protection of \n     individual health privacy consistent with regulations \n     promulgated in accordance with section 264(c) of the Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1320d-2 note), the Family Educational Right to Privacy \n     Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g), and State and local privacy \n     regulations, as applicable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORIUM (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1227. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of substitute adult day services under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Mrs. Lincoln \nof Arkansas to reintroduce bipartisan legislation aimed at improving \nlong-term care health and rehabilitation options for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and also assisting family caregivers.\n  We all recognize that our Nation needs to address sooner rather than \nlater the challenges of financing long-term care services for our \ngrowing aging population. The Congressional Budget Office has projected \nthat national expenditures for long-term care services for the elderly \nwill increase each year through 2040. But it is in just over a decade \nwhen we will see these challenges become even more pronounced, when the \n76 million baby boomers begin to turn 65. Baby boomers are expected to \nlive longer and greater numbers will reach 85 and older.\n  Congress' attention in this area is critical, given the expected \ngrowing costs of long-term care services, and the fact that so many \nAmerican families are already serving as caregivers for aging or ailing \nseniors and providing a large portion of long-term care services. It is \nmore important than ever that we have in place quality options in how \nto best care for our senior population about to dramatically increase.\n  This is why we are introducing the Medicare Adult Day Services \nAlternative Act. This legislation would offer home health beneficiaries \nmore options for receiving care in a setting of their own choosing, \nrather than confining the provision of those benefits solely to the \nhome.\n  This legislation would give beneficiaries the option to receive some \nor all of their Medicare home health services in an adult day setting. \nThis would be a substitution, not an expansion, of services. The bill \nwould not make new people eligible for Medicare home health benefits or \nexpand the list of services paid for. In fact, this legislation may be \ndesigned to produce net savings for the Medicare program.\n  Permitting homebound patients to receive their home health care in a \nclinically-based senior day center, as an alternative to receiving it \nat home, could result in significant benefits to\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\nthe Medicare program, such as reduced cost-per-episode, reduced numbers \nof episodes, as well as mental and physical stimulation for patients.\n  Moreover, the Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act could well \nhave a positive impact on our economy, as it would enable caregivers to \nattend to other facets in today's fast-paced family life, such as \nworking a full- or part-time job and caring for children, knowing their \nloved ones are well cared for. It is unfortunate that today many \ncaregivers have to choose between working or caring for a family \nmember. It is estimated that the average loss of income to these \ncaregivers is more than $600,000 in wages, pension, and Social Security \nbenefits. And by extension, the loss in productivity in United States \nbusinesses is pegged at more than $10 billion annually.\n  But it does not have to be an either-or proposition. The Medicare \nAdult Day Services Alternative Act is a creative solution to health \ncare delivery, which would adequately reimburse providers in a fiscally \nresponsible way. Located in every state in the United States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, adult day centers generally offer transportation, \nmeals, personal care, and counseling in addition to the medical \nservices and socialization benefits offered.\n  We can and should offer both our Medicare beneficiaries and family \ncaregivers more and better options for health care delivery, and that \nis exactly what the Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act is \ndesigned to do. This legislation is bipartisan, and has been supported \nby more than 20 national non-profit organizations concerned with the \nwell-being of America's older population and committed to representing \ntheir interests.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in this cause. I again thank \nSenator Lincoln for working with me in this effort, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1227\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Adult Day Services \n     Alternative Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) adult day services offers services, including medical \n     care, rehabilitation therapies, dignified assistance with \n     activities of daily living, social interaction, and \n     stimulating activities, to seniors who are frail, physically \n     challenged, or cognitively impaired;\n       (2) access to adult day services provides seniors and their \n     familial caregivers support that is critical to keeping the \n     senior in the family home;\n       (3) more than 22,000,000 families in the United States \n     serve as caregivers for aging or ailing seniors, nearly 1 in \n     4 American families, providing close to 80 percent of the \n     care to individuals requiring long-term care;\n       (4) nearly 75 percent of those actively providing such care \n     are women who also maintain other responsibilities, such as \n     working outside of the home and raising young children;\n       (5) the average loss of income to these caregivers has been \n     shown to be $659,130 in wages, pension, and Social Security \n     benefits;\n       (6) the loss in productivity in United States businesses \n     ranges from $11,000,000,000 to $29,000,000,000 annually;\n       (7) the services offered in adult day services facilities \n     provide continuity of care and an important sense of \n     community for both the senior and the caregiver;\n       (8) there are adult day services facilities in every State \n     in the United States and the District of Columbia;\n       (9) these centers generally offer transportation, meals, \n     personal care, and counseling in addition to the medical \n     services and socialization benefits offered; and\n       (10) with the need for quality options in how to best care \n     for our senior population about to dramatically increase with \n     the aging of the baby boomer generation, the time to address \n     these issues is now.\n\n     SEC. 3.

\nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a persistent, \nserious, and entirely preventable threat to our children's \nintelligence, behavior, and learning.\n  Lead poisoning affects 300,000 children in our Nation between the \nages of one and five, and has been linked with developmental \ndisabilities, behavioral problems, and anemia. One recent study from \nthe New England Journal of Medicine also found that children suffered \nup to a 7.4 percent decrease in IQ at lead levels that CDC considers \nsafe. At very high levels, lead poisoning can cause seizures, coma, and \neven death.\n  In New York State in 1999, over twelve thousand children suffered \nfrom lead poisoning, 9,533 of those children in New York City alone. In \nfact, we may even be underestimating the significance of this important \npublic health problem.\n  I am glad that the Secretary of Health and Human Services considers \nlead poisoning to be a priority, and established a national goal of \nending childhood lead poisoning by 2010. However, federal programs only \nhave resources to remove lead-based paint hazards from less than 0.1 \npercent of the twenty-five million housing units that have these \nhazards. At this pace, we will not be able to end childhood lead \npoisoning by 3010, let alone 2010.\n  We will never stop childhood lead poisoning unless we get lead out of \nthe buildings in which children live, work, and play. In Brooklyn, more \nthan a third of the buildings in one community have a lead-based paint \nhazard. Parents of children with lead poisoning are being told that \nnothing can be done until their children's lead poisoning becomes \nworse. How can we ask children to watch and wait while their sons and \ndaughters suffer from lead poisoning before we remove the lead from \ntheir homes?\n  That is why today, I am proud to introduce the Home Lead Safety Tax \nCredit Act of 2003 with my colleague, Senator Mike DeWine. This \nlegislation would provide a tax credit to aide and encourage homeowners \nin removing lead-based paint hazards in their homes. Specifically, it \nwould provide a tax credit for owners of residential properties built \nbefore 1978 that pay for abatement performed by a certified lead \nabatement contractor. Owners would receive a maximum tax credit of 50 \npercent of the cost of the abatement, not to exceed $1,500 per dwelling \nunit. In Massachusetts, a similar tax credit helped reduce the number \nof new cases of childhood lead poisoning by almost two-thirds in a \ndecade.\n\n  The Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2003 would help homeowners \nmake approximately 85,000 homes each year safe from lead, which is more \nthan ten times the number of homes made lead safe by current Federal \nprograms. It would greatly accelerate our progress in ridding our \nnation of the significant problem of childhood lead poisoning. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, which will help \nus achieve our common goal of protecting children from threats in our \nenvironment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home Lead \n     Safety Tax Credit Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Of the 98,000,000 housing units in the United States, \n     38,000,000 have lead-based paint.\n       (2) Of the 38,000,000 housing units with lead-based paint, \n     25,000,000 pose a hazard, as defined by Environmental \n     Protection Agency and Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development standards, due to conditions such as peeling \n     paint and settled dust on floors and windowsills that contain \n     lead at levels above Federal safety standards.\n       (3) Though the number of children in the United States ages \n     1 through 5 with blood levels higher than the Centers for \n     Disease Control action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter \n     has declined to 300,000, lead poisoning remains a serious, \n     entirely preventable threat to a child's intelligence, \n     behavior, and learning.\n       (4) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     established a national goal of ending childhood lead \n     poisoning by 2010.\n       (5) Current Federal lead abatement programs, such as the \n     Lead Hazard Control Grant Program of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, only have resources sufficient \n     to make approximately 7,000 homes lead-safe each year. In \n     many cases, when State and local public health departments \n     identify a lead-poisoned child, resources are insufficient to \n     reduce or eliminate the hazards.\n       (6) Approximately 15 percent of children are lead-poisoned \n     by home renovation projects performed by remodelers who fail \n     to follow basic safeguards to control lead dust.\n       (7) Old windows typically pose significant risks because \n     wood trim is more likely to be painted with lead-based paint, \n     moisture causes paint to deteriorate, and friction generates \n     lead dust. The replacement of old windows that contain lead \n     based paint significantly reduces lead poisoning hazards in \n     addition to producing significant energy savings.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage \n     the safe removal of lead hazards from homes and thereby \n     decrease the number of children who suffer reduced \n     intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and \n     other health consequences due to lead-poisoning.\n\n     SEC. 2. LEAD ABATEMENT TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 (relating to foreign tax credit, etc.) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 30B.

A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, \nto clarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in nondisclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the \nSpecial Counsel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. Today I rise to introduce the Federal \nEmployee Protection of Disclosures Act with Senators Levin, Leahy, \nDurbin, and Dayton to amend the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA. \nThese amendments are necessary to protect Federal employees from \nretaliation and protect the American people from government waste, \nfraud, and abuse. The Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act \nbuilds on the foundation laid in the 107th Congress with S. 995 and S. \n3070, the latter of which was favorably reported by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee last year. The bill also incorporates recommendations \nreceived during a hearing I chaired on similar legislation in 2001.\n  Last year, Time magazine honored Sherron Watkins, Colleen Rowley, and \nCynthia Cooper as its ``persons of the year.'' These brave women are \nwhistleblowers--Colleen Rowley is the Minneapolis FBI agent who penned \nthe memo on the FBI headquarter's handling of the Zacarias Mousssoui \ncase. In 2002, Ms. Rowley and the two other women went public with \ndisclosures of mismanagement and wrongdoing within their workplaces. \nThey captured the nation's attention and earned our respect in their \nroles as whistleblowers. Congress encourages Federal employees like Ms. \nRowley to come forward with information of threats to public safety and \nhealth through the WPA, which has been amended twice in order to shore \nup congressional intent.\n  Once again, Congress must act to guarantee protections from \nretaliation for Federal whistleblowers. First and foremost, our bill \nwould codify the repeated and unequivocal statements of congressional \nintent that Federal employees are to be protected when making ``any \ndisclosure'' evidencing violations of law, gross mismanagement, or a \ngross waste of funds. The bill would also clarify the test that must be \nmet to prove that a Federal employee reasonably believed that his or \nher disclosure was evidence of wrongdoing. Despite the clear language \nof the WPA that an employee is protected from disclosing information he \nor she reasonably believes evidences a violation, the Federal Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, which has sole jurisdiction over whistleblower cases, \nruled in 1999 that the reasonableness review must begin with the \npresumption that public officers perform their duties in good faith and \nthat this presumption stands unless there is ``irrefragable proof'' to \nthe contrary. By definition, irrefragable means impossible to refute. \nTo address this unreasonable burden placed on whistleblowers, our bill \nwould replace the ``irrefragable proof'' standard with ``substantial \nevidence.''\n  The bill would provide some method of relief for those whistleblowers \nwho face retaliation by having their security clearance removed. \nAccording to former Special Counsel Elaine Kaplan, removal of a \nsecurity clearance in this manner is a way of camouflaging retaliation. \nTo address this issue, the bill would make it a prohibited personnel \npractice for a manager to suspend, revoke or take other action with \nrespect to an employee's security clearance in retaliation for \nwhistleblowing and allow the Merit Systems Protection Board, MSPB, to \nreview the action. Under an expedited review process, the MSPB may \nissue declaratory and other appropriate relief, but may not direct the \nPresident to restore a security clearance. MSPB and subsequent \nCongressional review of the agency's action provides sound oversight \nfor this process without encroaching upon the President's authority in \nthe national security arena.\n  The measure would also provide independent litigating authority to \nthe Office of Special Counsel, OSC. Under current law, OSC has no \nauthority to request MSPB to reconsider its decision or to seek review \nof a MSPB decision by the Federal Circuit. The limitation undermines \nboth OSC's ability to protect whistleblowers and the integrity of the \nWPA. As such, our bill would provide OSC authority to appear in any \ncivil action brought in connection with the WPA and obtain review of \nany MSPB order where OSC determines MSPB erred and the case will impact \nthe enforcement of the WPA. The bill would also help protect the \nintegrity of the Act by removing sole jurisdiction of such cases from \nthe Federal Circuit and provide for review of whistleblower cases in \nthe same manner that is afforded in Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission cases. This review system is designed to address holdings by \nthe Federal Circuit which have repeatedly ignored congressional intent.\n  Enactment of the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act will \nstrengthen the rights and protections afforded to Federal \nwhistleblowers and encourage the disclosure of information vital to an \neffective government. Congress should act quickly to assure \nwhistleblowers that disclosing illegal activities within their agencies \nwill not be met with retaliation. I urge my colleagues to join with me \nin protecting the dedicated Federal employees who come forward to \ndisclose wrongdoing to help the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\n                                S. 1229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Akaka, Leahy, \nDurbin and Dayton today in introducing the Federal Employees Protection \nof Disclosures Act. Our bill strengthens the law protecting employees \nwho blow the whistle on fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal programs.\n  Whistleblowers play a crucial role in ensuring that Congress and the \npublic are aware of serious cases of waste,\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\nfraud, and mismanagement in government. Whistleblowing is never more \nimportant than when our national security is at stake. Since the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, courageous individuals have \nstepped forward to blow the whistle on significant lapses in our \nefforts to protect the United States against potential future attacks. \nMost notably, FBI Agent Coleen Rowley alerted Congress to serious \ninstitutional problems at the FBI and their impact on the agency's \nability to effectively investigate and prevent terrorism.\n  In another example, two Border Patrol agents from my State of \nMichigan, Mark Hall and Bob Lindemann, risked their careers when they \nblew the whistle on Border Patrol and INS policies that were \ncompromising security on the Northern Border. Their disclosure led to \nmy holding a hearing at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in \nNovember 2001, that exposed serious deficiencies in the way Border \nPatrol and INS were dealing with aliens who were arrested while trying \nto enter the country illegally. Since the hearing, some of the most \ntroublesome policies have been changed, improving the security \nsituation and validating the two agents' concerns. Despite the fact \nthat their concerns proved to be dead on, shortly after they blew the \nwhistle, disciplinary action was proposed against the two agents. \nFortunately in this case, whistleblower protections worked. The Office \nof Special Counsel conducted an investigation and the decision to \ndiscipline the agents was reversed. However, that disciplinary action \nwas proposed in the first place is a troubling reminder of how \nimportant it is for us to both strengthen protections for \nwhistleblowers and empower the Office of Special Counsel to discipline \nmanagers who seek to muzzle employees.\n  Agent Rowley, Mark Hall and Bob Lindemann are simply the latest in a \nlong line of Federal employees who have taken great personal risks in \nblowing the whistle on government waste, fraud, and mismanagement. \nCongress has long recognized the obligation we have to protect a \nFederal employee when he or she discloses evidence of wrongdoing in a \nfederal program. If an employee reasonably believes that a fraud or \nmismanagement is occurring, and that employee has the courage and the \nsense of responsibility to make that fraud or mismanagement known, it \nis our duty to protect the employee from any reprisal. We want federal \nemployees to identify problems so we can fix them, and if they fear \nreprisal for doing so, then we are not only failing to protect the \nwhistleblower, but we are also failing to protect the taxpayer.\n  I sponsored the Whistleblower Protection Act in 1989 which \nstrengthened and clarified whistleblower rights, as well as the bill \npassed by Congress to strengthen the law further in 1994. \nUnfortunately, however, repeated holdings by the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit have corrupted the intent of Congress, \nwith the result that additional clarifying language is sorely needed. \nThe case of LaChance versus White represents perhaps the most notable \nexample of the Federal Circuit's misinterpretation of the whistleblower \nlaw.\n  In LaChance, decided on May 14, 1999, the court imposed an unfounded \nand virtually unattainable standard on Federal employee whistleblowers \nin proving their cases. In that case, John E. White was an education \nspecialist for the Air Force who spoke out against a new educational \nsystem that purported to mandate quality standards for schools \ncontracting with the Air Force bases. White criticized the new system \nas counterproductive because it was too burdensome and seriously \nreduced the education opportunities available on base. After making \nthese criticisms, local agency officials reassigned White, relieving \nhim of his duties and allegedly isolating him. However, after an \nindependent management review supported White's concerns, the Air Force \ncanceled the program White had criticized. White appealed the \nreassignment in 1992 and the case has been in litigation ever since.\n  The administrative judge initially dismissed White's case, finding \nthat his disclosures were not protected by the Whistleblower Protection \nAct. The MSPB, however, reversed the administrative judge's decision \nand remanded the case back to the administrative judge, holding that \nsince White disclosed information he reasonably believed evidenced \ngross mismanagement, this disclosure was protected under the Act. On \nremand, the administrative judge found that the Air Force had violated \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act and ordered the Air Force to return \nWhite to his prior status; the MSPB affirmed the decision of the \nadministrative judge. OPM petitioned the Federal Circuit for a review \nof the board's decision. The Federal Circuit subsequently reversed the \nMSPB's decision, holding that there was not adequate evidence to \nsupport a violation under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Federal \nCircuit held that the evidence that White was a specialist on the \nsubject at issue and aware of the alleged improper activities and that \nhis belief was shared by other employees was not sufficient to meet the \n``reasonable belief'' test in the law. The court held that ``the board \nmust look for evidence that it was reasonable to believe that the \ndisclosures revealed misbehavior'' by the Air Force. The court went on \nto say: ``In this case, review of the Air Force's policy and \nimplementation via the QES standards might well show them to be \nentirely appropriate, even if not the best option. Indeed, this review \nwould start out with a presumption that public officers perform their \nduties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law \nand governing regulations. . . . And this presumption stands unless \nthere is ``irrefragable proof to the contrary'.''\n  It was appropriate for the Federal Circuit to remand the case to the \nMSPB to have it reconsider whether it was reasonable for White to \nbelieve that what the Air Force did in this case involved gross \nmismanagement. However, the Federal Circuit went on to impose a clearly \nerroneous and excessive standard for him to demonstrate his \n``reasonable belief''--requiring him to provide ``irrefragable'' proof \nthat the Air Force had engaged in gross mismanagement.\n  Irrefragable means ``undeniable, incontestable, incontrovertible, \nincapable of being overthrown.'' How can a Federal employee meet a \nstandard of ``irrefragable'' in proving gross mismanagement? It is a \nvirtually impossible standard of proof to meet. Moreover, there is \nnothing in the law or legislative history that even suggests such a \nstandard applies to the Whistleblower Protection Act. The intent of the \nlaw is not for a Federal employee to act as an investigator and compile \n``irrefragable'' proof that the Federal Government, in fact, committed \nfraud, waste or abuse. Rather, under the clear language of the statute, \nthe employee needs only to have ``a reasonable belief'' that there is \nfraud, waste or abuse occurring in order to make a protected \ndisclosure.\n  LaChance is only one example of the Federal Circuit misinterpreting \nthe law. Our bill corrects LaChance and as well as several other \nFederal Circuit holdings. In addition, the bill strengthens the Office \nof Special Counsel and creates additional protections for federal \nemployees who are retaliated against for blowing the whistle.\n  One of the most important issues addressed in the bill is to clarify \nagain that the law is intended to protect a broad range of \nwhistleblower disclosures. The legislative history supporting the 1994 \nWhistleblower Protection Act amendments emphasized: ``[I]t also is not \npossible to further clarify the clear language in section 2302(b)(8) \nthat protection for ``any'' whistleblowing disclosure truly means \n``any.'' A protected disclosure may be made as part of an employee's \njob duties, may concern policy or individual misconduct, and may be \noral or written and to any audience inside or outside the agency, \nwithout restriction to time, place, motive or content.''\n  Despite this clear Congressional intent that was clearly articulated \nin 1994, the Federal Circuit has acted to push a number of \nwhistleblower disclosures outside the protections of the whistleblower \nlaw. For example, in Horton versus the Department of the Navy, the \nFederal Circuit ruled that a whistleblower's disclosures to co-workers, \nor to the wrong-doer, or to a supervisor were not protected by the WPA. \nIn Willis versus the Department of Agriculture, the court ruled that a \nwhistleblower's disclosures to officials in\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\nthe agency chain of command or those made in the course of normal job \nduties were not protected. In Huffman versus Office of Personnel \nManagement, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed Horton and Willis. And in \nMeuwissen versus Department of Interior, the Federal Circuit held that \na whistleblower's disclosures of previously known information do not \nqualify as ``disclosures'' under the WPA. All of these rulings violate \nclear Congressional intent to afford broad protection to whistleblower \ndisclosures.\n  In order to make it clear that any lawful disclosure that an employee \nor job applicant reasonably believes is evidence of waste, fraud, \nabuse, or gross mismanagement is covered by the WPA, the bill codifies \nprevious statements of Congressional intent. Using the 1994 legislative \nhistory, it amends the whistleblower statute to cover any disclosure of \ninformation without restriction to time, place, form, motive or \ncontext, or prior disclosure made to any person by an employee or \napplicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary course of an \nemployee's duties that the employee or applicant reasonably believes is \ncredible evidence of any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or \nother misconduct specified in the whistleblower law. I want to \nemphasize here that, other than the explicitly listed exceptions \nidentified in the statute, we intend for there to be no exceptions, \ninferred or otherwise, as to what is a protected disclosure. And the \nprohibition on inferred exceptions is intended to apply to all \nprotected speech categories in section 2302(b)(8) of the law. The \nintent here, again, is to make it clear that when the WPA speaks of \nprotecting disclosures by federal employees ``any'' means ``any.''\n  The bill also addresses the clearly erroneous standard established by \nthe Federal Circuit's LaChance decision I mentioned earlier. Rather \nthan needing ``irrefragable proof'' to overcome the presumption that a \npublic officer performed his or her duties correctly, fairly, in good \nfaith, and in accordance with the law and regulations, the bill makes \nit clear that the whistleblower can rebut this presumption with \n``substantial evidence.'' This burden of proof is a far more reasonable \nand appropriate standard for whistleblowing cases.\n  In the 1994 WPA amendments, Congress attempted to expand relief for \nwhistleblowers by replacing ``compensatory'' damages with all direct or \nindirect ``consequential'' damages. Again, despite clear Congressional \nintent, the Federal Circuit has narrowed the scope of relief available \nto whistleblowers who have been hurt by adverse personnel actions. Our \nlegislation would clarify the law to provide whistleblowers with relief \nfor ``compensatory or consequential damages.''\n  The Federal Circuit's repeated misinterpretations of the \nwhistleblower law are unacceptable and demand Congressional action. In \nresponse to the court's inexplicable and inappropriate rulings, our \nbill would suspend for five years the Federal Circuit's exclusive \njurisdiction over whistleblower appeals. It would instead allow a \nwhistleblower to file a petition to review a final order or final \ndecision of the MSPB in the Federal Circuit or in any other United \nStates appellate court of competent jurisdiction as defined under 5 \nU.S.C. 7703(b)(2). In most cases, using another court would mean going \nto the federal circuit where the contested personnel action took place. \nThis five year period would allow Congress to evaluate whether other \nappellate courts would issue whistleblower decisions which are \nconsistent with the Federal Circuit's interpretation of WPA protections \nand guide Congressional efforts to clarify the law if necessary.\n  In addition to addressing jurisdictional issues and troublesome \nFederal Circuit precedents, our bill would also make important \nadditions to the list of protected disclosures. First, it would subject \ncertain disclosures of classified information to whistleblower \nprotections. However, in order for a disclosure of classified \ninformation to be protected, the employee would have to possess a \nreasonable belief that the disclosure was direct and specific evidence \nof a violation of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross \nwaste of funds, an abuse of authority, a substantial and specific \ndanger to public health or safety, or a false statement to Congress on \nan issue of material fact. A whistleblower must also limit the \ndisclosure to a member of Congress or staff of the executive or \nlegislative branch holding the appropriate security clearance and \nauthorized to receive the information disclosed. Federal agencies \ncovered by the WPA would be required to establish a process to provide \nconfidential advice to employees on how to lawfully make a protected \ndisclosure of classified information to Congress.\n  Current law permits Federal employees to file a case at the MSPB when \nthey feel that a manager has taken a personnel action against them in \nretaliation for blowing the whistle. The legislation would add three \nnew personnel actions to the list of adverse actions that cannot be \ntaken against whistleblowers for engaging in protected activity. These \nactions would include enforcement of any nondisclosure policy, form or \nagreement against a whistleblower for making a protected disclosure; \nthe suspension, revocation, or other determination relating to a \nwhistleblower's security clearance; and an investigation of an employee \nor applicant for employment if taken due to their participation in \nwhistleblowing activity.\n  It is important to note that, if it is demonstrated that a security \nclearance was suspended or revoked in retaliation for whistleblowing, \nthe legislation limits the relief that the MSPB and reviewing court can \norder. The bill specifies that the MSPB or reviewing court may issue \ndeclaratory and other appropriate relief but may not direct a security \nclearance to be restored. Appropriate relief may include back pay, an \norder to reassign the employee, attorney fees, or any other relief the \nBoard or court is authorized to provide for other prohibited personnel \npractices. In addition, if the Board finds an action on a security \nclearance to have been illegal, it may bar the agency from directly or \nindirectly taking any other personnel action based on that illegal \nsecurity clearance action. Our legislation would also require the \nagency to review and provide a report to Congress detailing the \ncircumstances of the agency's security clearance decision, and \nauthorizes expedited MSPB review of whistleblower cases where a \nsecurity clearance was revoked or suspended. The latter is important \nbecause a person whose clearance has been suspended or revoked and \nwhose job responsibilities require clearance may be unable to work \nwhile their case is being considered.\n  Our bill would also add two prohibited personnel practices to the \nwhistleblower law. First, it would codify the ``anti-gag'' provision \nthat has been in force since 1988, by virtue of its inclusion in \nappropriations bills. Second, it would prohibit a manager from \ninitiating an investigation of an employee or applicant for employment \nbecause they engaged in a protected activity, including whistleblowing.\n  Another issue addressed in the bill involves certain employees who \nare excluded from the WPA. Among these are employees who hold \n``confidential policy-making positions.'' In 1994, Congress amended the \nWPA to keep agencies from designating employees confidential \npolicymakers after the employees filed whistleblower complaints. The \nWPA also allows the President to exclude from WPA jurisdiction any \nagency whose principal function is the conduct of foreign intelligence \nor counterintelligence activities. Our legislation maintains this \nauthority but makes it clear that a decision to exclude an agency from \nWPA protections must also be made prior to a personnel action being \ntaken against a whistleblower from that agency. This provision is \nnecessary to ensure that agencies cannot argue that employees are \nexempt from whistleblower protections after an employee files a claim \nthat they were retaliated against.\n  Another key section of the bill would strengthen the Office of \nSpecial Counsel. OSC is the independent federal agency responsible for \ninvestigating and prosecuting federal employee complaints of \nwhistleblower retaliation. Current law, however, limits OSC's ability \nto effectively enforce and defend whistleblower laws. For example, the \nlaw provides the OSC with no authority to request the Merit Systems \nProtection Board to reconsider one of its decisions or to seek \nappellate review of an MSPB decision. Even when\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\nanother party petitions for a review of a MSPB decision, OSC is \ntypically denied the right to participate in the proceedings.\n  Our bill would provide explicit authority for the Office of Special \nCounsel to appear in any civil action brought in connection with the \nwhistleblower law. In addition, it would authorize OSC to obtain \ncircuit court review of any MSPB order in a whistleblowing case if the \nOSC determines the Board erred and the case would have a substantial \nimpact on the enforcement of the whistleblower statute. In a letter to \nme addressing these provisions, Special Counsel Elaine Kaplan said, ``I \nbelieve that these changes are necessary, not only to ensure OSC's \neffectiveness, but to address continuing concerns about the whittling \naway of the WPA's protections by narrow judicial interpretations of the \nlaw.'' I ask unanimous consent that the OSC letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for giving me the opportunity \n     to comment on the proposed Title VI of H.R. 5005, concerning \n     the protection of federal employee whistleblowers.\n       As the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), \n     the independent federal agency that is responsible for \n     investigating and prosecuting federal employees' complaints \n     of whistleblower retaliation, I share your recognition that \n     it is crucial to ensure that the laws protecting \n     whistleblowers are strong and effective. Federal employees \n     are often in the best position to observe and identify \n     official misconduct or malfeasance as well as dangers to the \n     public health and safety, and the national security.\n       Now, perhaps more than ever before, our national interest \n     demands that federal workers feel safe to come forward to \n     bring appropriate attention to these conditions so that they \n     may be corrected. Further, and again more than ever, the \n     public now needs assurance that the workforce which is \n     carrying out crucial operations is alert, and that its \n     leaders welcome and encourage their constructive \n     participation in making the government a highly efficient and \n     effective steward of the public interest.\n       To these ends, Title VI contains a number of provisions \n     that will strengthen the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) \n     and close loopholes in the Act's coverage. The amendment \n     would reverse the effects of several judicial decisions that \n     have imposed unduly narrow and restrictive tests for \n     determining whether employees qualify for the protection of \n     the WPA. These decisions, among other things, have held that \n     employees are not protected against retaliation when they \n     make their disclosures in the line of duty or when they \n     confront subject officials with their suspicions of \n     wrongdoing. They have also made it more difficult for \n     whistleblowers to secure the Act's protection by interposing \n     what the Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit has called \n     an ``irrefragable'' presumption that government officials \n     perform their duties lawfully and in good faith.\n       In addition to reversing these rulings, Title VI would \n     grant the Special Counsel independent litigating authority \n     and the right to request judicial review of decisions of the \n     Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in cases that will have \n     a substantial impact upon the enforcement of the WPA. I \n     firmly believe that these changes are necessary, not only to \n     ensure OSC's effectiveness, but to address continuing \n     concerns about the whittling away of the WPA's protections \n     by narrow judicial interpretations of the law. The changes \n     would ensure that, OSC, the government agency charged with \n     protecting whistleblowers, will have a meaningful \n     opportunity to participate in the shaping of the law.\n       Further, Title VI would strengthen OSC's capacity to use \n     its disciplinary action authority to deter agency \n     supervisors, managers, and other officials from engaging in \n     retaliation, and to punish those who do so. The amendment \n     does this in two ways. First, it clarifies the burden of \n     proof in disciplinary action cases that OSC brings by \n     employing the test first set forth by the Supreme Court in \n     Mt. Healthy School District v. Board of Education. Under this \n     test, in order to secure discipline of an agency official \n     accused of engaging in whistleblower retaliation, OSC would \n     have to show that protected whistleblowing was a \n     ``significant, motivating factor'' in the decision to take or \n     threaten to take a personnel action. If OSC made such a \n     showing, the MSPB would order appropriate discipline unless \n     the official showed, by preponderant evidence, that he or she \n     would have taken or threatened to take the same action even \n     had there been no protected activity.\n       This change is necessary in order to ensure that the burden \n     of proof in these cases is not so onerous as to make it \n     virtually impossible to secure discipline against \n     retaliators. Under current law, OSC bears the unprecedented \n     burden of demonstrating that protected activity was the but-\n     for cause of an adverse personnel action against a \n     whistleblower. The amendment would correct the imbalance by \n     imposing the well-established Mt. Healthy test in these \n     cases.\n       In addition, the bill would relieve OSC of attorney fee \n     liability in disciplinary action cases in which it ultimately \n     does not prevail. The amendment would shift liability for \n     fees to the manager's employing agency, where an award of \n     fees would be in the interest of justice. The employing \n     agency would indemnify the manager for these costs which \n     would have been incurred by him in the course of performing \n     his official duties.\n       Under current law, if OSC ultimately does not prevail in a \n     case it brings against a manager whom our investigation shows \n     has engaged in retailiation, then we must pay attorney fees, \n     even if our prosecution decision was an entirely reasonable \n     one. For a small agency like OSC, with a limited budget, the \n     specter of having to pay large attorney fee awards simply \n     because we do not ultimately prevail in a case, is a \n     significant obstacle to our ability to use this important \n     authority to hold managers accountable. It is, moreover, an \n     unprecedented burden; virtually all fee shifting provisions \n     which could result in an award of fees against a government \n     agency, depend upon a showing that the government agency has \n     acted unreasonably or in bad faith.\n       In addition to these provisions, the bill would also \n     provide that for a period of five years, beginning on \n     February 1, 2003, there would be multi-circuit review of \n     decisions of the MSPB, just as there is now multi-circuit \n     review of decisions of the MSPB's sister agency, the \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority. This experiment will \n     give Congress the opportunity to judge whether providing \n     broader perspectives of all of the nation's courts of \n     appeals will enhance the development of the law under the \n     WPA.\n       There are several other provisions of the amendments that \n     would strengthen the Act's coverage and remedies. The \n     amendments, for example, would extend coverage of the WPA to \n     circumstances in which an agency initiated an investigation \n     of an employee or applicant in reprisal for whistleblowing or \n     where an agency implemented an illegal non-disclosure form or \n     policy. The amendments also would authorize an award of \n     compensatory damages in federal employee whistleblower cases. \n     Such awards are authorized for federal employees under the \n     civil rights acts, and for environmental and nuclear \n     whistleblowers, among others, under other federal statutes. \n     Given the important public policies underlying the WPA, it \n     seems appropriate that the same sort of make whole relief \n     should be available to federal employee whistleblowers.\n       Finally, Title VI contains a provision that would provide \n     relief to employees who allege that their security clearances \n     were denied or revoked because of protected whistleblowers, \n     without interfering with the longstanding authority of the \n     President to make security clearance determinations. The \n     amendment would allow employees to file OSC complaints \n     alleging they suffered a retaliatory adverse security \n     clearance determination. OSC would be given the authority to \n     investigate such complaints and the MSPB would have the \n     authority to issue declaratory and appropriate relief other \n     than ordering the restoration of the clearance. Further, \n     where the Board found retaliation, the employing agency would \n     be required to conduct its own investigation of the \n     revocation and report back to Congress.\n       The amendment provides a balanced resolution of the tension \n     between protecting national security whistleblowers against \n     retaliation and maintaining the President's traditional \n     prerogative to decide who will have access to classified \n     information. Especially in light of the current heightened \n     concerns about issues of national security, this change in \n     the law is clearly warranted.\n       Thank you again for providing me with an opportunity to \n     comment on these amendments, and for your continuing interest \n     in the work of the Office of Special Counsel.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Elaine Kaplan.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. OSC currently has the authority to pursue disciplinary \naction against managers who retaliate against whistleblowers. However, \nFederal Circuit decisions, like LaChance, have undermined the agency's \nability to successfully pursue such cases. The Special Counsel has said \nthat ``change is necessary in order to ensure that the burden of proof \nin these cases is not so onerous as to make it virtually impossible to \nsecure disciplinary action against retaliators.'' In addition to it \nbeing difficult to win, if the OSC loses a disciplinary case, it has to \npay the legal fees of those against whom OSC initiates disciplinary \naction. In its letter, OSC said that ``the specter of having to pay \nlarge attorney fee awards . . . is a significant obstacle to our \nability to use this important authority to hold managers accountable.'' \nOur bill addresses these problems by establishing a reasonable burden \nof proof for disciplinary actions and requiring the employing agency, \nnot the OSC, to reimburse the prevailing party for attorney fees in a \ndisciplinary proceeding.\n  Finally, the bill addresses a new issue that has arisen in connection\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\nwith the recent enactment of the Homeland Security Act or HSA. To \nevaluate the vulnerability to terrorist attack of certain critical \ninfrastructure such as chemical plants, computer networks and other key \nfacilities, the HSA asks private companies that own these facilities to \nsubmit unclassified information about them to the government. In doing \nso, the law also created some ambiguity on the question of whether \nfederal employee whistleblowers would be protected by the WPA if they \nshould disclose information that has been independently obtained by the \nwhistleblower about such facilities but which may also have been \ndisclosed to the government as under the critical infrastructure \ninformation program.\n  While I believe it was Congress' intent to extend whistleblower \nprotections to federal employees who disclose such independently \nobtained information, the law's ambiguities are troublesome in the \ncontext of the tendency of the Federal Circuit to narrowly construe the \nscope of protections afforded by the WPA. Our bill would thus clarify \nthat whistleblower protections do extend to federal employees who \ndisclose independently obtained information that may also have been \ndisclosed to the government as part of the critical infrastructure \ninformation program.\n  We need to encourage federal employees to blow the whistle on waste, \nfraud and abuse in federal government agencies and programs. These \npeople take great risks and often face enormous obstacles in doing what \nthey believe is right. The Congress and the country owe a particular \ndebt of gratitude to those whistleblowers who put their careers on the \nline to protect national security. Since September 11, 2001, we have \nseen a number of examples of how crucial people like Coleen Rowley, \nMark Hall and Bob Lindemann are to keeping our country safe. I request \nunanimous consent to print a letter from Agent Rowley in the Record. In \nthe letter she says that when she blew the whistle, she was lucky \nenough to garner the support of many of her colleagues and members of \nCongress. However, her letter warns that for every Coleen Rowley, \n``there are many more who do not benefit from the relative safety of \npublic notoriety.'' It is to protect those responsible, courageous many \nthat we offer this legislation. We need more like them.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                September 2, 2002.\n       Dear Senators: I have proudly served in federal law \n     enforcement for over 21 years. Prior to my personal \n     involvement in a specific matter, I did not fully appreciate \n     the strong disincentives that sometimes keep government \n     employees from exposing waste, fraud, abuse, or other \n     failures they witness on the job. Nor did I appreciate the \n     strong incentives that do exist for agencies to avoid \n     institutional embarrassment.\n       The decision to step forward with information that exposed \n     my agency to scrutiny was one of the most difficult of my \n     career. I did not come to it quickly or lightly. I first \n     attempted to warn my superiors through regular channels. Only \n     after those warnings failed to bring about the necessary \n     response and congressional inquiry was initiated, did it go \n     outside the agency with my concerns. I had no intention or \n     desire to be in the public spotlight, so I did not go to the \n     news media. I provided the information to Members of Congress \n     with oversight responsibility. I felt compelled to do so \n     because my responsibility is to the American people, not to a \n     government agency.\n       Unfortunately, the cloak of secrecy which is necessary for \n     the effective operation of government agencies involved in \n     national security and criminal investigations fosters an \n     environment where the incentives to avoid embarrassment and \n     the disincentives to step forward combine. When that happens, \n     the public loses. We need laws that strike a better balance, \n     that are able to protect effective government operation \n     without sacrificing accountability to the public. I was lucky \n     enough to garner a good deal of support from my colleagues in \n     the Minneapolis office and Members of Congress. But for every \n     one like me, there are many more who do not benefit from the \n     relative safety of public notoriety. They need credible, \n     functioning rights and remedies to retain the freedom to \n     warn.\n       I also need to state that I write this letter in my \n     personal capacity, and that it reflects my personal views \n     only, not those of the government agency for which I work.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n                                                    Coleen Rowley.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a section-\nby-section explanation of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n   Section-by-Section Analysis of the Federal Employee Protection of \n                            Disclosures Act\n\n       The Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act would \n     strengthen protections for federal employees who blow the \n     whistle on waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government.\n       Protected Whistleblower Disclosures. To correct court \n     decisions improperly limiting the disclosures protected by \n     the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), section (b) of the \n     bill would clarify Congressional intent that the law covers \n     `any' whistleblowing disclosure, whether that disclosure is \n     made as part of an employee's job duties, concerns policy or \n     individual misconduct, is oral or written, or is made to any \n     audience inside or outside an agency, and without restriction \n     to time, place, motive or context. This section would also \n     protect certain disclosures of classified information to \n     Congress when the disclosure is to a Member or legislative \n     staff holding an appropriate security clearance and \n     authorized to receive the type of information disclosed.\n       Informal Disclosures. Section (c) would clarify the \n     definition of ``disclosure'' to include a formal or informal \n     communication or transmission.\n       Irrefragable Proof. In LaChance v. White, the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit imposed an erroneous standard \n     for determining when an employee makes a protected disclosure \n     under the WPA. Under the clear language of the statute, an \n     employee need only have a reasonable belief that he or she is \n     providing evidence of fraud, waste or abuse to make a \n     protected disclosure. But the court ruled that an employee \n     had to have ``irrefragable proof'' meaning undeniable and \n     incontestable proof to overcome the presumption that a public \n     officer is performing their duties in accordance with law. \n     Section (d) would replace this unreasonable standard of proof \n     by providing that a whistleblower can rebut the presumption \n     with ``substantial evidence.''\n       Prohibited Personnel Actions. Section (e)(1) would add \n     three actions to the list of prohibited personnel actions \n     that may not be taken against whistleblowers for protected \n     disclosures: enforcement of a nondisclosure policy, form or \n     agreement; suspension, revocation, or other determination \n     relating to an employee's security clearance; and \n     investigation of an employee or applicant for employment due \n     to protected whistleblowing activities.\n       Nondisclosure Actions Against Whistleblowers. Section \n     (e)(2) would bar agencies from implementing or enforcing \n     against whistleblowers any nondisclosure policy, form or \n     agreement that fails to contain specified language preserving \n     the right of government employees to disclose certain \n     protected information. It would also prohibit a manager from \n     initiating an investigation of an employee or applicant for \n     employment because they engaged in protected activity.\n       Retaliations Involving Security Clearances. Section (e)(3) \n     would make it a prohibited personnel practice for a manager \n     to suspend, revoke or take other action with respect to an \n     employee's security clearance in retaliation for \n     whistleblowing. This section would also authorize the Merit \n     Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to conduct an expedited \n     review of such matters and issue declaratory and other \n     appropriate relief, but would not empower MSPB to restore a \n     security clearance. If MSPB or a reviewing court were to find \n     that a security clearance decision was retaliatory, the \n     agency involved would be required to review its security \n     clearance decision and issue a report to Congress explaining \n     it.\n       Exclusions from WPA. Current law allows the President to \n     exclude certain employees and agencies from the WPA if they \n     perform certain intelligence related or policy making \n     functions. In 1994, Congress amended the WPA to stop agencies \n     from removing employees from WPA coverage after the employees \n     filed whistleblower complaints. Section (f) would also \n     require that removal of an agency from the WPA be made prior \n     to a personnel action being taken against a whistleblower at \n     that agency.\n       Attorney Fees. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has \n     authority to pursue disciplinary action against managers who \n     retaliate against whistleblowers. Currently, if OSC loses a \n     disciplinary case, it must pay the legal fees of those \n     against whom it initiated the action. Because the amounts \n     involved could significantly deplete OSC's limited resources, \n     section (g) would require the employing agency, rather than \n     OSC, to reimburse the manager's attorney fees.\n       Compensatory Damages. In the 1994 WPA amendments, Congress \n     attempted to expand relief for whistleblowers by replacing \n     ``compensatory'' damages with direct and indirect \n     ``consequential'' damages. Despite Congressional intent, the \n     Federal Circuit narrowed the scope of relief available to \n     whistleblowers. To correct the court's misinterpretation of \n     the law, section (h) would provide whistleblowers with relief \n     for compensatory or consequential damages.\n       Burden of Proof in Disciplinary Actions. Currently, when \n     OSC pursues disciplinary action against managers who \n     retaliate against whistleblowers, OSC must demonstrate that \n     an adverse personnel action would not have occurred ``but \n     for'' the whistleblower's protected activity. Section (i) \n     would establish a more reasonable burden of proof by \n     requiring OSC to demonstrate that the whistleblower's \n     protected disclosure was\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\n     a ``motivating factor'' in the decision by the manager to \n     take the adverse action, even if other factors also motivated \n     the decision. This burden would be similar to the approach \n     taken in the 1991 Civil Rights Act.\n       Disclosures to Congress. Section (j) would require agencies \n     to establish a process to provide confidential advice to \n     employees on how to lawfully make a protected disclosure of \n     classified information to Congress.\n       Authority of Special Counsel. Under current law, OSC has no \n     authority to request MSPB to reconsider a decision or seek \n     appellate review of a MSPB decision. This limitation \n     undermines OSC's ability to protect whistleblowers and \n     integrity of the WPA. Section (k) would authorize OSC to \n     appear in any civil action brought in connection with the WPA \n     and request appellate review of any MSPB order where OSC \n     determines MSPB erred and the case would have a substantial \n     impact on WPA enforcement.\n       Judicial Review. In 1982, Congress replaced normal \n     Administrative Procedures Act appellate review of MSPB \n     decisions with exclusive jurisdiction in the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit. While the 1989 WPA and its \n     1994 amendments strengthened and clarified whistleblower \n     protections, Federal Circuit holdings have repeatedly \n     misinterpreted key provisions of the law. Subject to a five \n     year sunset, section (l) would suspend the Federal Circuit's \n     exclusive jurisdiction over whistleblower appeals and allow \n     petitions for review to be filed either in the Federal \n     Circuit or any other federal circuit court of competent \n     jurisdiction.\n       Nondisclosure Restrictions on Whistleblowers. Section (m) \n     would require all federal nondisclosure policies, forms and \n     agreements to contain specified language preserving the right \n     of government employees to disclose certain protected \n     information. This section would codify the so-called anti-gag \n     provision that has been included in federal appropriations \n     bills since 1988.\n       Critical Infrastructure Information. Section (n) would \n     clarify that section 214(c) of the Homeland Security Act \n     (HSA) maintains existing WPA rights for independently \n     obtained information that may also qualify as critical \n     infrastructure information under the HSA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7643-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7643-S7644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 164--REAFFIRMING SUPPORT OF THE CONVENTION ON THE \nPREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT OF THE CRIME OF GENOCIDE AND ANTICIPATING THE \nCOMMEMORATION OF THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE GENOCIDE \n  CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION OF 1987 (THE PROXMIRE ACT) ON NOVEMBER 4, \n                                  2003\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Reed, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kohl, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Allen, Mr. Biden, Mr. Santorum, Mrs. \nDole, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 164\n\n       Whereas, in 1948, in the shadow of the Holocaust, the \n     international community responded to Nazi Germany's \n     methodically orchestrated acts of genocide by approving the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide, done at Paris on December 9, 1948;\n       Whereas the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     the Crime of Genocide confirms that genocide is a crime under \n     international law, defines genocide as certain acts committed \n     with intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial, or \n     religious group, and provides that parties to the Convention \n     undertake to enact domestic legislation providing effective \n     penalties for persons who are guilty of genocide;\n       Whereas the United States, under President Harry Truman, \n     was the first nation to sign the Convention on the Prevention \n     and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       Whereas the United States Senate approved the resolution of \n     advice and consent to the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on February 19, 1986;\n       Whereas the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987 \n     (the Proxmire Act) (Public Law 100-606), signed into law by \n     President Ronald Reagan on November 4, 1988, enacted chapter \n     50A of title 18, United States Code, to criminalize genocide;\n       Whereas the enactment of the Genocide Convention \n     Implementation Act marked a principled stand by the United \n     States against the crime of genocide and an important step \n     toward ensuring that the lessons of the Holocaust, the \n     Armenian Genocide, and genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda and \n     elsewhere will be used to help prevent future genocides;\n       Whereas a clear consensus exists within the international \n     community against genocide, as evidenced by the fact that 133 \n     nations are party to the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       Whereas, despite this consensus, many thousands of innocent \n     people continue to fall victim to genocide, and the denials \n     of past instances of genocide continue; and\n       Whereas November 4, 2003 is the 15th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of \n     1987 (the Proxmire Act): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its support for the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       (2) anticipates the commemoration of the 15th anniversary \n     of the enactment of the Genocide Convention Implementation \n     Act of 1987 (the Proxmire Act) on November 4, 2003; and\n       (3) encourages the people and the Government of the United \n     States to rededicate themselves to the cause of ending the \n     crime of genocide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 165--COMMENDING BOB HOPE FOR HIS DEDICATION AND \n                        COMMITMENT TO THE NATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 52\n\n       Whereas all people are endowed with an inestimable dignity, \n     which is based on autonomy and self-determination, and which \n     requires that every person be placed at the center of all \n     decisions affecting such person, and the inherent equality of \n     all people and the ethical requirement of every society to \n     honor and sustain the freedom of any individual with \n     appropriate communal support;\n       Whereas more than 600,000,000 people have a disability;\n       Whereas more than two-thirds of all persons with \n     disabilities live in developing countries, and only 2 percent \n     of children with disabilities in the developing world receive \n     any education or rehabilitation;\n       Whereas during the last 2 decades, a substantial shift has \n     occurred globally in governmental and nongovernmental \n     institutions from an approach of charity toward persons with \n     disabilities to the recognition of the inherent universal \n     human rights of persons with disabilities;\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\n       Whereas the United Nations has authoritatively endorsed and \n     helped to advance progress toward realizing the human rights \n     of persons with disabilities, as exemplified by the United \n     Nations Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities \n     for Persons with Disabilities (adopted by the United Nations \n     General Assembly in Resolution 48/96 of December 20, 1993), \n     which are monitored by a United Nations Special Rapporteur;\n       Whereas because of the slow and uneven progress of ensuring \n     that persons with disabilities enjoy their universal human \n     rights in law and in practice, every society and the \n     international community remain challenged to identify and \n     implement the processes which best protect the dignity of \n     persons with disabilities and which fully implement their \n     inherent human rights;\n       Whereas greater and more rapid progress must be achieved \n     toward overcoming the relative invisibility of persons with \n     disabilities in many societies, national laws, and existing \n     international human rights instruments; and\n       Whereas, accordingly, the United Nations General Assembly \n     in November 2001, adopted an historic resolution to establish \n     an ad hoc committee open to all United Nations member nations \n     to consider proposals for a comprehensive and integral treaty \n     to protect and promote the rights and dignity of persons with \n     disabilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should play a leading role in the \n     drafting of a thematic United Nations convention that affirms \n     the human rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, \n     and that--\n       (A) is consistent with the spirit of the American with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990, the United States Constitution, and \n     other rights enjoyed by United States citizens with \n     disabilities;\n       (B) promotes inclusion, independence, political \n     enfranchisement, and economic self-sufficiency of persons \n     with disabilities as foundational requirements for any free \n     and just society; and\n       (C) provides protections that are at least as strong as the \n     rights that are now recognized under international human \n     rights law for other vulnerable populations; and\n       (2) the President should instruct the Secretary of State to \n     send to the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee meetings a United \n     States delegation that includes individuals with disabilities \n     who are recognized leaders in the United States disability \n     rights movement.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution \non behalf of myself, Senator Chafee and Senator Kennedy. This \nresolution deals with an issue that I have been working on for many \nyears in a bipartisan manner. It simply calls on the United States to \ntake a leading role in the drafting of an international convention on \nthe human rights of individuals with disabilities. Such a treaty could \nimprove the lives of over 600 million individuals with disabilities \nthroughout the world.\n  For the past twenty years, the United States has put politics aside \nand has taken a lead role in the world toward the understanding that \ndisability rights are human rights. I chaired the Senate's Subcommittee \non the Handicapped at the time that the Americans With Disabilities Act \nwas being considered by Congress and was a leading author of the ADA. \nDuring hearings, I heard over and over again stories of people with \ndisabilities suffering from discrimination--not getting a job because \nof a disability; being locked up in a nursing home or institution \nbecause of a disability; not being able to get into schools, \nrestaurants, stores, banks and other places of business because of a \ndisability. This kind of discrimination is wrong. It is wrong in the \nUnited States and it is wrong throughout the world.\n  In 1990, then President Bush signed the ADA into law. He said, ``This \nhistoric Act is the world's first comprehensive declaration of equality \nfor people with disabilities. Its passage has made the United States \nthe international leader on this human rights issue.'' The United \nStates did lead the way in 1990, and it has another historic \nopportunity to lead the way today.\n  The issue of disability rights is very personal to me. As many of my \ncolleagues know, my brother Frank was deaf. Because of his disability, \nhe was sent to a school for the ``deaf and dumb'' across the State. \nFrank said to me, ``I may be deaf but I am not dumb.'' I think of how \nmany children, like Frank, in the world are suffering the effects of \nthis sort of discrimination. How many children are not going to school \nbecause they are deaf, or use a wheelchair, or are blind? How many \nadults with these same disabilities are not working, not earning a \nliving, not participating in civil society?\n  In recent months, we have all witnessed the situation people with \ndisabilities face in Iraq and in Afghanistan. We have seen footage of \nthe results of the tyranny of Saddam Hussein. We have seen many \nindividuals who have life-long disabilities as a result of his cruelty. \nMany more are victims of terrorism and cruelty who now suffer the added \ninjury of discrimination.\n  America has an historic opportunity to help change the lives of these \nchildren and adults from around the world and open the doors of \nopportunity to them. It is time for the world community to come \ntogether and write an important new chapter and break down the barriers \nthat prevent people with disabilities from participating in their \ncommunities and play an active role in civil society. It is time to say \nto all of the world that disability rights are human rights, not just \nin the United States, but everywhere in the world. I strongly urge the \nBush Administration to take a lead and work with other member Nations \nin the drafting of this resolution. Under the auspices of the United \nNations, member states are scheduled to meet next week in New York to \nconsider proposals for a comprehensive treaty to protect and promote \nthe rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. I cannot think of \na more worthwhile role the Administration could play than to be a \nleader on this issue and to fully support a convention on the rights of \nindividuals with disabilities.\n\n  America's leadership in this process will help create a treaty that \nis both well intentioned and relevant, one that may fulfill its \npotential and vastly improve the perceptions, treatment and conditions \nof people with disabilities throughout the world. The United States \nmust continue to lead the way in this important international effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7644-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 871.

Mr. President, we have been negotiating all day with \nSenator Baucus, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, in the \nhopes of getting the Burma bill cleared, but, regretfully, that has not \noccurred yet.\n  Time is passing. I was at a meeting with the President just an hour \nago. He brought up the issue. Both the Republican and Democratic \nleaders of the Senate are in favor of this bill. Both the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee are in favor of \nthis bill. My good friend, the assistant Democratic leader, is in favor \nof this bill. It is time to pass it.\n  We have been protecting, under a rule XIV procedure, the possibility \nof going to this bill tomorrow. But I must say, I think it would be a \nlot better to go to it tonight. So I have notified the Senator from \nNevada that I am going to make the following unanimous consent request, \nand I will do that at this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow, at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic \nleader, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1215, \nthe Burma sanctions bill, under the following conditions: 1 hour of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the measure, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been told by Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley that they object to this.

We are going to figure out a way to have this matter brought \nbefore the Senate.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend from \nNevada, I have not heard from Senator Grassley. I keep hearing from the \nother side that Senator Grassley objects, but I have not heard that, \nnor have floor staff been informed that he does. But either way, it is \ntime to move forward, and it needs to be done this week, and should be \ndone with a tight time agreement and a rollcall vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7648-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

We should \ncontinue to address and dispose of as many amendments as possible. \nTherefore, Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day \ntomorrow in relation to amendments to that bill.\n  I also inform all of my colleagues that we anticipate locking in a \nfinal list of amendments to the Energy Bill during tomorrow's session.\n  In addition to considering amendments to the Energy Bill, it remains \nmy hope that we will be able to take up and pass the Burma sanctions \nbill tomorrow. We should have done it today. Hopefully we can do it \ntomorrow. There is currently, as the Senator from Nevada and I have \ndiscussed, difficulty in clearing that with Senator Baucus, and \nhopefully that will be cleared up by tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/10/senate-section/article/S7649-5", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
