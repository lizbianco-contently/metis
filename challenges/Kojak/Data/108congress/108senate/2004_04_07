This morning, the Senate will conduct a period of morning \nbusiness until 10:45 a.m. We may make some adjustments to that because \nwe want a full hour of morning business. There will be some leader time \nused by myself and the Democratic leader. Morning business will be for \nan hour, with the first half under the control of the Democratic leader \nand the second half under the control of the majority leader.\n  Following that 1 hour of morning business, the Senate will begin 2 \nhours for debate with respect to the motion to proceed to the Pregnancy \nand Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004.\n  Following the debate, the Senate will recess until 2:15 for the \nweekly policy luncheons to occur. When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15, \nthere will be a vote on invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthe consideration of the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection \nAct. This procedural vote will require 60 votes. Unfortunately, it \nbecame necessary due to objections from the other side of the aisle.\n  Following that vote, the Senate will conduct a second cloture vote \nrelating to the FSC/ETI, the JOBS bill. This will be the second cloture \nvote with respect to this JOBS bill, the FSC/ETI bill. I hope we will \nbe successful in invoking cloture and bringing this FSC/ETI issue to \nconclusion.\n  An issue we need to address this week is the pension equity \nconference report. That conference report has passed the House by a \nlarge margin, and it is now at the desk. We need to consider that \nmeasure prior to adjourning for the Easter recess. I will be talking to \nthe Democratic leader after our statements this morning about reaching \nan agreement for a period of debate and a vote on the pension equity \nconference report.\n  I will briefly comment on the JOBS bill, the FSC/ETI bill. The \nprogrowth policies this Senate, this body has passed in 2001 and 2003 \nare policies which keep more money in the hands of individuals and \nbusinesses and out of the grasp of Government. These policies have \nbegun to pay dividends, dividends we have seen over the last several \nmonths, realized in the improvement in the economy and in the job\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\ncreation numbers, which have steadied and now begun to increase.\n\n  The point is, we can, we should, and we will do more. Today, we have \nan opportunity to further enhance the creation of jobs which are so \nneeded here at home, by taking positive action to move the JOBS bill--\nthat is, the Jumpstart Our Business Strength Act, the FSC/ETI bill--\nthrough this whole maze of parliamentary obstacles that are currently \nhandcuffing this bill. It is important for us to do. We absolutely must \naccomplish that this week.\n  As most know, this bill brings together our trade and tax laws. It \nbrings them in compliance with our trade agreements. It will also \ncreate tens of thousands of new jobs over the next several years. Given \nthat much of the benefit of that legislation goes to U.S. manufacturing \nfirms, these jobs are likely to be high-wage, high-skill jobs that are \nnecessary to ensure strong economic growth.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Europeans are already imposing \ntariffs on our exports. The tariffs started last month, March 1, at 5 \npercent of the $4 billion authorized. They will increase 1 percent; \nthat is, $40 million, each and every month that passes. The tariffs, in \neffect, are a European tax on U.S. manufacturers, and they are \ndevastating U.S. businesses.\n  According to the American Forest and Paper Association, in the forest \nproducts industry alone, approximately 1,400 jobs are at risk due to \nthese tariffs. It is time for us to act; it is causing real economic \nhardship.\n  There is a company with operations in both Ohio and Wisconsin called \nRobbins Sports Surfaces. Jonathan Turner is their director of \npurchasing. He wrote an e-mail that summarizes why we need to act and \nto act now:\n\n       The estimated average value per year for all items that the \n     EU has sanctioned has been about $300,000.00 for my company. \n     . . . Because competition is so fierce in these markets, any \n     import duty will likely cost us that business to a European \n     competitor. With the initial import duty, we cannot compete \n     effectively in Europe at this time. We need to sell our \n     products to the EU and are in favor of discontinuing this \n     duty. For 10 years we have exported to the EU and are in \n     danger of losing that market if FSC/ETI is not resolved.\n\n  That is just one example--Jonathan Turner's words in an e-mail.\n  A vote against cloture is a vote in support of this Euro tax, whether \nit is on Jonathan Turner or Robbins Sports Surfaces or thousands of \nother companies also facing these tariffs. So I do hope my colleagues \nwill join me and others in voting in favor of cloture this afternoon so \nwe can move forward on this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3870-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to respond, \nif I could, to the comments made by the distinguished majority leader. \nHe made a very good statement about the importance of the FSC/ETI bill. \nI do not know whether there is unanimous support for FSC/ETI, but I do \nknow there is strong support for it. It passed by a large margin out of \nthe Finance Committee, and I think there is a great deal of interest in \npassing it on the Senate floor. So this is not a question whatsoever \nabout support for the bill.\n  We have been on the bill now for 7 days. This is the seventh day. We \nhave actually had a vote on one amendment having to do with \noutsourcing--7 days, one vote. I am absolutely convinced if we had \nspent these 7 days working through the list of amendments--and I have \nthe list in front of me--we would have finished this bill by now.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of \namendments be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  S. 1637, FSC/ETI Bill (2nd List)--Updated 1 p.m., Monday, March 29, \n                                  2004\n\n        Bayh: (1) China trade laws; and (2) manufacturing.\n        Breaux/Feinstein: (1) Re-patriation.\n        Cantwell: (1) UI.\n        Corzine: (1) Trade barriers; (2) COBRA; and (3) trade \n     enforcement.\n       Daschle: (1) Job creation package.\n        Dayton: (1) Strike all international provisions; (2) \n     capturing tax credit; (3) housing; and (4) check the box.\n        Dorgan/Mikulski: (1) Runaway plants.\n        Feingold: (1) Buy America provisions.\n        Graham: (1) Strike international manufacturing and replace \n     with job credit; (2) repeal of international title; and (3) \n     relevant.\n        Harkin: (1) Overtime.\n        Harkin/Wyden: (1) No tax deduction for outsourcing.\n        Hollings: (1) Strike all international provisions.\n        Kennedy: (1) Family opportunity act; (2) strike some \n     international provisions; and (3) notification (with \n     Daschle).\n        Lautenberg: (1) Foreign subsidiaries doing business with \n     terrorist nations.\n        Levin: (1) Tax shelters.\n        Miller: (1) Green bond.\n        Murray/Durbin: (1) Malpractice insurance tax credit.\n        Pryor: (1) IRA.\n        Reid/Dorgan/Coleman: (1) Production tax credit.\n        Schumer: (1) NY; and (2) China.\n        Stabenow: (1) Tax benefits for domestic production.\n        Wyden/Rockefeller: (1) TAA for services and health care.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have indicated to Senator Frist that I feel strongly \nabout the importance of working with him to try to finish deliberations \non this bill. Instead, what we have gotten from some on the other side \nis just a lot of posturing.\n  This was the original bill: 378 pages. Well, they denied the \nDemocrats the opportunity to vote on one amendment and came back with \nthe second version; this has 567 pages. They denied the opportunity, \nonce again, to offer Democratic amendments, but now they have 969 pages \nof new amendments. So what they are telling us this morning is that \nthis amendment is OK, but Senate Democrats cannot offer any of their \namendments that are relevant, that are certainly appropriate, but that \nwould fall under cloture today.\n  I have urged my colleagues to reduce the number of amendments that \nthey had intended to offer, and virtually every one of them has \nobliged. We started out with about 75 amendments. It came down to 40 \namendments. Now it is down to around 25 amendments. If we had a finite \nlist, I am sure we could work those down even more as we debated these \namendments.\n  So I am troubled and, frankly, somewhat frustrated. Senator Frist, \nsince he has been majority leader, has had a very good managerial \nstyle, where he has come to the floor, he has allowed Democrats to \noffer their amendments, and we have worked through bill after bill, \nincluding a very complicated highway bill in a very short period of \ntime. Well, this is not in keeping with that practice, and it is \ntroubling to me.\n  About a week ago, I also indicated we would be prepared to finish the \nwelfare bill this week if we could work through the amendments, and \nthat was not possible either.\n  I hope people understand this has nothing to do with support of the \nbill. This has to do with support of having an opportunity to do what \nthis Senate is supposedly known for, which is to have a vigorous debate \nin what is called the most deliberative body. Having one amendment in 7 \ndays is not my idea of thoughtful deliberation. We have been hung up on \nprocedure and hung up on issues that have nothing to do with the FSC/\nETI bill as it relates\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\nto stopping--I would say obstructing--Democrats from offering these \namendments.\n  I am hopeful that once we get beyond this cloture vote, we can lay \nthe bill down and we can work through these amendments. I will work \nwith the majority leader to ensure we have adequate cooperation on this \nside, as I have offered from the very beginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3871-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICAL MALPRACTICE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the second issue, that I just mention \nbriefly, has to do with the cloture vote on the medical malpractice \nissue that will come before the Senate this afternoon.\n  This bill actually differentiates between those who walk in the front \ndoor of a hospital and those who get emergency care. We objected last \ntime we voted on this because it differentiated between men and women. \nMen and women would be treated differently under the bill that cloture \nwas voted on a few weeks ago. Now our Republican colleagues add to that \npeople who walk into a hospital or are taken into a hospital via an \nemergency room.\n  This draws a distinction that I think is inexplicable. If you are \ninjured in an emergency room, under this legislation, you have \nvirtually no legal recourse. If you are injured by walking through the \nfront door of a hospital, you still have all the recourses that are \nallowed under Federal law. Drawing that distinction, to me, is not an \nimprovement. That is not reform. Yet that is what some of our \nRepublican colleagues have said.\n\n  On more than one occasion, Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Dick \nDurbin have said they are prepared to work, in a bipartisan way, to \nallow us the opportunity to address meaningful malpractice reform, \nincluding the high cost of malpractice insurance. But that is what it \nis going to take.\n  Having cloture votes on bills that draw a distinction between two \ncircumstances that have nothing to do with punitive damages, or with \neconomic damages for that matter, is something I think will get us \nnowhere. This vote, as all the other votes, will not be accepted. It \nagain reminds us how important it is that we work together to find a \nreal solution to malpractice, as Senators Graham and Durbin are doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3871-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONFERENCE PROCEDURES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Finally, Mr. President, let me just add one other \ntroubling aspect to this discussion this morning, and that is the \npension bill.\n  Our caucus will be discussing this matter this afternoon. I am \nhopeful we can find some way to address the issue of pensions in a \nmeaningful way. I have indicated to Senator Frist how concerned we are \nwith the way pensions have once again been addressed in conference. We \nused this conference as a test to see whether Senators, in a bipartisan \nway, can work together, but once again Democrats were locked out of the \ndiscussions in a way that brought about a very questionable result.\n  The Senate voted 85 to 14 to support multiemployer and single-\nemployer pension plans. We went to conference. We had a tentative \nagreement that at least 20 percent of the multiemployer pension plans \nwould be addressed. We felt that was a sufficient effort to address \nsome of the real plans in crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the White House told the conferees that that was \nunacceptable to them and, without consultation and without any effort \nto resolve the matter in some form of bipartisan compromise, Democrats \nonce again, as we saw last year with the Omnibus legislation, with the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, and with other bills, got the same \nresult. It is no wonder our colleagues are so reluctant to go to \nconference. Once again, as the pension bill proved, the conferences are \nnot working as they should.\n  It is for that reason many of us are very concerned about what now to \ndo with the pension bill as it is presented. We will have a good \ndiscussion about that in caucus today and make some decision as we go \nforward.\n  This is not the way conferences should work. It is deeply troubling \nto many of us that again we find ourselves in exactly the situation \nthat I warned would cause further problems were it to happen again. It \nhas. I regrettably feel as if conferences in the future are going to be \nvery difficult, if not impossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3871-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, in the last few days, the Foreign Minister \nof Saudi Arabia has said--and it has been widely reported by our \ncountry's two largest wire services--that Saudi Arabia was not \ncontacted by the Bush administration over OPEC's recent decision to cut \noil production by 1 million barrels per day. I was very troubled by \nthese comments by the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia. I want to read \nspecifically what the Saudi Foreign Minister said when he was asked \nwhether the United States had expressed its disappointment over OPEC's \ncut in oil production. The Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia said:\n\n       I didn't hear from the Bush administration. I'm hearing it \n     from you that they are disappointed.\n\n  This ought to be troubling to every Member of the Senate. Up and down \nthe west coast of the United States, our constituents are getting \nmugged by high gasoline prices. In community after community, citizens \nare paying more than $1.90 a gallon. The high driving season is just \nupon us, and escalating gasoline prices are going to be devastating to \nconsumers and to our economy overall. We all understand consumer \nspending is a major driver of our economy today, and it is going to be \nharder and harder to grow the economy and create private sector jobs if \nthese gasoline prices continue to skyrocket.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support \nthe resolution I have introduced urging that OPEC increase production. \nThe reason I am hopeful for bipartisan support is that this resolution, \nin terms of its substance, is identical to one introduced on February \n28, 2000, with our current Secretary of Energy, our friend, Spence \nAbraham, as one of the principal sponsors. Back then it was clear that \nour colleagues thought it was important, and we had a number of our \ncolleagues who serve today, our friend Senator Grassley, distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Santorum, and others, all of \nwhom said--and I share their view--that it is important for every \nadministration to put the heat on OPEC in order to protect our \nconsumers. It was important then to make it clear that it was the \nposition of the U.S. Senate that OPEC boost oil production, and it is \njust as clear now.\n  At the time that resolution was adopted in March 2000, a resolution \nsponsored by then-Senators Abraham and Ashcroft, oil prices were in the \n$25-per-barrel range with a high of $27 per barrel in February of 2000. \nIn recent weeks, oil prices have been in the range of $35 per barrel, \nspiking up to $38, a 13-year high, last month.\n  In 2000, then-candidate George W. Bush said it was important to put \npressure on OPEC to boost oil production. I certainly share his \nsentiments. Yet with the comments of the Saudi Foreign Minister last \nweek, it is clear that at best, there has not been a full court press \nin this administration on Saudi Arabia, on OPEC in order to increase \ngasoline production.\n  If ever there were an administration that had earned some bargaining \nchips to push Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, it is this \nadministration. After 9/11, there was an effort to help the Saudis, a \nnumber of them, leave our country. When there was concern about \ncharities and the role that charities had played in financing 9/11, it\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nwas difficult to get key Government documents declassified.\n  The fact is that Saudi Arabia keeps getting a free pass again and \nagain. On this issue with respect to oil production, if ever there were \nan administration that had some bargaining chips to play in trying to \nget OPEC and the Saudis to increase oil production, it is certainly \nthis administration. Now the Saudi Foreign Minister has said, just \nafter OPEC announced another million-barrel-per-day production cut, it \nwas not even contacted by the Bush administration to keep oil \nproduction high.\n  There are other troubling signs which have led me to introduce this \nresolution. When Secretary Powell was in Saudi Arabia about 2 weeks \nago, he also had a chance to talk about the oil crunch and how it is so \nharmful to the American consumer. The press release that came from the \nU.S. Information Agency--this is another document coming from our \nGovernment--indicated that the Secretary and the Crown Prince and \nForeign Minister talked about a number of subjects--terrorism, \ngovernmental reforms, a variety of issues--but not the question of oil \nprices and keeping oil production high.\n  I have said that OPEC is going to stand up for OPEC. Anybody who \nthinks OPEC is going to stand up for the American consumer thinks \nColonel Sanders is going to stand up for the chickens. OPEC is doing \nwhat they think is in their self-interest. If you think they are going \nto stand up for the consumer, it is a delusion; it is not going to \nhappen. But it is the job of our administration, just as it was in \n2000, to stick up for the consumer who is getting clobbered with these \ngasoline prices.\n\n  When the Saudi Foreign Minister says he hasn't even been contacted on \nthis question of boosting oil production, I say that is not good \nenough. That is not good enough, given the harm it has done to our \neconomy and our consumers by these gasoline price hikes. It is \ncertainly not good enough for the people of Oregon, where consistently \nwe have paid some of the highest gasoline prices in our country.\n  The American people are entitled to some answers. Certainly, they are \nentitled to an administration, just as they were in 2000, that does \nwhat then-Governor George W. Bush says was important, and that was to \npush OPEC, put the heat on OPEC, have a full court press on OPEC to \nincrease oil production. Instead, what we have learned from the Saudi \nForeign Minister in recent days is that the administration has \nessentially sat on its hands with respect to this oil production issue.\n  I will tell you, I think what is coming on this gasoline situation is \na perfect storm. The combination of the shenanigans by OPEC--the fact \nthat we are filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the wrong time, \nswiping oil from the private market, squirreling it away in the reserve \nat a time when we have enough for our national security needs; the fact \nthat the Federal Trade Commission is not following up on \nanticompetitive practices--are the factors that are going to come \ntogether for a perfect storm with respect to this gasoline issue.\n  I think it is critically important this Senate go on record on an \nissue we can do something about, just as we did in 2000 when we were \nled by a number of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in \nmaking an effort to boost oil production. We ought to do the same now \nand stand up for the American consumer.\n  I have introduced S. Res. 330, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Carper, Senator Graham of Florida, and Senator Daschle be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I also want to make sure our colleagues \nunderstand the timetable that is behind my resolution. On February 28, \n2000, then-Senators Ashcroft and Abraham introduced a resolution \ncalling on President Clinton to pressure OPEC to boost oil production \nbefore an OPEC meeting. That resolution passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent.\n  On June 22, 2000, then-candidate George Bush said:\n\n       I would hope the administration would convince our friends \n     at OPEC to open the spigots.\n\n  On February 10, 2004, our current Secretary of Energy said:\n\n       [It is] very clear we are not going to beg OPEC for oil.\n\n  On April 1 of this year, at a White House press briefing by Scott \nMcClellan, he said:\n\n       Let me just continue to reiterate that we remain actively \n     engaged in discussions with our friends at OPEC. . . . We \n     continue to make our view known. The President certainly \n     makes his views known when he meets with world leaders \n     and when he talks with world leaders. High-level \n     administration officials from Dr. Rice to Secretary Powell \n     to Secretary Abraham are always in close contact with \n     producers around the world to make our views known. And we \n     continue to do so.\n\n  But given that timeline, on April 1 of this year--just a few days \nago--the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia said he had not been \ncontacted by the Bush administration over OPEC's decision to cut crude \nproduction by 1 million barrels a day. The Saudi Foreign Minister said:\n\n       I didn't hear from the Bush administration. I am hearing it \n     from you that they are disappointed.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the Saudi Foreign Minister. We have to \nhave an administration that puts the heat on OPEC, that pushes them to \nincrease oil production and, just as the Senate said in 2000, we ought \nto say it in 2004.\n  So given what I have just outlined, I now ask unanimous consent that \nthe Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. Res. 330, a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the President should communicate to the members of OPEC and \nnon-OPEC countries that participate in the cartel of crude oil-\nproducing countries the position of the United States in favor of \nincreasing world crude oil supplies so as to achieve stable crude oil \nprices; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that \nthe resolution and the preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, all without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this \nresolution has recently gone to the committee. It needs to go through \nthe process. I certainly empathize with many of the things the Senator \nfrom Oregon has propounded. However, I must respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, what is troubling about the objection of \nour distinguished colleague from Texas is that this resolution is, in \nits substance, identical to the resolution that was offered by those on \nthe other side of the aisle in 2000. It is interesting that when I came \nto the floor first to discuss this resolution, the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, our friend Senator McConnell, said that \ncertainly if we applied a set of principles to the Clinton \nadministration, we can look at it as it relates to the Bush \nadministration. That is exactly what I am doing.\n  I will tell you, I listened to all of the arguments for the Bush \nadministration's position. We hear about ``quiet diplomacy,'' for \nexample. Maybe it is quiet diplomacy, but apparently the Bush \nadministration's brand of diplomacy was inaudible to the Saudi royal \nfamily. So I cannot understand why there would be an objection from the \nother side with respect to this resolution.\n  We have the Saudi Foreign Minister saying he had not been contacted \nby the Bush administration. I outlined the specific timeline of events \nbetween 2000 and 2004 that makes the case, in my view, why every Member \nof the Senate should want to support this resolution, which in terms of \nits substance is identical to the one passed in 2000. So I think it is \nvery unfortunate that there has been an objection. I note that there \nhas. I hope we will be able to take it up as expeditiously as possible.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for an answer to his question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, with all due respect, I do sympathize \nwith much of what the Senator from Oregon has said, and I am frustrated \nas well. But I think it is important that the Senator recognize we do \nhave a process; that this is 2004; it is not 2000; and it is not 2002.\n  Furthermore, I say to the Senator from Oregon that we have many ways\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nto increase the supply of oil in our country. Passing the Energy bill \nthat has already passed the Senate, that went to conference and was \nheld up by the Democratic side by two votes would give us the supply \nthat we need to lower the cost of fuel in our country. We have at our \ndisposal the capability to lower prices.\n  Mr. President, I think it is incumbent upon all of us not to just \nlook at the cartel that is OPEC, but to look at our own resources and \nto control our own resources. We have the capability to do that and we \nare not because of the obstructionism on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, the Energy bill would do absolutely \nnothing over the next few months to lower these gasoline prices. What \nwill help to lower the prices is passing this resolution and pushing \nOPEC to increase crude oil production. In fact, Republicans have even \nasked, with respect to the Energy bill, what it would do to gasoline \nprices. There is no evidence that it will lower prices.\n  This resolution does something in conjunction with making sure we \nstop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, making sure the Federal \nTrade Commission deals with these anticompetitive practices.\n  This resolution can make a difference by pushing OPEC to stand up for \nthe consumer. It was good enough in 2000 when a number of our \ncolleagues, led by current Secretary of Energy Abraham, said it made \nsense. I submit this is something, unlike the Energy bill, which can \nmake a difference for the gasoline consumers getting hosed at the pump \nright now.\n  For that reason, I think it is unfortunate my colleagues have \nobjected. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3873-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3873-S3874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on America's economic \nsecurity--rather, I should say America's economic insecurity at the \nmoment.\n  Before the Senator from Oregon leaves the floor, let me compliment \nhim on bringing up one of those issues that absolutely must be \naddressed, one of those issues that is squeezing middle-class \nAmericans: their gas prices--natural gas prices and gasoline prices.\n  The idea that we are unwilling, after we are committing so many \nresources to the Middle East, to try to bring stability and democracy \nin the Middle East and not use our diplomatic capital to accomplish \nwhat the Senator from Oregon is speaking about, to bring forth a \nresponse from OPEC, is just unfathomable. It is absolutely an abject \nfailure in the context of economic policy management and certainly on \ndiplomatic efforts.\n  I compliment the Senator for his efforts. I hope he will include me \nas a cosponsor of his resolution.\n  As I said, I wish to speak about America's economic security. We have \ncertainly heard in the last 48 to 72 hours a lot of celebration and \nvictory laps being taken with regard to 1 month's economic report on \nemployment in the United States.\n  All of us are pleased to see that jobs have been created in the \nUnited States. We are glad to see they finally met something that \nlooked like the expectations that have been talked about for the 38 \nmonths this administration's stewardship of the economy has been in \nplace. It is positive for those who have found jobs, but it is failing \nto take into account something that I think is very important in the \nreality of people's lives and something that is not being celebrated on \nthe ground among working men and women in the United States, and that \nis an incredible squeeze on moderate and middle-class families in this \ncountry across the board.\n  It is great to celebrate big-picture statistics, but the last time I \nchecked, statistics are not how people live their lives. The reality is \nwe have almost 8.5 million unemployed Americans. That number actually \ngrew last month by about 180,000. For those folks and for many people \nwho feel as if they are at the edge of whether their job will continue, \nthe situation is really quite serious. Those kitchen-table issues \nactually make a difference in people's lives.\n  I will be specific. Just last month, we closed the next to the last \nauto production facility in New Jersey. Mr. President, 1,500 \nmanufacturing jobs were eliminated in New Jersey. By the way, we have \none last plant, which is scheduled to close in May of 2005. Then we \nwill have the auto industry completely eliminated from the State of New \nJersey. We have already had the textile industry eliminated. We have \nseen AT and Lucent lose literally tens of thousands of jobs over the \nlast 2 to 2\\1/2\\ years in my home State.\n  When people lose in these contracting industries, we see a decline in \nthe real standard of living when people are reemployed. The statistics \nshow that the average loss, since the last recession, for people who \nlose jobs at $44,000 when they were working to their next job at \n$35,000 was 21-percent decline in their real earnings. That is what \nhappens when people are part of that growing job set but, \nunfortunately, they are losing their manufacturing jobs, they are \nlosing their white-collar jobs, and they are moving into service sector \njobs that are dramatically less valuable for their families and their \nown economic well-being. It is a big hurt, and I know it is a big hurt \non those folks I see and talk with in my home State.\n\n  Think about it: We have gone from 6.5 million unemployed to 8.4 \nmillion unemployed under this administration's stewardship of the \neconomy. When people get jobs--it is good we see job growth--they come \nback at a lower earning capacity than before.\n  That is not the only place we are getting hurt. For most middle- and \nmoderate-income families, they have to deal with trying to make ends \nmeet with regard to health care costs and tuition that goes on in their \nState and, as we just heard very eloquently expressed by Senator Wyden, \nincreasing gas prices. These are items for which real dough is coming \nout of people's pockets. We have gone from earning $44,000 a year on \njobs lost to $35,000 in jobs found, and we have income not keeping up \nwith the cost of medical care.\n  We have seen an almost 15-percent increase in medical costs for \nindividuals since 2001, while we are seeing less than 5 percent in real \nincome growth. That is a huge gap. By the way, at the same time, there \nwere 3.5 million, almost 4 million Americans who lost their insurance \nduring that period of time, so these costs are actually real. They are \ncoming right out of their pocketbooks. Those 3.5 million to 4 million \npeople are having to pay those costs, and that is why I talk about \neconomic insecurity. This is a reality in people's lives: lower income, \nhigher costs, and they are having to deal with that around the kitchen \ntables across America.\n  We might have one great number out of 38 months of economic \nstewardship as far as job creation, but I do not think it is \ntranslating into reality in people's lives.\n  Let me use another example: increasing tuition costs. There has been \na 14-percent increase in tuition costs last year alone. These numbers \nare up about 25 percent since the Bush administration came into office. \nWe have seen Pell grants go from about 42 percent to about 35 percent. \nIncome, relative to tuition costs for kids accessing the American \npromise through higher education, has just been a tragedy. We are \nseeing people not able to afford the kind of education that will allow \nthem to grow their income.\n  The difference between having a college education and a high school \neducation or high school dropout is a dramatic improvement in their \nreal earnings. We are seeing incredible pressure being put on middle-\nclass Americans in tuition, just as we are seeing in health care costs.\n  I could go through a whole laundry list of other expenses most \nAmericans have to meet and discuss around the kitchen table. Property \ntaxes in New Jersey have gone up 7 percent in the last 3 years. One of \nthe reasons is we in Washington keep putting mandates on them, and all \nthose mandates trickle down to the local level, the local\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\nschool board. They have to meet No Child Left Behind standards and \nIDEA, special education mandates, and the only way to meet those \nmandates is to raise property taxes. It is wonderful that we are \ncutting taxes in Washington, but they are going up dramatically in the \nState and local governments. It is a very substantial hit, particularly \nfor middle-class and moderate-income Americans.\n  Again, it is great that we saw 1 month of job growth, but what about \nthese trendlines with regard to college tuition?\n  What about the trendlines with regard to medical expenses? What about \nthe trendlines with regard to property taxes? Now we are seeing an \nexplosion in gasoline prices. I think that is why there is a sense of \neconomic insecurity among Americans.\n  It is great to take these victory laps and put all the spin that one \nwants to put on what is going on with regard to job growth, but it is \nnot matching reality in people's lives. It is not matching with those \n1,500 families who are losing their major wage earner at the Edison \nFord plant in New Jersey. That is happening across the country, and I \nthink it is a shame.\n  We will talk a little bit about the job deficit in a macro term. We \nlike to talk about 300,000 jobs grown in a month, but the fact is this \nis the only administration since Herbert Hoover that is actually going \nto be overseeing 4 years in office without having any job growth, \nunless there is a miracle that we have a job growth of 300,000 a month \nbetween now and next January.\n  There has been roughly 2.6 million jobs lost in the private sector, \n1.8 in the overall sector because somehow or another we seem to be \ngrowing Government for an administration that thinks Government is not \na good thing. Anyway, we are seeing job losses where we have not seen \nit before, all the way back to the Depression. No other President is \ngoing to have overseen an actual shrinkage of jobs. By the way, just \nfor comparison purposes, there were about 22 million jobs created in \nthe previous administration. So when the Democrat presumed Presidential \ncandidate talks about 10 million jobs, at least there is a record to \nrun on.\n  History will show that if we want to see job creation in this \ncountry, and we want to have balanced policies with regard to taxes and \nbudget deficits, then we have to make sure we are investing back in the \nAmerican people in a way that makes a difference.\n  We have seen these manufacturing jobs leave America, which has shown \na reduction in the quality of the jobs that are replacing them. We have \nseen a reduction in the number of jobs overall.\n  I think that to get so focused on 1 month's number in celebration is \na little bit like some of the other things we have seen that I think \nundermine the credibility of those who claim everything is so \nwonderful. There are credibility gaps on all kinds of issues, not only \nwith regard to jobs where there is a 7 million job deficit from the \neconomic report of the President of 2002, post-9/11, projecting there \nwere going to be 5.6 million jobs and there are actually 1.8 million \nless. That is a 7 million deficit relative to what was projected at \nthat point in time.\n  We have promised we would cut taxes without using Social Security \ntrust funds. Well, we used every penny of the Social Security trust \nfund to pay for both the tax cuts and the expenditures that we made in \nthe country.\n  The claim that any deficits would be small and short term, well, we \nall know they have not been small. There are record deficits right now, \n$500 billion-plus this year. People are talking about as much as $5.6 \ntrillion worth of deficits in the next 10 years. We are seeing a $10 \ntrillion swing in cashflow of the Federal Government in the 10 years \nthat encompass the President's timeframe and analysis. It is hard to \nbelieve $10 trillion. I have a hard time even figuring out what \ntrillion means, but it is a lot of money.\n\n  I know each American had $18,000 worth of Federal debt assigned to \nthem when this President came into office. It is $24,000 now and it \nwill be $35,000 at the end of the term. We are creating an enormous \namount of debt burden on every American as we go forward, and there is \na credibility problem. One cannot say they are a fiscal conservative, \nthat they are fiscally responsible, and have this kind of debtload laid \non the American people.\n  There are also other small issues such as the $140 billion miss with \nregard to the Medicare prescription drug plan. That is why people are \nfrustrated when they hear about the great news that we had great growth \nin jobs, which everybody is glad to see, but we do not see it tracking \nwith the reality of the other activities that are going on.\n  I wanted to make the point that while we are hearing all of this \ncelebration, all of this spinning about how good this is--and again it \nis good--there were 2.6 million private sector jobs lost, the worst \nrecord in history. The quality of the jobs that are replacing the ones \nthat are lost is substantially less in actual real earnings. Real \nmedian income earnings last year for the Nation were actually negative \nfor the first time in decades. Massive deficits are occurring at the \nvery same time. We are seeing all of these rising costs on health care, \ntuition, property taxes, and gas prices in this country.\n  I think there is a serious credibility problem. We need a new \nPresident who will put America first, rebuild our economy, and address \nthe real needs of the middle class and moderate-income elements of our \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Friday, April 9, will mark the 1-\nyear anniversary of the liberation of Iraq from the dictator Saddam \nHussein and his corrupt regime. It was April 9, 2003, that Iraqis \ncheered when Saddam Hussein's statue fell in Baghdad.\n  When we began Operation Iraqi Freedom and as our troops were marching \non Baghdad, we started the Senate every single day for at least 30 \nminutes talking about our troops, what they were doing, the successes \nthey had, and the heartrending problems they faced. We let them know \nthat not 1 day, not 1 hour, not 1 minute passed that we were not \nthinking of what they were doing for our country.\n  It is still the case today. Although Saddam Hussein's regime fell 1 \nyear ago today, we are still fighting with the spirit and the heart \nthat is personified by our troops on the ground in Iraq today.\n  At that time, we all talked about--and it was written in the \nnewspapers and talked about on television--that it did not seem like \nthat infamous Republican Guard had been there. We did not meet them on \nthe way to Baghdad. We did not meet them in Baghdad, at least it did \nnot seem like it. It seemed almost too easy.\n  This is one person's opinion, but this person believes that when \nhistory is written about this war, it will say that we are meeting the \nRepublican Guard right now, that they faded into the woodwork and they \nstrengthened their numbers and they are coming back. They have decided \nto make their last stand because we have a deadline of\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nJune 30 when we want the Iraqi people to take control of their \ngovernance, and we want the people to have a say. We set that deadline.\n  All of those who do not want freedom and democracy in Iraq, whether \nthey be people who want control inside Iraq or whether they are people \nfrom outside Iraq who want to control the Middle East and make sure \nthere is not a working democracy, all of those forces are now coming \ntogether against our coalition forces.\n  This is a very important time in our war on terrorism, and our hearts \nare with our troops on the ground. Our hearts are with their families \nright now.\n  Our hearts are with those brave civilians who have volunteered to go \nin to help stabilize the country of Iraq and to get an economy going \nthere. We know they paid the price from the horrendous pictures we saw \nlast week. Those volunteers who were trying to serve were not only \nmurdered in cold blood, but their bodies were defiled. We will never \nforget those pictures, and we will never forget the pictures we have \nbeen seeing day after day out of Iraq.\n  We are here today to say how much we appreciate what they are doing. \nWe are also here to say that every one of those who have died, they \nhave not died in vain because we are not going to walk away from this \nbattle. America will not cut and run and render those great losses \nmeaningless. We will not do it because we have a President who is \nwilling to stand firm in the face of adversity. Our President is \nsupported by troops who are every bit as committed and dedicated as he \nis to the cause.\n  This is a very important time. I think it is so important that we \nshould look at what is happening and make sure we are not doing \nanything which would hurt our cause while our troops are in harm's way.\n  I have to say I am troubled when I hear leaders say this is another \nVietnam. We have troops on the ground in harm's way. Is it really \nproductive for us to be labeling Iraq after 1 year as another Vietnam? \nIs it helpful to heap criticism on our President? Is it even helpful to \nbe dissecting what happened in the run-up on the war on terrorism that \nbegan on September 11, 2001? Is it helpful to be saying who is at fault \nfor bad information? Was it the Clinton administration or the Bush \nadministration? Or was it before that? Is that what we ought to be \ntalking about right now? I don't think so.\n  I think what we ought to be talking about right now is how we can \ncome together as a country and make sure everyone in America \nunderstands the importance of this cause; that we support our Commander \nin Chief, and that we support our troops on the ground.\n  I have been to Iraq. Mr. President, you have been to Iraq. Our \nCommander in Chief has been to Iraq. We know a little bit about what it \nis like. We don't know everything because we are not there when the \nbombs go off. We are not there when the missiles are launched. But we \nhave been there, and we know our troops are the best. They are \ncommitted. They are doing exactly what needs to be done to stabilize \nthis country.\n  It is not going to be easy. But the one thing we must all do is be \ncommitted to the proposition we can't fail, and dividing our country in \nhalf over who was responsible for faulty intelligence is one way we \ncould fail.\n  What we need to be doing is uniting our country. This is America's \nchallenge. This is our coalition's challenge, that we will stay the \ncourse. We will make sure a constitution is in place in Iraq so the \npeople who have been oppressed for so many years, so the girls in \nAfghanistan who have been abused and uneducated will have the chance \nfor lives all of us dream for our children to have, so the people in \nIraq who were raped, tortured, and mutilated by Saddam Hussein and his \nregime will no longer have to fear that kind of treatment because they \nwill be in control of their own destiny. We will be there with the \nsecurity to help them see this through.\n  What we need right now is a united country, not a country sniping at \nour President, whether it is on the Senate floor or out in the field.\n  My time is up. But I think it is not productive for us to be divisive \nat this point. We need to be united in support of our Commander in \nChief and our troops on the ground.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3875-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Texas noted we need a \nunited country. I want to briefly respond to my colleague from New \nJersey who talked about the economy before I talk about the situation \nin Iraq.\n  We had great news: 308,000 new jobs were created in March. Yet my \ncolleagues from across the aisle say, Great news, but; they talk about \nall the celebration, but; and all the spinning, but. But there is no \nspinning about 308,000 jobs. The spinning is in the light of good news \nat a time which we should celebrate.\n  Americans are worried and concerned about their economic future and \njob growth and opportunity. We have good news. Why can't we simply be \nunited? Why do we have to take the ``Chicken Little'' approach and say \n``the sky is falling, the sky is falling''? We have 308,000 new jobs, \nbut; Pell grants have risen, but; 308,000 jobs, but. We have challenges \nin Social Security; 308,000 jobs, but.\n  The reality is not only 308,000 jobs in March, but the Labor \nDepartment went back and recalculated the job growth in January and \nFebruary. What we have is 500,000 jobs over the last 3 months.\n  Why can't we come together for a moment and try not to create \ndarkness out of light? Why do we have to dim the hopes of the people of \nthis country? Confidence makes a difference. Our economy runs on \nconfidence. We should have confidence based on the facts, and based on \nall the evidence that has been there for many months about \nmanufacturing growth, investment, and about consumer spending, and now \nabout job growth. Why do we have to spin and twist and turn and create \ndark clouds for political purposes? I hope we can do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3875-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3875-S3877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with many mixed \nemotions and with a firm conviction. Foremost among these emotions is a \ndeep sympathy for the families who have lost loved ones during the \nrecent surge of violence in Iraq. I believe there were 32 deaths of our \nservicemen in the last 96 hours. We lost one brave marine over the \nweekend who is from Minnesota. My thoughts and prayers are with his \nfamily and with others.\n  America will forever be in the debt of the brave men and women who \nvolunteered. Every man and woman in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan is \na volunteer. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice. It is with a heavy \nheart I reflect on that. But my prayers are with them and my thoughts \nare with them. My admiration is with them, and the thanks of every \nMinnesotan and every American is with them for their sacrifice and \ntheir courage.\n  I am of the Jewish faith. We just celebrated the Passover tradition, \ncelebration and commemoration of Israel's deliverance from Egypt and \nfrom slavery almost 6,000 years ago. One of the things about that \nholiday is in that service we have a dinner which is a ritual dinner, \nand we celebrate. We thank God for deliverance. But in that service we \nalso talk about not only ourselves; it is not enough that God delivered \nus from slavery, but we need to exert ourselves in the deliverance of \nothers. I think that is more than a Jewish tradition. It is more than \nan American President. Our President reminded us it is a universal \nprinciple; that freedom is not America's gift to the world, but it is \nGod's gift.\n  This is also a solemn time to remember the genocide in Rwanda 10 \nyears ago when we as a Nation stood by and over 1 million people were \nslaughtered.\n  This is the anniversary of the fall of Baghdad for which the whole \ncivilized world should rejoice. It has been a year without new mass \ngraves being filled. A half million Iraqis were slaughtered by Saddam \nHussein, by the brutal tyrant. It has been a year in which the torture \nchambers and the rape rooms are now silent. It has been a year when the \nwealth of Iraq, a nation with millions of poor people, has not been \nplundered to sustain the obscene decadence\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nof a sadistic dictator and his maniacal sons. It has been a year that \nkids returned to school and teachers actually got paid, hospitals \nreopened, and food and water restored. It has been a year in which \nclear intent to threaten the region and the world has been stopped.\n\n  The violence in the last several days has been grievous, but it only \nstands to confirm the truth of what America has been committed to for \nthe last 3 years: the choice of this state for the uprising in terms \nthat we were battling the remnants of a regime we went there to \ndestroy.\n  The attacks in Spain a short time ago confirm our conviction that \nIraq is a battle in the global war on terror. Why else would terrorists \ntarget Spain, except to undermine our coalition?\n  Let us never forget that terrorism at its heart, at its evil heart, \nis a psychological war. It endeavors to break the spirit and the \nresolve of those it attacks by creating a lose-lose situation. It uses \ndeadly force. By using deadly force it creates a dilemma for its enemy. \nTo not respond validates those attacks. To respond in kind, they \nbelieve, will create further unrest and cause for the next round of \nattacks. Our resolve is what they are attacking. We must show them no \nhint of resignation.\n  I must say, I felt a great sense of remorse over comments made \nyesterday by Members of this body who raised the specter of Vietnam. I \nwill be direct: To raise the specter of Vietnam as 10 families learn of \nthe deaths of young sons is regrettable. To attribute a political \nmotive to the President's June 30 deadline to return control of Iraq is \nextreme. I know the target audience of these comments, but its \nunintended witnesses are those we fight against today in the global war \non terror.\n  Am I the only person struck by the absurd irony of the last week's \nnational debate? On the one hand, the President is being roundly \ncriticized by those claiming he failed to act aggressively prior to \nSeptember 11 and used only diplomatic efforts to combat terrorism. And, \nin almost the same breath, he is criticized for being far too \naggressive after September 11 and not relying upon diplomacy enough. So \nhe was supposed to be tougher on terror before the attack and easier \nafterwards? It is hypocrisy.\n  We have an all-sports radio station in the Twin Cities that pokes fun \nat itself by saying it is ``the home of the best second-guessing.'' I \ndon't think it can match this town of late. It is intellectually \ndishonest to look backwards with all the facts and judge the decisions \nthat were made with almost none of the facts, or the facts that existed \nhidden in the normal cloud of endless speculation of what might happen. \nTo compare perfect hindsight with imperfect foresight is unfair. The \nAmerican people understand that.\n  I have heard the story about a woman who wrote many letters of advice \nto President Lincoln during the Civil War, giving him direction she \nreceived in a prayer of who to attack and who to defend, which general \nto keep and which to fire. Lincoln replied something to the effect: \nDon't you find it curious that the Almighty gave you all the \nanswers and gave me the job?\n\n  It is easy to second-guess. It is easy to criticize, particularly in \na political season. But to lead is something altogether different. The \nleader must live in the real world of the price that might be paid for \nthe goal that has been set. Our young men and women are on the line \ntoday defending freedom, fighting terror. We are having discussion and \ndebate about an April 30 deadline. One can raise questions about the \nplan. We should discuss that. But to call it arbitrary and unilateral, \nknowing there is an expectation of the Iraqis that we need to turn over \npolitical power--not leave, not cut and run. We are still in Germany 50 \nyears later, in Kosovo, in South Korea, not to cut and run--hand over, \nget rid of the specter of occupation, which is what the international \ncommunity wants. Yet there are those today who will criticize that \nsecond-guessing because you need something to second-guess. It should \nnot work that way.\n  America awakened on September 11 to a harsh reality. After a decade \nof talking tough, diplomatic efforts, occasionally sending a cruise \nmissile to blow up a factory, or camp in the desert and hoping \nterrorism would go away, we were brutally attacked. Our good will, our \nlove of peace, and our broad oceans did not protect us. As much as some \nmay want to return to the illusory sense of security we had before \nSeptember 11, we cannot. Giving people false hope is the antithesis of \nleadership.\n  The prior judgment of those who attacked us was that America was \nweak, that we were corrupt, that we were divisible. The destruction of \nthe Taliban in Afghanistan was lesson No. 1. They were wrong. The \ninvasion of Iraq and the fall of Baghdad was lesson No. 2. The attempt \nto secure peace in Iraq is lesson No. 3.\n  The terrorists are making up their minds what we are made of. They \ntested the Spanish. They tested the British. They will test the \nRussians, the Poles, the Italians and every other nation that has been \nparticipating in the coalition and the multilateral effort to put Iraq \nback on its feet. No doubt they will test us. We will meet that test. \nWe will show resolve. We will not cut and run. Terrorism will be \ndefeated. Freedom will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I salute my colleague from Minnesota \nfor his strong leadership on this issue and his great insight into what \nis happening today in a very complex world.\n  As I listened to the news yesterday and today and read the newspapers \nthis morning, we are reminded again of several things. First, we are \nreminded of what a difficult and complex world it is in which we live. \nIt is a world where we who want to be a peaceful nation and see peace \nthroughout the world once again realize the type of peace we hope for \nand pray for may be a long and difficult road ahead.\n  We understand, also, from the standpoint of sacrifice, nothing comes \neasy. We are reminded once again that the freedom this Nation enjoys \ncame at great sacrifice. We are seeing sacrifices around the world \ntoday, particularly of our brave men and women who are fighting for the \nfreedom of the Iraqi people.\n  As I think about that and I think about what is going on in Iraq \ntoday and what is happening to an overwhelming majority of the Iraqi \npeople who want to see peace and who want stability in that country and \nthey are having to deal with a small number of insurgents who want to \ncarry the day by using guns and violence, it disturbs me when I hear \nstatements made by politicians in America, politicians who aspire to \nhigher office, as well as politicians who have been in the realm of \npolitics in our country for many years, statements that tend to incite \nthe opposition and to put our men and women in greater harm's way.\n  When I was coming along as a young man, I played a lot of athletics. \nI have had the privilege of coaching Little League basketball and \nbaseball for 25 years. When you play athletics or when you coach \nathletics, you want to be inspired as an athlete and as a coach. You \nwant to inspire the opposition. Frankly, the statements I have seen in \nthe last 24 hours relative to the comparison of Iraq to Vietnam are the \ntype of statements a coach would take and plaster on the locker room \nwall when he wants to charge up his team and he tells the opponents, \nLook what is happening on the other side. Morale is decaying. We are \nwinning.\n  That is simply the type of statement that is foolish and should never \nbe made by anyone in the political realm in our country in a time of \ngreat crisis and great confrontation over the issue of freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  America has long been the leader of the free world. But we did not \nget there in an easy way. Likewise, Iraq is not going to get there in \nan easy way. No one ever said it would be easy making a democracy out \nof a country the size of California, that has no democratic traditions, \nis divided sometimes by religious and ethnic disputes, and has a \nhistory of internal repression.\n  When I think about our great country and the fact that a little over \n225 years ago we declared our independence, what happened in our \ncountry when the citizens of America became free, it was not easy. We \nhad great loss of life in order to ensure that America became free and \nindependent. When we look at what has happened in America over the \ncourse of that 225-plus years, we have suffered great loss of life of \nbrave men and women who fought for a cause, a cause of freedom and a \ncause\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nof democracy, the simple cause of freedom that is being fought for in \nIraq today.\n\n  America is providing the kind of leadership the world respects and \nthe world has come to understand; that it is what America stands for. \nWhen Americans provide that kind of leadership, it is incumbent on all \nAmericans to rally around the leadership of this country in times of \ngreat crisis in the world, when we are the leader of the free world, \nand not to try to incite the other side, not try to create a more \ndifficult position for our brave men and women in the military, who \ntoday continue to be in harm's way and continue to suffer loss of life.\n  Speaking of that, I concur with my friend from Minnesota, our hearts \ngo out to the families of those brave men and women--all 600-plus--who \nhave suffered loss of life in Iraq as a result of their fight for the \ncause of freedom. In addition to that, we have a number of men and \nwomen who have been injured; and, again, it is for the right reason.\n  I had a great privilege about 2 weeks ago of visiting a number of \nmilitary bases in my State. One of the bases I visited was Fort Gordon, \nGA. At Fort Gordon, right outside of Augusta, we had a tour of the \nbase, the usual things that we do to see what is going on with respect \nto the missions at Fort Gordon. At the end of the day, I had the \nopportunity to participate in a very unique ceremony. It was a \nreenlistment ceremony, where 17 men and women were reenlisting in the \nU.S. Army.\n  Some of these men and women had been longtime members of the Armed \nForces; some had only been in for a couple of years, but they were re-\nupping. Some of them had been to Iraq. Some of them had seen their \nfellow soldiers fallen to the ground injured or killed. Yet here they \nwere raising their right hand and reenlisting in the U.S. Army.\n  I had the opportunity to visit with every single one of them, and for \nthe most part, I asked the same question to each of them; and that is, \nWhy are you doing this? Why are you reenlisting in the Army in these \ndifficult times? I felt so great, No. 1, just to be in the presence of \nthose true American heroes; but secondly, the response I got, in \nunison, from those individuals was that: I like my job. I enjoy what I \nam doing, and it is my opportunity to do something positive for \nAmerica.\n  The ones who had been in Iraq had a very high morale about what is \ngoing on over there because they are the ones who were on the ground \nevery day in Iraq. They know the feeling of the majority--the \noverwhelming majority--of the Iraqi people. They support the freedom \nand democracy that America is making the sacrifices for.\n  Some say this administration underestimated just how difficult and \ncomplex the job in Iraq would be. I will be honest, I have come to \nshare that view. I think the administration would agree with that. But \nI believe, therefore, we need to learn from our tactical mistakes, and \nto ensure that our posture in Iraq is flexible and can adapt to fluid \nand developing circumstances. If this means finding new ways to ensure \nShiite grievances are heard, so be it, as the cooperation of the Shiite \nmajority in the transition ahead is essential to that transition \nsuccess. But the CPA must also respond aggressively to aggression of \nany kind that is directed against our troops.\n  In talking about what we anticipated or what the administration \nexpected in Iraq, let's talk also about some of the things we did not \nexpect. We did not expect for clerics in that part of the world to come \nforward, and instead of preaching religion that you would expect them \nto be preaching, to be preaching and advocating hatred and violence \ntowards Americans--Americans, who had given them the opportunity to \nstand in that mosque and express the words they were expressing, \nbecause without the Americans taking down Saddam Hussein, they would \nnot have that freedom, they would not have the ability to carry out \ntheir disruptions and the violence that is ongoing over there today.\n\n  But removed from that, and behind the cloud of those robes of \nreligion, clerics are hiding, and they are also hiding behind innocent \nwomen and children and shielding themselves by use of innocent people \nfrom the Americans who seek to arrest and prosecute them for the crimes \nthey have carried out. Those are the types of things that no \nadministration could anticipate and no administration should have \nexpected when we freed the people of Iraq from the regime of Saddam \nHussein.\n  There is one other aspect of the situation in Iraq that is just as \npersonally, if not more personally, troubling to me; and that is the \nissue relative to our lack of intelligence gathering, the lack of the \nability to use human assets on the ground inside of Iraq, to make sure \nwe find out what is going on among these radical clerics who are \nadvocating violence; what is going on with respect to the terrorist \ncommunity and the terrorists themselves relative to attacks against \nAmericans; what is going on with respect to the long-term plans of \nthese terrorists as it applies to the American service people, as well \nas civilians who are on the ground in Iraq.\n  We are not doing the job of gathering intelligence that we need to be \ndoing. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I assure you, we are \ndoing our oversight. We are going to be critical where we need to be \ncritical because this is a phase of this war that must improve. We are \ngoing to do our job and make it improve so the people of Iraq will \nultimately be free, the world will be safer, and America will be a \nsafer country.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3877-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2207, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 2207) to improve women's \n     access to health care services, and the access of all \n     individuals to emergency and trauma care services, by \n     reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on \n     the delivery of such services.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next 2 hours \nshall be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we now return to the issue of how we make \nhealth care more affordable and accessible to the American people. This \nbill will try to reduce the liability, the insurance costs of doctors \nwho deliver babies and doctors who work in emergency rooms, making the \npractice of those different disciplines more attractive to doctors and \nallowing, therefore, especially women who are having children more \naccess to doctors. Especially in rural areas this is a huge problem \nbecause so many OB doctors have had to give up the practice of medicine \nbecause of the cost of their liability insurance. We return to that \nbill.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 633\n\n  But before we go on to that bill, I think it is important that we \naddress other legislation that could also significantly reduce the cost \nof health care in this country and improve its delivery. One such piece \nof legislation has been reported out of the committee which I have the \nprivilege to chair, which is the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. It was reported out unanimously--unanimously. It is the \npatient safety bill, and it basically is structured so that it does, \nfor example, make information as to how errors occur within the medical \nprofession more available within the medical profession so people in \nthe medical profession can learn from these errors.\n\n  Today, regrettably, if you have an experience of doing a procedure \ninappropriately, having a medication which is inappropriately applied, \nor having an operating room that may not be set up correctly, and as a \nresult errors result from that type of activity which lead to injury or \nproblems for patients, that information is kept very close. It is not \nmade available generally to the medical profession for the obvious \nreason that they will be sued.\n  What this bill does is essentially try to create a better atmosphere \nfor allowing that information to be shared\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nand, thus, reducing medical errors. We know, for example, that there is \na huge number of people in this country every year who are impacted by \nmedical errors and that there are 98,000 preventable deaths that occur \nas a result of medical errors. This information would significantly \nreduce those occurrences by allowing this information--the information \nof how these errors occur--to be shared within the medical community.\n  It would create a system for voluntary reporting of medical errors. \nIt would establish Federal evidentiary privilege and confidentiality \nprotections to promote the reporting of medical errors. It would \nproduce better procedures, interventions, and safety protocols for \neliminating errors and improving quality of care. It would permit \nsafety data to be shared and disseminated nationally so other \ncaregivers can learn from mistakes that have occurred without the fear \nof litigation.\n  It is excellent legislation, such strong legislation, in fact, that \nit was reported unanimously out of the committee which I have the \nprivilege to chair. Yet it has been stopped on the floor for reasons I \nfind difficult to understand. I know it has cleared our side of the \naisle, that the Republican membership is willing to move on it. In \nfact, we are willing to move on it by a voice vote on this side of the \naisle.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 633, the Patients Safety \nAct, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree with the chairman of the committee. \nThe committee has done a tremendously important job on this bill. It is \nsomething we need to do.\n  As indicated, this patient safety bill--I should say as indicated by \nthe chairman--is something that is so vitally important. There are news \narticles about the fact of patients not being treated properly. One of \nthe reasons is simply we don't have information from various \ninstitutions as to what has happened.\n  To make a long story short, we have a bill before us. There is an \namendment. We have had a couple of Members on our side who want to \nsimply look at the amendment. I am confident this is something that can \nbe done in the near future. I look forward to working with the chairman \nand the other members of the committee to make sure we can move this as \nquickly as possible. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would inquire of the assistant leader of \nthe Democratic membership if there is a timeframe when we could bring \nthis bill to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I will meet sometime or visit with the ranking member, \nSenator Kennedy, later today and try to get a timeframe. I think we can \ndo this fairly quickly.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be excellent. I appreciate the response of the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a unanimous consent request, \nwe have 10 minutes left on our side on the debate on the cloture \nmotion. I yield that final 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have the floor, correct?\n  Mr. REID. We are just giving our final 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois. Forty minutes to Senator Byrd, 10 to Mr. Dayton, and now we \nare giving 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. GREGG. At this time, I yield to the Senator from Nevada such time \nas he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the HELP Committee \nfor the work he has done to bring this legislation to the floor of the \nSenate, trying to get an up-or-down vote, or just trying to proceed to \ndebate this bill.\n  For those people around the country who do not understand the way the \nSenate works, we have to have 60 votes to proceed to the bill on \nreforming our medical liability system. We have to have 60 votes to go \nto the bill, to amend it, and then to vote it up or down. It is a shame \nthe Democratic side of the aisle is not even allowing us to have an up-\nor-down vote on this incredibly important legislation.\n  Today 19 States across the United States are in full-blown crisis, \naccording to the American Medical Association, regarding medical \nliability. Only six States are stable because of the reforms they have \nin place. OB/GYNs, emergency room physicians, and trauma doctors are \nthe hardest hit, but they are not the only ones. From 1982 to 1998, the \naverage premium for OB/GYNs rose 167 percent. In 2002, the average \npremium for emergency room physicians rose by 56 percent. In Las Vegas, \nOB/GYNs have seen a 300- to 400-percent increase in their premiums as \nof late. Three years ago they paid around $40,000 a year; now they pay \nupwards of $200,000 a year.\n  To help curb the cost, OB/GYNs are limiting the number of babies they \ndeliver, and some of them are no longer delivering babies at all and \nare only practicing gynecology. In fact, many of them are leaving our \nState altogether.\n  This crisis has now grown to affect our students in medical schools \nacross the country. Nevada is really suffering because it is the \nfastest growing State in the country. Medical students are now avoiding \nhigh-risk specialties. Nevada's school of medicine had the lowest \nnumber of students entering obstetrics it has had since 1999. That \nnumber has decreased every year since 2000.\n  Nationally, half of all medical students indicate the liability \ncrisis is a factor in their choice of specialty. For osteopathic \nstudents, the numbers are even worse. Eighty-two percent say cost and \navailability of insurance will influence their specialty choice. \nEighty-six percent say cost and availability of insurance will \ndetermine where in the country they practice. With doctors leaving \npractice and no more entering the field, patients are suffering and \nwill suffer more in the future.\n  Patients are what this debate is all about--not doctors or lawyers. \nPatients can't find access to care when they need it. For example, \nNevada's only level I trauma center closed for 10 days in 2002. The \ncenter serves trauma victims over 10,000 square miles--in Nevada, parts \nof California, Utah, and Arizona. In 2002, this trauma center cared for \n11,600 patients. Mainly, these patients suffer the most traumatic \ninjuries such as severe car accidents, knife and gunshot wounds, and \nbrain and spinal cord trauma.\n  This closure cost Jim Lawson his life on July 4, 2002. We have a \npicture of Jim. Jim lived in Las Vegas, and was just 1 month shy of his \n60th birthday. He had recently returned from visiting his daughter in \nCalifornia. When he returned, he was injured in a severe car accident. \nJim should have been taken to the university medical center's level I \ntrauma center, but it was closed. Instead, Jim was taken to another \nemergency room to be stabilized and transferred to Salt Lake City's \ntrauma center. Tragically, Jim never made it that far. He died that day \ndue to cardiac arrest caused by blunt force from physical trauma.\n  Why was Nevada's only level I trauma center closed? Simple fact: \nThere were not enough doctors available to provide care. There were not \nenough doctors because of skyrocketing medical liability premiums.\n  How do we know it was because of that reason? It is very simple. It \nreopened a week later when the State put the level I trauma center \nunder its umbrella coverage where the maximum the State could be sued \nfor is $50,000. The legislation we have before us caps non-economic \ndamages at much more--$250,000--but allows recovery of economic damages \nto be unlimited. Remember, economic damages are for lost wages, medical \nbills, etc.\n  We have cases in California, where a law is in place that is almost \nidentical to the legislation we are talking about today, where patients \nhave been awarded millions of dollars in compensation. It is the out-\nof-control jury awards across the country that are dramatically raising \nour premiums.\n  I want to emphasize again, the level one trauma center in Las Vegas \nwas reopened because the State of Nevada took it under its wing and \nsaid: We will protect any of the doctors who work there with a maximum \nliability coverage of $50,000 in damages.\n  Opponents on the other side argue that injured patients won't get \nwhat\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nthey need financially if malpractice occurs as determined by a jury. \nLet's remember that patients can recover damages in three different \nways under our bill, and in only one case, non-economic damages, are we \nplacing a distinct limit. Economic damages would be unlimited and \npunitive damages are available in the cases of gross malpractice. This \nbill would create strong medical liability reform where patients can \nactually get the kind of compensation they need and they can get it \nsooner because they can navigate through the courts much faster. \nUndoubtedly, the courts will work a lot more quickly because there \nwon't be so many frivolous cases clogging up the civil justice system.\n  The cases we hear about, whether it is in the trauma centers or \nbecause there are no OB/GYNs available, are tragic. It is the patients \nwho are being hurt every day. The other side says they are trying to \nstand up for the little guy--the little guy who gets hurt because of \nmedical malpractice. And we definitely should stand up for those people \nbecause there are some very tragic cases.\n  Without a doubt they deserve just compensation. Unfortunately, our \nsystem has swung out of balance. It is too easy to sue these days \nbecause the threat of a lawsuit and the cost of that lawsuit is so \nexorbitant that medical providers and their insurance companies often \nsettle out of court. It is an absolute fact that providers and their \ninsurers settle even in those cases they probably could win just \nbecause of the enormous expense and time.\n  Adding to this broken cycle are these so-called ``professional \nwitnesses,'' for lack of a better term. When I say professional \nwitnesses, I mean physicians who no longer are practicing. Some have \npracticed a little bit, but they all of a sudden become experts in \nfields they never practiced in. Our legislation says if someone is \ntestifying as an expert, they need to be an expert in the field they \nare testifying about. In other words, you don't want somebody who is a \nfamily doctor testifying in the case that involves a pediatric \nneurosurgeon. You want somebody who is a specialist in pediatric \nneurosurgery and knows about the ins and outs of that specific practice \nof medicine.\n  Again, this legislation would allow those people who actually have \nhad medical malpractice inflicted upon them to get through the court \nsystem faster, so maybe the ones who are truly hurt will get the \ncompensation before they die. For many today, because the courts are so \nclogged up, it takes 6 to 10 years to get through the court system, and \nmany of them die before they ever get compensation. Talk about a \ntragedy. So if people really want to stand up for the little guy and \nthey want to say I want to fight for the little guy--if they want to \nfight for the person who actually gets hurt, let's pass legislation \nthat allows the cases to get through the courts in a much more \nexpeditious fashion.\n  Another benefit of this bill is most, if not all, of the reforms it \ncontains will help lower the cost of health insurance in this country \nfor everybody, so hopefully we will have more people with health \ninsurance. If the costs are lower, more people can afford it, and we \nwill have fewer uninsured in this country.\n  How many more doctors do we have to lose in Nevada and other States? \nDo we really want people who are not as qualified to go into some of \nthese specialties? Do we want to start scraping the bottom of the \nbarrel, or do we want the best and the brightest to go into these \nspecialty fields? They always have in the past. Now they look out there \nand say, you know what, I am not going to be able to afford to \npractice. Why would the best and the brightest go into it when they \nsay, I am going to go to 4 years undergraduate, 4 years medical school, \nand then I am going to do anywhere from 3 to 8 years, depending on the \npostgraduate training that is required in the specialty field, before I \nstart making decent money. What people don't realize is even after \nthese students graduate from medical school, they might make $30,000 to \n$40,000 doing ``slave labor,'' working 100 hours a week, while they are \nlearning their particular field of study.\n  We want the best people who are willing to sacrifice all of those \nyears and all of those hours of hard work to be able to go into those \nfields. At the end, yes, they should be rewarded economically, just as \nanyone who works hard toward entering a specific field of work. But \nmany of them will not do it for the simple fact they are not going to \nbe able to afford the medical liability premiums. That is why it is so \ncritical we pass medical liability reform.\n  Today, we have before us a bill we have limited to provide relief to \ntwo specialties. It only covers OB/GYNs and professionals involved in \nthe practice of emergency medicine and/or trauma medicine. We have \nlimited it to highlight two of the most high-risk and the most severely \naffected areas in our health care system today.\n  If you don't like portions of the bill and want to change it, fine. \nLet's have a healthy debate and amend the bill. Let's take amendments \none at a time and amend the bill and then come out with a product that \nwill actually fix the problems we have in this country. Right now the \nother side, the Democratic side of the aisle--it almost boggles my mind \nsome of the points they argue against this bill--but they won't even \nlet us have the bill brought to the floor where it can be amended. They \nwon't let us have a fair debate where we can amend this bill. Sadly, \nthey are obstructionists on so many pieces of legislation this year. \nBut at least on the other pieces of legislation that they are \nobstructing they are not costing lives. On this legislation, they are \ncosting lives. Unfortunately, more and more lives will be lost in the \nfuture. When there are not enough doctors to treat patients, it costs \nlives.\n  The providers covered in this bill--OBGYNs, ER and trauma doctors--if \nthey are not available to care for patients, people are going to die. \nPeople are going to end up in a situation like Jim Lawson's who, as we \nshowed earlier, needed the kind of specialty care only a trauma center \ncan provide. Right now, the doctors are not there to be able to give \nthe patients the kind of care they need. We have to ask ourselves, what \nif it were one of our loved ones--not ourselves, but one of our loved \nones? For instance, down in Florida, Dr. Frank Schwerin's son was \ninjured. He is an internist. His son is a 4-year-old named Craig. Craig \nstruck his head on the side of a swimming pool. Within minutes, he \nbecame lethargic and began to vomit. He was rushed to North Collier \nemergency room. The ER physician paged the neurosurgeon on call. \nUnfortunately, neurosurgeons in Collier County were not able to treat \npediatric patients because they were too high risk. The nearest \npediatric neurosurgeon was 150 miles away. In neurological trauma, \nevery minute counts. After an hour or so of receiving what care he \ncould, Craig was eventually stabilized. But not every child is that \nlucky. No parent should have to go through that wondering, does my \nchild have the best care they can get, simply because the specialist \nleft their area because the medical liability premiums were too \nexpensive. I cannot tell you how many doctors who are in this \nsituation. By the way, it is not only doctors. We are also talking \nnurse-midwives, EMTs, emergency and fire personnel, you name it. \nThroughout the health care provider system, people are affected by the \nout-of-control medical liability costs. But the physicians I have \ntalked to, anecdotally, in story after story, say people were sued for \nthe first time in their life in a case they may have had very little to \ndo with. They walked in, gave only a consultation to another physician \nwho was the primary doctor on the case, and then they are sued because \nmalpractice was committed somewhere down the line by someone else on \nthe case. Even though it had nothing to do with them, they now have to \nspend literally thousands of dollars defending themselves.\n  The system is broken. It is out of control. Our system of justice \nswings like a pendulum. Right now, it has swung too far in one way--in \nthe trial lawyer's favor. We have to bring it back in favor of the \npatients. The patients need to come first. That is what we are talking \nabout today in this legislation--putting patients first instead of \ntrial lawyers.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with this. I want to talk about the \nStates that have enacted reforms versus the States that have not. I \nwish to give a couple of examples to put this in dollar terms so people \ncan get their arms around it.\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\n  This chart explains it very clearly. First of all, this is an example \nof internal medicine, general surgery, and OB/GYN. I will focus on the \nOB/GYNs to keep it simple because they are affected directly by this \nlegislation.\n  L.A., Denver, New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Miami are listed on \nthis chart. The population shares are relatively similar. This shows \nthe medical liability premiums in the various cities. This is a 2002 \nsurvey. Mind you, the cities with the problems are in much worse shape \nin 2004 than they were in 2002.\n  An OB/GYN pays about $55,000 a year in L.A., and around $31,000 a \nyear in Denver. California and Colorado are two States that have had \ngood medical liability reforms passed at the State level, and these \nreforms have been in place for several years. If we go to New York, Las \nVegas, Chicago, or Miami--take your pick--none of these States have \ngood medical liability reform passed. In New York, they are paying \n$90,000; $108,000 in Las Vegas. That number is way low. At a minimum it \nis $140,000. Chicago, $102,000, and Miami is over $200,000 a year. That \nis why doctors are leaving their practices.\n  One can say doctors make so much money that they can afford this. The \naverage OB/GYN in Las Vegas makes around $200,000 a year. When $108,000 \nis going for medical liability coverage, you can see there is not very \nmuch left for the provider. You raise this up to $140,000, $150,000, \n$160,000, as many are now experiencing in my state, and there is not a \nlot of room left. I would also mention that with the way these doctors \nare getting paid at fixed rates, through managed care, Medicaid, and \nthe like, there is not a lot of room left to afford rising premium \nrates. The fact is they are leaving the practice or they are limiting \nthe amount of babies they deliver simply because they cannot afford to \ndeliver babies. In the fastest growing cities and metro areas, that is \nunacceptable.\n  This chart shows California versus U.S. premiums from 1976 to 2000. \nCalifornia has the model legislation we all look at. These are the \npremiums. This is California, the blue line, which is very stable. \nThere has been an increase of about 167 percent over that time, a \nlittle more than inflation, but pretty close. Look at it for the rest \nof the country: 505 percent.\n  Is medical liability reform working in California? I think the answer \nis pretty obvious that it is. We need a national solution. We need to \nsay to the trial lawyers: Listen, we respect the fact you went to law \nschool and you want to make a lot of money, but I think the system has \nbeen abused enough. It is time to put the patients first.\n  Let's vote for cloture today. Let's get the 60 votes needed to at \nleast go to debate on the bill. And if my colleagues do not like the \nprovisions of the bill, let's amend it. Let's have up-or-down votes on \namendments. Let's get to final passage where we can actually correct \nwhat is wrong with the health care system in the United States by \neliminating abusive lawsuits, outrageous and unwarranted jury awards, \nand out-of-control medical liability premiums.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3880-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3880-S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 \nminutes already allocated to me be increased to 20 minutes and include \nthe time previously allocated to Senator Dayton of Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nyielding me the 10 minutes so I might speak to this important issue \nthis morning. I thank the Senator from Nevada for illustrating to us a \nserious challenge that faces America. There is no doubt in my mind, nor \nin the minds of those who studied this issue nationwide, that we need \nto do something as a nation to deal with medical malpractice liability.\n  It is clear that in many parts of our country, in many parts of my \nState, the cost of medical malpractice insurance has gone up \ndramatically, to the point that some doctors are moving to other States \nand some are retiring. That is a reality. It is a reality in Illinois. \nIt is a reality in other States. I believe we need to do what is \nnecessary on a bipartisan basis to grapple with this issue.\n  Although it will be the first time in history the Federal Government \nwould take on the question of civil procedure and medical malpractice \ncases in States, frankly, it may be the only way to approach it. So I \nagree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that inaction \non our part will only make this problem worse. We need to move forward. \nBut I come today to tell you the bill before us, S. 2207, is not the \nright approach.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look at this \nbill carefully. I hope they will view, as I do, this bill as an honest \nattempt to identify a problem but a very inadequate attempt to solve \nit.\n  Let me say at the outset that a lot has been said about emergency \nrooms, which are covered by this bill. Some has been said about OB/GYNs \ndelivering babies, and that is covered by this bill. But the sponsors \nof this bill have not mentioned the fact that it also exempts from full \nliability drug companies, medical product manufacturers, insurance \ncompanies, those who make vaccines that cause problems for children. \nThey are also included in this bill.\n  So much has been argued about the doctors in the emergency rooms, but \nthe full scope of the bill has not been described, at least as long as \nI have been on the floor.\n  Let me tell you what I think is wrong with this bill. Here is what \nthe bill says: The bill says in cities and communities across America \nwhere we rely on a jury of your neighbors and friends to come together \nand decide what is fair and what is just, when it comes to those \nlawsuits involving injuries, coming out of, for example, an emergency \nroom treatment, no longer will a local jury decide. The case will be \ndecided on the floor of the Senate. One hundred Senators will decide \ntoday with this bill that regardless of what happens to you or your \nchild when you go to an emergency room for treatment, regardless of the \npossibility that you brought your child in as an innocent victim \nseeking medical care at an emergency room, and that child, the love of \nyour life, became the victim of medical malpractice, regardless of the \ncircumstances, we will decide on the floor of the Senate, if that child \nis facing a lifetime of disability, a lifetime of disfigurement, a \nlifetime of pain and suffering, we, the jury of the Senate, will decide \nit will never be worth more than $250,000 for the pain and suffering, \nfor the disfigurement, for the incapacity they will face. That is what \nthe bill says.\n  When you look at it you think, why? Why would we decide that \nregardless of the lawsuit, someone could never receive more than \n$250,000 for pain and suffering, for noneconomic losses? The argument \nis, unless we put a cap on the possible recovery in a lawsuit, \nmalpractice premiums will continue to rise and doctors will not be able \nto afford them. That is the premise. That is the argument of this bill.\n  So the first thing I would like to do is question that premise. Let's \nlook at the facts.\n  Here we have OB/GYN insurance premiums in States with caps, with \nlimitations on the amount a jury can award, and without caps. In \nCalifornia, with caps of $250,000, called for in this bill, we see a \n54-percent increase in the year 2003 in medical malpractice premiums; \nOregon, with no caps, 0 percent increase; California, a 15-percent \nincrease versus the State of Washington, 0 percent; Colorado, a 29-\npercent increase where they have caps and limitations on jury verdicts, \nand in Georgia with no caps, a 10-percent increase; New Mexico, with \ncaps on how much the jury can award, a 52-percent increase in \nmalpractice premiums; Arizona, right next door with no caps, no \nlimitations, only a 14-percent increase.\n  So the argument that caps will bring down premiums is illustrated \nhere to just be wrong. The premise is wrong. The argument is wrong.\n  Take a look at the premiums and what has happened in States without \ncaps between 1991 and 2002 and those with limitations on jury verdicts.\n  Arizona in this period of time of 10 or 11 years, 3-percent increase; \nNew York,\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\n6 percent; Georgia, 8 percent; Washington, 27 percent. These are States \nwithout caps. Then take a look at the States with caps, with \nlimitations on jury awards, 50-percent increase in California; 60 \npercent in Kansas; 82 percent in Utah; 84 percent in Louisiana. The \nargument is made--and I heard it on the floor this morning--that it is \nbecause so much is being paid out in terms of verdicts, and that is why \npremiums have gone up.\n  There is little or no correlation between the amounts that are paid \nout in verdicts and settlements and what happens to premiums. One would \nthink there would be a direct correlation, but look at this situation. \nThe State of Hawaii, a 527-percent increase in 10 years in the amount \npaid out in medical malpractice suits, a 10-percent increase in \npremiums; Iowa, a 87-percent increase in payouts, a 12-percent decline \nin the premiums charged. The case is illustrated and goes on.\n  The point I wish to make is if the premise of this law is \nestablishing caps will bring down malpractice premiums these two things \nwe can be sure of: There is no evidence to support it in many of the \nStates with the strictest caps and, secondly, if there is any benefit \nto be realized by establishing caps it will be years before it is \nrealized. That just reflects the fact that lawsuits filed for \nmalpractice are filed years after the event occurred. Frankly, if there \nis any benefit to be realized, doctors and hospitals today will not see \nit for a long time.\n  The second thing that I think cries out to be said when it comes to \ncapping what a jury can award in a case involving medical malpractice \nis the fundamental injustice involved in this. Here we have to go \nbeyond the theoretical, beyond the statistical, to the real world of \nwhat happens when people show up at emergency rooms for treatment.\n  This is a beautiful young girl, Shay Maurin, from Hartford, WI. She \nwas the victim of medical malpractice. On March 5, 1997, her mother \ntook her 5-year-old daughter Shay to a local clinic because she thought \nsomething was wrong. She was not sure what it was. The physician's \nassistants at the clinic thought Shay might have diabetes but did not \nperform any tests.\n  The mother then took her daughter to the emergency room, where she \ntold the emergency room doctor that the clinic thought this little girl \nmight have diabetes and maybe that was why she was sick. She was 5 \nyears old.\n  Although her daughter was exhibiting signs and symptoms of diabetes, \nthe emergency room did not administer the standard finger-stick test, \nthe basic test that people suffering from diabetes go through regularly \nto monitor their blood insulin. Instead, this little girl and her \nmother were sent home from the emergency room.\n  This little girl died of diabetic ketoacidosis the following \nafternoon. That occurs when a person who has diabetes is not treated \nwith insulin. The body's blood sugar builds up to extremely high \nlevels. The body cannot metabolize what the person eats. The body \nbecomes severely dehydrated. Acid buildup occurs, leading to swelling \nof the brain and death.\n  The emergency room which failed to administer the most basic test, \nafter being told by the mother that they suspected she was suffering \nfrom diabetes, was found 88-percent responsible for her death and the \nclinic 12-percent responsible. If we pass this bill, we have decided \nthat the jury of the Senate would say to this little girl's family: The \nmaximum you can recover for the losses and pain and suffering for this \nlittle girl is $250,000.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues a story of another young girl. This \nbeautiful little girl is Lauren Meza. On January 2, 2000, Jennifer Meza \ntook her 2\\1/2\\-year-old daughter Lauren to the emergency room at the \nrecommendation of her pediatrician.\n  The baby's symptoms indicated that she may have had pneumonia. The \nchild's father was being hospitalized for pneumonia at the time she \ndeveloped the symptoms. The emergency room doctor refused to perform \nany tests, insisting to Ms. Meza that her daughter would be fine and \nshe should go back home.\n  Two days later, Ms. Meza brought Lauren back to the pediatrician, who \nwas alarmed at her deteriorating condition. The doctor determined she \nneeded immediate emergency care and she was airlifted to another \nhospital where she was treated for a condition that left her body \nunable to expel toxic agents and waste products, forcing them into her \nbloodstream. As a result of the emergency room doctor's denial of care, \nshe is facing dialysis and a kidney transplant before she turns 10 \nyears of age.\n  What this bill says is that this little girl, Lauren Maza, facing a \nlifetime of dialysis and ultimately a kidney transplant, would never be \nallowed more than $250,000 for any pain and suffering which she \nsustained because of the clear negligence of the emergency room doctor.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about a case that involves a person who is \nsomewhat older but illustrates this point again. On January 22, 2000, \nBarbara Jackson complained of chest pains. Her coworkers thought she \nmight have had a heart attack. They called an ambulance. She is from \nMelrose Park, IL. The ambulance driver suspected a heart attack, but \nthe emergency room personnel waited nearly an hour to do an EKG. More \negregiously, they gave her drugs that actually precipitated the heart \nattack. The attack was so serious this woman lapsed into a coma. She is \nnow in a vegetative state living with her sister who cares for her \nevery single minute of every day.\n  Her family believes she is capable of feeling pain. Proper medical \ntreatment, nursing treatment, and rehabilitation will cost more than \n$20 million if she lives to full life expectancy, which her doctors \nexpect.\n  A mistake made in an emergency room, a woman in a vegetative state \nfor the rest of her time on Earth, and the jury of the U.S. Senate has \nreached a verdict. For pain and suffering, in Barbara Jackson's case, \nno more than $250,000.\n  Not only do caps not work to bring down malpractice premiums in case \nafter case, they are fundamentally unjust and unfair. There has to be a \nbetter way. We have to deal with a standard that will bring down \nmalpractice premiums but not at the cost of fairness and justice.\n  It is a simple fact of life, and one which I wish were not the case, \nthat more and more medical errors are being committed. We cannot expect \ndoctors and hospitals to be perfect. They are human. There are times, \nunfortunately, when they are negligent, when they do not meet the \nstandard of care which we can expect of every physician and \nevery medical provider. In those instances, they should be held \naccountable, as all of us are held accountable for our wrongdoing.\n\n  That accountability means they should be held responsible for the \nreal problems they create, the damages that are created by their \nmisconduct.\n  We have had so many surveys of hospitals. A study recently found that \ninjuries in U.S. hospitals in the year 2000 resulted in 32,600 deaths. \nSome have estimated some 98,000 people die each year from malpractice. \nOnly a small percentage of these cases ever end up in a lawsuit, ever \nend up in a trial.\n  We need to address this issue at three levels. First, let us make the \npractice of medicine safer, and we can do that. Secondly, let us deal \nwith tort reform. I have told my friends who are trial lawyers--and I \npracticed law myself before I came to the Senate--we have to step up to \nand accept responsibility for change that will reduce the number of \nfrivolous lawsuits and give those truly deserving their day in court. \nThird, insurance companies have to be held accountable for their \nmisconduct. If they are gouging, if they are overpricing, then we, as a \ngovernment, need to stand up to that industry as well.\n  Three parts: Reducing medical errors, tort reform, and insurance \nreform are the way to approach it. I say to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, join me in a bipartisan effort now to go beyond this \nissue of caps, which will not solve the problem, caps that are \nfundamentally unfair, and let us talk about real solutions.\n  Think about this bill that is before us for a moment. This bill says \nthat if one is brought to an emergency room because they were in \nserious trouble and medical conditions are such that warrant it, they \nwill be limited in how much money one can recover if they are an \ninnocent victim of medical malpractice. However, if one is admitted to\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\nthe hospital, through the front door and not the emergency room, these \nlimitations would not apply.\n  Think of it as well from the OB/GYN point of view. It is true that \nOB/GYN premiums have gone up astronomically in some areas, and we have \nto zero in on that, but we are saying someone who is a victim of \nmalpractice by an obstetrician gynecologist will have a limitation on \nhow much they can recover while someone else in the same hospital being \noperated on by a doctor with a different specialty will not be subject \nto these limitations. That is just fundamentally unfair.\n  I think what we need to do is open the door for conversation, but \nfirst we need to close the door on this concept. This is not the right \napproach.\n  I have met over the last several months with scores of doctors and \nhospital administrators in my State, and I say to them in all \nseriousness and sincerity that we have a problem in Illinois, as well \nas a national problem.\n  I have invited Members to come to the table after this legislation is \ndefeated today and sit down in an honest, bipartisan fashion to look \nfor solutions that will solve this problem. I believe we can find it.\n  The Senator from South Carolina who is presiding has joined me in \nbipartisan legislation that really tries to approach this from a new \ninnovative, creative, and positive point of view that does work. I \nthink we can achieve that goal. But to achieve it we need to bring the \nmedical professionals into the room along with those who are \nrepresenting the victims of medical malpractice. Once that conversation \ntakes place, if it takes place in good faith, I am confident we can \ncome up with solutions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion for cloture on \nproceeding to this bill. It has not been subjected to hearings. It \nincludes things which were not talked about on the floor--protection \nfor insurance companies, protection for pharmaceutical companies and \nmedical device manufacturers. Let us get down to the business of trying \nto solve this problem and doing it in a fashion that is reasonable and \neffective and bipartisan.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think we are actually making progress. I \nam delighted to hear the Senator from Illinois agree with what it \nsounded like the minority leader stated earlier, that they have some \nproblems with this bill as written, and they acknowledge the problem of \nmedical liability crisis exists and suggest we ought to try to find \nsome way to address that crisis which they concede is very real.\n  Senator Durbin said it is not the right approach. My question would \nbe, Well, what is the right approach? Senator Daschle said there is no \nreason to differentiate between those who walk in the front door of a \nhospital and those who get emergency care. I will concede the good \nfaith of that question. The problem is we offered that bill earlier and \nwere unsuccessful in getting cloture so we could actually get to the \nmerits of the bill and debate it. Of course, not until we get to that \n60-vote hurdle where we can actually move the bill on to the floor can \nthe bill be amended. Indeed, that is how the Senate does its work. But \nI wonder whether it is the intention of our friends on the other side \nof the aisle to have a good-faith debate about how to solve this \nproblem.\n  For example, rather than take what I consider to be the constructive \napproach the Senator from Illinois and the Senate minority leader have \ntaken to criticize the content of the bill but to acknowledge we have a \nproblem so perhaps we can then get to a solution of that problem, the \nthe ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee called it a \npartisan approach and then criticized the Senate leadership. He said, \nIn my 29 years here in the Senate I have never seen so little \naccomplished.\n  I think the reason why we are not accomplishing any reform or any \nreal solution to what is a very real problem is because our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle simply won't let us call the bill up, \nhave a debate, consider amendments, and try to solve what is a very \nreal crisis in this country.\n\n  Even though we are calling this a medical liability reform bill, this \nis not something we are doing out of the goodness of our hearts for the \nmedical profession. While I respect members of the medical profession \nwho dedicate their lives to curing illness and addressing medical \nneeds, as well as health care providers who run hospitals and a whole \nhost of other allied health care facilities, that is not what drives me \nto see the need for this bill. The reason I think this bill needs to be \npassed, or some version of it after amendment if the Senate reaches \nconsensus on a solution to the problem, is because I know everyone \nwithin the sound of my voice and literally everyone across the country \nwho is alive today will at some point in their lives be a patient. They \nwill need access to good quality health care.\n  What is happening today in this country because of this medical \nliability crisis is denying patients--that is the American people--\naccess to health care they need in order to lead a good quality of life \nand in order to enjoy life for themselves and their children and their \nother loved ones.\n  I want to comment briefly on a suggestion I have heard from our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. They said that with this \nparticular solution--that is a cap of $250,000 on non-economic \ndamages--people walk away with nothing when they go to court. The truth \nis, in California, which has a medical liability reform law very \nsimilar to what we are proposing here today, economic damages, \nincluding medical expenses, are compensated completely. Indeed, in \nDecember of 2002, in Alameda County, there was an $84 million award to \na 5-year-old boy who has cerebral palsy and is a quadriplegic because \nof delayed treatment of jaundice after birth. That would only be \npossible because what is actually being compensated there is the very \nreal economic loss suffered as a result of that horrendous injury, \nsomething we all regret.\n  The suggestion we are going to turn people out of court with nothing \nto show for it and we are not going to compensate people for their \ninjuries received in the medical context caused by the fault of another \nis not true. I wonder how anyone can stand up and suggest we are \nsomehow trying to deny people a remedy. That is certainly not the case.\n  We know this kind of law will have a positive impact. Even in the \nState of Texas, which I represent, where we passed not a $250,000 cap \nbut indeed a higher cap on non-economic damages last September, we have \nseen one medical liability insurance company reduce its rates by 12 \npercent across the board, sort of a start. Another medical liability \ninsurance carrier has cancelled an anticipated 19-percent increase. \nObviously, we will see how this all plays out, but we already know it \nhas a very real and positive impact as demonstrated by the evidence.\n  I see the Senator from Virginia and I want to make sure he has all \nthe time he needs to speak. But I want to also comment on the effect of \nhigh medical liability insurance rates on the cost of health care and \non the pressure being put on employers and others who provide health \ninsurance to their employees to drop their employees from any sort of \nhealth coverage, exacerbating the crisis we have in this country of too \nmany people who do not have access to health insurance and the fact we \nhave many emergency rooms put on divert status with patients being \nredirected elsewhere in true emergencies because people who do not have \nhealth insurance have nowhere else to turn if they don't have money. \nThey know they can be treated in an emergency room. They know they \ncan't be turned away. But the fact is about 80 percent of the people \nwho go to emergency rooms are being treated for medical conditions that \ncould be treated in a clinic or a doctor's office much more cheaply, \nmore humanely, and in a way that would help us address this crisis in \naccess to good quality health care.\n  Finally, I know we have heard a lot of discussion on the floor of the \nSenate, as we should, about the concern of every person in this country \nwho wants to work to find a good job so they can provide for themselves \nand their family. But the cost of health care in this country is \nkilling our recovery. It is doing so from the standpoint of putting \nincreased financial burdens on employers who want to provide health \ninsurance to their employees but simply are\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\nnot able to add new positions in their company because they know that \nin addition to salary they are going to have to pay benefits, including \nhealth care costs in many instances, and they are simply priced out of \nthe market.\n  If our colleagues on the floor of the Senate want to do something \nabout improving access to good quality health care, if they want to do \nsomething about the fact many people don't have health insurance and \nneed health care coverage, if they want to do something about America's \ncompetitiveness in this global economy, and make sure we keep more jobs \nin this country rather than see them go to China, India, or anywhere \nelse, they should vote to let this bill come forward and have a debate \nabout what this bill ought to look like to address the medical \nliability crisis that even the Senator from Illinois and the minority \nleader admit we have in this country today.\n\n  I implore Members to reconsider their obstruction. By obstructing \nprogress on this vote we are not solving any problems. People are maybe \nmaking political points, but it is hard to see what kind of political \npoint you make by obstructing good, commonsense legislation like this. \nI implore them to reconsider their obstruction and ask that they vote \nfor cloture so we can move on and begin to solve this very real problem \non behalf of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I commend our distinguished colleague \nfrom Texas. He spoke from the heart on this measure. It is a matter of \nutmost seriousness.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be made a cosponsor on this pending \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise again to join the Senator from \nTexas and many other Members on this side of the aisle in strong \nsupport of health care liability reform.\n  My father was a medical doctor. He was an obstetrician. I am grateful \nto so many doctors from whom I am hearing all across America about this \ncrisis. My father had no great interest in politics. He voted \nregularly; I remember that. I think most physicians find little time to \ninvolve themselves in politics. But this is a political question. We \nhave to look at it fair and square and call it as it is.\n  America is crying out from every corner of our land, from all 50 \nStates, for relief from the oppressive number of lawsuits brought \nagainst the medical profession, a profession that is not interested in \npolitics. They are only interested in caring for the citizens of this \nNation.\n  I am proud to stand with the distinguished majority leader, Mr. \nFrist, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from \nTexas, the Senator from Nevada, and others, time and time again in this \nSenate to urge this body to rise above politics and extend a helping \nhand to the medical profession.\n  Early this year, I was pleased to offer my own amendment on health \ncare liability reform. My amendment was called the Protect the Practice \nof Medicine Act, amendment No. 2624, but procedural impediments--I have \nto recognize we follow the rules around here--prevented the Senate from \naddressing that bill. My amendment was supported by the American \nMedical Association, the American College of Surgeons, and a number of \nother associations representing the men and women in our medical \nprofession. Unfortunately, a procedural move by the opponents precluded \nthe Senate from voting on this amendment.\n  I stand today in hopes there will be a vote on this measure. This \nmeasure is very much like the measure I put forth; indeed, the goals \nare common.\n  Opponents of health care liability reform have been using procedural \ntactics in the Senate to prevent an up-and-down vote on these issues \nfor many years. The consequences are grave. Men and women continue to \nleave the practice of medicine due to the high cost of malpractice \ninsurance, and patients continue to lose access to medical health care.\n  We have all heard the real stories from doctors about the rapidly \nincreasing costs of medical malpractice insurance. In some States, \nmalpractice insurance premiums have increased as much as 75 percent in \n1 single year.\n  As have others in this body, I have received numerous letters from \nmedical professionals from the Commonwealth of Virginia and across the \nNation that share with me the very real difficulties they encounter \nwith malpractice insurance and the consequences of this problem.\n  Let me read one of those letters sent to me by a doctor in Virginia. \nThe doctor writes:\n\n       I am writing you to elicit your support and advice for the \n     acute malpractice crisis going on in Virginia. . . . I am a \n     48-year-old single parent of a 14 and 17 year old. After all \n     the time and money spent training to practice OB/GYN--\n\n  That is obstetrics, my father's profession, or specialty--\n\n       I find myself on the verge of almost certain unemployment \n     and unemployability because of the malpractice crisis. I have \n     been employed by a small OB/GYN group of doctors for the last \n     7 years. . . . Our malpractice premiums were increased by 60 \n     percent in May of 2003. . . . The prediction from our \n     malpractice insurance carrier is that our rates will probably \n     double at our next renewal date in May 2004. The reality is \n     we will not be able to keep the practice open and cover the \n     malpractice insurance along with other expenses of medical \n     practice.\n\n  Another letter writer from the Midwest:\n\n       Due to the rapid increase of premiums, the crisis is one of \n     affordability and availability of insurance for physicians. . \n     . . The result of this is premature retirement, physicians \n     moving to more favorable areas--\n\n  Moving from one State to another State--\n\n       discontinuing high-risk procedures or finding other ways to \n     make a living out of medicine. All of this, of course, \n     affects the patients, who have increasing difficulty finding \n     medical care.\n\n  Letter after letter are stories of the effect this crisis is having \nacross America.\n  Time magazine and Newsweek have thoroughly detailed the crisis \ndoctors are facing. I have the two recent issues entitled ``Lawsuit \nHell,'' and the second, ``The Doctor is Out.''\n  It is being discussed all across America. That is why it is so \nimperative this institution, the Senate, be given the opportunity to \nvote on this issue.\n  In June of 2003, Time magazine had a cover story on the effects of \nrising malpractice insurance rates. The story entitled ``The Doctor is \nOut'' discusses several doctors all across America who have had to \neither stop practicing medicine or had to take other action due to \nincreased insurance premiums. One example cited in the Times article is \nthe case of Dr. Mary-Emma Beres. Time reports:\n\n       Dr. Mary-Emma Beres, a family practitioner in Sparta, N.C., \n     has always loved delivering babies. But last year, Dr. Beres, \n     35, concluded that she couldn't afford the tripling of her \n     $17,000 malpractice premium and had to stop. With just one \n     obstetrician left in town for high-risk cases, some women who \n     need C-sections now must take a 40-minute ambulance ride.\n\n  Dr. Beres' case makes clear that not only doctors are being affected \nby the medical malpractice crisis but patients, as well. With increased \nfrequency due to rising malpractice rates, more and more patients are \nnot able to find the medical specialists they need in their community \nor in a neighboring community and have to travel long distances or even \ngo out of State, to other States, where there has been closer control \non the types of lawsuits that generate these exorbitant fees.\n  Newsweek magazine had a cover story on the medical liability crisis. \nThat cover story was entitled ``Lawsuit Hell.'' I was struck by the \nfeature in this magazine about a doctor from Ohio who saw his \nmalpractice premiums rise in 1 year from $12,000 to $57,000. As a \nresult, this doctor ``decided to lower his bill by cutting out higher \nrisk procedures like vasectomies, setting broken bones, and delivering \nbabies''--even though obstetrics was his favorite part of practice. Now \nhe glances wistfully at the cluster of baby photos still tacked to a \nwall in his office. `I miss that terribly,' he says.''\n\n  While these stories are compelling on their own, the consequence of \nthis malpractice crisis can even be greater.\n  On February 11, 2003, a woman by the name of Ms. Leanne Dyess of \nGulfport, MS, shared with both the HELP Committee--of which the \ndistinguished chairman is present managing this bill--and the Judiciary \nCommittee her very personal story about how this crisis has affected \nher.\n  She told us how, on July 5, 2002, her husband Tony was involved in a \nsingle-\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\ncar accident. He was rushed to the hospital in Gulfport where he had \nhead injuries and received medical attention. Tony could not be treated \nat the Gulfport hospital because they did not have the specialist \nnecessary to take care of him. After a 6-hour wait, he was airlifted to \nthe University Medical Center. Today, Tony is permanently brain \ndamaged.\n  According to Mrs. Dyess, no specialist was on staff that night in \nGulfport because rising medical liability costs had forced almost all \nof the brain specialists in that community to abandon their practices. \nAs a result, Tony had to wait 6 hours before the only specialist left \nin Gulfport could treat Tony to reduce the swelling in his brain.\n  As you can see, without a doubt, the astronomical increases in \nmedical malpractice insurance premiums are having wide-ranging effects. \nIt is a national problem, and it is time for a national solution.\n  President Bush has indicated that the medical liability system in \nAmerica is largely responsible for the rising costs of malpractice \ninsurance. The American Medical Association and the American College of \nSurgeons agree with him, as does almost every doctor in Virginia with \nwhom I have discussed the issue.\n  The President of the AMA, Dr. John Nelson, has publicly stated:\n\n       We cannot afford the luxury of waiting until the liability \n     crisis gets worse to take action. Too many patients will be \n     hurt.\n\n  The American College of Surgeons concurs by stating:\n\n       More and more Americans aren't getting the care they need \n     when they need it. . . . The ``disappearing doctor'' \n     phenomenon is getting progressively and rapidly worse. It is \n     an increasingly serious threat to everyone's ability to get \n     the care they need.\n\n  Let me state unequivocally that I agree with our President, with the \nAMA, with the American College of Surgeons, and with the vast majority \nof doctors all across Virginia.\n  While the amendment I offered earlier this year is somewhat different \nfrom the measure before us today--the goals are the same: to ensure \nthat patients have access to quality health care and to protect the \npractice of medicine from frivolous lawsuits and runaway jury verdicts.\n  The legislation before us today is a commonsense solution to a \nserious problem, and it is time for us to vote up or down on this \nlegislation.\n  Over the past several weeks, I have listened closely to my colleagues \nspeak on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the importance of having an \nup-or-down vote on particular legislation. And, in response, I ask, how \nis this bill any different?\n  I, for one, intend to vote to end the filibuster on health care \nliability reform legislation. The consequences of continued dilatory \ntactics are too profound to patients and doctors in this country. I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Madam President, I hope this institution can live up to its \nresponsibility as duly elected representatives of the people of this \ncountry and respond to the cries of the people of this country to \naddress this situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I congratulate the senior Senator from \nVirginia for his excellent statement, especially for reflecting on some \nof the specific personal events which this bill tries to address: \nPeople who have been actually impacted by the fact they have not had a \ndoctor available because the doctor can no longer afford to practice \nthe type of medicine which this bill addresses, the delivering of \nchildren and emergency room medicine.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel be added \nas a cosponsor of S. 2207.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to, once again, recite what this \nbill is about because there has been some diversion, I am afraid, \ncoming from the other side in the representations that were made.\n  Basically, what we are dealing with is a bill that is going to try to \nmake medicine more readily available to women who are having children.\n  In rural parts of this country today, for example, in northern New \nHampshire, if a woman is having a child, she has to drive a long way to \nsee a doctor because there is nobody practicing obstetrics in northern \nNew Hampshire. The baby doctors in that part of the State have found \ntheir liability premiums so exceed what they can earn that they can no \nlonger afford to practice medicine. So women are put at risk because \nthey have to get in their car and drive a long way on snowy roads, and \nit is very difficult, especially as they move into the later terms of \ntheir pregnancy.\n  Secondly, this deals with people who walk into an emergency room, \nhave an emergency and need to receive care. As was pointed out by the \nSenator from Tennessee, the majority leader, who is a doctor, there is \na window of opportunity to care for people who have experienced trauma. \nIf there isn't a doctor in that emergency room to take care of that \nindividual, then you have a serious problem. This bill tries to address \nthat by making affordable the practice of medicine in an emergency \nroom.\n  Today, we have a problem. Doctors who practice in emergency rooms do \nnot make a lot of money. They are not making enough money to cover the \npremiums for the liability insurance they have because of the massive \namounts of lawsuits which are filed.\n  This bill will redress that issue. It will still give recovery to \npeople. It will allow them to recover all the medical costs they have. \nIt will allow them to recover all their compensation costs, and it will \nallow them to recover something for what is known as pain and \nsuffering. But it will also allow doctors to practice their disciplines \nbecause it will make it possible for baby doctors and emergency room \ndoctors to be able to afford the cost of the premium of their liability \ninsurance--something many cannot do today, so they are getting out of \nthe practice. It will, therefore, give women better care and people who \nexperience trauma better care in this country.\n  Madam President, it is my understanding, at this time, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is to be recognized. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 minutes under his control.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Madam President, I have watched with heavy heart and mounting dread \nas the ever precarious battle to bring security to postwar Iraq has \ntaken a desperate turn for the worse in recent days and hours. Along \nwith so many Americans, I have been shaken by the hellish carnage in \nFallujah and the violent uprisings in Baghdad and elsewhere. The \npictures have been the stuff of nightmares, with bodies charred beyond \nrecognition and dragged through the streets of cheering citizens. And \nin the face of such daunting images and ominous developments, I have \nwondered anew at President Bush's stubborn refusal to admit mistakes or \nexpress any misgivings over America's unwarranted intervention in Iraq.\n  During the past weekend, the death toll among America's military \npersonnel in Iraq topped 600--including as many as 20 American soldiers \nkilled in one 3-day period of fierce fighting. Think of it. Many of the \ndead, most, perhaps, were mere youngsters--mere youngsters--just \nstarting out on the great adventure of life. But before they could \nrealize their dreams, they were called into battle by their Commander \nin Chief, a battle that we now know was predicated on faulty \nintelligence and wildly exaggerated claims.\n  As I watch events unfold in Iraq, I cannot help but be reminded of \nanother battle, at another place and another time, that hurtled more \nthan 600 soldiers into the maws of death because of a foolish decision \non the part of their commander. The occasion was the Battle of \nBalaclava on October 25, 1864, during the Crimean war, a battle that \nwas immortalized by Alfred Lord Tennyson in his poem ``The Charge of \nthe Light Brigade.''\n\n     ``Forward, the Light Brigade!''\n     Was there a man dismay'd?\n     Not tho' the soldier knew\n     Someone had blunder'd:\n     Their's not to make reply,\n     Their's not to reason why,\n     Their's but to do and die:\n     Into the valley of Death\n     Rode the six hundred.\n\n  Tennyson got it right--someone had blundered. It is time we faced up \nto the\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nfact this President and his administration blundered as well when they \ntook the Nation into war with Iraq without compelling reason, without \nbroad international or even regional support, and without a plan for \ndealing with enormous postwar security and reconstruction challenges \nposed by Iraq. And it is our soldiers, our men and women, our own 600 \nand more who are paying the awful price for this administration's \nblunder.\n  In the runup to the war, this President and his advisors assured the \nAmerican people we would be greeted as liberators in Iraq. Yes, this \nVice President, Vice President Cheney, assured the American people we \nwould be greeted as liberators in Iraq. For a brief moment, that \noutcome seemed possible. One year ago this week, on April 9, 2003, the \nmood in many corners of the Nation was euphoric as Americans witnessed \nthe fall of Baghdad and the jubilant toppling of a massive statue of \nSaddam Hussein. Less than 4 weeks later, President Bush jetted out to \nan aircraft carrier parked off the coast of California to cockily \ndeclare to the world the end of major combat operations in Iraq. For \nthose with tunnel vision, the view from Iraq looked rosy. Then Baghdad \nhad fallen, Saddam Hussein was on the run, and U.S. military deaths had \nbeen kept to a relatively modest number, a total of 138 from the \nbeginning of combat operations through May 1, 2003.\n  But the war in Iraq was not destined to follow the script of some \nidealized cowboy movie of President Bush's youth, where the good guys \nride off into a rose-tinted sunset, all strife settled and all \nwrongdoing avenged. The war in Iraq is real. And as any soldier can \ntell you, reality is messy and bloody and scary.\n  Nobody rides off into the sunset for fear the setting sun will blind \nthem to the presence of the enemies around them. So the fighting \ncontinues in Iraq. It is going on right now, right this minute, long \npast the end of major combat operations, and the casualties have \ncontinued to mount even now, even this hour, even this minute. As of \ntoday, more than 600 military personnel have been killed in Iraq and \nmore than 3,000 wounded.\n  Now after a year of continued strife in Iraq comes word that the \ncommander of forces in the region is seeking options to increase the \nnumber of U.S. troops on the ground, if necessary. Surely I am not the \nonly one who hears echoes of Vietnam in this development. I was here in \nthis Chamber when the word went out in those days to send more, send \nmore men. We will be out by Christmas, yes.\n  Surely this administration recognizes that increasing the U.S. troop \npresence in Iraq will only suck us deeper and deeper and deeper into \nthe maelstrom, into the quicksand of violence that has become the \nhallmark of that unfortunate, miserable country. Starkly put, at this \njuncture, more U.S. forces in Iraq equates more U.S. targets in Iraq.\n  Again, Tennyson's words bespeak a cautionary tale for the present:\n\n     Cannons to the right of them,\n     Cannons to the left of them,\n     Cannons in front of them\n     Volley'd and thunder'd;\n     Storm'd at with shot and shell,\n     Boldly they rode and well,\n     Into the jaws of Death,\n     Into the mouth of Hell\n     Rode the six hundred.\n\n  Like Tennyson's Light Brigade, American military personnel have \nproved their valor, have proved their mettle, have proved their bravery \nin Iraq. In the face of a relentless and seemingly ubiquitous \ninsurgency, they have performed with great courage and great resolve. \nThey have followed the orders of their Commander in Chief, regardless \nof the cost. But surely some must wonder why it is American forces that \nare still shouldering the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of \nthe burden in Iraq, 1 year after the liberation of the country.\n  Where are the Iraqis? Where are they? What has happened to our much-\nvaunted plans to train and equip the Iraqi police and Iraqi military to \nrelieve the burden on U.S. military personnel? Could it be that our \nexpectations exceeded our ability to develop these forces? Could it be \nthat, once again, the United States underestimated the difficulty of \nwinning the peace in Iraq?\n  Since this war began, America has poured $121 billion into Iraq for \nthe military and for reconstruction. But this money cannot buy \nsecurity; this money cannot buy peace; and $121 billion later, only \n2,324 of the 78,224 Iraqi police are ``fully qualified,'' according to \nthe Pentagon. Nearly 60,000 of those same police officers have had no \nformal training--none. It is no wonder security has proved to be so \nelusive. The time has come for a new approach in Iraq.\n  The harsh reality is this: One year after the fall of Baghdad, the \nUnited States should not be casting about for a formula to bring \nadditional U.S. troops to Iraq. The United States should instead be \nworking toward an exit strategy. The fact that the President has \nalienated friend and foe alike by his arrogance in ``going it alone'' \nin Iraq and has made the task of internationalizing postwar Iraq an \nenormously difficult burden should not deter our resolve.\n  Pouring more U.S. troops into Iraq is not the path to extricate \nourselves from that miserable and unfortunate country. We need the \nsupport and endorsement of both the United Nations and Iraq's neighbors \nto truly internationalize the Iraq occupation and take U.S. soldiers \nout of the crosshairs of angry Iraqis.\n  From the flood of disturbing dispatches from Iraq, it is clear that \nmany Iraqis, both Sunni and Shiite, are seething under the yoke of the \nAmerican occupation. The recent violent uprising by followers of a \nradical Shiite cleric is by far the most troubling development in \nmonths and could signal America's worst nightmare--a civil war in Iraq \nthat pits moderate Shiites against radical Shiites. Layered over the \npersistent insurgency being waged by disgruntled Iraqi Sunnis and \nradical Islamic operatives, a Shiite civil war could be the event that \ntopples Iraq from instability into utter chaos.\n  As worrisome as these developments are in and of themselves, the fact \nthat they are occurring as the United States hurtles toward a June 30 \ndeadline to turn Iraq over to an interim Iraqi government--a government \nthat has yet to be identified, established, or vetted--adds an element \nof desperation to the situation.\n  Where should we look for leadership? To this Congress? To this \nSenate? Should we look here?\n\n  This Senate, the foundation of the Republic, has been unwilling to \ntake a hard look at the chaos in Iraq. Senators have once again been \ncowed into silence. Where are Senators on this issue? Where are they? \nThey are of many different opinions, I am sure. Why are they not here \nto express them? Senators have once again been cowed into silence and \nsupport, not because the policy is right, but because the blood of our \nsoldiers and thousands of innocents is on our hands.\n  Questions that ought to be stated loudly in this Chamber are instead \nwhispered in the halls. Those few Senators with courage to stand up and \nspeak out are challenged as unpatriotic and charged with sowing seeds \nof terrorism. It has been suggested that any who dare to question the \nPresident are no better than the terrorists themselves. Such are the \nsuggestions of those who would rather not face the truth.\n  This Republic was founded in part because of the arrogance of a king \nwho expected his subjects to do as they were told, without question, \nwithout hesitation. Our forefathers overthrew that tyrant and adopted a \nsystem of government where dissent is not only important, it is also \nmandatory. Questioning flawed leadership is a requirement of this \nGovernment. Failing to question, failing to speak out, is failing the \nlegacy of the Founding Fathers.\n  When speaking of Iraq, the President maintains that his resolve is \nfirm, and indeed the stakes for him are enormous. But the stakes are \nalso enormous for the men and women who are serving in Iraq and who are \nwaiting and praying for the day they will be able to return home to \ntheir families, their ranks painfully diminished but their mission \nfulfilled with honor and dignity.\n  The President sent these men and women into Iraq, and it is his \nresponsibility to develop a strategy to extricate them from that \ntroubled country before their losses become intolerable.\n  It is staggeringly clear that the administration did not understand \nthe\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nconsequences of invading Iraq a year ago, and it is staggeringly clear \nthat this administration has no effective plan to cope with the \naftermath of the war and the functional collapse of Iraq. It is time--\npast time--for the President to remedy that omission and to level with \nthe American people about the magnitude of mistakes made and lessons \nlearned. America needs a roadmap out of Iraq, one that is orderly and \nastute, else more of our men and women in uniform will follow the fate \nof Tennyson's doomed Light Brigade.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I came to speak on medical malpractice. \nHow much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I wish to save 3 minutes, if you will \nadvise me. I believe another colleague is coming.\n  I do have to make one or two quick remarks about this subject of \nIraq. When we went into Iraq, 77 Members of this body believed the \nintelligence, that there was a deadly force, a radical tyrant there who \nneeded to be removed.\n  One may argue about the intelligence. The intelligence was not as \ngood as it should have been, and that is why we on the Intelligence \nCommittee have been looking into the evidence. But there is no \nquestion, what David Kay said afterward when he did the work of the \nIraqi Survey Group, Iraq was a far more dangerous place than we even \nimagined it.\n  We heard from soldiers. I talked with soldiers who have been there. \nThey know what we are doing. They know the atrocities that went on. \nThey know Iraq was a place of weapons of mass destruction, that \nbiological and chemical weapons had been manufactured before, with \nwide-open opportunities for terrorists in Iraq to get those weapons and \nto use them. This was a clear-cut danger, not only to the people of \nIraq who were suffering every day--literally hundreds of thousands \nmurdered, neighbors murdered--but also a harbor for terrorists in that \ncountry and around the world.\n  What we did in Iraq was dismember the Saddam Hussein regime and wipe \nout the terrorist holding pattern of government, wipe out the \nprotective elements Afghanistan's Taliban government and Iraq's Saddam \nHussein have given the terrorists.\n  Yes, there is deadly fighting going on. There are tragedies every \nday, and it was laid out by al-Zarqawi, the terrorist leader in \nnorthern Iraq who has been working there for years to attack not only \nAmerican soldiers but Iraqi civilians. They are attacking those \ncivilians, but they are aiming at the American public opinion. They are \naiming at this body. They want to get this body to say we are going to \ncut and run so they can have the opportunity to run that country one \nmore time.\n  I believe we cannot forsake and disregard the sacrifices made by the \nbrave men and women who have deposed and captured Saddam Hussein and \nopened up the opportunity for a free and vibrant Iraq to flourish in \nthe Middle East. I hope we will stay the course, and I think my \ncolleagues will want to talk about it.\n  I wanted to address today the problem of medical malpractice \ninsurance rates and how trial lawyers have driven them through the top \nof the roof.\n  Nineteen States are in a full-blown crisis, including my home State \nof Missouri. Premium increases in 2002 were 61 percent, on top of \nincreases in the previous year of 22 percent.\n  Almost a third of the physicians in Missouri say they are considering \nleaving their practice altogether. It is happening in Missouri and \nacross the country. But this is not only a problem for doctors. They \nare well educated. They can move elsewhere and resume their practice, \nas difficult and as unfair as that is. The real damage, the real pain, \nis being felt by their patients.\n  The headlines and the horror stories continue to accumulate, and \npatients continue to suffer in Missouri and across the country. The \nbill before us on which we are going to vote today is a narrow, \ntargeted, short-term solution to a growing national crisis. This bill \nprotects patient access to emergency and trauma care services, as well \nas access to care for women and babies.\n  I have come to this floor many times to talk about protecting access \nto care for pregnant women. It is a real problem in Missouri. Last \nyear, Missouri lost a total of 33 obstetricians. Let me give a few \nexamples of the compromised care in Missouri.\n  A St. Joseph, MO, practice, the only practice in northwest Missouri \nto accept Medicaid, lost one-third of its doctors after the insurance \ncompany would no longer offer insurance to OB/GYNs. St. Joseph now has \nonly seven OB/GYNs serving its population.\n  A Missouri doctor who had been in private practice for 3 years \nexperienced a 400-percent increase in liability premiums for the past 3 \nyears. He got a quote of $108,000 for the current year. The OB/GYN is \nconsidering quitting obstetrics to find more affordable insurance to do \nsomething else.\n  A gynecological oncologist in Missouri left a group practice, \neliminated a rural outreach clinic because of rising professional \nmedical liability premiums. Women with gynecological cancers in Ste. \nGenevieve, Carbondale, and Chester now have to drive over 100 miles to \nsee a gynecological oncologist.\n  On the eastern side of the State in St. Ann, MO, an OB/GYN was forced \nto close his practice last year because of medical liability costs that \nrose 100 percent. Previously, that practice had delivered about 400 \nbabies a year.\n  Twelve doctors at the Kansas City Women's Clinic used to serve women \nin both Missouri and Kansas, but because of the rising medical \nliability insurance rates in Missouri, the clinic could not find a \nsingle company that would offer them a medical malpractice insurance \npolicy they needed in their office in Missouri.\n  As a result, at the end of 2002, they closed their doors to Missouri \npatients. There were over 6,000 visits a year in their Missouri office. \nNow they have to go to Kansas to see an OB/GYN or someplace else.\n  Access to OB/GYN services is not the only care in jeopardy. This \ncrisis threatens access to emergency and trauma services as well. To \nsecure affordable medical liability insurance or to minimize their risk \nof lawsuits, many physicians, including neurosurgeons, orthopedic \nsurgeons, cardiothoracic surgeons, obstetricians, and cardiologists are \nforced to stop serving ``on call'' to hospital emergency departments.\n  Today, in many hospitals there are no neurosurgeons available to \ntreat patients with major head trauma or no orthopedic surgeon to care \nfor patients with open fractures.\n  Patients suffering from head and spinal injuries, broken bones, \ngunshot wounds, or other major trauma are airlifted to other medical \nfacilities. Critical lifesaving facilities are no longer available, and \nin many extreme cases trauma centers have been forced to shut down \ncompletely. This is a danger that speaks in volumes.\n  As my colleagues know, there is a ``golden hour'' that trauma \npatients have from the time they are injured to the time they get \ntrauma care. Closing trauma centers increases the odds that patients \nwon't get the care they need in that hour.\n  In Missouri the numbers speak volumes: 20 percent of all the \nneurosurgeons in Kansas City, MO have quit or moved out of the area in \nthe past 12 months; 5 out of 25 neurosurgeons in private practice in \nSt. Louis quit last year; 21 out of 79 neurosurgeons surveyed in \nMissouri are considering leaving the State; 2 trauma centers in Kansas \nCity have closed in the past 12 months due to lack of physician \ncoverage.\n  According to Dr. Steve Reintjes, a practicing physician at the KC \nNeurosurgery Group in Kansas City, ``Patients are dying before they get \nto us because the trauma center's closed.''\n  Patients are having a hard time getting the care they need and \ncommunities are losing their trusted doctors. We have a health care \nsystem that is in crisis in Missouri and across the country.\n  The bill before us today provides a sensible, short-term solution to \na growing national crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague from Arizona has joined us. I \nyield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Missouri. I \nalso paid close attention to his statement. I think it is a very \nimportant one.\n  Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed an additional \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I take the floor to respond to comments \nmade by Senator Byrd, but also to general comments that have been made \nover the last 48 hours as we all recognize this is a very difficult \ntime for us in Iraq.\n  I do not have to review with any of my colleagues the events of the \nlast few days and the tragedies in the loss of these brave young \nAmericans who are fighting and sacrificing for someone else's freedom.\n  I have also heard a number of observers, including some Senators, who \nhave compared events in Iraq to what we went through in Vietnam. I \nhappen to know something about Vietnam, and I know we do not face \nanother Vietnam. I need not go into the long history of our involvement \nin that nation, the reasons for our failure, but the realities on the \nground in Iraq are clear.\n  There is no superpower that is backing these minority of Shias and \nSunnis who are seeking to gain political power through the use of a \ngun, and there is no comparison as far as the sanctuary which this \nenemy has. We grant them no sanctuary.\n  Some have stated we are on the defensive. I would argue that, as we \nspeak, in Fallajuh and other places, our Marines and Army are on the \noffensive, dedicated to the proposition that no group, no matter what \ntheir ethnic or religious beliefs are, will take control of Iraq.\n  Control of Iraq will be the result of a democratic process and a \nrepresentative one, part of which is the turning over of power to the \nIraqi people on June 30.\n  We have had this argument back and forth: Should we turn over power \nof the government to the Iraqis on June 30? I say yes, and I say yes \nrecognizing two realities. One is that it will be a difficult process, \nand we have a lot more planning to do between now and June 30 for that \ntransition to take place. The other reality, as far as the security \nsituation is concerned, is that America's military will be there in \nforce for a significant period of time, and the American people need to \nbe told that.\n  This is a long, tough, hard struggle. It is hard for countries to \nadopt democracies. It is incredibly difficult when they have never \nknown democracy and freedom in the past. A little later, I want to talk \na little bit more about what happens if we fail, as well as what \nhappens if we succeed in Iraq.\n  Again, in Vietnam there was superpower support. There were arms and \npolitical support. We did not have a clear plan for victory, and dare I \nmention that in Vietnam many times we had more casualties in a week, \nsometimes less than a week, than we have had in a year in Iraq.\n  To make these comparisons with the Tet offensive or the entire \nVietnam conflict is not only uninformed but I think a bit dangerous \nbecause, of course, the specifics of our involvement in that conflict \nfade, as they should, in the memories of the American people.\n  What is happening in Iraq today is we have a Sunni insurgency that \nconsists of ex-Baathists and Saddam loyalists. They obviously are the \nonly people who were better off during Saddam Hussein's regime because \nthey were the favored minority that were of the same religion as \nSaddam. They realize they will never run Iraq again because they are in \nthe minority. Because they are in the majority, the Shia will probably \ndominate that government, but we also have a constitution in Iraq that \nguarantees the rights of minorities. We are there and a new government \nwill be there to guarantee those same rights.\n  The realities are the Sunni minority will never control Iraq again. \nWe have a small minority of Shias who are trying to grab some political \npower before the July 1 transition. There is very little doubt that \nSadr's followers are in a distinct minority and the majority of Shias \nstill owe allegiance and have allegiance to the Ayatollah Sistani, who \nhas argued, perhaps not forcefully enough, that we do not have the kind \nof armed conflict that we are seeing today.\n  Is this a difficult political problem? Yes. Is it the time to panic, \nto cut and run? Absolutely not. The vast majority of Iraqi people are \nglad we are there and they state unequivocally that they are better off \nthan they were under the regime of Saddam Hussein. Lest time dim our \nmemory, let us remember the mass graves that we discovered, the 8- and \n9-year-old boys coming out of prison in Baghdad, the despotic, \nincredibly cruel practices of his two sons. The people of Iraq and \nAmerica and the world are better off with Saddam Hussein gone.\n\n  Now, we can argue about intelligence; we can argue about weapons of \nmass destruction. That is why we have commissions. That is why \ntomorrow, in an almost unprecedented fashion, the National Security \nAdviser to the President will testify before the 9/11 Commission. I am \nconfident she will perform admirably because she is an incredibly \nintelligent and capable individual.\n  The fact is, to argue that we should have left Iraq under the rule of \nthis incredibly cruel person who used weapons of mass destruction, who \nhad weapons of mass destruction in 1991, was continuing to attempt to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction, and if in power would continue to \ntry to acquire those weapons, certainly flies in the face of the facts \nabout Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  Senator Byrd says we should not have gone into Iraq in the first \nplace and that we should not be there now. I respect the view. I \nstrongly disagree with it, and I think the facts indicate that is not \nthe case. We could argue for days about it, but right now at this \nmoment we need to send a message not only to the Sunnis in Iraq and the \nminority of Shias in Iraq who are taking up arms and killing Americans \nthat we are there to stay. We are there to stay and we will see it \nthrough. If we fail, if we cut and run, the results can be disastrous. \nThose results would be the fragmentation of Iraq, to start with, on \nethnic and religious lines. The second result would be an unchecked \nhotbed of training ground and birthing of individuals who are committed \nto the destruction of the United States of America.\n  We will never solve the war on terror as long as there are millions \nof young men standing on street corners all over the Middle East with \nno hope, no job, no opportunities, no future. They are the breeding \nground. They are the ones who are taken off the streets and taken into \nthe madrasahs--funded by the Saudis, by the way--and taught to hate and \nkill, and who want to destroy America, the West, and all we believe in. \nTheir hatred is not confined to the United States of America, as the \ncitizens of Spain have found out, much to their dismay and tragedy.\n  What happens if we win? What happens if we see this thing through? It \nwill be hard and it will be difficult and perhaps we need more troops. \nI have said for a long time that we needed more troops of certain \ntypes, but we have to see this thing through. And what will happen? \nWhat will happen is that we will affirm the profound and fundamental \nbelief upon which this Nation was founded, that all men and women are \ncreated equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nrights, and they are not just in the Western Hemisphere; they are not \njust in the United States of America; they are not just in Europe. The \npeople in the Middle East have the same hopes, beliefs, and yearnings \nfor freedom and democracy, and they have a right to determine their own \nfuture just as have our own citizens and citizens throughout the world.\n  When they achieve that--and it will be long and hard and difficult--\nit will send a message to every despotic regime, every religious \nextremist throughout the Middle East, their day is done because in a \ndemocratic, free, and open society the people want to live in peace \nwith their neighbors and with the world.\n  So there is a lot at stake. I grieve every moment, as every American \ndoes, for the loss of these brave young\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nAmericans' lives. They have made a supreme sacrifice, and we will honor \ntheir memory, but at least their grieving families will know they \nsacrificed in the cause of freedom.\n  At this particular moment of crisis--and it is a crisis--I urge all \nof my colleagues and all Americans to join together in this noble \ncause. Yes, we are free to criticize; yes, we are free to make \nrecommendations and suggestions; but the awesome responsibility lies \nwith all of us, led by the President of the United States, as we \nattempt to carry out what is the most noble act that no country in the \nworld has ever done besides the United States of America, and that is \nto shed our most precious blood and expend our treasure in defense of \nsomeone else's freedom in the hope that they may enjoy the fruits of a \nfree and open society in a democracy that is guaranteed to all men and \nwomen by our Creator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I strongly support the Pregnancy and \nTrauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004.\n  I thank Majority Leader Frist for proactively addressing this crisis. \nAcross America, health care providers, especially health care providers \nthat work in high-risk services such as obstetricians, gynecologists, \nand emergency personnel, have faced difficulty obtaining affordable \nmedical liability coverage. Doctors are being hit with dramatic \nincreases in the premiums they pay for liability insurance--if \ninsurance is even available in their area.\n  These soaring costs are depriving patient's access to crucial medical \ncare, especially in rural areas, where some services are already in \nshort supply. In a number of instances, doctors are forced to relocate \ntheir practice as hospitals and physicians find it increasingly \ndifficult to continue offering certain services. Without real reform, \nmore and more Americans will find that health care services are simply \ngoing to disappear from their communities. And, in my opinion, this is \nunacceptable, especially when a reasonable solution is at hand.\n  There is a map I have seen in this chamber. This map is of the United \nStates, and each of the States is color-coded: red if the State is in \ncrisis, yellow if the State is showing problems, and white if the State \nis currently OK.\n  I am very proud that my State, New Mexico, is one of the six states \nthat is white. New Mexico is OK because in 1976, the State legislature \nrecognized there was a problem with medical malpractice, and they \npassed reform. Part of this reform included caps on noneconomic \ndamages. And, as the map shows, it has worked. States with realistic \nlimits on noneconomic damages are faring better. Physicians in most \nstates with caps on non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases \npay lower insurance premiums. Reasonable caps keep premiums from rising \nquickly.\n  Unquestionably, truly injured parties must have access to our courts \nto adjudicate their claims. And injured patients must be compensated \nfor their economic damages such as cost of future medical care and lost \nwages. However, trial lawyers have taken advantage of our civil justice \nsystem to further their own interests. The explosion of malpractice \nlawsuits and subsequent growth of astronomical jury awards have \ntremendously increased the costs of medical malpractice insurance. \nPremium increases have jumped as much as 81 percent over the last 2 \nyears, according to some insurers. Frivolous lawsuits combined with \nexcessive judgments are destroying the doctor-patient relationship and \ndriving professionals out of medical practice all together. This \nreality has terrible consequences for all Americans.\n  The bill we are debating today is real reform. It provides an \nunlimited amount of damages for actual economic loss. It caps \nnoneconomic damages, it has more reasonable punitive damages awards, a \nuniform statute of limitations, and it provides flexibility to States \nby allowing State laws to supercede Federal limits on damages.\n  This bill creates directives for a malpractice system that currently \nis unpredictable and largely random. The rising cost of medical \nmalpractice insurance is a serious threat to the well being of American \ncitizens and our Nation's healthcare system. It is time for Congress to \npass meaningful legislation that will address our Nation's health care \ncrisis.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate today is considering a procedural \nvote on a motion to recommit the Foreign Sales Corporation/\nExtraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) legislation. This is an effort to \nbring to the Senate a remodeled bill--one containing popular energy tax \nincentives--that will make a vote against it less politically \npalatable. This is much less about enacting good national policies than \nit is about producing campaign ads. This is less about creating jobs \nthan it is about playing partisan politics. It is certainly less about \nthe very important business of formulating a comprehensive national \nenergy policy than it is about scoring points for the majority's \ncampaign contributors. As the Members of this body know well, \nbipartisan energy legislation, including a very similar package of \nenergy tax incentives, passed this body twice already--once in April \n2002, in the 107th Congress, and again in July 2003, in the first \nsession of this Congress.\n  I support, and have strongly advocated, many of these targeted energy \ntax provisions. In their totality, these incentives can be a helpful \nstimulus to get our Nation's energy policy back on track, and the \nSenate's proposal has had support in numerous industry sectors as well \nas among consumers. However, it is a rotten carrot that is dangling \nbefore us. This is yet another perverse, backdoor attempt to buy off \nDemocratic votes by adding popular provisions to a Senate bill, while \nsimultaneously preventing Democratic Senators from offering their own \namendments on the floor and preventing them from protecting their \ninterests during conferences.\n  The majority is preventing Democrats from getting votes on other very \nimportant policy matters. There are many things that this Senate must \naddress, including passing these energy tax incentives, but the \nmajority needs to stop playing games with its Democratic colleagues. \nThe Senate deserves better.\n  The Senate finds itself handcuffed by the same authoritarian dictates \nfrom the Bush administration that have led to some of the fiercest \npartisan passions that this body has seen in decades. Gone is the \ntraditional spirit of cooperation. Gone is the belief that the needs of \nthe Nation stand above the ambitions of political party. It is a \ndisheartening turn for this historic Chamber.\n  Despite its campaign-driven rhetoric, this lipservice and corporate \ncoddling have been the sum total of this administration's economic, \nhealth care, energy, and so many other policies. From the beginning, \nthe administration's tax cuts have primarily benefited the wealthy. \nHope for a bipartisan Medicare prescription drug benefit was high, but \nall that was left was a prescription for protecting the pharmaceutical \nindustry and a drug benefit that is a sham for America's seniors. \nProgress on an energy strategy for the country began cooperatively, but \nquickly dissolved as Democrats were locked out of conference \nnegotiations, their seats filled by special interest lobbyists.\n  If the Republican majority wants to get something done in a closely \ndivided Senate, it can, but it has to work with the other side of the \naisle at all stages of the legislative process. That means respecting \nthe committee process, respecting the rights of Senators to offer--and \nget votes on--amendments on the floor. It means truly including \nDemocrats in conference deliberations, and defending the position of \nthe Senate in conference negotiations--not buckling under pressure from \nthe White House. I believe that, if the majority would do this, we \nwould follow a better, more productive legislative path instead of \nvoting on--and failing to invoke--cloture so often.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, once again we are faced with an ill-\nadvised medical malpractice bill coming to the Senate floor without any \ncommittee consideration. Some argue that we have a malpractice \ninsurance ``crisis'' that is driving doctors from the practice of \nmedicine, particularly in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, or \nOB/GYN. This is a serious issue and it deserves close examination. But \nwe haven't yet explored the issue in the Senate at all. Nor have we \nexamined the issue of how malpractice cases may\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\nbe affecting the practice of emergency medicine. No committee has held \nhearings or marked up a bill on these topics.\n  In fact, no work has apparently been done behind the scenes since the \nSenate refused to invoke cloture on S. 2061. Instead, once again, an \nextreme and unbalanced proposal has been brought directly to the floor \nand Senators are expected to vote for it without any committee having \nlooked into the facts or considered alternatives. That is not how the \nlegislative process should work.\n  I would like very much for Congress to address the problem of \nmalpractice insurance premiums once we understand the seriousness of \nthe problem and the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. But by \nbringing this bill directly to the floor only 6 weeks after a nearly \nidentical bill failed to achieve the necessary vote, the majority shows \nthat it is not serious about addressing the problem. It appears that \nwhat is going on here is a cynical exercise, designed only to fail and \nto provide fodder for political attacks. This issue deserves better and \nI hope that there will be some effort to address it in a serious, \nbipartisan manner.\n  I will vote nay on cloture.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today's vote on S. 2207 is a test of the \nSenate's character. In the past, this body has had the courage to \nreject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by those who \ncontend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt seriously \ninjured patients. Unfortunately, as we saw in the Patients' Bill of \nRights debate, the Bush administration and congressional Republicans \nare again advocating a policy which will benefit neither doctors nor \npatients, only insurance companies. Caps on compensatory damages and \nother extreme tort reforms are not only unfair to the victims of \nmalpractice, they do not result in a reduction of malpractice insurance \npremiums.\n  Once more, we must stand resolute.\n  We must not sacrifice the fundamental legal rights of seriously \ninjured patients on the altar of insurance company profits. We must not \nsurrender our most vulnerable citizens to the avarice of these \ncompanies.\n  This bill contains the same arbitrary and unreasonable provisions \nwhich were decisively rejected by a bipartisan majority of the Senate \ntwice within the past year. The only difference is that the bill \nrejected in February took basic rights away only from women and newborn \nbabies who are the victims of negligent obstetric and gynecological \ncare, while this bill includes victims of negligent emergency trauma \ncare as well. Broadening the bill does not make it more acceptable. On \nthe contrary, it only expands the unfairness to an additional category \nof malpractice victims.\n  This legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the \nright to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing \narbitrary caps on compensation for noneconomic loss in all obstetrical \nand gynecological cases and in all emergency and trauma care cases. \nThese caps only serve to hurt those patients who have suffered the most \nsevere, life-altering injuries and who have proven their cases in \ncourt.\n  They are babies who suffered serious brain injuries at birth and will \nnever be able to lead normal lives. They are the women who lost organs, \nreproductive capacity, and in some cases even years of life. They are \nthe children who are permanently injured when emergency room doctors \nfail to provide proper medical treatment after an accident. These are \nlife-altering conditions. It would be terribly wrong to take their \nrights away. The Republicans talk about deterring frivolous cases, but \ncaps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases which have \nbeen proven in court. These badly injured patients are the last ones we \nshould be depriving of fair compensation.\n  A person with a severe injury is not made whole merely by receiving \nreimbursement for medical bills and lost wages. Noneconomic damages \ncompensate victims for the very real, though not easily quantifiable, \nloss in quality of life that results from a serious, permanent injury. \nIt is absurd to suggest that $250,000 is fair compensation for a child \nwho is severely brain injured at birth and, as a result, can never \nparticipate in the normal activities of day to day living; or for a \nwoman who lost her reproductive capacity because of an OB/GYN's \nmalpractice; or for a patient who suffered a devastating heart attack \nbecause a negligent emergency room doctor ignored his severe chest \npains and sent him home.\n  This is not a better bill because it applies only to patients injured \nby malpractice in three medical categories. That just makes it even \nmore arbitrary.\n  The entire premise of this bill is both false and offensive. Our \nRepublican colleagues claim that women and their babies must sacrifice \ntheir fundamental legal rights in order to preserve access to OB/GYN \ncare, and that those seeking care in a hospital emergency room must \nleave their rights at the door. The very idea is outrageous. For those \nlocales--mostly in sparsely populated areas--where the availability of \nspecialists is a problem, there are far less drastic ways to solve it.\n  This bill is based on the false premise that the availability of OB/\nGYN and trauma care physicians depends on the enactment of draconian \ntort reforms. If that were accurate, States that have already enacted \ndamage caps would have a higher number of OB/GYNs providing care. \nHowever, there is in fact no correlation. States without caps actually \nhave 28.4 OB/GYNs per 100,000 women, while States with caps have 25.2 \nOB/GYNs per 100,000 women.\n  Nor is there any correlation between access to emergency trauma care \nand whether a State has enacted restrictions on the compensation that \nmalpractice victims can receive. In fact, 7 of the top 10 States \nidentified in the Journal of the American Medical Association, March \n26, 2003, as having the highest number of level I and II trauma centers \nper million residents do not cap damages in malpractice cases. Five of \nthe States with the best availability of trauma centers have actually \nbeen listed as malpractice ``crisis'' States by the AMA. That is worth \nrepeating; 7 of the 10 States whose residents have the greatest access \nto emergency care do not limit damages. In contrast, four States that \nthe AMA identifies as ``doing OK,'' having satisfactory tort laws, fail \nto have an adequate number of trauma centers to serve their residents.\n  And that is only one of many fallacies in this bill. If the issue is \ntruly access to OB/GYN and emergency care doctors, why has this bill \nbeen written to shield from accountability HMOs that deny \nneeded medical care to a woman suffering serious complications with her \npregnancy or to a child in need of emergency care after a serious \naccident, a pharmaceutical company that fails to warn of the dangerous \nside effects caused by its new drug, and a manufacturer that markets a \nmedical device which can seriously injure the user. Who are the authors \nof this legislation really trying to protect?\n\n  In reality, this legislation is designed to shield the entire health \ncare industry from basic accountability for the care it provides to \nwomen and their infant children and to patients in need of emergency \ntreatment. It is the first step toward broader legislation which would \nshield the industry from accountability in all health care decisions \ninvolving all patients. While those across the aisle like to talk about \ndoctors, the real beneficiaries will be insurance companies and large \nhealth care corporations. This legislation would enrich them at the \nexpense of the most seriously injured patients; whose entire lives have \nbeen devastated by medical neglect and corporate abuse.\n  This legislation is attempting to use the sympathetic family doctor \nas a Trojan horse concealing an enormous array of special legal \nprivileges for every corporation which makes a health care product, \nprovides a health care service, or insures the payment of a medical \nbill. Every provision of this bill is carefully designed to take \nexisting rights away from those who have been harmed by medical neglect \nand corporate greed.\n  In addition to imposing caps, this legislation would place other \nmajor restrictions on seriously injured patients seeking to recover \nfair compensation. At every stage of the judicial process, it would \nchange long-established judicial rules to disadvantage patients and \nshield defendants from the consequences of their actions.\n  When will the Republican Party start worrying about injured patients \nand\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nstop trying to shield big business from the consequences of its \nwrongdoing?\n  If we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously injured \npatients as the sponsors of this legislation propose, what benefits \nwould result? Certainly less accountability for health care providers \nwill never improve the quality of health care. It will not even result \nin less costly care. The cost of medical malpractice premiums \nconstitutes less than two-thirds of 1 percent, 0.66 percent, of the \nNation's health care expenditures each year. Malpractice premiums are \nnot the cause of the high rate of medical inflation.\n  In this era of managed care and cost controls, it is ludicrous to \nsuggest that the major problem facing American health care is \n``defensive medicine.'' The problem is not ``too much health care,'' it \nis ``too little'' quality health care.\n  A CBO report released in January of this year rejected claims being \nmade about the high cost of ``defensive medicine''. Their analysis \n``found no evidence that restrictions on tort liability reduce medical \nspending.'' There was ``no statistically significant difference in per \ncapita health care spending between States with and without limits on \nmalpractice torts.''\n  The White House and other supporters of caps have argued that \nrestricting an injured patient's right to recover fair compensation \nwill reduce malpractice premiums. But there is scant evidence to \nsupport their claim. In fact, there is substantial evidence to refute \nit. In the past few years, there have been dramatic increases in the \ncost of medical malpractice insurance in States that already have \ndamage caps and other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books, as \nwell as in States that do not. No substantial increase in the number or \nsize of malpractice judgments has suddenly occurred which would justify \nthe enormous increase in premiums which many doctors are being forced \nto pay. The reason for sky-high premiums cannot be found in the \ncourtroom.\n  Caps are not only unfair to patients, they are also an ineffective \nway to control medical malpractice premiums. Comprehensive national \nstudies show that medical malpractice premiums are not significantly \nlower on average in States that have enacted damage caps and other \nrestrictions on patient rights than in States without these \nrestrictions. Insurance companies are merely pocketing the dollars \nwhich patients no longer receive when ``tort reform'' is enacted.\n  Let's look at the facts. Based on data from the Medical Liability \nMonitor on all 50 States, the average liability premium in 2003 for \ndoctors practicing in States without caps on malpractice damages, \n$35,016, was less than the average premium for doctors practicing in \nStates with caps, $40,381. There are many reasons why insurance rates \nvary substantially from State to State. This data demonstrates that it \nis not a State's tort reform laws which determine the rates. Caps do \nnot make a significant difference in the malpractice premiums which \ndoctors pay. This is borne out by a comparison of premium levels for a \nrange of medical specialties.\n  Focusing on premiums paid by OB/GYN physicians, the evidence is the \nsame. Data from the Medical Liability Monitor shows that the average \nliability premium for OB/GYNs in 2003 was actually slightly higher in \nStates with caps of damages, $63,278, than in States without caps, \n$59,224. It also showed that the rate of increase last year was higher \nin States with caps, 17.1 percent, than it was in States without caps, \n16.6 percent.\n  This evidence clearly demonstrates that capping malpractice damages \ndoes not benefit the doctors it purports to help. Their rates remain \nvirtually the same. It only helps the insurance companies earn even \nbigger profits. As BusinessWeek magazine concluded after reviewing the \ndata, ``the statistical case for caps is flimsy,'' March 3, 2003 issue.\n\n  If a Federal cap on noneconomic compensatory damages were to pass, it \nwould sacrifice fair compensation for injured patients in a vain \nattempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums. Doctors will not get \nthe relief they are seeking. Only the insurance companies, which \ncreated the recent market instability, will benefit.\n  Insurance industry practices are responsible for the sudden dramatic \npremium increases which have occurred in some States in the past few \nyears. The explanation for these premium spikes can be found not in \nlegislative halls or in courtrooms, but in the boardrooms of the \ninsurance companies themselves.\n  Insurers make much of their money from investment income. Interest \nearned on premium dollars is particularly important in medical \nmalpractice insurance because there is a much longer period of time \nbetween receipt of the premium and payment of the claim than in most \nlines of casualty insurance. The industry creates a ``malpractice \ncrisis'' whenever its investments do poorly. The combination of a sharp \ndecline in the equity markets and record low interest rates in recent \nyears is the reason for the sharp increase in medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums. What we are witnessing is not new. The industry has \nengaged in this pattern of behavior repeatedly over the last 30 years.\n  Last year, Weiss Ratings, Inc., a nationally recognized financial \nanalyst conducted an in-depth examination of the impact of capping \ndamages in medical malpractice cases. Their conclusions sharply \ncontradict the assumptions on which this legislation is based. Weiss \nfound that capping damages does reduce the amount of money that \nmalpractice insurance companies pay out to injured patients. However, \nthose savings are not passed on to doctors in lower premiums.\n  Between 1991 and 2002, the Weiss analysis shows that premiums rose by \nsubstantially more in the States with damage caps than in the States \nwithout caps. The 12-year increase in the annual malpractice premium \nwas 48.2 percent in the States that had caps, and only 35.9 percent in \nthe States that had no caps. In the words of the report: ``On average, \ndoctors in States with caps actually suffered a significantly larger \nincrease than doctors in States without caps . . . In short, the \nresults clearly invalidate the expectations of cap proponents.''\n  Doctors, especially those in high risk specialties, whose malpractice \npremiums have increased dramatically over the past few years do deserve \npremium relief. That relief will only come as the result of tougher \nregulation of the insurance industry. When insurance companies lose \nmoney on their investments, they should not be able to recover those \nlosses from the doctors they insure. Unfortunately, that is what is \nhappening now.\n  Doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry. \nExcess profits from the boom years should be used to keep premiums \nstable when investment earnings drop. However, the insurance industry \nwill never do that voluntarily. Only by recognizing the real problem \ncan we begin to structure an effective solution that will bring an end \nto unreasonably high medical malpractice premiums.\n  There are specific changes in the law which should be made to address \nthe abusive manner in which medical malpractice insurers operate. The \nfirst and most important would be to subject the insurance industry to \nthe Nation's antitrust laws. It is the only major industry in America \nwhere corporations are free to conspire to fix prices, withhold and \nrestrict coverage, and engage in a myriad of other anticompetitive \nactions. A medical malpractice ``crisis'' does not just happen. It is \nthe result of insurance industry schemes to raise premiums and to \nincrease profits by forcing antipatient changes in the tort law. I have \nintroduced, with Senator Leahy, legislation which will at long last \nrequire the insurance industry to abide by the same rules of fair \ncompetition as other businesses. Secondly, we need stronger insurance \nregulations which will require malpractice insurers to set aside a \nportion of the windfall profits they earn from their investment of \npremium dollars in the boom years to cover part of the cost of paying \nclaims in lean years. This would smooth out the extremes in the \ninsurance cycle which have been so brutal for doctors. Thirdly, to \naddress the immediate crisis that some doctors in high risk specialties \nare currently facing, we should provide temporary premium relief. This \nis particularly important for doctors who are providing care to \nunderserved populations in rural and inner city areas.\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\n  Unlike the harsh and ineffective proposals in S. 2207, these are real \nsolutions which will help physicians without further harming seriously \ninjured patients. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership continues to \nprotect their allies in the insurance industry and refuses to consider \nreal solutions to the malpractice premium crisis.\n  This legislation, S. 2207, is not a serious attempt to address a \nsignificant problem being faced by physicians in some States. It is the \nproduct of a party caucus rather than the bipartisan deliberations of a \nSenate committee. It was designed to score political points, not to \nachieve the bipartisan consensus which is needed to enact major \nlegislation. For that reason, it does not deserve to be taken seriously \nby the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when we first began the Senate debate on \nS. 1637 in March, the intended purpose of the measure was to resolve \nappropriately the controversy between the United States and the \nEuropean Union over the extraterritorial income, ETI, exemption tax \nbenefit for exports. Almost all of us recognize the critical need to \npass legislation to bring the United States back into compliance with \nWorld Trade Organization, WTO, agreements and stop the burdensome \ntariffs now imposed on our manufacturers. Unfortunately, achieving the \nlegislation's worthy purpose is in jeopardy due to a host of special \ninterest tax provision add-ons. I do not support these latest add-ons \nand, as such, must vote against today's cloture vote.\n  When S. 1637 was presented to the Senate, it was a 378-page bill. \nAlthough only one roll call vote has occurred on an amendment during \nthe floor consideration, the bill had grown to some 527 pages by the \nlast cloture vote on March 22. I reluctantly voted for cloture, voicing \nmy strong concerns about the direction the bill was going at the time. \nBut instead of reigning in the special interest add-ons, they are only \ngrowing further. The bill has now grown to a 929-page Easter basket of \ngoodies, but with almost no debate or votes on its provisions, \nincluding the latest addition of $13 billion in energy-related tax \nbreaks.\n  I recognize the strong interest of the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee and others to pass an energy bill. I wish that I could \nsupport the bill that the committee has developed, but in its current \nform I cannot. But I can assure the proponents of the energy \nlegislation that to now shift $13 billion in costs from their bill to \nthe JOBS bill is not the way to gain support for an energy bill. \nInstead, they need to develop an energy bill that is more evenly \nbalanced between stimulating the supply of conventional fuels and \npromoting alternative fuels and energy efficiency.\n  If the Senate is to consider an energy tax incentive bill or an \nenergy authorizing bill, we should be following regular order, and \nbringing legislation to the floor and debating in its own right. \nInstead, we are being asked to simply accept a 362-page energy bill \nadd-on without debate or further amendments.\n  With our limited legislative time during this election year, the \nSenate would serve the American public far better if it stayed focused \non accomplishing the intended purpose of legislating. Unfortunately, \nthe JOBS bill, which is a much needed bill, is being dragged down with \nthe unnecessary weight of billions of dollars in wasteful subsidies, \ntax breaks, and special exemptions for special interest industries. \nWith the Nation facing a half-trillion dollar deficit, now is not the \ntime for Congress to be enacting new tax credits and carving out sweet \ndeals for special interests.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, we will be voting on a cloture \nmotion to allow the Senate to proceed to debate S. 2207, the Pregnancy \nand Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote for the motion to proceed.\n  It should be clear to all those following this debate that our \nmedical litigation system is failing the American people. It is failing \nour communities, our hospitals, our doctors, our families and, most \nimportantly, our patients. Unfortunately, this system hurts our most \nvulnerable patients the most--those needing help from highly trained \nmedical specialists like neurosurgeons and obstetricians. Reform of \nthis broken system is desperately needed, and we must act.\n  The upcoming vote will allow us to fully debate this critical issue. \nIf Members have problems with certain parts of the bill that is fine. \nLet's move to the bill, offer amendments, and fully debate this needed \nreform.\n  But if action is delayed, we know what will happen: patients will \nsuffer, women will suffer and babies will suffer. Those seeking care \nfrom emergency rooms and trauma centers will suffer. OB/GYNs will \ncontinue to flee their practices and drop obstetrical services, and \nmore doctors will refuse to perform vitally needed emergency services.\n  I remind my colleagues that our current litigation system does more \nthan simply threaten access to care. It indirectly costs the country \nbillions of dollars every year in defensive medicine. The fear of \nlawsuits forces doctors to practice defensive medicine by ordering \nunneeded extra tests and procedures. Though the numbers are hard to \ncalculate, well-researched reports predict savings from reform at tens \nof billions of dollars per year.\n  It directly costs the taxpayers billions. The CBO has estimated that \nreasonable broad reform will save the Federal Government $14.9 billion \nover 10 years through savings in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  It impedes efforts to improve patient safety. The threat of excessive \nlitigation discourages doctors from discussing medical errors in ways \nthat could dramatically improve health care and save hundreds or \nthousands of lives. I am a strong supporter of patient safety \nlegislation which I hope we will pass this year. In addition to patient \nsafety legislation, we need to address the underlying problem, our \nliability system.\n  We must reform this broken liability system. That is why I strongly \nsupport the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act. I thank my \ncolleague Senator Gregg, who has skillfully led this debate, and I \nthank Senator Ensign, a leading proponent of reform, who has seen the \ncurrent crisis in his own State of Nevada.\n  This legislation will protect access to care for our most vulnerable \ncitizens and ensure that those who are negligently injured receive fair \nand just compensation. Again, I encourage my colleagues to move this \nlegislation forward. We cannot afford further delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to make a statement and, upon the conclusion of my \nstatement, the Senate recess until 2:15 as provided under the previous \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                FSC/ETI\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed that we have \nto be here today debating the FSC/ETI bill. The fact is, with America's \neconomic health at risk, the bipartisan JOBS bill should have been \ndebated and voted out of this body last month. Instead, attempts to \nmove this jobs in manufacturing bill has been stymied. As a result, \nAmerican manufacturing is not only being deprived of a competitive \nboost that it deserves at a time of no job creation in manufacturing \nbut, in addition to that, U.S. exporters are stuck with a 6-percent \nEuropean tax on our products going there.\n  This situation has festered for much too long. It has been several \nyears since the World Trade Organization has ruled that the FSC/ETI \nregime did not meet our World Trade Organization obligations that this \nSenate and the other body agreed to a long time ago. Since then, we \nhave known that. It is a fact. We have all known that unless we changed \nour current tax system, tariffs against our exports were looming.\n  To try to avoid these sanctions, Senator Baucus and I came together \nover a year ago and formed a bipartisan, bicameral working group to \nfind a real, permanent solution to this problem.\n  The result is bipartisan. Remember that nothing gets done in the \nSenate that is not bipartisan. We have a jobs in manufacturing act \nbefore the Senate, and we will be voting on that today. This bill was \npassed out of my committee by a vote of 19 to 2. That means all \nDemocrats voted for it. It provided a real and permanent solution to \nour FSC/ETI problems in a way which complies with our WTO obligations.\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\n  The bipartisan jobs in manufacturing act helps America's \nmanufacturing sector. It helps us compete by giving an across-the-board \n3-percentage point tax cut to all companies, large or small, that \nmanufacture in the United States.\n  At a time when manufacturing is flat, this 3-percent tax cut can make \na real difference to a company's bottom line perhaps bringing up enough \ncapital and creating enough manufacturing growth to enable it or any \ncompany to hire in the manufacturing sector.\n  That is something every Senator would like to see. But because of \npolitical games and dilatory tactics by some in the Senate, this relief \nis not forthcoming.\n  I want Americans to understand that Senators on my side of the aisle \nare ready, willing, and able to provide a real shot in the arm to \nAmerica's manufacturing sector. But after working so long in a \nbipartisan way, we are being blocked. We are blocked from providing the \nrelief that American manufacturing deserves and needs.\n  In effect, this bill and the American manufacturing sector are being \nheld hostage to Democratic demands to load this bipartisan legislation \nwith a bunch of unrelated nongermane amendments. While some of these \namendments are legitimate, others amount to nothing more than a wish \nlist of political message amendments that have nothing to do with this \nvery major piece of legislation. I, for one, am tired of watching us \nbide our time contemplating a wish list. American manufacturing needs \nsolutions. It does not need a political wish list.\n\n  We have a good bipartisan bill before the Senate, a package that \nworks for America's workers. But our plea for progress is met with \nnothing but demands for including one more item on some political wish \nlist. You would think adults would make up their minds about what they \nwant and that would be it.\n  It would be one thing if a political wish list did no harm, if it \nreally didn't matter, or if the JOBS bill moved or not. But for \nmanufacturing it does matter. Delay deprives American manufacturing of \na much needed economic boost. Delay also inflicts real economic harm on \ninnocent workers across the country.\n  The World Trade Organization has authorized the European Union to \nimpose as much as $4 billion in tariffs in retaliation for our failure \nto bring our tax laws into compliance with international trade \nagreements that this body has already accepted--and accepted years ago.\n  Last month, on March 1, the European Union began implementing these \nsanctions by imposing an additional 5-percent tax on selected U.S. \nexports. This 5-percent Euro tax automatically increases by 1 percent \nfor each month in which the United States of America remains out of \ncompliance. Thus, when Members voted against stopping debate last \nmonth, the last time this bill was before this body, they contributed \nto a 20-percent increase in these tariffs because that additional 1 \npercent went into effect on April 1. Because of delay, then we have a \n6-percent sales tax on our exports to Europe, making a lot of our \nbusinesses uncompetitive.\n  As you can see from this chart, these sanctions will continue to \nclimb unless we act and act fast. In May, they rise another 1-\npercentage point to 7 percent and continue increasing until they reach \na maximum of 17 percent in March of 2005. After that, then who knows \nwhat is going to happen. But by then we will have a lot of layoffs and \npeople will wake up to the fact that harm is being done.\n  The European Union is not bound to cap retaliation at 17 percent. \nThat is why I said: Who knows? In fact, they are scheduled to review \nthe effectiveness of these retaliatory taxes at the end of 1 year. If \nthe Europeans conclude that we are not in compliance, retaliation can \nescalate even further to a maximum of $4 billion a year.\n  If this sounds one sided, America wins more disputes in the World \nTrade Organization than we lose. We have won some major disputes \nagainst Europe. One time we won one about American beef being kept out \nof Europe. Europe still doesn't like to get some American beef. So we \nhave imposed a tax on European exports coming into our country because \nthat is the legal way of handling these disputes after it has been \ndecided. I use that as an example. Europe has learned a lesson from the \nUnited States and they are doing to us what we have done to them. Why? \nBecause in one case Europe did not want to abide by a decision, and in \nanother case, we, up to now, have not abided by a decision. That is why \nwe have the tax. It is quite obvious in most cases countries abide by \nthese decisions. If they did not abide by these decisions, we would \nhave chaos in international trade. We do not.\n\n  I make clear to the Members of this body: The effect of voting \nagainst stopping debate last month contributed strongly to raising \ntariffs on our exports by 2 percent. If cloture is not invoked this \nweek, it is certain sanctions will escalate another percentage point, \nrising an overall level of 7 percent on selected U.S. exports. The core \nlegislation should be very clear: A vote against stopping debate is a \nvote for higher taxes on our exports.\n  Which exporters will be hurt? All of them. No, not all of them, \nbecause the European Union was very careful in drawing up the sanctions \nlist. In many cases, they chose to impose sanctions on U.S. exports \nthat would most significantly feel the pain of the higher tax tariffs.\n  They are smart. Thus, highly competitive products with high profit \nmargins are likely to find themselves on the list.\n  A press release from the American Forest and Paper Association dated \nMarch 2 of this year says this about European Union tariffs on wood \nproduct exports:\n\n       This is a devastating development for an industry that has \n     already closed more than 220 mills and laid off 120,000 \n     workers since 1997.\n       Our industry works on such tight profit margins that even a \n     5 percent tariff will likely price many U.S. wood and paper \n     products out of our vital European markets. To have this \n     happen just as United States wood and paper products are \n     beginning to recover from a decade-long stump does \n     irreparable harm to our industry.\n\n  The European Union has chosen products they could get from other \ncountries, hoping that the higher tariffs on U.S. exports will price \nour products out of the European market, to be replaced by similar \nproducts from other foreign competitors. It is important for Members of \nthe Senate to understand the effect of pricing U.S. exports out of the \nEuropean market is not just temporary. Longstanding business \nrelationships can be permanently disrupted as European buyers scramble \nto replace cost-prohibited U.S. products. Even if our price may go \ndown, those relationships that are made because of this uncompetitive \natmosphere for American exporters may go on and we never gain back that \nmarket. Once a replacement from another country is found, there is no \nguarantee the European buyer will ever buy from the U.S. producer \nagain. In the end, the lost European export market can be lost forever. \nIf the Senate votes down this motion to stop debate this month, the \ncancer of sanctions will not only continue, it will spread.\n  On May 1 of this year the European Union will take in 10 more member \ncountries. These countries will be bound by the same import-export \nregime as France and other European Union countries. Thus U.S. exports \nto those 10 countries will also face higher tariffs as they try to \ncompete in these markets.\n  Now we will look at another chart that shows the list of countries \nthat will be become part of the European Union starting May 1, 2004: \nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, \nPoland, Slovakia, Slovenia. I hope Senators who vote against stopping \ndebate today appreciate they are voting not only to raise the Euro tax \non sensitive U.S. exports but are also voting to have that tax applied \nto an even broader array of countries.\n\n  Some people might argue these sanctions only hurt big companies. Do \nnot be fooled. They are big, people might argue, and they can absorb a \nhit of higher tariffs. The fact is, approximately 90 percent of U.S. \nexporters in 2001 were small businesses with 100 employees or less. \nThese small exporters can ill afford the sting of sanctions on their \nbottom line. Products impacted include jewelry, horses, dairy, fruit \nand vegetables, toys and games, glass and glassware, animal feed, \nleather goods and handbags, textile products, carpets, footwear, soap \nand candles, wood\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\nproducts, and electric machinery. That is just a small list of 500 \ndifferent products being hit. The American people are starting to take \nnotice.\n  I read in part from a letter I received from the Carpet Rug Institute \nheadquartered in Dalton, GA, stating:\n\n       The United States carpet industry produces 45 percent of \n     the world's carpet and is a $12 billion per year presence at \n     the mill.\n       The carpet industry is extremely competitive, both \n     domestically and worldwide, with profit margins cut razor \n     thin.\n       The potential of an increased duty in the form of a \n     punitive sanction may make the export of carpet and rug \n     products by any United States manufacturer in the European \n     Union market an economic impossibility. For the sake of the \n     collection of an excess tariff an entire industry may be made \n     to suffer.\n\n  And we are hearing:\n\n       Voices from across the country are asking relief from the \n     escalating Euro tax on our exports.\n\n  I will take a look at another letter signed by over 80 businesses and \ntrade associations. These organizations that signed the letter want to \nemphasize the urgency of resolving the FSC/ETI export tax issue as soon \nas possible. Quick action on legislation is necessary to both comply \nwith our WTO obligations and avoid or minimize retaliation against U.S. \nproducts.\n\n     . . . the European Union has increased the retaliatory \n     tariffs from 5 to 6 percent on as much as $4 billion per year \n     of American products.\n       These retaliatory tariffs are hurting the U.S. exports to \n     Europe at a time when they are just beginning to rebound in \n     the global economy and showing signs of renewed growth. \n     Moreover, the tariffs negatively impact American workers.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       We urge the Senate and House to pass FSC/ETI legislation \n     immediately and proceed to conference as soon as possible \n     thereafter.\n       Thank you . . . for doing your part to send FSC/ETI bill to \n     the President's desk without delay, thus minimizing the \n     economically devastating trade sanctions on U.S. products and \n     its impact on American workers who produce them.\n\n  These organizations span the entire Nation. This is not regional. \nAlmost every State is going to be impacted by this vote this afternoon.\n  So let's go to the Northeast: the Virginia Forestry Association, the \nAssociated Industries of Massachusetts, the Coalition of New England \nCompanies for Trade, and the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce.\n  From our part of the country, the Upper Midwest--the Presiding \nOfficer is from Minnesota; I am from Iowa--we have the Detroit Regional \nChamber of Commerce, the Minnesota Timber Producers Association, the \nMinnesota Agri-Growth Council, the Missouri Forest Products \nAssociation, and the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, we have the Pacific Coast Council of Custom \nBrokers and Freight Forwarders and the Softwood Export Council in the \nPacific Northwest.\n  From the West, we have the Utah Manufacturers Association, the \nCalifornia Manufacturers and Technology Association, and the California \nChamber of Commerce.\n  From the Plains States and the South, we have the Arkansas Forestry \nAssociation, the Louisiana Forestry Association, the Mississippi \nForestry Association, and the Texas Forestry Association.\n  From the Southeast, we have the Alabama Forestry Association, the \nPuerto Rico Manufacturers Association, the Tennessee Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry, and the North Carolina Forestry Association.\n  So as you can see, the entire country is impacted by this European \ntax on our exports to that part of the world. Some of the nationally \nimpacted associations include the Agriculture Retailers Association, \nthe American Architectural Manufacturers Association, the American \nCotton Shippers Council, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute, the American Peanut Council, the \nAmerican Soybean Association, the American Textile Manufacturers \nInstitute, the Manufacturing Jewelers and Suppliers of America, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the National Corn Growers \nAssociation, and the National Cotton Council. And that is just a \npartial list.\n  What communication to Members of Congress is all about is businesses \ncrying out for relief--not for the delay that we have already had for 1 \nmonth.\n  Let's be clear about what is at stake. American jobs are at stake \nbecause American competitiveness is at stake.\n  A vote against stopping debate is a vote against tax relief for \nAmerica's beleaguered manufacturing sector--tax relief that goes beyond \nnullifying this European tax.\n  A vote against stopping debate is a vote to prolong the pain across \nAmerica. A vote against stopping debate is a vote to increase the \nEuropean tax on American exporters yet more than the 6 percent already \nthere. A vote against stopping debate is a vote to deprive America's \nsmall exporters--because 90 percent of our exporters are small \nbusinesses of 100 employees or less--continued access to the European \nmarket, and access they may never regain.\n  If my colleagues vote against stopping debate, they might as well be \ntelling American manufacturing that the United States is closed for \nbusiness; that if you want access to the European export markets, you \nmight as well go overseas and do your business because Members of this \nCongress have refused to give these manufacturers the tools they need \nto compete.\n  There is an answer. Stop--stop playing political games; stop pushing \npolitical wish lists; stop jeopardizing economic recovery. Instead, \nstart supporting the ending of debate; start bringing this bill to \nfinality; support stopping debate and start enhancing the economic \nrecovery that is just around the corner in America's manufacturing \nsector if we do not snuff it out; support stopping debate and start the \nprocess that eliminates the European tax on our exports.\n\n  The choice is clear: Vote no, and you might make a few political \npoints but I think just for a short period of time. As this Euro-tax \ngoes up, people are laid off and you lose political points. Vote yes to \nstop debate and you are guaranteed to get economic progress.\n  So let's put aside our political games. Stop this debate. Move to \nfinality. Consider legitimate amendments. That is what this place is \nall about--legitimate amendments, not just making political comment.\n  I summarize this way: This is like moving the goalposts. We have \nheard a lot from the Democratic leadership which claims they support \nthis bipartisan bill. That is what we are hearing. I know that is what \nthey are telling their constituents as well. I am afraid the actions of \nthe Democratic leadership speak louder than their words. My sense is \nthat there is a political priority to deny President Bush an \nopportunity to sign a bipartisan bill either this summer or this fall. \nIt seems that the objective is to prevent that Rose Garden signing \nceremony from occurring.\n  Of course, the victims of this strategy happen to be those companies \nand those workers who are hit by this Euro-tax as it ratchets up. I \nhope I am wrong. But the record gives me pause. I would hope that those \non the other side would put the interests of firms and workers in their \nStates above that of partisan Presidential campaign strategy. If you \nlook at the record, you will see dramatic movements in terms of the \ndemands of people on the other side of the aisle to promote their \npolitical message amendments, most often nongermane.\n  This chart draws from a favorite activity that we have in the \nMidwest, for example, every time Iowa plays Minnesota, and I am \ntalking, obviously, about football. This jobs in manufacturing bill is \nnear the Senate goal line. Unfortunately, it seems politics is driving \nthe other side to move the goalposts.\n  When we came into session in January, Senator Frist was criticized by \nthe Democratic leadership for not moving right away this very bill, the \njobs in manufacturing bill. At that time, the goalpost was clear--just \n5 yards away. Then, after we were finished with the highway bill and a \ncouple other bills, Senator Frist attempted to go to this jobs in \nmanufacturing bill.\n  Much to my surprise, we were ambushed by the leadership of the other \nside with unrelated amendments. I thought I had an understanding with \nthe floor manager we were going to do amendments first that were \nrelated to the bill and then move to other amendments. That agreement \nwas not carried out. That event caught me off guard. So a second \ngoalpost appeared. It was the overtime amendment of my colleague from \nIowa.\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\n  Now, it did not matter that we had voted on it previously. It did not \nmatter that the amendment dealt with a proposed--not final but a \nproposed--Department of Labor regulation. None of that seemed to \nmatter. That amendment was, and is still, a show-stopper to this \nbipartisan bill. So we are at the second goalpost, as it has been \nmoved.\n  The demand of the leadership of the other side keeps changing. We \nwere talking about just a single-digit list of amendments and, for the \nmost part, hopefully germane amendments. We are not talking about that \nanymore. Now, since it looks like an overtime pay vote may be in the \npicture, there is a goalpost yet further away.\n  For the first time we are hearing of other amendments--not Finance \nCommittee jurisdiction amendments--such as an increase in the minimum \nwage, that are new showstoppers.\n  You can't finish this bill, we are told, even though we are told the \nsubstance is great. Nobody seems to disagree on the substance of this. \nSo why can't we get a bill to the President? Even though we don't \ndisagree on the substance, there is still a new goalpost. Heaven help \nus how all that turns out.\n  There is a final goalpost way out there; that is, getting to \nconference. We may move through all the goalposts, but then we may be \nblocked on whether we get to conference. I hope I am proven wrong in a \nfew minutes as we vote on this measure.\n  If we can't get cooperation from the other side, we have a couple \nalternatives: One, to go on with other business; two, to look at \nreconciliation in late spring. I don't want to go with either of those \noptions because we can finish this bill now. There is always a time \nwhen the Senate has goodwill between the two parties represented. That \ngoodwill hopefully will surface just as cream surfaces on milk.\n  Now it is time to get the job done. I hope we can pass this FSC/ETI \nlegislation. It is bipartisan. That is the only way you get things done \nin the Senate. Consequently, because it is bipartisan, we ought to get \nit done. And because it is bipartisan, it deserves better treatment \nthan it has received thus far.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3894-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wanted to take a couple moments and \nupdate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as to where we plan on \ngoing on a very important bill, the jobs in manufacturing bill that is \nbefore us.\n  The bill itself, first and foremost, is a critically important bill. \nWe have used the almost mnemonic JOBS bill, but it really does affect \nworkers, manufacturing, employment and, thus, it is critical. From \ntalking to the Democratic leadership and our leadership and the \nchairman and ranking member, we all agree we need to do everything \npossible to complete this legislation in a timely way because it is \nimportant to the American people. We have a bill that passed out of the \nFinance Committee 19 to 2 which, by definition, means it enjoyed broad \nand bipartisan support.\n  Now we have had two cloture votes that have failed. Both of those \ncloture votes are signals to stop, to obstruct the bill. Yet in our \nconversations, everybody agrees we need to do everything possible--\ntoday, tonight, tomorrow, and tomorrow night--to complete this bill. \nFirst and foremost, it is an important bill. From a procedural \nstandpoint and from what we do over the next hour or so, we are working \nhard to complete the list of amendments we will be addressing. We will \nhopefully be able to lock in that list at some point in time so we will \nhave a pathway for completion of the legislation.\n  Thirdly, there is a particular amendment, the Harkin amendment on \novertime, on which I have been clear. Once we have a plan to address \nall the potential scores of amendments in a reasonable way--hopefully \nstaying on amendments that directly impact the content of the bill \nitself, that are germane, although the interpretation of germaneness \nvaries on this floor--the overtime amendment will be considered and the \nHarkin amendment will be considered and voted upon. But what we ask is \nfor a list of amendments and a glide path to completion of the bill. \nLet people vote up or down, yes or no, for or against the bill so that \nwe can bring it to resolution.\n  First, this bill is important to workers. It is important to our \neconomy. Second, we are completing how we can put together a glide path \nto finish the legislation. Third, there is the overtime vote and a \ncompanion vote that will be side-by-side votes that will take place on \nthe overtime issue. We continue to work hard.\n  I withdraw the pending motion to proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             EVENTS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, a year ago come Friday, I remember watching \nwith some emotion as the television recorded the events in Baghdad, and \nan American soldier crawled up a statue of Saddam Hussein and put a \nchain around its neck and, with the help of American equipment, pulled \ndown that statue to the cheers of a throng of Iraqi people who had \nsuffered for decades under the tyranny of this vicious man, this mass \nmurderer, this fomenter and financier of world terrorism.\n  I saw that day people hungry for a chance at freedom, hungry for a \nchance to have a new beginning as a people and as a nation. I remember \nshedding some tears watching that scene. I reflected at the time that I \nwas watching a piece of American history not unlike the fall of the \nBerlin Wall, not unlike the surrender of the empire of Japan on the \nbattleship Missouri to General MacArthur, a moment in which I was \nseeing the values of American foreign policy displayed before the \nentire Earth.\n  As a Member of the Senate and as a student of American foreign policy \nhistory, I have always taken great pride in the fact that America does \nnot seek the treasury or the territory of other neighbors and nations. \nBut what we do say to the world is: We hold out and spread the values \nof our Bill of Rights, of our Constitution, of our Declaration of \nIndependence. We hold out values such as democracy, human rights, \nfreedom and liberty, the freedom of enterprise, the spreading of peace \nand prosperity, of domestic tranquility, of promoting the general \nwelfare and providing for the common defense of our people and our \nfriends. To me, that is what American foreign policy is about. I \nbelieve that is what it has always stood for.\n  So it is with particular sorrow that I reflect upon some of the \ncommentary upon our current action in Iraq. I was a new Member of the \nSenate. I had been here 2 years when President Clinton came to this \nbody and asked that we issue a resolution that called for regime change \nin Iraq.\n  President Clinton, after the expulsion of U.N. weapons inspectors, \nfelt compelled to rain bombs on Baghdad for 4 days and 4 nights in \norder to hit those targets where we believed weapons were held because \nthey had been declared, but not disclosed. President Clinton wisely \nwarned that, based on the intelligence he and other nations had in \ncommon, we would fight them now or fight them later.\n  President Clinton's warnings took on greater urgency for this Senator \nand for many of my colleagues in the light of 9/11, when still declared \nbut undisclosed weapons of mass destruction were in the hands of a \nterrorist nation and a sponsor of terrorism like Saddam Hussein. We \nfelt compelled to pursue the policy we all voted upon, to change the \nregime in Iraq for the safety of the American people, for the safety of \nthe free world.\n  As I recall that resolution, it was darn near unanimous, if not so. \nMy pride in that vote is we did it together, Republicans and Democrats. \nYet it is disappointing to me, as a Republican who stood with President \nClinton on so much foreign policy during the 1990s, when President \nBush, after 9/11, asked for support and following through on that \nresolution and 17 U.N. resolutions, this conflict has become \nincreasingly politicized.\n  I think it is important in my comments and in those of my colleagues \nthat we not question the patriotism of any of our colleagues who voted \notherwise or any of our colleagues who believed this is not the right \naction. But I do think it appropriate to question the wisdom of those \nwho would undermine this American initiative at a time when we need \nunity.\n  The comparison was made by one of my colleagues this is Vietnam \nagain. I think it is important, if we want to make that comparison, we \npoint out how many inconsistencies there are to Vietnam. But I think it \nis also well to remember Ho Chi Minh said the Vietnam war would not be \nwon by them in the streets of Saigon, but in the streets of San \nFrancisco, Chicago, New York, and Washington. The whole point of his \ncomment at that time was the way you beat America is not to beat them \nmilitarily but to beat their will at home. I think that is what is \nbeing called into question.\n  What is our will? What are our purposes? For this Senator, my will is \nwe\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nmust win. My vote has been for this action, both under President \nClinton and now under President Bush. It is unfortunate that some now \ncall for policies which amount to retreat and loss. I cannot think of a \nmore devastating result for America's place and purpose in this world \nthan for us to fail at this time.\n  We must win. We must not have the will of the American people broken \nto the naysayers of today. We have to continue to stand up for the \nvalues of freedom embodied in our founding documents, the values of \ndemocracy, the values of human rights, the values of enterprise and \nfreedom. Those are the things we hold out to the people of Iraq.\n  I was stopped in the hall by a reporter who asked if in fact it was \ntrue American military forces fired a missile into a mosque in Baghdad. \nI did not know the answer until I inquired. Now it is all on the news \nand, in fact, there was a missile fired in the direction of a mosque. \nThe reason it was is because five American soldiers were shot from that \nmosque as they tried to advance through the streets to secure the \nsecurity of that area.\n  I say for the record murderers and terrorists must not find sanctuary \nbehind the cloak of religion in any place. There should be no sanctuary \nfor people such as these. So if the American forces made the decision \nto fire where they were being fired upon, I say: Well done and do it \nagain. Let them find no sanctuary anywhere if their purpose is to deny \nthe American forces the ability to provide security, if their purpose \nis to undo this Nation's effort in establishing democracy for the \npeople of Iraq. They have suffered too long; they have suffered \ntorture, maiming, rape rooms, weapons of mass destruction, at the hands \nof a brutal dictator. There are a few--I mean a decided minority--in \nIraq who will not win from the values we enjoy because they won under \nthe tyranny of Saddam Hussein. They must not be allowed to win now.\n\n  I plead with my colleagues, patriots all, be careful in the words we \nuse, be wise in what we say, so we do not give aid and comfort to the \nenemies of that country, the fomenters of terrorism; that we do what we \nhave set out to do, and that is to remove a regime that was bent on \ntyranny, fomenting terror, and financing it wherever it could; and that \nwe follow through with the promises made by this Government and the \nprevious one, President Clinton and President Bush, that democracy can \nhave a new beginning--in fact, a first chance--on the streets of \nArabia. This is our purpose, and may we win. We will win sooner if we \nwatch our words and we weigh them on the scales of wisdom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending business is S. 1637, \nthe JOBS Act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n    Congratulating the Men's and Women's University of Connecticut \n                            Basketball Teams\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with a strong note of celebration in \nmy voice on behalf of my small State. The presiding officer lives in \nthe same region of the country I do, so I suspect there is a sense of \ncollective regional pride as well.\n  I am sorry my colleague Senator Lieberman isn't here. He will be here \ntomorrow. Today is a religious holiday, so he could not be in the \nSenate today. I am sorry he is not here on one level; but on another \nlevel, every time one of the University of Connecticut teams wins, he \ndoes the UCONN cheer on the floor of the Senate, which causes his \nsenior colleague a significant degree of embarrassment. He knows this, \nand I think he enjoys doing it when I am here. So, the one piece of \ngood news I have is I won't have to listen to that cheer tomorrow \nbecause I myself will be away tomorrow.\n  I want to take a few minutes to recognize and celebrate a remarkable \nhistorical achievement that occurred both on Monday and Tuesday nights \nof this week. I speak of the men's and women's national collegiate \nbasketball championships. Never before in history has a single \nuniversity captured both of those titles in the same year, so my \ncolleagues and others, I am sure, will understand the sense of pride we \nall feel in Connecticut for the tremendous historic accomplishments of \nthese two wonderful teams--both the men's and women's teams. UCONN's \nachievement is stunning all the more because when you consider the \nprevious four times in history a school sent both of its men's and \nwomen's teams to the Final Four in the same year, those schools failed \nto come away with so much as one national championship, let alone two \nin the same year.\n  Let me briefly recognize both of these teams. While it is certainly a \nuniversity-wide celebration over the accomplishments of both, each \ndeserves a moment of special recognition for their achievement.\n  I will begin with the men's team. Those who follow college basketball \nwill recall on the cover of ``Sports Illustrated,'' the University of \nConnecticut men's team was predicted to win the national championship.\n  They were the No. 1 ranked team in the country. Shortly thereafter, \nin November, they faced, ironically, a Georgia Tech team which handed \nthem a rather significant defeat. Ironic I say because it was Georgia \nTech that the University of Connecticut faced on Monday night for the \nnational championship.\n  All told, the UConn Huskies would lose six games all season. For most \nteams, that would be reason to celebrate, having won 33 games and \nlosing 6. In the Huskies' case, with each loss, more and more people \naround the country began to doubt whether the University of \nConnecticut's team had what it would take to go on to win a national \ntitle.\n  To make matters worse, throughout the season, the Huskies' \noutstanding center, Emeka Okafor, was troubled with a series of back \ninjuries and spasms and was unable to play at his full measure of \ncapability. He was certainly the heart and soul of the team. He scored \npoints, grabbed rebounds, and blocked shots. He is the leader in the \ncountry in that last category.\n  His accomplishments went far beyond his statistics. His mere presence \non the floor was fundamentally enough to alter the game. He is that \nmuch of a leader.\n  Even more impressive than Emeka's athletic credentials are his \nacademic ones. We fail to promote academic success. Emeka Okafor is not \nonly the No. 1 basketball player in the country, but he is also the Big \nEast Scholar-Athlete of the Year and the National Academic All-American \nof the year.\n  While he was putting up impressive numbers on the basketball court, \nEmeka was an all-star in the classroom as well. He earned his degree in \nfinance in 3 years with a GPA in excess of 3.8.\n  A lesser team might have given up hope after losing a player of Emeka \nOkafor's ability, but a pivotal series was the Big East Tournament \nwhere he had to sit out two games. Ben Gordon, a very talented guard \nfor the University of Connecticut, took over the leadership role, along \nwith Rashad Anderson, Taliek Brown, and others. They went on to win six \nstraight games and capture the national title.\n  One of the most important games, of course, was the Saturday night \ngame in which by a margin of 1 point, UConn defeated the Blue Devils--a \nvery heated rivalry going back a number of years--facing a remarkable \nDuke team under the leadership of Mike Krzyzewski. We are all very \nappreciative of his abilities and the teams he put together, but \nbeating Duke has a special significance in the UConn-Duke rivalry. We \nare very proud of the men's team. They had a terrific season. They \ncertainly deserve some special recognition. Jim Calhoun, who is a good \npersonal friend of mine--I am very proud of Jim's accomplishments. My \nonly regret is that on Monday he was not selected to be in the Hall of \nFame. I think he deserved it.\n  If it was up to my vote, he would have had it. His accomplishments \nover the years, both at Northeastern and the University of Connecticut, \nmore than qualify him for a special place in the Basketball Hall of \nFame. Being only one of three active coaches at the collegial level to \nhave won two national championships, Jim Calhoun deserves a spot in the \nHall of Fame. I am\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\nconfident he will get one soon. I am sorry it did not occur on the day \nhe won another championship, on Monday.\n  My congratulations to Jim for a wonderful season, a great leadership \non that team. His assistant coaches, Tom Moore, George Blaney, and \nClyde Vaughan--good friends of mine--and the players, Rashad Anderson, \nHilton Armstrong, Jason Baisch, Josh Boone, Denham Brown, Taliek Brown, \nJustin Evanovich, Ben Gordon, Ed Nelson, I mentioned Emeka Okafor, Ryan \nSwaller, Ryan Thompson, Shamon Tooles, Charlie Villanueva, Marcus \nWhite, and Marcus Williams, all made significant accomplishments.\n  The women's team, of course, was also a great success. This is the \nthird consecutive national championship they have won, really a \nremarkable record only having been achieved once before, ironically, by \nthe Tennessee team they defeated last evening under the leadership of \nPat Summitt.\n\n  Over the past decade or so, the UConn women's basketball team has \nbecome synonymous with excellence across the country. The numbers they \nhave piled up are rather staggering: 5 national titles, 8 appearances \nin the Final Four, and a record winning streak of 70 consecutive games. \nOver the same period of time, women's basketball in America has \nexperienced an enormous surge in popularity, and the University of \nConnecticut women are a major reason why. They have been an inspiration \nto young girls all across our Nation who dream of being basketball \nstars. Their combination of athletic skills, academic excellence, and \ngood sportsmanship have made them role models for young men and young \nwomen across the country.\n  Things did not come easily for this women's team this year. Much like \nthe men's team, the women's team had a tough run in the early days. On \nJanuary 3, they lost a heartbreaker to Duke by 1 point. It was their \nfirst home loss in 4 years. For the second straight year, they were \neliminated in the Big East Tournament. This year, when the seedings \nwere announced for the NCAA Tournament, UConn received the No. 2 seed, \nmeaning they were not even favored to make it to the Final Four. But as \nthey have done so many times in the past, this wonderful team of \ntalented young women exceeded all expectations. They were led, once \nagain, by the outstanding All-American senior, Diana Taurasi, the \nNational Player of the Year. She is a remarkable athlete, a remarkable \nperson, not unlike Emeka Okafor. She is a presence on the floor. Anyone \nwho watched the game last evening, a wonderful game between Tennessee \nand the University of Connecticut, could see this remarkable young \nwoman and the leadership she brought to her team.\n  The team has gone 22-1 in tournament games under Diana Taurasi's \nstoried career. She is only the fifth player to win two Naismith Player \nof the Year awards.\n  She has scored the second most points of any player in the women's \nNCAA Tournament history. She was also named Outstanding Player of the \nYear in the Final Four.\n  It was a great game last evening against Tennessee. It has been a \nwonderful rivalry. Unlike the University of Connecticut and Duke \nrivalry, the University of Connecticut and Tennessee rivalry is a great \none.\n  My friend from Tennessee, the majority leader, I point out very \ngraciously, about 8:15 last evening, about 15 minutes prior to the \nUConn-Tennessee game, called and offered a polite wager. I am somewhat \ndisturbed by it. I appreciate it. He offered to wager that if UConn won \nthe game that he would supply me with as many spareribs as I could eat. \nFor a heart surgeon, who happens to be the majority leader, to offer a \nDemocratic member of the Chamber a pile of spareribs makes me wonder \nwhat his ultimate goal may have been in that wager.\n  I have won the wager. I offered him a high protein, very low caloric \nConnecticut River shad, of which the Presiding Officer is well aware. \nThe Connecticut River provides a border of his State.\n  Connecticut River shad is high in protein, low caloric, the kind of \nproposal one would think a heart surgeon would propose. No, he offered \nspareribs--thick, juicy, fat-loaded spareribs--for this senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut to consume. I will share those with any good \nRepublicans I can find in my State as part of those winnings.\n  I conclude by congratulating the women's coach Geno Auriemma, who is \na wonderful friend, as well as Jim Calhoun. He has had a wonderful \ncareer at the University of Connecticut, and has been a wonderful role \nmodel for players, coaches, and others. He is very active in our State, \nas is Jim Calhoun. It goes beyond their leadership of the basketball \nprograms. He is very active in philanthropic programs throughout our \nState, and is always willing to appear at various events on behalf of \nworthy causes.\n  My congratulations to Geno Auriemma for the terrific job he has done, \nhis assistant coaches, Chris Dailey, a wonderful assistant coach over \nthe years, Tonya Cardoza, and Jamelle Elliott. And the players: I \nmentioned Diana Taurasi, Ashley Valley, Kiana Robinson, Maria Conlon \nfrom Derby, CT, Stacey Marron, Morgan Valley, Nicole Wolff, Ashley \nBattle, Willnett Crockett, Jessica Moore, Barbara Turner, Liz Sherwood, \nand Ann Strother. Ann played a wonderful game last night, as did Maria \nConlon, and also the forwards on that team, Barbara Turner and Willnett \nCrockett, were terrific as well.\n  Congratulations to these two great teams. I have taken a longer time. \nWhen you have two national champions at the same university in the same \nyear, I hope my colleagues will accept my apologies for taking more \ntime than would normally be the case. We have to export our sport \nallegiance. We have no professional teams in my State. As my colleague \nknows, in Connecticut you can almost tell where somebody lives by \nasking them whether they are a Red Sox or a Yankee fan, a Rangers or \nBruin fan, a Knicks or Celtics fan. Connecticut is equally divided in \nits sports allegiance.\n  So all my life I have had to embrace teams outside of my own State. \nThis wonderful collegiate athletic performance by the University of \nConnecticut has given us a wonderful sense of pride in our State. In \nthe midst of otherwise bad news coming out of other parts of the world, \nI thought I would offer this tidbit of good news from a small corner of \nour country called Connecticut, with great pride for these wonderful \nathletes and their coaches, and fans at the University of Connecticut \nand throughout our State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague on the success \nof his two teams, both of which were truly outstanding. I particularly \ncommend his women's basketball team because before their showdown with \nTennessee, they beat an outstanding team from the University of \nMinnesota, which reached the semifinals and the final four for the \nfirst time in the team's history and was lead by two outstanding \nplayers, Lindsay Whalen from Minnesota and Janel McCarville from the \nneighboring State of Wisconsin, but we have adopted her as a Minnesotan \nnow, and the two of them have achieved the distinction of being Kodak \nall-Americans. They led the team, which gave us enormous pride in \nMinnesota, until they met an outstanding Connecticut team. And they had \nan excellent game on Sunday night, which, unfortunately, from our \nstandpoint, went Connecticut's way. But the Senator certainly has two \nteams of which to be very proud.\n  I also might note, as the Senator from Connecticut knows because we \nhave had the occasion to be at the White House together, President Bush \nhas very graciously the last years that I have been there invited the \nwinners of the women's and men's basketball championships and the \nwinners of the men's and women's hockey national championships to the \nWhite House for a ceremony.\n  I am pleased to say I will be joining the Senator from Connecticut \nagain this year because the University of Minnesota women's hockey team \nwon the national championship the weekend before and, in fact, the \nUniversity of Minnesota-Duluth men's hockey team is in the chosen four \nwhich begins this Thursday night. So I am very hopeful we will have \nonly Senators from two States attending that ceremony from Connecticut \nin basketball and Minnesota in hockey. But in either\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\nevent, thanks to the outstanding performance of the Minnesota women's \nhockey team, which I must acknowledge as a Yale graduate defeated \nHarvard 6 to 2 in the finals, much to my enormous satisfaction, but \njust had a terrific year, it was rated No. 1 throughout the year and \nprevailed in the national championship. It shows, as the Senator noted, \nwomen's basketball is the same as women's hockey. Under the auspices of \ntitle IX and the opportunities now that have been given to women \nathletes starting as young girls, they have equal opportunity to play \nthese sports. Their talents and skills are every bit as good as men's, \nand they are phenomenal athletes and delights to watch as they play \nthese games with the highest level of proficiency. It is something that \nas Americans we should be proud of, the fact that we have made that \nadvance and that girls are no longer relegated to being cheerleaders \nfor men's sports or boys' sports, as they were when I was growing up, \nbut now have shown themselves to be remarkable athletes in their own \nright far advanced to anything that I could have accomplished as a \nmeager athlete back in my day.\n  So I will see the Senator at the White House.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield, and I appreciate the comments \nand give congratulations, the Minnesota women's team is a great team. \nIn fact, a mutual friend of ours, a former member of the other body and \nI, Rick Nolan, who my colleague knows very well, talked the other \nnight, and after the game he told me that Geno Auriemma, coach of the \nwomen's team, was quoted extensively in the Minnesota newspapers and \nradio stations on commending the Minnesota team. He said it reminded \nhim very much of an earlier UConn women's basketball team when they \nwere starting out. I cannot tell the Senator how impressed I was with \nMiss Whalen and Miss McCarville. They are great players. I love their \ntenacity and emotion. Your coaches--you have had three coaches in 3 \nyears--have had some difficult times to go through. I thought the game \nbetween Minnesota and Duke was one of the great women's basketball \nteams of all time. I suspect we are going to hear a lot more from \nMinnesota not only in hockey but in basketball as well.\n\n  I am glad my colleague mentioned title IX. I meant to mention it as \nwell. Back in January, I invited a former colleague of ours, Birch Bayh \nof Indiana, to come to Connecticut to a women's basketball game. The \nreason I invited our former colleague and the father of our present \ncolleague, Evan Bayh, was because in 1972, Birch Bayh was the author of \ntitle IX. There were a lot of other Members involved; I do not want to \nsuggest he was the only one, but he was the principal author of title \nIX. I thought he might like to come and watch what a change he had made \nin America.\n  It was not solely because of Birch Bayh, but he certainly deserves to \nbe recognized for authoring that bill. To give my colleague some idea, \nabout 15 years ago a national championship game for the women's \nbasketball game drew maybe 1,500 people. Last night, there were 19,000 \npeople in New Orleans to watch the game. I suspect millions across the \ncountry were tuned in to watch Tennessee and the University of \nConnecticut play.\n  So we brought Birch Bayh to Connecticut on that day when the \nUniversity of Connecticut was playing Notre Dame. We had about 15,000 \npeople on hand that afternoon, and at halftime we had some of the \nleaders of the women's teams over the years. We had a group of younger \nwomen just starting out at center court. Birch Bayh received a standing \novation from 15,000 people in Connecticut because he made a difference \nin this sport.\n  As my colleague has said, to see fathers and daughters, fathers and \ngranddaughters, young boys and sisters coming to watch these young, \nremarkable women athletes, created a change in our country for the \nbetter. I look forward to the day when we will gather at the White \nHouse--I am confident President Bush will do this again because of his \ngreat love of sport--when he invites the men's and women's basketball \nteams from the University of Connecticut. Let me go on record today \ninviting, as well, not only the women's hockey team from Minnesota but \nthe men's hockey team from Minnesota.\n  I thank my colleague for his nice compliments about Connecticut.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank my colleague. I think we are in a position where \nwe can come to an agreement on that. I am not sure many of our \ncolleagues would agree, but the Senator is right. In fact, I read over \nthe weekend that the women's semifinal basketball games outdrew the \nmen's in the national televised audience. That is not to say anything \ndisparaging about the men because they had an outstanding tournament as \nwell. It shows the popularity of the sport among all Americans. \nCertainly, the skill level to which it is played is something that \nanybody, even a couch potato like this Senator, can enjoy.\n  The Senator is right, also, that the President has been extremely \ngracious in hosting these teams. I think he recognizes how much of a \nthrill it is for the teams that have dedicated themselves all year to \nthis level of national proficiency to be able to be recognized by the \nPresident of the United States; it is a great achievement for all of \nthem. I look forward to the President's invitation. He has been very \ngracious in the past, and I look forward to joining my friend, the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3898-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3898-S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SAFE ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor S. 1709, the Security and Freedom Ensured Act, the SAFE Act, \nwhich Senator Larry Craig and I have introduced with several of our \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n  The SAFE Act is a narrowly tailored bill that would revise several \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. It would safeguard the rights of \ninnocent Americans without impeding law enforcement's ability to fight \nterrorism. The SAFE Act is supported by a broad coalition of \norganizations and individuals from across the political spectrum.\n  I challenge any of my colleagues to find the broad base of political \nsupport for virtually any bill that we have found for the SAFE Act.\n  I voted for the PATRIOT Act. I believed then and I still believe that \nthe act made many reasonable and necessary changes in the law. However, \nthe PATRIOT Act contains several provisions that do not adequately \nprotect innocent Americans from unwarranted Government surveillance. \nThe FBI now has broad authority to obtain a ``John Doe'' roving wiretap \nwhich does not identify the person or place being tapped. The FBI has \nauthority now to conduct sneak-and-peek searches and to seize personal \nrecords.\n  The PATRIOT Act was passed at a critical moment in the history of the \nUnited States. It was a moment of tragedy and fear. Now with more than \n2 years of hindsight and experience, it is time to revisit this law.\n  I can recall--and I am sure all who followed this debate can \nremember--how we felt after September 11. Just a few steps away from \nthis Chamber, I was meeting in a room with Senator Daschle and a group \nof Senators and we saw on television the images which every American \nhas seared in their memory. Then someone suggested a bomb had gone off \nat the Pentagon. We gathered by the windows and looked down this \nbeautiful Mall toward the Washington Monument and saw black smoke \nbillowing across the Potomac, unaware at that moment another airplane \nhad struck that building, killing many innocent Americans.\n\n  It was a time of great concern and great anxiety and great unity. The \nadministration came to us and said to the Congress, Give us the tools \nto find the people responsible for this terrible American tragedy. Give \nus what we need to protect Americans and to fight the war on terrorism.\n  In a rare showing of bipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans \ncame together and addressed some of the most difficult and complicated \nquestions about Government authority and\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nindividual freedom we have had to address in our history. I am proud to \nsay in a short period of time there was a bipartisan consensus, a \nconsensus which tried to work out the best way to meet the requirements \nof the administration and to make America safe.\n  Many of these provisions were worrisome. We were not certain whether \nwe had gone too far in giving the Government more authority and \nAmericans fewer freedoms than necessary. So we included in the PATRIOT \nAct sunset provisions. Basically, what that means is that over some \nperiod of time, a year or two, these provisions would expire and be \nsubject to renewal and reapproval by Congress. Of course, at that point \nwe would be forced to assess their impact.\n  Interestingly, since that day, from some quarters, the volume has \ngrown in support of basically eliminating the sunset provisions and \nsaying this will be permanent law and we will not revisit it. However, \nmany have looked at the PATRIOT Act, including Senator Craig and \nmyself, and feel there are four specific areas of the Act that should \nbe amended by our SAFE Act. Senator Craig, a Republican, and myself, as \na Democrat, reached across the partisan divide to work together on this \nbill. It is quite an unusual political marriage. Senator John Sununu, \nalso a cosponsor, joked that when Senator Craig and Senator Durbin \nintroduce a bill together, it proves one thing: One of them must not \nhave read it.\n  Well, that is not true. We have both read the SAFE Act. Our \ncooperation on this piece of legislation speaks volumes about the need \nto make changes in the PATRIOT Act.\n  Some claim because we are at war, the American people want the \nGovernment to keep them safe, no matter what. I think they are wrong. \nThe American people care very deeply about their freedoms. They are \nwatching Congress carefully and they are concerned that perhaps in some \nareas we went too far in passing the PATRIOT Act. I have heard from a \nlot of my constituents. 275 communities in 39 states have passed \nresolutions expressing concern about the provisions of the PATRIOT Act. \nThese communities represent close to 50 million Americans. Almost one \nout of every six Americans has, through their elected representatives \nin their communities, expressed some concern about the provisions of \nthe PATRIOT Act.\n  Let me be very frank about the bill itself. The PATRIOT Act was over \n130 pages long. It is very complicated. Most Americans have not read \nevery word of it. Many Americans who may not be able to explain the \nexact details of the PATRIOT Act still are concerned it is restricting \ntheir freedoms unnecessarily.\n  Some argue this means we should not take the American people so \nseriously because they cannot cite specific sections of the bill. I \ndisagree. There is no reason to dismiss these public concerns. And this \nis no excuse for inaction. The burden of proof is not on the American \npeople when the Government seeks to take away their rights and \nliberties. The burden of proof is on the Government.\n  What is clear is the American people want us to strike a balance, \ngive the FBI and law enforcement and intelligence agencies the powers \nthey need to fight terrorism but also to protect American liberty. That \nis what the SAFE Act would do.\n  An unusual thing has occurred with the introduction of this bill. I \nhave been on Capitol Hill for over two decades working in the House and \nin the Senate. I have never seen this happen before. The Bush \nadministration announced with the introduction of the bill they would \nveto it. The bill has not been considered before a committee. It has \nnot been subject to amendment in committee. It has not been debated in \ncommittee. It has not come to the floor of the House or the Senate, nor \nhas it been subject to debate and amendment there. There is no final \nwork product, only the initial offering by Senator Craig and myself.\n  Based on that and that alone, the Bush administration has said they \nare going to oppose this bill and they are going to veto this bill. I \nhave never seen anything quite like that.\n  The Justice Department argues our bill would eliminate some PATRIOT \nAct powers and make it even more difficult to effectively fight \nterrorism. Frankly, these objections do not hold water. The SAFE Act \nneither repeals any provision of the PATRIOT Act nor amends pre-PATRIOT \nAct law. In fact, the SAFE Act retains the expanded powers created by \nthe PATRIOT Act while placing important checks on these powers.\n  Senator Craig and I wrote a letter responding in detail to the \nJustice Department's objections to the bill and their threat to veto \nthe bill, which has not even passed either the House or the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 2004.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to request that you schedule a \n     hearing in the Judiciary Committee as soon as possible on S. \n     1709, the Security and Freedom Ensured (SAFE) Act, a \n     narrowly-tailored, bipartisan bill that would amend several \n     provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56). We would \n     also like to take this opportunity to respond to concerns the \n     Justice Department has raised regarding the SAFE Act.\n       We voted for the PATRIOT Act and believe now, as we did \n     then, that the PATRIOT Act made many reasonable and necessary \n     changes in the law. However, the PATRIOT Act contains several \n     provisions that create unnecessary risks that the activities \n     of innocent Americans may be monitored without adequate \n     judicial oversight.\n       This concern is shared by a broad coalition of \n     organizations and individuals from across the political \n     spectrum. In fact, 257 communities in 38 states--representing \n     approximately 43.5 million people--have passed resolutions \n     opposing or expressing concern about the PATRIOT Act. Groups \n     as politically diverse as the ACLU and the American \n     Conservation Union have also endorsed changes in the law.\n       In his State of the Union address, the President called for \n     reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. Given the bipartisan \n     concerns about the most controversial provisions of the law, \n     however, this will not happen unless these provisions are \n     revisited. Congress, in fact, made oversight of the PATRIOT \n     Act implicit by sunsetting over a dozen sections of the bill \n     at the time of its passage.\n       S. 1709, the SAFE Act, was drafted with this oversight in \n     mind. It was drafted to clarify and amend in a minor way the \n     PATRIOT Act's most troubling provisions so that whole or even \n     piecemeal repeal of the law would be unnecessary. It was \n     drafted to safeguard the liberties of law-abiding citizens \n     while preserving the law enforcement authorities essential to \n     a successful war on terror.\n       The Administration unfortunately has threatened to veto the \n     SAFE Act. The Justice Department argues that the SAFE Act \n     would ``eliminate'' some PATRIOT tools and ``make it even \n     more difficult to mount an effective anti-terror campaign \n     than it was before the PATRIOT Act was passed.''\n       We respectfully disagree with the Justice Department's \n     objections to our reasoned and measured effort to mend the \n     PATRIOT Act. The SAFE Act neither repeals any provision of \n     the PATRIOT Act, nor impedes law enforcement's ability to \n     investigate terrorism by amending pre-PATRIOT Act law. \n     Rather, the SAFE Act retains the expanded powers created by \n     the PATRIOT Act while restoring important checks and balances \n     on powers including roving wiretaps, ``sneak and peek'' \n     warrants, compelled production of personal records, and \n     National Security Letters.\n\n\n                            Roving Wiretaps\n\n       The SAFE Act would place reasonable checks on the use of \n     roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes. Normally, when the \n     government seeks a warrant authorizing a wiretap, its \n     application must specify both the target (the individual) and \n     the facilities (the telephone or computer) that will be \n     tapped. Roving wiretaps, which do not require the government \n     to specify the facilities to be tapped, are designed to allow \n     law enforcement to tract targets who evade surveillance by \n     frequently changing facilities. Before the PATRIOT Act, \n     roving wiretaps were only permitted for criminal, not \n     intelligence, investigations. The PATRIOT Act authorized the \n     FBI to use roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes for the \n     first time.\n       Using roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes is \n     important. Unfortunately, the PATRIOT Act did not include \n     sufficient checks to protect innocent Americans from \n     unwarranted government surveillance. Under the PATRIOT Act, \n     the FBI is not required to determine whether the target of \n     the wiretap is present at the place being wiretapped, as it \n     is for criminal wiretaps.\n       The Intelligence Authorization Act of 2002 made another \n     dramatic change in the law. The FBI is now permitted to \n     obtain a ``John Doe'' roving wiretap for intelligence \n     purposes, an authority not authorized in any other context. A \n     ``John Doe'' roving wiretap does not specify the target of \n     the wiretap or\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\n     the place to be wiretapped. In other words, the FBI can \n     obtain a wiretap without saying whom they want to wiretap or \n     where they want to wiretap.\n       The Justice Department defends this authority by noting \n     that even if the target of the wiretap is not identified, a \n     description of the target is required. The law does not \n     require the description to include any specific level of \n     detail, however. It could be as broad as, for example, \n     ``white man'' or ``Hispanic woman.'' Such a general \n     description does not adequately protect innocent Americans \n     from unwarranted government surveillance.\n       The SAFE Act would retain the PATRIOT Act's authorization \n     of roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes but impose \n     reasonable limits on this authority. Law enforcement would \n     be required to ascertain the presence of the target before \n     beginning surveillance and identify either the target of \n     the wiretap or the place to be wiretapped. The FBI would \n     not be able to obtain ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps, \n     thereby ensuring that the government does not surveil \n     innocent Americans who are not the target of the wiretap.\n       The Justice Department argues that ``John Don'' roving \n     wiretaps are necessary because there may be circumstances \n     where the government knows a target's physical description \n     but not his identity. If the government is tracking a suspect \n     closely enough to utilize a wiretap, it is unlikely his or \n     her identity will be unknown to them. In this unusual \n     circumstance, the SAFE Act would permit the issuance of a \n     ``John Doe'' wiretap which would not identify the target but \n     rather the facilities to be wiretapped. If the government \n     wished to obtain a roving wiretap, they could do so by \n     identifying the target. It is important to note that the \n     government is not required to identify the target by his or \n     her actual name. The government, for example, could identify \n     the target by an alias. This level of detail should be \n     required to make clear who is being targeted to prevent \n     innocent people with no relationship to the target from being \n     spied upon.\n\n\n                      ``sneak and peek'' searches\n\n       The SAFE Act would impose reasonable limits on the issuance \n     of delayed notification (or ``sneak and peek'') search \n     warrants. A sneak and peek warrant permits law enforcement to \n     conduct a search without notifying the target until sometime \n     after the search has occurred. The Justice Department argues \n     that sneak and peek warrants for physical evidence ``had been \n     available for decades before the PATRIOT Act was passed,'' \n     but such warrants were never statutorily authorized before \n     the passage of the PATRIOT Act. Too, though some courts have \n     permitted sneak and peek warrants in limited circumstances, \n     the Supreme Court has never ruled on their constitutionality.\n       In codifying sneak and peek warrants, Section 213 of the \n     PATRIOT Act did not adopt limitations on this authority that \n     courts had recognized. For example, courts have required a \n     presumptive seven-day limit on the delay of notice. Section \n     213 requires notice of the search within ``a reasonable \n     period,'' which is not defined. According to the Justice \n     Department, this has resulted in delays of up to 90 days, and \n     of ``unspecified duration lasting until the indictment was \n     unsealed.''\n       Section 213 authorizes issuance of a sneak and peek warrant \n     where it finds that providing immediate notice of the warrant \n     would have an ``adverse result,'' as defined by 18 U.S.C. \n     Section 2705. Section 2705, which allows delayed notice for \n     searches of stored wire and electronic communications, \n     defines adverse result very broadly, including any \n     circumstances ``otherwise seriously jeopardizing an \n     investigation or unduly delaying a trial.'' This catch-all \n     provision could arguably apply in almost every case. A sneak \n     and peek search of a home involves a much greater degree of \n     intrusiveness than a seizure of wire or electronic \n     communications, so this broad standard for delaying notice is \n     inappropriate. Section 213 also does not limit delayed \n     notification warrants to terrorism investigations, and unlike \n     many surveillance-related PATRIOT Act provisions, does not \n     sunset.\n       Last year, an overwhelming majority in the House of \n     Representatives voted to repeal Section 213. The SAFE Act \n     would not go nearly this far. It would place modest limits on \n     the government's ability to obtain sneak and peek warrants, \n     while still permitting broad use of this authority.\n       The SAFE Act would still authorize a sneak and peek warrant \n     in a broad set of specific circumstances: where notice of the \n     warrant would endanger the life or physical safety of an \n     individual, result in flight from prosecution, or result in \n     the destruction of or tampering with the evidence sought \n     under the warrant. Importantly, it would eliminate the catch-\n     all authorization of sneak and peek authority in any \n     circumstances ``otherwise seriously jeopardizing an \n     investigation or unduly delaying a trial.'' It would require \n     notification of a covert search within seven days, but would \n     authorize unlimited additional seven-day delays so long as \n     any circumstance that would justify a delay of notice \n     continues to exist. According to the Justice Department, \n     ``the most common period of delay'' under Section 213 is \n     seven days, so a seven-day limit with court-authorized \n     extensions is not overly onerous but would prevent abuse.\n       The Justice Department states that the SAFE Act imposes \n     restrictions on the issuance of sneak and peek warrants that \n     could tip off terrorists, and ``thus enable their associates \n     to go into hiding, flee, change their plans, or even \n     accelerate their plots.'' To the contrary, the SAFE Act would \n     authorize issuance of a sneak and peek warrant in all of \n     these circumstances. If notice of the warrant could lead \n     terrorists or their associates to hide or flee, a court could \n     delay notice to prevent flight from prosecution. If notice of \n     the warrant could lead terrorists or their associates to \n     change or accelerate their plots, a court could delay notice \n     to prevent the resulting danger to life or physical safety. \n     The Constitution protects the sanctity of our homes, and we \n     should only allow this sanctity to be breached in such \n     serious circumstances.\n\n\n                Compelled Production of Personal Records\n\n       The SAFE Act would place reasonable checks on the \n     government's authority to compel production of library and \n     other personal records. Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act \n     permits law enforcement to obtain such records without \n     individualized suspicion and with minimal judicial oversight. \n     Before the PATRIOT Act, FISA authorized the FBI to seek a \n     court order for the production of records from four types of \n     businesses: common carriers, public accommodations \n     facilities, physical storage facilities, and vehicle rental \n     facilities. In order to obtain such records, the FBI was \n     required to state specific and articulable facts showing \n     reason to believe that the person to whom the records relate \n     was a terrorist or a spy. If a court found that there were \n     such facts, it would issue the order.\n       Under FISA as modified by Section 215, the FBI is \n     authorized to compel production of ``any tangible things \n     (including books, records, papers, documents, and other \n     items)'' not just records, from any entity, not just the four \n     types of businesses previously covered. The FBI is only \n     required to certify that the records are ``sought for'' an \n     international terrorism or intelligence investigation, a \n     standard even lower than relevance. The FBI need not show \n     that the documents relate to a suspected terrorist or spy. \n     If the FBI makes the required certification, the court no \n     longer has the authority to examine the accuracy of the \n     certification or ask for more facts to support it; the \n     court ``shall'' issue the order. Defenders of Section 215 \n     frequently assert that the issuance of an order for \n     records requires court approval, but this type of court \n     approval amounts to little more than a rubber stamp. The \n     PATRIOT Act gives the government too much power to seize \n     the personal records of innocent Americans who are not \n     suspected of involvement in terrorism or espionage.\n       The SAFE Act retains the PATRIOT Act's expansion of the \n     business records provision to cover ``any tangible things'' \n     and any entity. It would reinstate the pre-PATRIOT Act \n     standard for compelling production of business records, which \n     requires individualized suspicion. The FBI would be required \n     to certify that there are specific and articulable facts \n     giving reason to believe that the person to whom the records \n     relate is a terrorist or a spy. A court would be required to \n     issue the order if it found that there are such facts. The \n     SAFE Act would thus prevent broad fishing expeditions which \n     waste scarce government resources, are unlikely to produce \n     useful information, and can infringe upon privacy rights.\n       The Justice Department argues that this standard is \n     inappropriate because it is higher than the relevance \n     standard under which federal grand juries can subpoena \n     records. This ignores some crucial distinctions. The \n     recipient of a grand jury subpoena can challenge the subpoena \n     in court and tell others, including those whose records are \n     sought, about the subpoena. In contrast, the recipient of a \n     Section 215 subpoena cannot challenge the subpoena in court \n     and is subject to a gag order. The scope of a federal grand \n     jury is limited to specific crimes, while an intelligence \n     investigation is not so limited.\n       Finally, it is very important to note that, in the more \n     than two years since the passage of the PATRIOT Act, Section \n     215 has never been used. If the authority has never been used \n     during this time of great national peril, it is difficult to \n     understand how imposing some reasonable checks on it could \n     cripple the war on terrorism. Indeed, the government offers \n     no examples, real or imagined, in which the SAFE Act's \n     revisions of Section 215 would hinder counterterrorism \n     efforts.\n\n\n                       national security letters\n\n       The SAFE Act would impose reasonable limits on the issuance \n     of National Security Letters (NSLs). Section 505 of the \n     PATRIOT Act allows the FBI to use NSLs to obtain personal \n     records without individualized suspicion. An NSL is a \n     document signed by an FBI agent requiring disclosure of \n     financial, credit and other personal information and \n     requiring the recipient not to disclose the request to the \n     individual whose records are being sought. It does not \n     require judicial or grand jury approval.\n       Before the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could issue an NSL to \n     obtain records from a wire or electronic communication \n     service provider by certifying that it had reason to believe \n     that the person to whom the records relate is a terrorist or \n     a spy. The approval of FBI headquarters was required.\n       Section 505 of the PATRIOT allows the FBI to issue an NSL \n     simply by certifying that the records are ``sought for'' a \n     terrorism or intelligence investigation, regardless of \n     whether the target is a suspect. Headquarters approval is no \n     longer required. Unlike many other surveillance-related \n     PATRIOT Act provisions, the expanded NSL authority does not \n     sunset.\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\n       The SAFE Act would retain the PATRIOT Act's lower standard \n     for the issuance of NSLs and its delegation of issuing \n     authority to field offices. It would simply clarify that a \n     library is not a ``wire or communication service provider,'' \n     which from the plain meaning of the words, it is not. The FBI \n     could still obtain information regarding e-mails or other \n     communications that took place at libraries by issuing an NSL \n     to the library's wire or communication service provider.\n       The Justice Department states that the SAFE Act would \n     ``extend a greater degree of privacy to activities that occur \n     in a public place than to those taking place in the home.'' \n     We disagree. The SAFE Act would simply ensure that the FBI \n     issues the NSL to the service provider, which is the \n     appropriate recipient, rather than a community library, which \n     is ill-equipped to respond to such a request.\n\n\n                      expanding the sunset clause\n\n       The SAFE Act would expand the sunset clause of the PATRIOT \n     Act to ensure Congress has an opportunity to review \n     provisions of the bill that greatly expand the government's \n     authority to conduct surveillance on Americans. Many of the \n     PATRIOT Act's surveillance provisions sunset on December 31, \n     2005. The SAFE Act would sunset four additional surveillance \n     provisions: Sections 213, 216, 219, and 505.\n       We have already discussed Sections 213 (sneak and peek \n     warrants) and 505 (national security letters). Section 216 \n     allows the use of surveillance devices known as pen registers \n     and trap and trace devices to gather transactional \n     information about electronic communications (e.g., e-mail) if \n     the government certifies the information likely to be \n     gathered is ``relevant'' to an ongoing criminal \n     investigation. The information the government gathers is \n     ``not to include the contents'' of communications, but \n     content is not defined. Section 219 permits a federal judge \n     in any district in the country in which ``activities related \n     to terrorism may have occurred'' to issue a nationwide search \n     warrant in a terrorism investigation. The target of such a \n     search warrant has no ability to challenge the warrant in \n     their home district. The SAFE Act would simply give Congress \n     an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of these four \n     provisions before deciding whether or not to reauthorize \n     them.\n       The Justice Department argues that Congress should not \n     expand the sunset to these authorities because they will all \n     be needed by the FBI for ``the foreseeable future.'' Even if \n     this is true, it is no reason not to give Congress the chance \n     to review the usefulness of these powers. If they are needed \n     for the fight on terrorism, we will surely renew them.\n       Throughout American history, during times of war, civil \n     liberties have been restricted in the name of security. We \n     therefore have the responsibility to proceed cautiously. \n     During the Civil War, President Lincoln suspended habeas \n     corpus, and during World War II, President Roosevelt ordered \n     the detention of Japanese Americans in internment camps. We \n     must be vigilant in our defense of our freedoms. But we also \n     must ensure that law enforcement has sufficient authority to \n     combat the grave threat of terrorism. We must strike a \n     careful balance between the law enforcement power needed to \n     combat terrorism and the legal protections required to \n     safeguard American liberties. That is what the SAFE Act would \n     do.\n       While we are disappointed that the Administration has \n     expressed disagreement with the SAFE Act, we view this as an \n     opportunity for increased public discussion of one of the \n     most important issues of our day. Accordingly, we request \n     that you schedule a hearing on the SAFE Act as soon as \n     possible. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry E. Craig,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Richard J. Durbin\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me cut through some of the rhetoric \nand tell you what the SAFE Act does.\n  The SAFE Act would place reasonable checks on what are known as \nroving wiretaps. Typically, when the Government seeks a warrant \nauthorizing a wiretap, its application must specify the individual and \nthe phone that will be tapped. A recommendation on roving wiretaps came \nto us in the PATRIOT Act because of the obvious: There was a time and \nplace in America when people had one telephone at work, one telephone \nat home, and if the Government sought to tap that telephone to find out \nwhat was going on, it was pretty obvious which telephone lines needed \nto be tapped. Now we live in a different world where people carry \naround phones in their pockets. People may have several phones.\n  So the Government asked for additional authority to focus on those \nwho were engaged in telephone conversations on numerous different \ntelephone lines. Roving wiretaps do not require the Government to \nspecify the phone being tapped. They are designed to allow law \nenforcement to track targets that evade surveillance by frequently \nchanging phones.\n  Before the PATRIOT Act, they were only permitted for criminal \ninvestigations, not intelligence investigations. The PATRIOT Act \nauthorized the FBI to use roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes for \nthe first time. I supported this. I thought it was a reasonable \nexpansion of wiretap authority because it is important that \nintelligence investigators have that authority.\n  Unfortunately, the PATRIOT Act did not include the same limits on \nthese powers that exist for criminal investigations. These limits would \nhave protected innocent Americans from unjustified surveillance. It is \na basic tenet of law that if you are going to tap a conversation, the \nGovernment has to be specific enough so as to protect innocent people. \nWe should not allow the Government at any given time to impose a \nwiretap on a phone that anybody might use. The Government should be \nspecific, protecting in the process the privacy of innocent people, \nwhile clearly targeting those with a wiretap who could be guilty of a \ncrime or guilty of activities that are treasonous.\n  Under the PATRIOT Act, the FBI is not required to determine whether \nthe target of the wiretap is physically present at the location being \nwiretapped before beginning the wiretap, as it is for criminal \nwiretaps. The ascertainment requirement, as it is known, ensures \ninnocent Americans are not wiretapped unnecessarily, especially when \nthe FBI wiretaps a public telephone.\n  The FBI is now permitted to obtain a John Doe roving wiretap for \nintelligence purposes, a sweeping authority never before authorized by \nCongress. A John Doe roving wiretap does not specify the person or the \nphone to be wiretapped. In other words, the FBI can obtain a wiretap \nwithout telling a court whom they want to wiretap and where they want \nto wiretap. This is a virtually limitless power.\n  The SAFE Act, which we have introduced, would continue to authorize \nroving wiretaps for intelligence purposes but would impose reasonable \nlimits, the same limits that exist for criminal investigations. Law \nenforcement would be required to determine whether the target of the \nwiretap is physically present before beginning the wiretap. The FBI \nwould not be able to obtain ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps. These \nprotections would ensure that the Government does not wiretap innocent \nAmericans.\n\n  Secondly, the SAFE Act would impose reasonable limits on sneak-and-\npeek searches. Sneak-and-peek searches are conducted secretly by the \nFBI with no notice to the target until some time after the search.\n  You have all seen the scene on television--maybe you are familiar \nwith it from your community--where there is a knock on the door and a \nlaw enforcement official says: I have a warrant to search your home. \nWell, that is the usual course of events in criminal investigations. It \nis much different when it comes to sneak-and-peek searches.\n  The Justice Department argues that warrants for sneak-and-peek \nsearches ``had been available for decades before the PATRIOT Act was \npassed,'' but such warrants were never authorized by Congress before \nthe passage of the PATRIOT Act. Some courts permitted sneak-and-peek \nwarrants in limited circumstances, although the Supreme Court has never \nruled on their constitutionality.\n  In authorizing sneak-and-peek warrants, section 213 of the PATRIOT \nAct did not include checks and limitations on the power of the \nGovernment so as to protect innocent Americans. Courts have required \nthe FBI to notify the target of the search within 7 days of the search. \nSection 213 of the PATRIOT Act, however, requires notice of the search \nonly within ``a reasonable period,'' which is not defined. According to \nthe Justice Department, this has resulted in delays of notice of up to \n90 days, and of ``unspecified duration.''\n  Section 213 authorizes sneak-and-peek searches where a court finds \nthat providing immediate notice of the search would have an adverse \nresult. ``Adverse result'' is defined broadly. It includes \ncircumstances ``seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly \ndelaying a trial.'' This catch-all provision could arguably apply in \nalmost every case.\n  Unlike many other PATRIOT Act provisions that give new surveillance \npowers to the FBI, the sneak-and-peek\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\nauthority does not sunset. It is permanent law.\n  According to a recent poll, 71 percent of Americans disapprove of the \ncurrent sneak-and-peek provision in the PATRIOT Act. Last year, an \noverwhelming, bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives voted \nto repeal this section of the PATRIOT Act. The SAFE Act that we \nintroduce would not go nearly that far. It would place reasonable \nlimits on the FBI's ability to conduct sneak-and-peek searches, while \nstill permitting broad use of this authority.\n  The SAFE Act would still authorize sneak-and-peek searches in a broad \nset of specific circumstances. However, it would eliminate the catch-\nall provision that allows sneak-and-peek searches in any circumstances.\n  The SAFE Act would require notification of a covert search within 7 \ndays but would authorize a court to allow unlimited additional 7-day \ndelays upon application by the Government. According to the Justice \nDepartment, ``the most common period of delay'' under section 213 is 7 \ndays, so this limit that we establish is not unreasonable.\n  The SAFE Act would also sunset the sneak-and-peek authority, giving \nCongress an opportunity to take a hard look at a provision in the law \nthat is so widely unpopular in the United States.\n  The third area has received a lot of attention, and it relates to the \ncompelled production of library and personal records.\n  The SAFE Act would place reasonable limits on the FBI's authority to \ncompel production of library and personal records. Before the PATRIOT \nAct, the FBI was authorized to seek a court order for the production of \nrecords from four types of businesses--common carriers, such as \nairlines and trains and buses; public accommodations, such as hotels \nand restaurants; storage facilities; and car rental companies. In order \nto obtain records, the FBI was required to convince a court it had \nreason to believe that the person to whom the records related was a \nterrorist or a spy.\n  Under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the FBI can compel production \nof ``any tangible things,'' not just records, from any entity, not just \nthe four types of businesses previously covered. The FBI, under the \nPATRIOT Act, is only required to certify that the records are ``sought \nfor'' a terrorism or intelligence investigation, a standard even lower \nthan relevance. The FBI is not required to show that the documents \nrelate to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n\n  Now, those who defend section 215 frequently claim the FBI must \nobtain court approval to compel production of records, but if you read \nsection 215, you will see that the type of court approval which is \nauthorized is a rubber stamp.\n  The PATRIOT Act gives the Government too much power to seize the \npersonal records of innocent Americans who are not suspected of \ninvolvement in any terrorism or espionage. This could lead to broad \nfishing expeditions which waste scarce Government resources, are \nunlikely to produce useful information, and can infringe upon privacy \nrights.\n  The SAFE Act would retain the PATRIOT Act's expansion of the records \nprovision to cover ``any tangible things,'' as I said earlier, and any \nentity. But it would reinstate the pre-PATRIOT Act standard for \nobtaining records, which requires individualized suspicion and \nincreased judicial oversight. The FBI would be required to convince a \ncourt that it has reason to believe that the person to whom the records \nrelate is a terrorist or a spy. This would protect innocent Americans \nand prevent fishing expeditions by the Government.\n  It is very important to note that in the more than 2 years since the \npassage of the PATRIOT Act, section 215--compelling records, as I have \ndescribed--has never been used. If the authority has never been used \nduring this time of great national concern and peril, it is difficult \nto understand how imposing some reasonable checks could harm the war on \nterrorism.\n  The fourth and last section of the SAFE Act relates to national \nsecurity letters. The SAFE Act would impose reasonable limits on the \nissuance of these letters. An NSL, as they are known, is a document \nsigned by an FBI agent requiring disclosure of financial, credit, or \nother personal information. It can be issued to a wire or electronic \ncommunication provider. The recipient of an NSL is subject to a gag \norder and cannot disclose the request to the individual whose records \nare being sought. An NSL does not require judicial or grand jury \napproval.\n  Before the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could issue such a letter to obtain \nrecords by certifying it had reason to believe that the person to whom \nthe records relate is a terrorist or spy. The approval of FBI \nheadquarters was required.\n  Section 505 of the PATRIOT Act allows the FBI to issue a national \nsecurity letter by certifying that the records are ``sought for'' a \nterrorism or intelligence investigation, regardless of whether the \ntarget is a suspect. FBI headquarters approval is no longer required.\n  Unlike many other surveillance-related PATRIOT Act provisions, this \nexpanded NSL authority does not sunset under the law of the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  The SAFE Act would retain the PATRIOT Act's lower standard for the \nissuance of NSLs and its delegation of issuing authority to FBI field \noffices.\n  It would simply clarify that a library is not a ``wire or \ncommunication service provider,'' which, from the plain meaning of the \nwords, it is not. The FBI could still obtain information regarding e-\nmails and other communications originating from library computers by \nissuing a national security letter to the library's wire or \ncommunication service provider.\n  The SAFE Act would simply ensure that the FBI issues the national \nsecurity letter to the service provider, which is the appropriate \nrecipient, rather than a community library, which is not equipped to \nrespond to such a request.\n  We would also sunset this NSL authority, giving Congress another \nopportunity to take a look at it.\n  We have the responsibility to give the Government the power it needs \nto keep us safe, but at the same time we have a responsibility to the \nConstitution, which we have all sworn to uphold and defend, to \nzealously protect the personal freedoms and liberties of American \ncitizens.\n  Geoffrey Stone, a professor and former dean at the University of \nChicago Law School, made this observation:\n\n       In time of war . . . we respond too harshly in our \n     restriction of civil liberties, and then, later, regret our \n     behavior. It is, of course, much easier to look back on past \n     crises and find our predecessors wanting, than it is to make \n     wise judgments when we ourselves are in the eye of the storm. \n     But that challenge now falls to us.\n\n  We must meet this challenge head on. As we reflect on the course of \nhistory, there has hardly been a time in the history of the Nation when \nwe faced great threats to our safety and security when the Government \ndid not overreach.\n  The greatest President, I think, who ever served us, Abraham Lincoln, \nfrom my State of Illinois, during the course of the Civil War, \nsuspended the writ of habeas corpus, basically gathering into prison \nsuspects without any charges. It was clearly in violation of the \nlanguage of the Constitution. It was a power he assumed as Commander In \nChief, and many have questioned it in the years that have followed.\n  During World War I, when there was real concern about outside threats \nto our country, we established the Alien and Sedition Acts, laws passed \nby Congress and signed by the President which, on reflection, went too \nfar.\n\n  In World War II, we had the Japanese internment camps. We took \nperfectly innocent Japanese Americans, simply because of their \nancestry, and put them in these settlement camps for lengthy periods of \ntime, even while the children would leave the camps to serve in the \nArmed Forces.\n  During the cold war, a war that went on for decades and cost this \nNation billions of dollars and created great anxiety, the McCarthy \nhearings and the questions of patriotism that were raised indicate that \nagain we had gone entirely too far. The list continues. Sadly, it \ncontinues when we reflect on what we have done since September 11.\n  There is always a tension in our society between security and \nfreedom. Those who want more security often argue that the Government \nneeds more power and more authority, and individuals must give up those \nfreedoms. Many of us believe that in surrendering\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\nour freedoms, we are surrendering our heritage to the terrorists. The \nfreedoms which were so carefully guarded and so zealously pursued by so \nmany generations, freedoms which we have won with the lives of \nAmericans in conflict time and time again, should be carefully guarded \nas well.\n  I hope we will understand that the burden of proof is not on \nindividual Americans to come forward and prove to the Government they \nhave a right to their freedoms and liberties. When the Government seeks \nto take away the freedom and liberty of an American citizen, it is the \nburden of the Government to prove that is necessary.\n  With the SAFE Act, Senator Craig and I have taken four very specific \nand discrete elements of the PATRIOT Act and we have said that by \nchanging these, we will still keep America safe, but we will prevent \nintrusive Government activity into the privacy of individuals.\n  We can search the Constitution from the beginning to the end, through \nevery amendment, and never see the word ``privacy'' in it, but courts \nhave said repeatedly that that is what government should be all about--\nprotecting our privacy, only invading it in times when it is absolutely \nnecessary to protect our safety in our community or our security as a \nNation. The PATRIOT Act ended up being an allocation of power to the \nGovernment that went far beyond what was necessary for the security of \nour Nation and in fact invaded our rights and liberties.\n  We need to meet this challenge head on. It is possible to combat \nterrorism and to protect our freedoms. We can be safe and free. The \nSAFE Act demonstrates that. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Craig \nand myself as cosponsors.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF JUSTICE FLORENCE K. MURRAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on Sunday, March 28, 2004, Rhode Island, the \njudicial community and the entire Nation lost a great pioneer who was a \nsuperb jurist and a powerful inspiration. Retired Supreme Court \nAssociate Justice Florence Kerins Murray passed away after decades of \nbreaking new ground for women in the United States. She was 87 years \nold.\n  Justice Murray, the first woman appointed to the Rhode Island \nSuperior and Supreme Courts, was a lifelong resident of Newport.\n  The daughter of John and Florence Kerins, Murray attended Rogers High \nSchool in Newport and went on to attend Syracuse University, where she \nwould later serve on the Board of Trustees and was the only woman in \nthe 1942 graduating class at Boston University Law School where she \nwould become a member of the board of visitors.\n  Throughout her life Justice Murray sought ways to serve the \ncommunity. She began her professional career as a teacher in a one-room \nschoolhouse on Prudence Island, in Narragansett Bay. Later, she joined \nthe Women's Army Corps and was promoted to lieutenant colonel before \nleaving the service in 1947. Again, Murray broke ground when she was \nthe youngest woman to achieve that rank at the time.\n  Upon leaving the Army, she opened a one-woman law firm above a \ngrocery store on Thames Street. She was the only female lawyer in \nNewport when she opened her firm. She later practiced law with her now-\ndeceased husband, Paul F. Murray, who went on to serve as U.S. Attorney \nfor Rhode Island from 1977 to 1981. Paul and Florence had a son Paul M. \nMurray.\n  Continuing her traditions of giving back to her community and public \nservice, Murray served as both a State Senator from Newport and member \nof the city's School Committee.\n  Murray was the only woman in the Rhode Island Senate during her years \nin the State House from 1948-1956.\n  While there, she sponsored legislation to abolish wage differences \nbased on gender and for equal pay for teachers throughout the State. \nShe also introduced a bill making it easier for a parent to get child \nsupport if a former spouse leaves the State, and another that led to \nthe creation of State facilities for the care and treatment of \nalcoholics.\n  In 1956, Murray was sworn in as the State's first female superior \ncourt judge. She became the first female chief judge of the superior \ncourt in 1978, and when she was elected by the General Assembly to the \nState Supreme Court in November 1979, she became the first woman on \nthat bench. She authored more than 500 opinions during her time on the \nSupreme Court before retiring in 1996.\n  Supreme Court Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg, who was appointed to \nMurray's seat on the high court upon her retirement, praised her ``for \nhaving broken down so many barriers that were previously closed to \nwomen. I believe her greatest accomplishment is that, before she boldly \nmarched into uncharted territory, she paused, turned around and \nbeckoned the rest of us to follow.''\n  During her four decades on the bench, Murray displayed an incredible \nwork ethic and modest demeanor. In a 1997 interview with the Providence \nJournal she spoke about how she approached her job, ``I haven't got any \nspecial attributes. I just do a job as well as I can do it, and I seek \nto keep myself well-informed about whatever my field of work is.''\n  When she was not at work, Murray found dozens of other ways to \ncontribute. She was a member of the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame, \na recipient of a Citizen of the Year Award from the Rhode Island Trial \nLawyers Association, and a Judge of the Year Award from the National \nAssociation of Women Judges.\n  The American Bar Association honored her in 2002 for pioneering work, \nin the late 1950s, that led to the establishment of Rhode Island's \nFamily Court.\n  She served on numerous judicial and civic boards over the years, \namong them, Salve Regina College and Bryant College and she founded the \nNewport Girls Club.\n  In her retirement, Murray was appointed by President Clinton to serve \non the board of directors of the State Justice Institute and remained \nactive in National Judicial College affairs.\n  Murray was honored in 1990 when the Newport Court House was renamed \nthe Florence K. Murray Judicial Complex. It was an excellent and \nfitting way to honor a great woman.\n  And when we honor Justice Murray, we must remember to honor the \ngreatness of her achievements. Not because she was a woman, but because \nher accomplishments were spectacular for any person, man or woman.\n  My deepest condolences go out to her friends and family, especially \nher son, Paul. Justice Murray was an incredible woman who was bound by \nno barriers. She was a patriot and a pioneer, a public servant and a \nmother. In her quest to improve herself, she improved the world around \nher. We will miss her dearly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, are we on particular legislation at this \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on a motion to recommit S. 1637, the \nJOBS bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                SAFE Act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor, as my colleague \nfrom Illinois did a few moments ago, to talk about the USA PATRIOT Act \nand where we are with this issue that the American people have \nrecognized as important for a variety of reasons.\n  We all know that following the attack on American soil on September \n11, 2001, we produced the USA PATRIOT Act to allow the law enforcement \nand intelligence communities of this country to move forward and do a \nvariety of things. For the first time, we stepped\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\ninto some arenas of law that many citizens of our country looked at at \nthe time and said, be careful if you go there for you may well be \nintruding upon what are fundamental and constitutional rights of \nprivacy with the American people.\n  I voted for the PATRIOT Act at that time, and I did so speaking to \nthe fact that I thought it was necessary that we move expeditiously to \nallow our law enforcement community to operate for the purpose of \nnational security. I said at that time that this was not a perfect law. \nIn fact, 253 communities and 37 States later, representing \napproximately 43.5 million people, have passed resolutions opposing or \nexpressing concern about the PATRIOT Act. Groups as politically diverse \nas the ACLU and the American Conservative Union endorse changes in the \nlaw.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President called for \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. Given the bipartisan opposition to \nthe law at this moment as it currently stands, there are many of us who \nbelieve it is necessary to make some adjustments in the law as we move \ntoward reauthorization. Congress, in fact, made oversight of the \nPATRIOT Act implicit by sunsetting over a dozen sections of the bill at \nthe time of its passage.\n  The Senator from Illinois and I drafted S. 1709 with this oversight \nin mind. It was drafted to clarify and amend in a minor way the PATRIOT \nAct's most troubling provisions so that the whole or even piecemeal \nrepeal of the law would be unnecessary. It was drafted to safeguard the \nliberties of law-abiding citizens while preserving the law enforcement \nauthorities essential to a successful war on terror.\n  Late last month, however, the Department of Justice issued a letter \nobjecting to the very legislation, objecting to it before there had \neven been a hearing on it. Specifically, they objected to the SAFE Act \non grounds that it would ``eliminate'' some PATRIOT tools and even \n``make it more difficult'' to fight terrorism than before enactment of \nthe PATRIOT Act.\n  Let me be emphatic: the SAFE Act in no way repeals any provision of \nthe PATRIOT Act, nor impedes law enforcement's ability to investigate \nterrorism by amending pre-PATRIOT Act law. My name would not be on a \nbill that accomplished those things.\n  What the SAFE Act does do is clarify and slightly modify several \nprovisions, particularly those related to the use of surveillance and \nthe issuance of search warrants, to restore the judicial oversight \nrequisite to healthy law enforcement.\n  Specifically, the SAFE Act would impose two reasonable safeguards on \nthe use of roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes.\n\n  Before the PATRIOT Act, roving wiretaps were only permitted for \ncriminal, not intelligence, investigations. The PATRIOT Act authorized \nthe FBI to use roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes for the first \ntime.\n  The Intelligence Authorization Act of 2002 further permitted the FBI \nto obtain ``John Doe'' wiretaps in an intelligence investigation \nwithout specifying either the target or the location of the wiretap.\n  Law enforcement is only required to provide a physical description of \nthe target, such as 5'7\", Middle Eastern descent or something else \nequally as vague, so as to, in my opinion, be meaningless. In order to \nprotect the private conversations of people wholly unrelated to the \ninvestigation, the SAFE Act simply requires that law enforcement \nspecify either the target or the location of the wiretap and ascertain \nthe presence of the target before initiating the surveillance.\n  Far from eliminating the roving wiretap, S. 1709 only makes the \nrequirements for a roving wiretap for intelligence surveillance conform \nto the requirements for roving wiretaps under the criminal code. Does \nthis tie law enforcement's hands in the way the Justice Department so \ndescribed it? Hardly so.\n  In the case of sneak-and-peek warrants, before the PATRIOT Act, there \nwas no statutory authority for delayed notice warrants for physical \nevidence, although covert searches of oral and wire communications for \nintelligence purposes were allowed. The Supreme Court never ruled on \nthe constitutionality of sneak-and-peek warrants for physical evidence, \nand the Federal circuit courts were divided on the issue.\n  Despite this, the PATRIOT Act granted Federal law enforcement broad \nauthority to obtain sneak-and-peek warrants for physical evidence where \na court finds ``reasonable cause'' that providing immediate notice of \nthe warrant would have an adverse result, including seriously \njeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial,''--a very \nbroad standard.\n  The SAFE Act, our amendment to the PATRIOT Act, reasonably limits \nwhen a court may issue a sneak-and-peek warrant for physical evidence \nto situations where notice of the warrant would:\n  (1) endanger the life or physical safety of an individual;\n  (2) result in flight from prosecution; or,\n  (3) result in the destruction of or tampering with evidence sought \nunder the warrant.\n  Though the Department of Justice argues that scenarios such as a \nsuspect's associates fleeing, going into hiding, or accelerating their \nplots would be excluded from the sneak-and-peek authority, these \nclearly fall within the reasonable limits of the SAFE Act.\n  The Department of Justice also misrepresents the authority of the \nsneak-and-peek provision when it says that the SAFE Act would \n``restrict the ability of courts to extend the period of delay'' for a \ndelayed-notice warrant. Although S. 1709 requires notice of a covert \nsearch within 7 days rather than a reasonable period, it authorizes \nunlimited 7-day delays if the court finds that notice of a warrant \nwould continue to endanger the life or physical safety of an \nindividual, result in flight from prosecution, or result in the \ndestruction of or tampering with the evidence sought under the warrant.\n  Far from restricting the courts, the SAFE Act restores what I believe \nis the proper level of judicial oversight in the process.\n  I believe the Department of Justice also misrepresented the \nmodifications the SAFE Act would make to section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct, which permits law enforcement to obtain a vast array of business \nrecords with minimal judicial oversight.\n  Before the PATRIOT Act, FISA search orders were available for only \ncertain travel-related ``business'' records--not library or personal \nrecords--where the FBI had ``specific and articulable facts'' \nconnecting the records to a foreign agent.\n  These orders are available for any and all records, including library \nrecords, by simply certifying that the records are sought for an \ninternational terrorism or intelligence investigation, a standard even \nlower than relevance. The court does not even have the authority to \nreject this certification under current law.\n  Though the Department of Justice describes the SAFE Act standard as a \n``much more rigorous'' standard, FISA search orders would still be \navailable for any and all records, but only when the FBI has ``specific \nand articulable facts'' connecting the records to a foreign agent.\n  Far from ``raising the standard'' to a new level, S. 1709 reinstates \nthe proper pre-PATRIOT standard for obtaining a FISA order for business \nrecords, and even maintains the PATRIOT Act's expanded definition of \nbusiness records.\n  Likewise, the Department of Justice argues that section 5 of the SAFE \nAct would impose an ``entirely new limitation'' on the use of National \nSecurity Letters.\n  Before the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could issue a National Security \nLetter to obtain personal records by certifying that it had reason to \nbelieve that the person to whom the records relate is a foreign power \nor agent of a foreign power.\n  Current law allows the FBI to obtain sensitive personal records, \nwithout judicial approval, simply by certifying that they are sought \nfor a terrorism or intelligence investigation, regardless of whether \nthe target is a suspect.\n  While national security letters are only to be used to obtain name, \naddress, length of service, and local and long distance toll billing \nrecords, available information indicated that the Justice Department is \nusing them to obtain other kinds of records, including library records. \nContrary to the assertions of the Department of Justice, the SAFE Act \nmaintains the greatly expanded definition of ``financial\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\nrecords,'' and even makes such records available without individual \nsuspicion. S. 1709 only reasonably exempts libraries and Internet \nterminals from National Security Letter orders.\n  While I am disappointed that the Administration has expressed \ndisagreement with the SAFE Act, I view this as an opportunity to \nincrease the public discussion on one of the most important issues of \nthe day.\n  I know Attorney General John Ashcroft. John and I are personal \nfriends. I am not worried about how John Ashcroft will enforce the law. \nBut administrations change. The law lasts, and it is imperative that it \nembodies a smooth balance of liberty and justice.\n  I am not seeking to repeal any provision of the PATRIOT Act but \nrather to salvage it by making necessary, albeit minor, amendments to \nit in order to safeguard individual liberties while preserving the very \nimportant law enforcement authorities it grants. Privacy is a hallmark \nof our constitutional system--the right of the individual within that \nsystem--and what we attempt to do by the SAFE Act, S. 1709, is to \nassure that when we reauthorize the PATRIOT Act, we guarantee that \nthose rights are preserved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Craig and Senator Durbin in calling for hearings on this \nimportant legislation to amend the PATRIOT Act.\n  After the vicious attacks of September 11, there was a broad \nconsensus in Congress about what needed to be done. We all recognized \nthe need to give law enforcement and intelligence officials stronger \npowers to investigate and prevent terrorism, to provide officials with \neffective ways to stop terrorists from entering our country, and to \nachieve greater coordination between the law enforcement and the \nintelligence communities. At the same time, we understood the critical \nimportance of protecting the basic rights and liberties of our citizens \nand others residing legally in the United States and maintaining \nAmerica's long tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world.\n  The challenge we faced, then as now, was how to strike the right \nbalance between law enforcement and civil liberties.\n  Many of us were concerned that some of the changes initially \nrequested by the administration did not strike the right balance. We \nmade significant improvements to the PATRIOT Act during Senate \nnegotiations, but we also recognized the need to follow the \nimplementation of these new powers carefully. That is why the 4-year \nsunset provision is such an important part of the legislation. By \npassing the sunset provision, Congress committed itself to revisiting \nthe PATRIOT Act after 4 years, in a non-election year, and making a new \nand better-informed assessment of which powers should be retained, \nwhich should be revised, and which should be eliminated.\n  Since the enactment of this law, there has been increasing bipartisan \nconcern about its effect on civil liberties in this country. Two \nhundred fifty-seven communities in 38 States representing over 40 \nmillion citizens, have passed resolutions opposing or expressing \nconcern about the PATRIOT Act.\n  Clearly, we must do more to protect the basic rights and civil \nliberties of law-abiding Americans. The bipartisan Security and Freedom \nEnsured Act is narrowly written to correct some of the PATRIOT Act's \nmost controversial provisions: it would protect innocent people from \nsurveillance, by requiring ``roving wiretap'' warrants to identify \neither the target of the wiretap or the place to be wiretapped; it \nwould impose reasonable limits on the Government's ability to carry out \n``sneak and peek'' search warrants, by requiring notice of such a \ncovert search to be given within 7 days after the search, unless the \nnotice would endanger a person's life or result in the destruction of \nevidence or a suspect's flight from prosecution; and it would protect \nlibrary and bookstore records from ``fishing expedition'' searches of \nthe records, while still allowing the F.B.I. to follow up on legitimate \nleads.\n\n  None of these changes would amend pre-PATRIOT Act law in any way. \nNone would impede the ability of law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials to investigate and prevent terrorism. To the contrary, the \nSAFE Act would retain the expanded powers created by the PATRIOT Act, \nwhile restoring the constitutional safeguards that are indispensable to \nour democracy. These safeguards are a continuing source of our \ncountry's strength, not luxuries or inconveniences to be jettisoned in \ntimes of crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the administration does not agree. Our proposal has \nnot yet received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, yet the \nadministration has already threatened to veto it. Rather than comply \nwith the sunset provision specifically written into the PATRIOT Act \nitself, President Bush has sought to make an election-year issue out of \nit by calling on Congress to reauthorize the Act now. Rather than seek \nto promote understanding, the Attorney General and other officials have \nchosen to defend the PATRIOT Act by speaking only before audiences \nsympathetic to their views. In Boston and other cities, citizens with \nquestions and concerns about the PATRIOT Act have been shut out.\n  I urge my colleagues not to accept this cynical election-year \nstrategy. In the House, Chairman Sensenbrenner has rejected calls for \nreauthorizing the PATRIOT Act this year, and we should do the same in \nthe Senate. We should conduct additional hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee on the many important civil liberties issues that have been \nraised since September 11, including the administration's unprecedented \nand troubling ``enemy combatant'' policy, under which U.S. citizens are \nincarcerated without counsel or judicial review. Attorney General \nAshcroft should appear to defend these and other policies. And we \nshould hold hearings specifically on the bipartisan SAFE Act proposed \nby Senator Craig and Senator Durbin.\n  We should also hold hearings on the need for legislation to protect \nthe civil liberties of immigrants. The detention provisions in the \nPATRIOT Act have led to the unfair detention of innocent people. \nMassive registration programs have fingerprinted, photographed and \ninterrogated over 80,000 innocent Arab and Muslim students, visitors, \nand workers. ``Voluntary interview'' programs have made criminal \nsuspects out of Muslims legally residing in the U.S. In our pursuit of \nterrorist suspects, our Government cannot be allowed to ride roughshod \nover the basic rights and liberties of immigrants.\n  In a speech in 1987, Justice William Brennan observed that the United \nStates had repeatedly failed to preserve civil liberties during times \nof national crisis--from the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, to the \ninternment of Japanese Americans during World War II--only to later \nrealize ``remorsefully . . . that the abrogation of civil liberties was \nunnecessary.'' As we continue to face the crisis of terrorism today, we \nshould do all we can to avoid the errors of the past. The \nadministration and Congress should work together in a spirit of \nbipartisanship and shared purpose, to bring terrorists to justice, to \nenhance our security, and to preserve and protect our Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n\n            Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I support legislation which would \naddress certain serious problems faced today by doctors, hospitals, and \nother medical professionals who provide obstetrical and gynecological \nservices and emergency or trauma care services, and at the same time \nprovide balance to fairly treat people who are injured in the course of \nsuch medical treatment.\n  While most of the attention has been directed to OB/GYN and ER \nmalpractice verdicts, the issues are much broader involving medical \nerrors, insurance company investments, and administrative practices.\n  I support caps on noneconomic damages so long as they do not apply to \nsituations such as the paperwork mixup leading to the double mastectomy \nof a woman or the death of a 17-year-old woman in a North Carolina \ntransplant case where there was a faulty blood type match, or \ncomparable cases in OB/GYN or the ER trauma services area.\n  An appropriate standard for cases not covered could be analogous \nprovisions in Pennsylvania law which limit actions against governmental \nentities in\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\nthe limited tort context which exclude death, serious impairment of \nbodily functions, and permanent disfigurement or dismemberment.\n  Beyond the issue of caps, I believe there could be savings on the \ncost of OB/GYN or ER trauma malpractice insurance by eliminating \nfrivolous cases by requiring plaintiffs to file with the court a \ncertification by a doctor in the field that it is an appropriate case \nto bring to court. This proposal, which is now part of Pennsylvania \nState procedure, could be expanded federally, thus reducing claims and \nsaving costs.\n  While most malpractice cases are won by defendants, the high cost of \nlitigation drives up malpractice premiums. The proposed certification \nwould reduce plaintiffs' joinder of peripheral defendants and cut \ndefense costs.\n  Further savings could be accomplished through patient safety \ninitiatives identified in the report of the Institute of Medicine.\n  On November 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine issued a report \nentitled ``To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' The IOM \nreport estimated that anywhere between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized \nAmericans die each year due to avoidable medical mistakes. However, \nonly a fraction of these deaths and injuries are due to negligence. \nMost errors are caused by system failures.\n  The Institute of Medicine issued a comprehensive set of \nrecommendations, including the establishment of a nationwide mandatory \nreporting system, incorporation of patient safety standards in \nregulatory and accreditation programs, and the development of a \nnonpunitive culture of safety and health care organizations. The report \ncalled for a 50-percent reduction in medical errors over 5 years.\n  The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education, which I chair, held three hearings to discuss the \nInstitute of Medicine's findings and explore ways to implement the \nrecommendations outlined in the IOM report. For fiscal year 2001, the \nsubcommittee bill contained $50 million for a patient safety initiative \nand directed the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to develop \nguidelines on the collection of uniform error data; establish a \ncompetitive demonstration program to test best practices, and to \nresearch ways to improve provider training. In fiscal year 2002 and \n2003, $55 million was included to continue these initiatives. In this \nyear, fiscal year 2004, we increased the amount provided for patient \nsafety to $79.5 million.\n\n  We have received an interim report informing us the creation of a \npositive safety culture at hospital and health care facilities in which \nemployees believe they would not be punished for reporting errors has \ncaused reporting rates of such errors to increase. The emerging \npositive culture also includes the involvement of key leaders, both \nadministrative and clinical, in patient safety procedures. This has \nhelped professionals move ahead to improve patient safety and the \nestablishment of patient safety committees, development and adoption of \nsafe protocols and procedures and enhanced technology as a tool where \ncarefully implemented to reduce errors and approve safety, for example, \nthrough the use of computerized physician order entry.\n  There is evidence that increased OB/GYN and ER trauma insurance \npremiums have been caused at least in part by insurance company losses, \nthe decline in the stock market of the past several years, and the \ngeneral ratesetting practices of the industry. As a matter of insurance \ncompany calculations, premiums are collected and invested to build up \nan insurance reserve where there is considerable timelag between the \npayment of the premiums and litigation which results in a verdict of \nsettlement. When the stock market has gone down, for example, that has \nresulted in insufficient funding to pay claims and the attendant \nincrease in insurance premiums. A similar result occurred in Texas on \nhomeowners insurance where cost and availability of insurance premiums \nbecame an issue because companies lost money in the market and could \nnot cover the insured losses on their accounts.\n  In structuring legislation to put a cap on jury verdicts, due regard \nshould be given to the history and development of trial by jury under \nthe common law where reliance is placed on average men and women which \ncomprise a jury to reach a verdict resulting from the values and views \nof the community.\n  Jury trials in modern tort cases descend from the common law jury \ntrial in trespass, drawn from and intended to be representative of the \naverage members of the community in which the alleged trespass \noccurred. This coincides with the incorporation of negligence standards \nof liability into trespass actions.\n  This representative jury right in civil actions was protected by \nconsensus among the State drafters of the United States Constitution's \nBill of Rights. The explicit trial-by-jury safeguards in the seventh \namendment to the Constitution were an adaptation of these common-law \nconcepts harmonized with the sixth amendment clause that local juries \nbe used in criminal trials. Thus, from its inception in common law \nthrough inclusion in the Bill of Rights today, the jury in tort \nnegligence cases is meant to be representative of the judgment of \naverage members of the community, not of elected representatives.\n  The right to have a jury trial to decide one's damages has been \ngreatly circumscribed in recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court. An \nexample is the analysis the Court has recently applied to limit \npunitive damage awards. In recent cases, the Court has shifted its \nseventh amendment focus away from two centuries of precedent in \ndeciding Federal appellate review of punitive damage awards will be \ndecided on a de novo basis and a jury's determination of punitive \ndamages is not a finding of fact for purposes of the reexamination \nclause of the seventh amendment which provides ``no fact tried by a \njury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law.''\n\n  Thus, in the year 2003, the Court reasoned that any ratio of punitive \ndamages to compensatory damages greater than 9 to 1 would likely be \nconsidered unreasonable and disproportionate, although that is subject \nto certain exceptions and constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation \nof property in non-personal injury claims. Plaintiffs will inevitably \nface a vastly increased burden to justify a greater ratio and appellate \ncourts have far greater latitude to disallow or reduce such awards, \nalthough increased awards can be permitted under the Supreme Court \ndecision. These decisions may have already, in effect, placed caps on \nsome jury verdicts in malpractice cases which may involve punitive \ndamages.\n  Consideration of the many complex factors on the Senate floor on the \npending legislation will obviously be very difficult in the absence of \na markup in committee or the submission of a committee report and a \ncommittee bill. The pending bill is the starting point for analysis, \ndiscussion, debate, and amendment. I am prepared to proceed with the \ncaveat there is much work to be done before the Senate would be ready, \nin my opinion, for the consideration of final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I wish to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                SAFE Act\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I rise to speak on the issue of the \nPATRIOT Act and to follow up on the remarks earlier this afternoon by \nSenator Craig of Idaho. I have joined Senator Craig in cosponsoring the \nSAFE Act, a piece of legislation that would make certain modifications \nto the PATRIOT Act. I will not go into all of the details of the \nlegislation, as Senator Craig did. However, I do want to highlight a \ncouple of the main provisions of the legislation to outline our \nthinking in crafting these provisions and underscore why I think we \nneed to take a step back, look at the PATRIOT Act in its totality and \ntry to make it work better and try to strike a better balance the \nprotection of the civil liberties we all cherish as Americans and the \ntools we do believe are necessary for law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies to conduct the war against terror.\n  It is unfortunate some people have come out with a knee-jerk reaction\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\ncalling for the repeal of the PATRIOT Act. Before the PATRIOT Act our \nlaws did not reflect or foresee a day and age with cellular phones, \nsatellite phones, and a high-speed Internet. There are a lot of very \nimportant provisions of the PATRIOT Act that do update our law \nenforcement capabilities in a way that reflects changes in technology. \nProtecting civil liberties while giving law enforcement the ability to \noperate as technology and new threats to our security emerge is \ncritical to winning the global war on terror.\n  We can draw an appropriate line to protect civil liberties in a few \nspecific areas. First, let's look at sneak-and-peek warrants, or a \ndelayed notification search warrant. Senator Craig spoke at length \nabout the provision in the SAFE Act that would modify the PATRIOT Act \nto say instead of requiring notification within a reasonable amount of \ntime, which is clearly an arbitrary definition. Instead, we ought to \nhave a set time limit that notification of a search warrant executed \nwithout notice has to be provided within 7 days of the execution of the \nwarrant.\n  Now, if there is a threat to safety, or risk of flight, or a risk of \ndamage to the investigation, the SAFE Act allows law enforcement \nofficials to go back to the judge and extend that notification another \n7 days. And that can continue indefinitely. This approach--specifying a \ntime limit on the warrant and providing for more judicial review--is \nmuch clearer and more respectful of civil liberties. For anyone to \nsuggest adding clarity in the law for notification undermines the \ncapacity of law enforcement to continue to do their job, I think, is a \nlevel of rhetoric that does not serve an important debate such as this \nvery well.\n  Second, we added clarification to the provision in the PATRIOT Act \nthat deals with a roving wiretap. The SAFE Act would require law \nenforcement to specify either the suspect to be put under surveillance \nthrough a roving wiretap--an order that follows that suspect as they \nuse different cell phones, and other means of communication--or specify \na particular location to be monitored. Specify the suspect or specify \nthe location. Changing the PATRIOT Act to require such specification \nwould add clarity to ensure the PATRIOT Act is not misused and \nminimizes the likelihood that innocent parties would be unknowingly \ntapped. And again, such a change would only improve the PATRIOT Act as \nit would protect those who are not targets of investigation but it \nstill give law enforcement the ability to conduct this kind of a roving \nwiretap.\n  Third, another provision of the SAFE Act applies sunset provisions to \na number of different sections of the PATRIOT Act that do not sunset \nover time. When we talk about a sunset provision in the U.S. Congress, \nwe are talking about a specific period during which the legislation is \nin force, but after that period--it might be a 2-year or 3-year or 4-\nyear period--the law sunsets, and it needs to be reenacted or \nreauthorized by Congress.\n  I think sunsets are healthy. They are good because they force \nCongress to rethink and reargue a piece of legislation and examine how \nthe legislation has been used and problems that might exist with it. I \nthink we are much more likely to make improvements to legislation if we \nhave to reauthorize it at different periods in the future.\n  I do not understand why anyone would say a sunset provision weakens \nlegislation. It does not. It simply requires us to renew them at a \nfuture date. I do not know why law enforcement would be afraid of a \nsunset provision. I do not know why the Justice Department would be \nafraid of a sunset provision. If there is value to the law, it is \nhelping law enforcement do their job, and all the while it is \nappropriately protecting civil liberties, the law will be reauthorized \nand improved over time.\n  I cannot think of any reason the provisions of the SAFE Act that add \nclarity to the time frame for notification and judicial review of a \nsneak and peak warrant, that add specification to the person or place \ntargeted for a wiretap, or that sunset provisions to a law--should be \nopposed on the grounds that they somehow threaten our ability to \nconduct the war on terrorism. Quite to the contrary, the provisions of \nthe SAFE Act go a long way toward ensuring individual civil liberties \nare protected, that the ability to misuse or abuse the law is \nminimized, that law enforcement continues to have what it needs to \nprosecute the war on terrorism and that Congress has to affirm and \nreauthorize legislation over time. I only see the SAFE Act as \nstrengthening the PATRIOT Act.\n  So I join with Senator Craig, Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Crapo, other members of the Senate and the wide range of \ncitizen groups who have all endorsed and supported the SAFE Act. I hope \nwhen we begin deliberations and discussions about renewing and \nextending the PATRIOT Act, these substantive yet modest, thoughtful \nmodifications are a vital part of that debate that is undertaken in \nthis Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to recommit the JOBS bill is \npending.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Madam President. I will speak to that motion, \nplease.\n  Madam President, today, we voted actually a second time on that \nmotion to invoke cloture to recommit this pending bill to the Finance \nCommittee--a vote that failed. So, in other words, we essentially voted \nnot to recommit the bill to the committee of origin.\n  I emphasize that fact because in my State of Minnesota Democrats are \nbeing accused of blocking action on this bill. That simply is not true. \nWe are ready and willing to act on this legislation right now, in fact, \nas we were last week before it was pulled off the floor by the \nRepublican leader.\n  So people watching might ask themselves, why was it pulled back then? \nWhy have we been faced with these repeated attempts to send the bill \nback to committee? The reason is because the Republican caucus does not \nwant to have to vote on the pending amendment, which is the Harkin \namendment, which would protect the rights to overtime pay for some 8 \nmillion Americans--police officers, firefighters, nurses, laborers; \nhard-working Americans who want to continue to receive overtime pay \nwhen they work their extra hours, whether it be for the sake of public \nsafety, whether it is needed to fill shifts on hospital wards in order \nto keep them open to patients, or whether it is in order to earn extra \nincome to improve their own lives and the lives of their families.\n  These 8 million Americans are not asking for any special favors, such \nas are provided in the underlying bill. They are not trying to get \nspecial tax breaks or avoid paying taxes on their foreign income, as \nare the beneficiaries of the underlying bill. They simply want to be \nable to earn the American dream, by working harder, by working longer \nhours, paying their taxes but then coming out ahead because of the \novertime provisions.\n  But this administration has said no, the same administration that \nwants to eliminate taxes on so-called unearned income, dividend income. \nThey settled for cutting the rate in half but wanted to eliminate it \ninitially. In other words, they want to make not working more lucrative \nand also want to make working harder less lucrative.\n  Now, what kind of family value is that? You work more and you earn \nless because the Bush administration cares more about the corporations \nthat want to add to their profits by paying their workers less money. \nThat is why they moved millions of American jobs overseas. That is why \nthey have eliminated millions of American jobs.\n  Madam President, 8.5 million of our fellow Americans are out of a job \ntoday. And now these same corporations, which have, by the way, been \nenjoying record high-profit increases in each of the last 2 years, want \nto make even more money by paying less money to the people who are \nstill working. And the administration is going to help them do it.\n  In fact, the Secretary of Labor unilaterally, by herself, revoked the \novertime benefit protections for 8 million Americans. We, their elected \nrepresentatives, are not even being allowed to vote on that matter to \nexpress our approval or disapproval--in this case, my strong \ndisapproval--of that revocation of their overtime benefit protections.\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\n  Why not? Why can't we vote on protecting 8 million American workers? \nWell, the Republican Conference leader said: Where is the discernible \ngain to our Members from voting on this and other Democratic \namendments?\n  I don't know about the gain to colleagues who don't want to support \novertime pay, but I will tell you about the gain or the loss to those 8 \nmillion American workers, depending on whether this measure passes or \nfails.\n  That is their overtime pay that has been taken away by the unilateral \naction of the Secretary of Labor. That is their earned income that has \nbeen taken away. That is their new home, their college education, \nfamily vacation, prescription drugs they need to buy for elderly \nrelatives.\n  We in the U.S. Senate are being denied even the right to vote because \nit is politically inconvenient for some of the Republican caucus.\n  There is also a huge gain or loss for millions of other Americans who \nare out of work by the fate of another Democratic amendment to extend \nunemployment benefits to the 1.1 million Americans who have exhausted \ntheirs at the present time. That number includes an estimated 20,000 of \nmy fellow Minnesotans. They are also hard-working men and women who, \nthrough no fault of their own, lost their jobs and have been looking \nfor work and unable to find it in the terrible jobs climate of the last \ncouple years.\n  Two-thirds of those out-of-work adults have children. An estimated \n622,000 children are affected in those families that have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits. When that happens, it is estimated that \nover two-thirds of those families lose their health coverage, so the \nchildren do not have health care coverage any longer. Over half those \nfamilies, it is estimated, fall below the poverty level as a result of \nlosing their unemployment benefits. It is unbelievably heartless and \ncruel to deny them this extension. Yet again we are unable to get a \nvote in the Senate on extending unemployment benefits to those \nAmericans.\n  Since we are unable to get these votes on our amendments to this JOBS \nAct, you might ask yourself, what is so precious about this bill, what \nis so perfect about it that the leader is denying us a chance to change \nit in any way? You would naturally assume that because it is called the \nJOBS bill, it is about actually providing jobs to fellow Americans, but \nthat is not the case.\n  This is about providing $114 billion in tax breaks to large and \nmostly profitable American corporations, to very wealthy American \ninvestors. Thirty-nine billion of these tax breaks would go to their \nforeign business operations to allow them to reduce taxes paid in this \ncountry on foreign profits, to allow them to postpone the payment on \nearned income abroad; in other words, to provide them with additional \ntax breaks for expanding their foreign business operations and \nproviding jobs overseas.\n  Some of those jobs might in fact be American jobs taken away from \npeople in this country and sent elsewhere or they might be jobs that \nare going to be created through an expanded business operation that \ncould have been created here in the United States except for the \nadvantages of doing so elsewhere--meaning again that foreign workers \nget those jobs rather than Americans at a time when we have 8.5 million \nAmericans who are out of work and another million and a half Americans \nwho are so-called marginally attached to the labor force, who have \ngiven up looking for work, and another 4.5 million Americans who are \nworking part time not by choice but because it is the only work they \ncan find.\n  In other words, over 10 percent of our workforce is either unemployed \nor underemployed right now, and we are providing foreign tax breaks \nworth $39 billion, additional foreign tax breaks, in this measure to \nthese companies or to the investors in them.\n  I will have an amendment I will offer that would address this matter \nand take these foreign tax breaks out of the bill, because if we are \ngoing to provide tax incentives, as other parts of the bill do, let's \nat least provide those incentives to American companies for producing \njobs in the United States. Let's tie every single one of the tax \nadvantages in this legislation to the provision of new jobs, ideally \nmanufacturing jobs but provable new or additional jobs in the United \nStates to Americans now, not as the measure provides for tax breaks \nthat are going to accelerate in the years 2009 to 2012. Those are not \ngoing to result in the creation of new jobs in this country now. We are \ngiving tax advantages to companies, some of which can certainly benefit \nfrom it, but many have been part of the 20-percent increases in \ncorporate profitability in each of the last 2 years.\n  I am glad American corporations are profitable. We need them to be \nprofitable in order to create jobs. But the fact is that at least in \nthe manufacturing sector--and up until now in just about any other \nsector--improved profitability has not resulted in new job creation in \nthe last couple of years. It didn't result in new job creation last \nmonth. So if we are going to provide tax reductions for U.S. \nmanufacturing companies or anyone else, let's make darn sure those \nreductions are going to result in jobs, the creation of new jobs or the \nadding of jobs where formerly people had been laid off or cut back. \nLet's translate those tax breaks into what this bill calls itself, a \nJOBS Act, jobs for Americans.\n  Finally, I want to address the fact that as part of this gambit today \nto supposedly recommit the bill to the committee where it already was \nreferred out, one of the ways in which we were supposedly going to be \ninduced to do so was some part of the former Energy bill, we were told, \nwas going to be added to the bill that reappeared out of the Finance \nCommittee. I appreciate very much the work that has been done by that \ncommittee, in particular by Chairman Grassley of Iowa, who has been \nstalwart in terms of providing additional tax incentives for energy \nproduction, particularly the biofuels, ethanol, and biodiesel fuels. He \nwas instrumental also in changing the formula on the highway trust fund \nthat penalized States such as Minnesota for their ethanol consumption. \nI would like to join with the majority leader and others who would like \nto advance this Energy legislation forward.\n  Since the bill was not recommitted to the Finance Committee, I have \ndrafted an amendment I intend to introduce to add some of the energy \nprovisions to the pending bill, ones that would reinstate the renewable \nfuels standard Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, was instrumental \nin adding and keeping through the conference committee a year ago, \nlegislation to expand the American consumption of ethanol and biodiesel \nfuels over the next 10 years, the electric reliability section, which \nis beneficial to smaller utilities throughout Minnesota and elsewhere \nin the Nation, and then the package of tax incentives which Chairman \nGrassley, ranking member Baucus, and others voted out of the Senate \nFinance Committee that provide alternative fuel incentives, the small \nethanol producer tax credit, the tradability of these credits by those \nco-ops and others that otherwise can't take advantage of them, the tax \ncredit for biodiesel that parallels the credit provided for \nethanol production.\n\n  These are important measures that would do what the bill itself \npurports to do, which is to add jobs and provide enormous economic \nbenefits to a State such as Minnesota, to farmers in terms of income, \nto the production plants for ethanol and biodiesel fuels.\n  Those are real jobs amendments, real jobs provisions, those that are \ngoing to provide tax credits for business activities, those that are \ngoing to result directly in additional jobs for America and in an \nalternative fuel for America that can reduce our dependence on foreign \noil; that can take some of the $115 billion a year we send out of the \ncountry to foreign countries such as Saudi Arabia and elsewhere to \nimport foreign oil into this country; $115 billion that, if it were \ngoing into the pockets of American farmers and multiplying those \ndollars throughout communities, would result in an economic \nrevitalization of rural America the likes of which we have not seen in \ndecades and which we couldn't create any other way, not through all the \nGovernment programs you want to imagine, just through the free market, \nthrough increased profitability for American agriculture, through the \ncreation of cleaner burning fuels that are available right now and \ncould be produced right now in quantities to significantly replace the \ngasoline that is consumed all over this country.\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\n  That is a real jobs amendment, one I will be introducing and hope we \ncan consider as part of the JOBS Act, so we can make that bill live up \nto its name, one that will actually provide jobs for Americans rather \nthan corporate tax giveaways for those who don't need them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I want to comment on the remarks of \nthe Senator from Minnesota this evening before the Senate and indicate \nmany of us who voted against the Harkin amendment were also as \nconcerned about some of the things the Senator of Minnesota talked \nabout, in terms of the benefits that accrued to working men and women \nin the United States of America.\n  I made it clear at that time, when I voted against the Harkin \namendment, I felt the Department of Labor should be able to move \nforward with their recommendations on a law that hasn't been changed \nsince 1978, and that if what my colleagues on the other aisle have \nindicated is true, many of us would join them in having those rules \noverturned by the Members of the Senate.\n  I am pleased to say those rules have been finished by the Department \nof Labor and they are now at OIRA, which is in the Office of Management \nand Budget, being reviewed by John Graham. I am hopeful they will be \nback to the Department of Labor within the next 30 days, so we will \nknow specifically what it is those rules are going to recommend in \nterms of changes in the law. Hopefully, they are not going to reflect \nwhat I have heard on the floor of the Senate over the last couple of \nmonths about eliminating overtime for 8 million workers.\n  The other thing I want to point out is there are many of us on this \nside of the aisle who are very much in favor of extending unemployment \nbenefits, and I joined with many colleagues to try to get cloture on \nthat amendment several weeks ago. I hope in the next couple of weeks we \nwill be able to get that passed on the Senate floor. There are hundreds \nof workers in my State--and I am sure also in Minnesota--anxiously \nwaiting for those benefits. In my State, we have too many people who \nare unemployed. Quite frankly, too many people in my State are worried \nabout whether they are going to have a job. So some of the things the \nSenator talked about, I hope, will be dealt with during the next couple \nof weeks.\n  Mr. DAYTON. If the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator for the \nupdate on the overtime situation. I look forward to improved provisions \nfrom the Secretary of Labor. I thank the Senator also for his \ninvolvement and support to extend unemployment benefits. I know people \nin his State of Ohio, my State of Minnesota, and many States \ndesperately need that. So I thank him.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I also share the Senator's enthusiasm \nabout the ethanol guarantee in the Energy bill. There are many other \nprovisions in that bill many of us are concerned about. I think it \nrepresents the first real energy policy this country has had. Again, \nhopefully, we can work it out so that can get done along with the other \nprovisions. He is right; that bill has some real job-creation aspects \nto it, particularly in the area of ethanol. We have several companies \nnow that are thinking about building ethanol plants in Ohio, and I \nthink one of the things the American public doesn't understand is it is \ngoing to provide less reliance on foreign oil and, in addition, it will \nlimit some of the environmental problems we have from gasoline, with \nsome other very good and important aspects to all of our brothers and \nsisters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Voinovich pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2292 are printed in today's Record under ``Introduction of bills and \njoint resolutions.'')\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Security and Freedom Ensured Act\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I join my colleagues Senators Craig \nand Durbin in urging the administration and Congress to support the \nSAFE Act. The SAFE Act is a much needed bill that amends a few \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act in a reasonable way to preserve our \nconstitutional rights and protections while still protecting our Nation \nagainst terrorism.\n  More than 2 years after the PATRIOT Act passed so overwhelmingly, \nwithout close scrutiny by Congress, I am delighted that there is now \ngrowing support for close examination of application of the law and for \nchanges to the law to ensure that, as we fight terrorism, we also \nprotect the civil liberties of Americans.\n  There is reason for hope. In Congress and in communities across the \ncountry, the American people are beginning to realize that the PATRIOT \nAct went too far.\n  In Congress, there is bipartisan support for changes to the law. I am \npleased to join my Republican colleagues, Senators Craig, Crapo, \nSununu, and Murkowski, as a cosponsor of the SAFE Act.\n  Over 275 communities and four States have now passed resolutions \nexpressing opposition to certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. President, the attacks of September 11, 2001, presented a new and \nunique challenge to this country. I can think of nothing more important \nthan responding to that terrible challenge and protecting Americans \nagainst terrorism. As I said during debate on the PATRIOT Act and \ncontinue to say today, I believe most of the Act's provisions were \nnecessary and proper, such as increasing the number of border patrol \nagents and allowing the FBI access to voicemails as a part of wiretaps.\n  But we must be sure that, in conducting the fight against terrorism, \nthe country's highest priority, we also respect the civil rights and \nliberties of all Americans. History shows that America should not let \nfear, however justified, cause us to sacrifice our liberty or the \nliberty of others in the name of national security. The Palmer raids, \nthe McCarthy hearings, the internment of Japanese-Americans, these are \nall events that have been judged poorly through the lens of history. \nToday, we are again faced with a grave threat but we can and must face \nit without potentially abusing the power of the Federal Government or \ntrampling fundamental constitutional rights and protections.\n  I am pleased that Members of Congress and the American people are \nbeginning to realize the values at stake. There is healthy debate \nacross the country in city councils, State legislatures, town hall \ngatherings, and in Congress, on how best to preserve a free and open \nsociety and to protect our Nation against future terrorist attacks.\n  In contrast, the administration does not seem interested in engaging \nin a good faith dialogue with the American people and Members of \nCongress about our legitimate concerns and reasonable proposals.\n  Instead, the President has prematurely called for lifting the sunset \non certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act that are due to expire. \nCongress has a responsibility to exercise oversight and demand \naccountability from the agencies using authority granted to them by \nCongress. Nearly 2 years before some provisions of the PATRIOT Act will \nsunset, the administration should be engaging in good faith discussions \nand negotiations on how it is using the powers it has and how best to \nprotect our country from terrorism while also protecting the civil \nliberties of our citizens.\n  I am pleased that both Senator Hatch and Representative \nSensenbrenner, the Chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees, respectively, have disagreed with the President and have \nstated that close scrutiny of the PATRIOT Act will be undertaken before \nCongress will consider lifting the sunset provisions. I commend them \nfor taking this position. It is the right thing to do and the proper \nrole of Congress.\n  In addition to prematurely calling for lifting the sunset provisions, \nthe administration has already threatened to veto the SAFE Act if it is \nenacted.\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\nThat is unfortunate, and very unusual. The administration has issued a \nveto threat of a bill that was introduced just a few months ago and has \nnot even had a hearing yet. Thousands of bills are introduced each \nyear. The administration could spend a lot of time issuing veto threats \nfor every one it disagrees with. Obviously, it is worried about this \none. But veto threats at this early stage do not contribute to a \nproductive dialogue, and they certainly will not deter the growing \nbipartisan interest in reevaluating the PATRIOT Act.\n\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about the SAFE Act and why it \nis a reasonable proposal.\n  As my colleagues Senators Craig and Durbin have discussed, the SAFE \nAct makes important modifications to enhance judicial review of the \nFBI's roving wiretap and so-called ``sneak and peek'' search \nactivities.\n  I would like to comment on another important modification to the \nPATRIOT Act contained in the SAFE Act, the section 215, or business \nrecords, fix.\n  Prior to the PATRIOT Act, the Government could compel the production \nof only certain business records in connection with a counter-\nintelligence or international terrorism investigation, namely, hotel, \nrental car, airline, and storage facility records. This was a narrow \nset of records, and so it made sense to change the law. I agree with \nthat change, to allow the FBI access to more categories of business \nrecords.\n  But the PATRIOT Act went too far because it also weakened the ability \nof the courts to exercise their proper role as a check on the executive \nbranch, and it took away the requirement of individualized suspicion. \nThe PATRIOT Act changed the standards for allowing the FBI access to \nsuch records. Prior to the PATRIOT Act, investigators had to state, in \ntheir application to the secret FISA court, specific and articulable \nfacts giving reason to believe that the person to whom the records \npertained was a suspected terrorist or spy. If a court agreed, it would \nissue the order.\n  The PATRIOT Act, however, vastly expanded this power so that \ninvestigators no longer have to show ``specific and articulable \nfacts.'' Now, investigators need only state that the records are \n``sought for'' a counter-intelligence or international terrorism \ninvestigation. Upon receiving the application for a court order, the \njudge must--must--issue the order. He or she does not have discretion. \nThe judge cannot review the merits of the request. For example, a judge \ncannot review facts to determine whether the scope of the request is \nreasonable. So long as the FBI asserts that the records are ``sought \nfor'' a foreign intelligence investigation, the judge must issue the \norder.\n  The SAFE Act sponsors and I, as well as librarians, privacy \nadvocates, and an increasing number of Americans, believe this \nprovision of the PATRIOT Act goes too far. We recognize that there is \nenormous potential for abuse if the FBI is allowed access to personal \ninformation, such as medical records, library records, or newspaper or \nmagazine subscription records, all with no meaningful judicial review \nand without a requirement of some showing that the records pertain to a \nsuspected terrorist or spy.\n\n  The SAFE Act would simply re-insert a pre-PATRIOT Act standard so \nthat he role of the judge as a check on the executive branch is real \nand effective. Like the standard prior to the PATRIOT Act, under the \nSAFE Act the FBI would need to state specific and articulable facts to \nsupport its application. The SAFE Act simply restores the judicial \noversight that existed prior to the PATRIOT Act, giving the court the \npower to ensure that the Federal Government is not engaging in a \nfishing expedition at the expense of innocent Americans. This is a \nreasonable response to protect both our security and our privacy.\n  The administration has not shown how this prudent safeguard would \nharm the fight against terrorism or impair its ability to get access to \ninformation it needs to protect the country.\n  I might add that according to the administration, as of last \nSeptember, almost 2 years since enactment of the PATRIOT Act, the \nadministration claims it had not yet used section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct. It is unclear whether they have used it since that time, and I \nhave recently sent the Attorney General a letter asking him whether it \nhas been used. But regardless of whether it has been used zero times or \na handful of times, it is nevertheless difficult to understand how re-\ninserting an important judicial check would harm the fight against \nterrorism.\n  I urge the administration to reconsider its position on the SAFE Act. \nThe American people have thoughtfully expressed their fears and wishes. \nThey want the Federal Government to protect them against terrorism, but \nthey also want the Federal Government to be respectful of the \nConstitution every step of the way.\n  With passage of the SAFE Act, we can reassure the American people \nthat we are working to protect their rights and liberties, as well as \ntheir safety. I urge my colleagues and the administration to support \nthe SAFE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Frist and Mr. Hatch pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2290 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I will withhold at the request \nof the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida. This will only take a moment, but I yield the floor to \naccommodate the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Florida. He has \nbeen sitting patiently. I already interrupted another Senator, but this \nwill be very brief.\n  Mr. President, over the next few minutes, I want to outline what the \nplans will be over tonight and tomorrow, briefly.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 3108\n\n  First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m., on \nThursday, April 8, the Senate proceed to the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3108, the pension equity bill. I further ask consent \nthat there then be 4 hours equally divided for debate between the two \nleaders or their designees. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \non adoption of the conference report, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tomorrow we will have morning business. We \nwill say more about that. Then at 11 o'clock, we will proceed to this \nconference report for up to 4 hours. I am not sure we will use that \nentire 4 hours, but there will be up to 4 hours equally divided on this \nvery important bill, followed by a vote.\n  On a separate issue we have been addressing all day--actually the \nlast several weeks--the FSC/ETI or JOBS bill, we are making real \nprogress. As mentioned shortly after the vote earlier this afternoon, \nwe are working on a list of amendments, a finite list of amendments, \nthat would be agreed to by both the Democratic side and the Republican \nside.\n  We made real progress. I was very hopeful we would be able to, around \nthis time, come back and say: This is the list; this is exactly how we \nare going to handle it. But we will continue to work over the next \nseveral hours and do want to announce that progress. We will have more \nto say either later tonight but more probably early first thing in the \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to confirm what the majority \nleader has reported. I think we have made real progress. We are not \nquite there, but I think we will be there. I can say, with great pride \nand satisfaction, I appreciate very much the cooperation of\n\n[[Page S3911]]\n\nvirtually every member of our caucus. I thank them for that cooperation \nand would hope perhaps by sometime tomorrow morning we will be able to \nreach an agreement.\n  I ask the majority leader if he anticipates any more rollcall votes \ntonight, given where we are with regard to the current schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, through the Chair, we will \nhave no more rollcall votes tonight. Assuming we will be able to reach \nan agreement on a finite list on the FSC/ETI bill, I would expect we \nwould not have votes on Friday of this week either.\n  Again, I thank our colleague from Florida. That will be the last \ninterruption, I promise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                   Cost of Prescription Drug Benefit\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, there is a recurring pattern in \nthis town. An issue comes to our attention. It is red hot. It creates a \ngreat deal of controversy. Two months later it is forgotten. My effort \ntonight is going to be to resurrect one of those issues because I think \nis it not only extremely important, but it is also urgent that we give \nit attention.\n  The issue is the administration's cost estimate of the Medicare \nModernization and Improvement Act and the circumstances surrounding the \nfailure to release that cost estimate to the Congress. As I said, this \nis old news, but let me just refresh some people's memories.\n  As early as the summer of 2003, the administration's actuaries, the \npeople who work for the administration in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, projected that the 10-year cost of the Medicare \nlegislation, which among other things provided a prescription drug \nbenefit, would be $534 billion over a 10-year period. It is also old \nnews that Mr. Rick Foster, Chief Actuary of the Medicare Program, was \nordered by the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices--at that time Mr. Thomas Scully--to withhold critical \nactuarial data from Congress and that failure to abide by this order \nmight well result in Mr. Foster being fired.\n  What is yet to be news are the reasons for the months' long delay in \ndisclosing that estimate to the American public and to the Congress. It \nhas now been 10 weeks since we found out the Medicare bill that we had \nrepresented to us as costing $400 billion over 10 years would actually \ncost $534 billion, according to the administration's own actuaries--10 \nweeks. We have had no explanation for the reasons for the delay, \ndespite the following quote by Secretary Thompson, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, on March 16 of this year. What \ndid the Secretary say?\n\n       There seems to be a cloud over this department because of \n     this. We have nothing to hide. So I want to make darn sure \n     that everything comes out.\n\n  Along with other members of the Finance Committee, I have asked the \nchairman and the ranking member to hold a hearing on the cost estimate \nand the reasons for its late disclosure. Given his strong track record \non Medicare oversight, I am confident these two fine Senators will do \nso.\n  I want to be clear about a couple of things:\n  One, it is not the cost per se that is troubling to me. In a moment \nof full disclosure, I voted for a prescription drug benefit that cost \nmore than $400 billion. I voted for a prescription drug benefit that \ncost more than $534 billion. But I was voting for a prescription drug \nbenefit that would at least provide a reliable Buick-style benefit to \nour seniors. What has now happened is we have learned that we passed a \nYugo-like prescription drug benefit and are now paying Cadillac prices \nfor it.\n  The second thing I wish to be clear about, some of my colleagues have \nsuggested that the only estimate that matters is the Congressional \nBudget Office because Congress is legally required to rely on the CBO \nnumbers. You may recall, as a youth, reading some Charles Dickens \nbooks, including possibly Oliver Twist. In that book, when confronted \nwith a similar argument, Mr. Bumble said:\n\n       If the law supposed that, the law is an ass, an idiot.\n\n  Mr. Bumble's perspective on the law aside, it is indeed true that \nCongress uses CBO numbers as our official scorekeeper, and I am not \nsuggesting that at this point we alter that process. At the same time I \ndon't think anyone would disagree that it is in America's best interest \nand the best interest of Congress to have as much information as \npossible before we vote on significant pieces of legislation. That \nwould clearly include the insights of the person most knowledgeable \nabout the likely cost of this program--the actuary of the very \ndepartment that will have the responsibility for administering the \nprogram.\n  In fact, it seems information was deliberate, purposefully withheld \nfrom the Congress. That action of withholding was contrary to past \npractices. Moreover, it appears to directly violate the spirit of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 which confirmed the independence of the \nChief Actuary and the desire of Congress to have access to his relevant \ncost projections.\n  The fact that the official cost has appropriately been determined by \nCBO is not the point, nor is the point the fact that there was a \ndifference in the cost estimates between the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Department's actuaries. We know that different analysts \nwill frequently arrive at different conclusions. The point is this: the \nenormous magnitude of the difference and the efforts apparently taken \nby this administration to keep that huge difference hidden from public \nand congressional scrutiny. That is the point.\n  The point is the Chief Actuary had information that would have been \nvaluable to us, Republicans and Democrats alike, in our deliberations \nlong before we took our vote on the final conferenced version of the \nMedicare prescription drug legislation. This information was \ndeliberately withheld.\n  The fact is, if the White House had released to the public and the \nCongress its own actuary's estimate of the cost of this Yugo \nprescription drug benefit, the legislation would clearly not have \npassed.\n  The Finance Committee has a particular obligation to investigate this \ndeception. As a member of that committee, I understand we have an \nobligation to seniors who are depending on an affordable, quality \nprescription drug benefit. We have an obligation to taxpayers who will \nbe paying for that benefit. We have an obligation to our fellow \ncolleagues to whom we declared, we represented that this plan would not \ncost more than $400 billion, cross my heart and hope to die.\n  We have an obligation to get answers to these questions:\n  What did the President know regarding the much higher cost estimated \nby his own actuaries and when did he know it? For someone from \nTennessee, that might be a familiar question.\n  If the President did not know that one of his stated priorities was \nestimated by his actuaries to far exceed the cost ceiling for this \nMedicare change--$400 billion over 10 years--who within his \nadministration failed to notify him of this extraordinary cost overrun?\n  Third, what actions, if any, were taken by the Department of Health \nand Human Services, the Office of Management and Budget, or the White \nHouse itself to prevent the timely and accurate reporting of \ninformation to Congress on the cost of this Medicare bill?\n  Finally, who has the President held accountable for this deception \nand what sanctions have been imposed?\n  These are ``rational, critical, important to the Congress and the \npublic to know the answers'' questions. One of the immediate impacts we \nare going to have because of this withholding is that the Congress, the \nSenate, now the House, have recently passed budget resolutions. These \nbudget resolutions cover fiscal year 2005, which begins October 1 of \nthis year, running through fiscal year 2009. In that budget resolution, \nas passed by the Senate, the baseline cost of the new Medicare \nprescription drug provisions and other matters that were included in \nthat legislation is $165 billion over 5 years. The number, as \ndetermined by the administration's own Office of the Actuary in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, is $231 billion.\n  Mr. President, what are we going to do when we face the question of \nfunding this prescription drug benefit--what I suspect to be likely \ncloser to its true cost, $231 billion, as opposed to $165 billion, \nCBO's number. Are we\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\ngoing to have to have a point of order with 60 votes every time we \nexceed the clearly inadequate number in order to provide the benefit \nthat we are now running millions of dollars worth of television ads \ntelling the seniors of America they are about to get a new benefit, \nwithout any changes in the Medicare Program?\n  The Finance Committee needs to closely examine these different \nnumbers. I suggest a couple of places to start. Approximately 25 \npercent of the difference between CBO and the actuaries is in one area, \nand that is what will be the effect of increasing the number of persons \nwho are enrolled in health management organizations. This legislation \nnot only dealt with prescription drugs, but it also substantially \nincreased the funding for HMOs and insurance companies in order to \ncreate an atmosphere that would induce new Medicare beneficiaries to \nchange their form of service from fee for service to traditional \nMedicare and to join an HMO.\n  In fact, the CBO estimated it would cost an additional $14 billion to \ndo that. The administration estimates it will cost $46 billion. You \nmight ask why does it cost more. I thought the purpose of using an HMO \nfor Medicare beneficiaries was it would save money. It was supposed to \nget people into a more organized health care system; it was supposed to \nencourage HMOs to provide preventive services so people would not get \nas sick, and they would have a higher quality of life and less health \ncare costs.\n  Well, I am shocked, and I am certain most Members of Congress are \nshocked, to find the administration finds it will cost $46 billion more \nto provide health care services to those persons who are induced by the \nbenefits of this legislation to join an HMO than if they stayed where \nthey were. So one question we need to know is, why are we scaring \nseniors into HMOs, when this is clearly harmful to the financial \nstructure of the Medicare Program?\n  The second point I hope the Finance Committee will review is the \nprohibition inserted into this legislation against the administrator of \nthe program and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, negotiating on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries to get the \nbest possible prices for prescription drugs. We have an almost \nanalogous situation, except the circumstances are reversed. The \nSecretary of the Veterans' Administration is directed to negotiate for \nthe prescription drugs his largest hospital system in the world \nprovides. Guess what. He has negotiated so well the cost of \nprescription drugs in a VA hospital is less than half of what it would \nbe if you bought the same drugs at retail at a local drugstore.\n  Can you believe the Congress of the United States has passed a \nprovision that prohibits the head of Health and Human Services from \ngetting the same good prices for our seniors?\n  Let me say, as an aside, we have seen some extremely distressing \nnumbers from the trustees of the Medicare Program. In fact, they \nreleased a report within the last 30 days which indicated there has \nbeen a 7-year shortening in the term--the years in which Medicare will \ngo insolvent. As recently as last year, it was estimated the program \nwould go insolvent in 2026. In 1 year, they have reduced that to 2019. \nSo we have a system that, we are being told by our best experts, in a \nlittle more than 15 years is going to be insolvent. It seems to me \nthere ought to be a sense of urgency to get every possible relief we \ncan to this program so we do not deny the promise that has been made to \nthe American people, to the working men and women, when they reach \nretirement age.\n\n  I believe one thing we can do immediately, in addition to reviewing \nthis issue of health maintenance organizations, is to give to the \nSecretary of HHS and the administrator of the Medicare Program the \nauthority to negotiate for the hospital portion of prescription drugs. \nWe have passed a new prescription drug benefit for outpatients. But \nsince the beginning of Medicare, Medicare has paid for prescription \ndrugs that were dispensed in a hospital setting. We ought to do \neverything we can, in light of the fact that 100 percent of the trust \nfunds for Medicare goes for part A--the hospital part--to lower the \ncost of the hospitals. One immediate way we can do it is by assisting \nthe hospitals in the same way VA assists its hospitals, to lower the \ncost of their prescription drugs.\n  I am hopeful the Finance Committee will hold a hearing on this \nimportant issue before the Memorial Day recess. This would give us an \nopportunity to fully understand the differences between the two \nestimates, the implications of those differences, and the process by \nwhich we learned at such a late date the administration was going to \nproject such an enormous difference. And most important, as a Congress, \nwe need to understand what happened and how the Congress can correct \nthe consequence of this deception.\n\n\n                                jobs act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Strength Act, a bill that provides much-needed tax relief to \nour Nation's manufacturing base in a manner that will not only protect \nbut will create jobs. Without question, passing this bipartisan \nlegislation will provide a major boost to the manufacturing sector of \nour economy.\n  Indeed, this legislation is necessary because our country's \nmanufacturers are in desperate need of help. Not only has America been \nhard hit by slow worldwide growth, but also has sustained significant \njob losses during the last few years.\n  Although the economic statistics for March are a positive \nimprovement, there remains cause for concern when one considers the \nprofound erosion of U.S. manufacturing jobs in recent years. The damage \nthis sector has sustained is nothing short of stunning. From July 2000 \nthrough July 2003, nearly 2.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were \neliminated. Incredibly, New England lost more than 214,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in the decade between June 1993 and June 2003.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, between \nJanuary 2001 through January 2004, manufacturing employment in our \nNation declined by 16 percent. In New England, there was a 20 percent \ndecrease in manufacturing employment during that same time period. This \nmeans that between January 2001 and January 2004, New England's \nmanufacturing sector employment declined by an alarming 28 percent \nfaster rate than it did nationally.\n  My home State of Maine has been shedding manufacturing jobs at an \nalarming rate over the past decade--and all the more so in the past two \nyears. From January 1993 through June 2003, a 10\\1/2\\ year period, \nMaine lost 18,900 manufacturing jobs. More specifically, from July 2000 \nto June 2003, Maine has lost 17,300 manufacturing jobs--the highest \nloss of any State during that time period.\n  In addition to passing this legislation to reverse these trends, we \nare also here to replace the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial \nIncome, FSC/ETI, rules. Congress enacted these rules to make U.S. \nexporters more competitive overseas by reducing their maximum income \ntax rate on export income from 35 percent to about 29.75 percent. This \nincentive is necessary to offset the disadvantage that U.S. exporters \nface vis-a-vis foreign competitors who benefit from a territorial tax \nregime. Nevertheless, the World Trade Organization, WTO, determined \nthat the FSC/ETI rules provide an impermissible export subsidy, meaning \nCongress must repeal those rules or face over $4 billion in trade \nsanctions. Those sanctions began to take effect March 1.\n  At the same time, repealing these rules will result in a nearly $50 \nbillion tax increase on the manufacturing sector over the next ten \nyears. Consequently, we need to replace the FSC/ETI regime with an \nappropriate substitute that not only complies with WTO rules but, more \nimportantly, protects our own manufacturing base.\n  Our objectives should therefore be clear: not only must we pass \nlegislation to comply with international trade law, but more \nimportantly, we need to offer our country's manufacturers with a \nsolution that will jumpstart their production and create jobs, and we \nmust do so right now. Were we to neglect this duty to ensure that our \nnation's manufacturers are simply given the chance to compete on a \nlevel playing field with foreign competitors, we would only be \ncompounding the current situation--a\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\nresult with which I am sure very few persons, particularly those \nworkers who have lost their jobs would be pleased.\n  Our task, then, is to identify the best way to ``reallocate'' the $50 \nbillion in revenues that replacing the FSC/ETI rules will generate and \nensure that those funds continue to benefit their original \nbeneficiary--namely our manufacturers. For that reason, I am pleased \nthat the main component of this bill provides direct tax relief to the \nmanufacturing sector of our economy. By permitting manufacturers to \nexclude from tax a portion of their income earned directly from \nmanufacturing operations that employ U.S. workers and are located in \nthe United States, we will continue to ensure that our Nation's \nmanufacturers are on a level playing field with foreign competitors, \nand we will accelerate the overall economic recovery that is so \ndesperately needed  and that is already underway.\n\n  This legislation, therefore, provides poignant, targeted tax relief \ndirectly into the sector of our nation's economy that needs it most. In \nshort, this income tax rate reduction for manufacturers will reduce \ntheir cost of doing business and increase their ability to compete in a \nglobal economy. Consequently, these businesses will be able to reinvest \nthis savings directly into their operations, thereby increasing \nproductivity and creating jobs.\n  To achieve these results, it is essential that this tax relief must \nbe available for all manufacturers--regardless of entity \nclassification. As such, I along with several Senators worked hard \nduring the Finance Committee's markup to insist that this bill apply to \nsmall businesses that operate in the form of S-corporations, \npartnerships, limited liability companies, and sole-proprietorships. \nWith small business manufacturers constituting over 98 percent of our \nNation's manufacturing enterprises, employing 12 million people, and \nsupplying more than 50 percent of the value-added during U.S. \nmanufacturing, it is imperative that we not turn our backs on these \nhard working taxpayers.\n  Despite the significance that small businesses play in our country's \neconomy, and despite the fact that not every manufacturer operates as a \ncorporation, some contend that in place of this bill's targeted \nmanufacturing relief, a more appropriate course of action would be to \nprovide an across-the-board 2 percent tax cut for all domestic \ncorporations--regardless if they are manufacturers.\n  I find this alternative problematic for two reasons. First, this \nproposition forgets the reason why we are here in the first place--\nnamely to reallocate tax cuts that Congress provided specifically for \ndomestic manufacturers in an effort to maintain their international \ncompetitiveness. Doesn't it make sense to ensure that all \nmanufacturers, which are the primary beneficiaries of the FSC/ETI \nrules, continue to be the primary beneficiary of its replacement \nlegislation, particularly when the manufacturing sector of our economy \nis already struggling to compete and preserve jobs?\n  After all, the main goal of this bill is to increase the \ncompetitiveness of our manufacturing base and stop the current job loss \ntrend, meaning legislation that is not necessarily focused exclusively \non manufacturing sector might fall short of this goal. Rather, the \nfocus must remain on promoting domestic job creation, and the \nlegislation before us accomplishes this task much more effectively than \nwould an across-the-board tax cut that is exclusive to corporations.\n  In addition, an across-the-board corporate rate cut limits this tax \nrelief to only corporations--something that is simply unacceptable as \nsmall businesses, many of which are S-corporations, limited liability \ncompanies, partnerships, and sole-proprietorships, are the true engine \nthat drives this economy and are responsible for a majority of domestic \njob creation. Indeed, small businesses account for 97.5 percent of \nMaine businesses . . . 98 percent of America's manufacturing enterprise \n. . . and contribute three-quarters of all new jobs nationwide. It is \ntherefore imperative that this legislation, which is intended to \n``Jumpstart Our Business Strength,'' include all manufacturers, \nparticularly all small businesses, so that we continue this upward \ntrend and reinvigorate America's entrepreneurial spirit.\n  Along those lines, I am also pleased that Chairman Grassley \nincorporated several other of my provisions during the Finance \nCommittee's markup of this bill. For example, current law permits small \nbusinesses to expense, rather than depreciate, up to $100,000 spent on \nequipment used in their trade or business. While this provision \nencourages capital investments and stimulates economic growth, the \ncurrent phase-out limits the number of small businesses that can \nqualify.\n  My provision already in this bill increases the phase out threshold--\nthereby increasing the number of eligible small businesses for this \nmuch-needed tax relief. In turn, these taxpayers will be provided with \ngreater incentive to expand their operations that will not only \nincrease productivity but ultimately create jobs.\n  Another one of my provisions included in this legislation is based on \nmy bill S. 885--The Small Business Investment Company Capital Access \nAct of 2003. In short, this bill provides that certain government-\nguaranteed debt capital of Debenture Small Business Investment \nCompanies, SBICs, is excluded from the definition of ``debt'' for \npurposes of the unrelated businesses taxable income rules.\n\n  This change is necessary because under current law, potential tax-\nexempt investors such as pension funds and universities are dissuaded \nfrom investing in small businesses due to the tax liability that would \nresult from the SBICs. By eliminating this problem and expanding the \ncapital available for SBICs to invest in the nation's small businesses \nat the modest rate of $1 million per year, this provision has the \npotential to result in $500-$600 million of new capital investments in \nSBICs, which in turn will create thousands of jobs each year.\n  Furthermore, this bill includes specific provisions at my urging that \nwill benefit greatly many taxpayers in my home State of Maine. In \ncommittee, I worked to ensure that the tax relief in this bill was \nextended to ``unprocessed softwood timber.'' The Softwood Lumber \nindustry, like paper and steel, has faced unfair trade from countries \nthat subsidize their products and dump them on the U.S. market. For \nthat reason, combined with the fact that this legislation is intended \nto benefit manufacturers in general and not only exporters, it is \nessential that this legislation extend this tax relief to the timber \nindustry.\n  Similarly, I urged Chairman Grassley to include a provision in this \nlegislation that would classify gains resulting from the sale or \nexchange of timber as capital rather than ordinary. The crux of this \nprovision is to change the way in which capital gains are calculated \nfor timber by taking the amount of gain and subtracting three percent \nfor each year the timber was held. This change is necessary because \nalthough individuals pay a maximum capital gains rate of 15 percent, \ncorporations must still pay a 35 percent rate. As such, this change \nwill reduce the rate of tax for corporations that sell timber, \ntherefore making the U.S. forest products industry more competitive \ninternationally and preserving domestic jobs.\n  In addition to these provisions that already are included in the \nbill, I am working with Chairman Grassley on an amendment that I have \nfiled that will not only spur economic growth but that will also go a \nlong way in bolstering our national security. Currently, navy \nshipbuilders are treated unfairly by the tax code because they are \nrequired to pay tax based on an expected percentage of their profits. \nThis treatment is problematic because oftentimes, they do not receive \npayment for several years, meaning the income tax has an overly \nburdensome effect on their cash flow and their overall production.\n  My amendment would change this treatment by placing navy shipbuilders \non equal treatment with commercial shipbuilders in allowing them to pay \n40 percent of their estimated income tax during the contract and the \nremaining 60 percent upon completion of the contract so long as the \ncontract does not exceed 8 years. Importantly, this amendment does not \nin any way affect the amount of tax that navy shipbuilders will pay; \nrather, it simply affords a more equitable payment schedule to allow \nthese taxpayers to satisfy\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\nmore of their tax obligation at a time in which they have cash in hand. \nI hope that in working with the chairman, we will find a way to address \nthis unfair disparity that is harming our Nation's naval shipbuilders.\n  Accordingly, I believe that the bill before us strikes the proper \nbalance of providing needed tax relief to the taxpayers in our economy \nwho need it most. It has taken a great deal of work to get us where we \nare today, yet I firmly believe that providing targeted, affordable tax \nrelief to the manufacturing sector of our economy is certainly the \nright path to choose in repealing the FSC/ETI rules.\n  The key here is that this bill simply reallocates the revenue that \nrepealing the FSC/ETI rules will raise and distributes it directly to \nthe primary beneficiaries of those rules--our country's manufacturers, \nwhich is indeed appropriate as the manufacturing base is in dire need \nof help.\n  While the legislation also simplifies the international tax code and \ncontains other miscellaneous tax cuts designed to create jobs, it does \nso without increasing the federal budget deficit because it contains \ntax offsets that will thwart taxpayers' participation in illegal tax \nshelters and abusive leasing transactions. Consequently, unlike \nprevious tax bills, this legislation is revenue neutral. Therefore, not \nonly is this bill affordable, but it is much needed in order to bolster \nour manufacturing base and enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. \nbased businesses.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                        medical liability reform\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, earlier today I voted in favor of invoking \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma \nCare Access Protection Act. My vote was not an endorsement of S. 2207 \nas it was introduced in the Senate. In fact, I have concerns about \nvarious aspects of the bill--including the $250,000 cap on noneconomic \ndamages--and I anticipate supporting amendments to S. 2207 if the \nSenate has an opportunity to fully debate this legislation.\n  However, I do believe that reform of the medical liability system \nshould be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging \nmedical malpractice premiums that endanger Americans' access to quality \nmedical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or to \ncease offering critical services, such as obstetrical care. For this \nreason, I voted for cloture on S. 2207 in an effort to move the debate \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nnoted Kentuckian and inspiring educator, Ms. Flora Allen. I also take \nthis opportunity to extend my condolences to her daughters, Nora Ruth \nJenkins and Margaret Cornelison, her five grandchildren, and all who \nknew and loved this remarkable woman.\n  Ms. Allen knew she wanted to be a teacher at a very early age. What \nshe didn't know was the amazing impact she would have on the students \nshe taught.\n  After moving to Berea, KY in 1946, she earned her bachelor's degree \nin teaching from Berea College and her masters from Eastern Kentucky \nUniversity. She taught Kentucky history, social studies and science for \n32 years. In addition to the traditional lessons, Ms. Allen also taught \nlife lessons, such as how to behave and treat others.\n  When Ms. Allen was away from the classroom, she was busy in her \ncommunity. She was a member of the Lioness Club, Berea Retired Teachers \nAssociation, Progress Club, Delta Kappa Gamma, and Berea Baptist Church \nwhere she taught Sunday school and Bible school. Ms. Allen spent her \nsummers and remaining spare time working in the flower shop she owned \nwith her husband, Allen's Flowers. Even with all this activity, Ms. \nAllen's best and most admirable attributes can be seen through the \nlives she touched.\n  It has become cliche to say that teachers inspire. Undoubtedly, \ninformed of such a happening, Ms. Allen would simply have smiled and \nstated that it had been her goal all along. What is not cliche is the \nfact that she instilled in her students a desire to learn, to know, and \nto understand. Not all of her former students went on to be historians. \nHowever, it is certain that a great many of them who were inspired by \nher have become better citizens.\n  I ask each of my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Flora \nAllen; for all that she gave to her community, her students, and to her \nfamily. She will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3914-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             UNR RIFLE TEAM\n\n  Mr. REID.

AMOS II\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nValparaiso, IN. Private First Class John Amos II, 22 years old, died in \nthe northern city of Kirkuk, Iraq on April 4, 2004, during an attack \nwhen the military vehicle he was riding in was struck by an improvised \nexplosive device.\n  After graduating from Valparaiso High School in 2002, John joined the \nArmy and was assigned to the C Company, 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry \nRegiment, 2nd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, HI. \nAccording to his mother, John was serving as the rear guard during a \npatrol at the time of his death. His deployment began when he joined \nthe efforts in Iraq only 2 months ago. With his entire life before him, \nJohn chose to risk everything to fight for the values Americans hold \nclose to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  John was the 26th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his father, John; his mother, Susan; his grandfather, Hank Amos; \ngrandparents Doug and Lucy Whitehead; his sister, Rebecca; and his two \nhalf brothers Hunter and Tyler. May John's siblings grow up knowing \nthat their brother gave his life so that young Iraqis will some day \nknow the freedom they enjoy.\n  Today I join John's family, his friends, and the entire Valparaiso \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nJohn, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  When looking back on the life of her late son, John's mother, Susan, \ntold the Gary Post-Tribune that her son ``was a fun-loving kid and a \nlot of fun.'' Today and always, John will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring John's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\nhere, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. \nThe world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it \ncan never forget what they did here. This statement is just as true \ntoday as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact \nof John's actions will live on far longer than any record of these \nwords.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of John D. Amos II in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like John's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3915-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RETIREMENT OF OFFICER JOHNNY WILSON FROM THE U.S. CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndistinguished service of Officer Johnny Lee Wilson of the U.S. Capitol \nPolice. Officer Wilson has been posted at the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence for the past 14 years. Regrettably, on April 30, 2004, \nOfficer Wilson will retire from the Capitol Police after more than 27 \nyears of dedicated service.\n  Officer Wilson was born in Shelby, NC, on November 5, 1945. Following \na move to Washington, DC, he finished high school. He then served in \nthe Armed Forces, where he saw combat in an Army infantry unit in \nVietnam in the late 1960s. At the conclusion of his tour, he was \ndecorated for outstanding performance.\n  Officer Wilson then returned to Washington, DC, to pursue his college \ndegree. In 1975, he graduated from Washington, DC's Howard University \nwith a bachelor of science degree.\n  In April 1977, Officer Wilson began his service with the U.S. Capitol \nPolice. For nearly three decades, he has dedicated himself to \nprotecting the lives of visitors, staff, and Members as they go about \ntheir daily business here on Capitol Hill. It is a job which has become \nincreasingly stressful since the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Despite the \nadded threats, Officer Wilson has performed his duties superbly. His \npatience, discipline, and attention to detail have made him an asset to \nthe Capitol Police and to the Intelligence Committee.\n  Officer Wilson's tireless dedication to the U.S. Capitol Police \nshould serve as an inspiration to everyone in law enforcement. He is a \ntremendous officer and a great friend to many in the U.S. Senate. He \nwill be truly missed as he enjoys his well-earned retirement.\n  Congratulations Officer Wilson, you are a fine public servant and a \nman of integrity and character. I extend my best wishes to your wife \nWeddie and your children--Gina and John-Paul. Good luck to you in \nretirement and thanks again for your fine service.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER, I add my voice to the comments of my colleague, \nSenator Roberts, concerning the contributions and outstanding \nperformance of Officer Johnny Wilson from the United States Capitol \nPolice. Officer Wilson is a 27-year veteran of the Capitol Police who \nis scheduled to retire in a few days. He has spent the past 14 years \nposted outside the offices of the Senate Intelligence Committee. During \nthat time, we came to think of Johnny as part of our staff and part of \nour family. It will be both odd and disappointing not seeing him \noutside our door every morning.\n  Officer Wilson, a Vietnam veteran, joined the Capitol Police on April \n4, 1977, and has dedicated his career to protecting the lives of \nMembers of Congress, their staffs and the thousands of tourists who \nvisit Capitol Hill each year. He is a fine example of the \nprofessionalism, dedication and work ethic of the men and women of the \nUnited States Capitol Police.\n  But what sets Johnny apart is the way in which he carries out his \nduties. He is outgoing and upbeat, with a hello and a kind word for \nanyone who crosses his path. Everyone that passes through the second \nfloor corridor outside the Intelligence Committee Hart Building offices \nknows Johnny and he knows them--if he doesn't he makes them think he \ndoes. At the same time he is unflappable when confronting tense \nsituations and approaches his responsibilities with complete \nseriousness.\n  In an era of technological advancements in biometrics and other \nenhanced security identification methods, there is absolutely no \nsubstitute for a professional law enforcement officer on the first line \nof defense. With Officer Wilson on the job, we all knew we were well \nprotected.\n  Officer Wilson's dedication to the United States Capitol Police has \nbeen proven on many occasions and he has been an excellent example of \nsomeone raising the bar of excellence for his peers. He has been a \ngreat friend to many in the United States Senate and he truly will be \nmissed. I congratulate this fine public servant, a man of integrity and \ncharacter, and I wish him well in his impending retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3915-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3915-S3916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORLD HEALTH DAY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to talk \nabout an issue that is very important to me personally, but one that is \nalso quickly becoming a concern across the globe: traffic crashes and \nthe resulting fatalities and injuries.\n  Today is World Health Day. World Health Day is celebrated every year \non April 7, focusing each year on a different public health problem. \nFor the first time ever, in response to the growing number of traffic \ndeaths worldwide, the World Health Organization chose the theme of \n``Road Safety'' for World Health Day 2004. The goal is to raise \nawareness of traffic safety in hopes of reducing the staggering number \nof traffic related fatalities and injuries that occur worldwide each \nyear. Efforts are being launched today in the U.S. and worldwide to \nencourage action in policy, programs, funding and research on traffic \nsafety.\n  Consider these statistics: Every year, nearly 1.2 million people die \nworldwide in motor vehicle crashes and an estimated 10 to 15 million \npeople are injured. In the U.S. alone, almost 43,000 people are killed \neach year and nearly 3 million are injured. Traffic crashes are the \nleading cause of death for people ages 1-34 and are one of the top ten \ncauses of death for all ages. In North Dakota, it is estimated that \nmotor vehicle crashes cost our citizens $290 million in 2000, or $452 \nper person. Sadly, experts predict that road traffic fatalities will \ndouble by the year 2020.\n  Today in Washington, the Pan-American Health Organization, PAHO, \nalong with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, AAA, and \nmany other organizations are emphasizing the importance of safety belt \nuse as part of the efforts for World Health Day. Seat belts are the \nsingle most effective means of reducing the risk of death in a crash \nand have saved approximately 135,000 lives and prevented 3.8 million \ninjuries in the last 26 years in the U.S. If everyone consistently wore \na seat belt, more than 7,000 American deaths could be prevented each \nyear.\n  This initiative coincides with our efforts in Congress to reauthorize \nthe transportation bill. I supported passage of the Senate bill, which \nwould provide a needed boost in funding and policy support for \nimportant safety initiatives, and offered an amendment to crack down on \nan important traffic safety issue, states that allow driving with an \nopen container of alcohol.\n  I applaud the World Health Organization, PAHO, AAA and all the \nindividuals and organizations that are working today and throughout the \nyear to draw attention to the growing problem of traffic crashes. We \nneed to sound the alarm--43,000 deaths in the U.S. and 1.2 million \nworldwide are too many.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I recognize World Health Day, which \nis celebrated every year on April 7 in order to bring awareness to a \nspecific health issue of global significance. This year, the World \nHealth Organization has selected ``Road Safety'' as the theme for World \nHealth Day.\n  Road safety is an imperative public health challenge that needs to be \naddressed. Every year, nearly 1.2 million people die in motor vehicle \ncrashes worldwide and an estimated 10 to 15 million people are injured. \nIn the United States, nearly 43,000 people die each year from motor \nvehicle crashes, making auto fatalities the number one\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\nkiller of those between the ages of 4 and 34. Despite these already \ntragic and staggering statistics, some experts predict that motor \nvehicle fatalities will double by the year 2020, thus becoming the \nthird greatest global health challenge, jumping from its current \nranking of ninth.\n  The goal of World Health Day 2004 is to raise public awareness of \ntraffic safety in hopes of reducing these motor vehicle fatalities and \ninjuries worldwide. Wearing a seat belt continues to be the most \neffective means of reducing the risk of death in a crash and the \nimplementation of a national primary seat belt law could save thousands \nof lives each year. Other important traffic and vehicle safety actions, \nsuch as greater consumer awareness of vehicle safety, stronger emphasis \nof safety with regard to vehicle design, stronger driver education \nprograms, and the identification and disclosure of dangerous roads and \nintersections would greatly improve road safety and save lives. We have \nmade some progress on these important issues here in the Senate, but we \nhave a long way to go.\n  I would like to thank the World Health Organization, AAA, the Pan-\nAmerican Health Organization, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, and other important organizations all over the world \nthat have worked tirelessly to confront this global epidemic of motor \nvehicle fatalities. Their work is saving lives.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since 1948, countries all over the world \nhave recognized April 7 as World Health Day as a way to raise awareness \nof a specific health issue that has global significance. In previous \nyears, World Health Day focused on issues such as the importance of \ncreating healthy environments for children, addressing emerging \ninfectious diseases, and reducing the stigma associated with mental \nhealth treatment. The theme for this year is road safety which is \nperhaps not something that is often thought of as a public health risk. \nHowever, each year motor vehicle crashes have a devastating and tragic \nimpact on millions of families all over the world.\n  In 2002, motor vehicle crashes killed nearly 1.2 million people \nworldwide and injured as many as 50 million more. If the current trend \ncontinues, the World Health Organization estimates that by the year \n2020, road traffic deaths and disabilities will become the third \nleading contributor to the global burden of disease and injury ahead of \nstrokes, tuberculosis and HIV.\n  The toll of these crashes is no less significant here in the United \nStates. Over 42,800 people were killed and nearly 3 million people were \ninjured on our own country's roads and highways in 2002. That's one \nperson--a parent, child, friend, or colleague--killed in a car crash \nevery 12 minutes of every single day. Beyond the overwhelming emotional \nimpact that these deaths and injuries wreak on our communities, they \nalso cost our economy over $230 billion a year.\n  Today as countries around the globe put a spotlight on the issue of \nroad safety, it is equally important to examine what we are doing here \nin our own country to prevent these crashes.\n  As the former chairman and now as the ranking member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to improve \ntransportation safety over the years and I would like to talk about \nsome of the ways we can save lives and prevent injuries.\n  To look at this in a very basic way, there are three categories of \nevents that can go wrong on the road and have deadly consequences. \nFirst, there can be hazardous road conditions such as poor weather, \nnarrow lanes or dangerous curves. Second, there can be a catastrophic \nfailure in the vehicle such as a blown tire or worn out brakes. And \nfinally, the driver's own behavior can mean the difference between life \nand death on the road, whether it is neglecting to wear a seat belt; \ndriving while intoxicated; speeding; or, falling asleep at the wheel.\n  The investments that we make in our roads, the standards that we set \nfor vehicles and the laws that we enact to change driver behavior all \ncan help reduce the number of fatalities on our Nation's roads and \nhighways.\n  Often when we talk about transportation funding, we focus on the \nhighway construction jobs that will be created and the congestion that \nwill be relieved. We also must mention how our transportation \ninvestments improve safety on our roads and highways. I would like to \ntake the occasion of World Health Day to highlight two areas, in \nparticular, where we hope our transportation investments will help \nchange driver behavior.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill that passed the Senate a few months \nago increased funding for the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration's drunk driving program by more than 40 percent. These \nfunds will help States develop and implement a tracking system for \nthose repeat offenders who drive drunk time and time again. They will \nalso help better educate the judges and prosecutors that handle drunk \ndriving cases so that sanctions will be applied in a consistent manner.\n  It is well known in the highway safety community that the best way to \ndeliver the message about the perils of drinking and driving is through \nhigh visibility enforcement programs. On the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with Senator Shelby to \ninclude funding for a national paid media campaign for NHTSA's ``You \nDrink and Drive. You Lose'' program. This media campaign, which \ncoincides with impaired driving safety mobilization efforts, delivers \nthe message to drivers that law enforcement is out in force conducting \nsobriety checkpoints and that if you are caught driving under the \ninfluence, there will be serious legal consequences.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill included $14 million for paid \nadvertising; $2.75 million to support State-impaired driving \nmobilization efforts; and $3 million to pilot new and innovative \nstrategies to combat impaired driving. This funding, in combination \nwith strong State laws, provides us with an opportunity to reverse the \nunfortunate upward trend in the number of alcohol-related fatalities.\n  Another contribution that the Omnibus appropriations bill made toward \ntransportation safety is in the area of seat belts. The most important \nthing you can do to protect yourself in the event of a car crash is to \nwear your seat belt. In fact, in 2002, the year for which we have the \nmost recent data, seat belts saved over 14,000 lives. The FY 2004 bill \nincluded $14 million for the ``Click It or Ticket'' program, which is a \nnational paid media campaign similar to the impaired driving effort I \njust mentioned, however, its focus is on getting families to buckle up.\n  This is the third year in a row that Congress has provided funding \nfor ``Click It or Ticket,'' and we are seeing some positive results. \nLast year, NHTSA estimated that seat belt use had risen to 79 percent \nnationally, its highest use rate ever. My State of Washington led the \ncountry with nearly 95 percent of our citizens wearing their seat \nbelts.\n  Our efforts to reduce drunk driving and increase seat belt use are \njust two examples of the steps we are taking to address the safety \nchallenges we face on our Nation's highways. As a member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to work to \nprovide funding for programs that tackle these issues and take the \nopportunity on occasions such as this to highlight the importance of \nsafety on our Nation's roads.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3916-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3916-S3917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAPT RONALD H.

The award is named for CAPT Michael J. Estocin, a fighter pilot \nin the Vietnam conflict who was posthumously awarded the Congressional \nMedal of Honor for remaining in the target area on a bombing mission \neven though his aircraft was badly damaged.\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\n  Captain Henderson has had over 3,800 flying hours and over 600 \ncarrier landings, and has earned the Defense Superior Service Medal, \nthe Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, \nthe Air Medal, three Navy Commendation Medals, and numerous unit and \ncampaign awards.\n  Captain Henderson has participated in Operation Desert Shield, \nOperation Southern Watch, Operation Allied Force, and most recently in \nOperation Enduring Freedom where he commanded the aircraft carrier \nnamed after my brother, the USS John F. Kennedy, CV-67.\n  Captain Henderson brought the ship and crew back home safely in \nAugust 2002 and was greeted by 10,000 supporters for a well-deserved \nhomecoming in Mayport, FL.\n  Captain Henderson will soon turn over his command of the carrier to \nassume his new responsibilities.

Mr. President, education is the fundamental base \nthat enables our youth to transition to adulthood. The basic principles \nstudents learn provide them with the necessary skills to become \nproductive and responsible citizens. In Idaho we view education as an \ninvestment not to be taken lightly. It is essential our students are \nwell prepared so that the journey through the halls of our schools will \nend at the doorway to success.\n  The preparation for this passage is intense. Not only must our \nstudents understand the basics of science, civics, and communication, \nbut they are expected to defend themselves in the face of peer pressure \nand poor choices. In order the achieve this, we look to those who serve \non the front lines of our education system. It is our teachers who will \nhelp students aspire to greatness. In Idaho, our teachers do more than \nexpected by expressing to our students the importance of giving back to \nour communities. They show our students an avenue through which to \nimprove themselves and the cities and towns from which they come. \nTeachers who encourage community service ought to be thanked.\n  I thank all the administrators, staff, and teachers in Idaho schools \nfor helping our students visualize their self-worth, thus enabling them \nto achieve greatness. In addition, today I would like to single out one \neducator in particular for his dedication and commitment to our local \ncommunity.\n  Wiley Dobbs has served in nearly every level of the education system \nover his tenure in southern Idaho. From time spent as a student at \nMorningside Elementary school, to his current position as \nsuperintendent of the Twin Falls School District, Wiley Dobbs has had a \npositive impact on the lives of others every step of the way. The \nstandard of excellence set by Wiley is one for which all Idaho \neducators should strive.\n  Wiley began his higher educational endeavor at the College of \nSouthern Idaho where he received an associates degree. He later went on \nto receive two bachelors degrees in social science and health and \nphysical education from Boise State University. Wiley began his career \nas a teacher in Montpelier, ID who he taught five subjects and coached \nthree sports. He then moved to Twin Falls and taught at both O'Leary \nJr. High School and Twin Falls High School. During his time in the high \nschool he taught courses in Government and English, coached wrestling, \nand worked toward receiving his master's degree in education from \nAlbertson College of Idaho.\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\n  After receiving his master's degree, Wiley made the transition from \neducator to administrator. Despite the shifting role, Wiley positive \nimpact on students only improved. As principal of the Magic Valley \nAlternative High School, he increased enrollment from 40 to over 125 \nstudents in only 2 years. Wiley also served as Principal of O'Leary \nJunior High School in Twin Falls. His outstanding work with both the \nstudents and faculty in he southern Idaho school district was \nrecognized not only by the local community, but by the state, as well. \nIn 1999, the Idaho Associates of Secondary School Administrators, \nMetLife, and the National Association of Secondary Principals named him \nIdaho's Secondary Principal of the Year. In 2001, Wiley was named the \nState Middle Level Educator of the Year.\n  Wiley's work is also recognized on the national level. His \ninvolvement on the Idaho Congressional Award Board has raised the \nnumber of Idaho recipients to one of the highest in the nation. \nStudents receive the honor by registering on the national level, and \nthen completing hundreds of hours of community service in four separate \ncategories: volunteer public service, personal development, physical \nfitness, and expedition exploration. Those students receiving the Gold \nMedal will have completed at least 700 hours of community service over \na 2-3 year period. Wiley has advised and helped approximately a third \nof Idaho's Gold Medal recipients since the beginning of his involvement \nin 1993 when he was named to the post by Congressman Mike Crapo.\n  Wiley Dobbs has been the driving force behind the Idaho Congressional \nAward Program. He has inspired, motivated, and encouraged hundreds of \nIdaho's youth to receive the national honor. His efforts have \nsolidified Idaho's presence in the national program, and it is his \ninvestment in Idaho's students that will benefit all our local \ncommunities. I hope all of us, especially those involved in our \neducation system, will look to the example set by Wiley Dobbs. His \nleadership and dedication to our children are an inspiration to us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3918-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHAD BENHAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

CHARLES CHATMAN\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Reverend and \nMrs. Charles Chatman, who are the founders of the Charles Chatman \nEvangelistic Association. Reverend Chatman accepted the call into \nministry at the age of 16 in 1958. He and Jean were married in 1960 and \nhave ministered together for the last 44 years. Reverend Chatman served \nas the senior pastor in churches throughout Missouri until he and Jean \nentered into full time evangelistic work in 1975.\n  Since that time, the Chatmans have traveled to many countries leading \nmission teams and crusades. They have ministered in Haiti, Dominican \nRepublic, Mexico, Trinidad and India.\n  In over 29 years of work in Haiti, the Chatmans' ministry has built \n30 churches, one medical clinic and a children's orphanage. Immanuel \nOrphanage, in the village of Bombardopolis, is home to 250 children. \nThe Chatmans have led over 3,000 people from across the United States \non mission trips overseas. The Chatmans are committed to bringing hope \nto all those they encounter. Reverend Chatman and his wife Jean are \ndedicated to the glorious service of their Lord and Savior.\n  Charles and Jean Chatman are proud parents of Darla, husband Brian, \nCindy, husband Dan, and Bryan. They have five wonderful grandchildren: \nJames, Ashley, Brandy, Jessica, and Wilna.\n  I commend Reverend Chatman and his wife Jean for their outstanding \nyears of service. Their message of hope is an inspiration and blessing \nto all of us. I am honored to share their successes with my colleagues, \nand I wish them the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3918-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n  S. 2290.

Bush has announced a Healthy \n     Marriage Initiative to highlight programs teaching marriage \n     skills and education, promote marriage mentoring and \n     enrichment programs, reduce disincentives to marriage, and \n     promote the value of marriage to our culture; and\n       Whereas, because the President launched the Health Marriage \n     Initiative, the Michigan House of Representatives and the \n     Michigan Senate appropriated $750,000 to fund a marriage \n     initiative in Michigan; and\n       Whereas, marriage is both a personal, private relationship \n     and a public commitment licensed by the state of Michigan; \n     and\n       Whereas, many of the expenditures by the state are closely \n     tied to people harmed by failed or never formed marriages, \n     and any long-term strategy for reducing dependency on state \n     social services and ensuring economic growth must include a \n     strategy for encouraging healthy marriages; and\n       Whereas, February 7-14, 2004, is being celebrated \n     throughout the nation as Marriage Week USA; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we hereby call on the \n     President of the United States, elected officials at every \n     level, and citizens of all walks of life to determine during \n     Marriage Week USA, and particularly on Valentine's Day, to \n     consider ways they can strengthen their own marriages and \n     support the marriages of others throughout the state of\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\n     Michigan and across the country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-386.

These \n     lawsuits seek monetary damages and other relief for the harm \n     caused by the misuse of firearms by third parties; including \n     criminals; and\n       Whereas, the manufacture, importation, possession, sale, \n     and use of firearms and ammunition in the United States are \n     heavily regulated by federal, state and local laws. Such \n     federal laws include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the \n     National Firearms Act, and the Arms Export Control Act; and\n       Whereas, businesses in the United States that are engaged \n     in interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n     manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to \n     the public of firearms or ammunition that has been shipped or \n     transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and \n     should not, be liable for the harm caused by those who \n     criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or \n     ammunition products that function as designed and intended; \n     and\n       Whereas, the possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n     industry for harm that is solely caused by others in an abuse \n     of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our nation's \n     laws, threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional \n     right and civil liberty, invites the disassembly and \n     destabilization of other industries and economic sectors \n     lawfully competing in the free enterprise system of the \n     United States, and constitutes a reasonable burden on \n     interstate and foreign commerce of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of S. 659, the Protection of Lawful \n     Commerce in Arms Act, is to prohibit causes of action against \n     manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers of \n     firearms or ammunition products for the harm caused by the \n     criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition \n     products by others when the product functioned as designed \n     and intended; and\n       Whereas, S. 659 will also preserve a citizen's access to a \n     supply of firearms and ammunition for all lawful purposes, \n     including hunting, self-defense, collecting, and competitive \n     or recreational shooting. It will also guarantee a citizen's \n     rights, privileges, and immunities, as applied to the states, \n     under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution, pursuant to section 5 of that Amendment. The \n     Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act will prevent the \n     use of such lawsuits to impose unreasonable burdens on \n     interstate and foreign commerce; and\n       Whereas, this legislation is intended to protect the right, \n     under the First Amendment to the Constitution, of \n     manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers of \n     firearms or ammunition products, and trade associations, to \n     speak freely, to assemble peaceably, and to petition the \n     government for a redress of their grievances; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact S. \n     659, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3919-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n   The following executive reports of committees were submitted:\n\n        By Mr. INHOFE for the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n        *Gary Lee Visscher, of Maryland, to be a Member of the \n     Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for a term of \n     five years.\n        *Stephen L.

A bill to create a fair and efficient system to resolve \nclaims of victims for bodily injury caused by asbestos exposure, and \nfor other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, a bill \nrelating to an issue I talked a lot on the floor about this morning and \nyesterday, and that is the issue of asbestos litigation reform.\n  This is an issue I have taken great pain to outline over the last \nseveral weeks because it is an issue that has been addressed in \ncommittee. It is an issue we looked at, debated, talked about, and \ndiscussed in a bipartisan way since that point in time. It is now time \nto take some action to continue the progress that has been made today.\n  It is on asbestos--an asbestos injury resolution act. Today, we \nintroduce a substitute bill to S. 1125, which is the Fairness in \nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act, which was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I thank my colleague, Chairman Hatch, for getting S. 1125 through the \nJudiciary Committee last July where, among many other successes, he led \na major bipartisan solution in committee on the linchpin criteria issue \nof the medical criteria. S. 1125, as reported out of committee, \nprovided a solid, reasonable solution to the asbestos litigation \ncrisis. It had numerous consensus-building changes all made at the \nrequest of people both on the committee, Democrats, and also \nrepresentatives of organized labor.\n  Since that time, there have been continued negotiations, and there \nhave been more agreements in improving the bill as reported.\n  Special thanks go to a whole number of people, including Senator \nSpecter and Judge Edward Becker who have both greatly improved and \naddressed the many issues on the administrative side of this bill.\n  I thank many Members. I thank the ranking minority member, Senator \nLeahy, and the efforts of my Democratic colleagues and many \nstakeholders who have contributed greatly to the underlying bill with \ndiscussions and negotiations since that point in time. All have been \nvery involved in improving the legislation.\n  I believe it is time--indeed, we are taking this action today--to \nfurther the effort of putting forward a constructive bill which \naddresses many of the concerns that people are talking about but now we \nwill have it as a bill.\n  To postpone this any longer, even though people keep coming forward \nand saying, I have another idea, I don't think will bring this to \nconclusion, and thus we introduce the bill today.\n  To push toward a solution, we are providing a substitute bill even \nthough we will not bring this bill to the floor until after the April \nrecess.\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\n  We, of course, welcome further discussions--myself, the chairman, and \nothers--with regard to how we might further improve the bill.\n  What has emerged from the collective efforts to date is a proposal \nthat retains the key elements of the original S. 1125 and includes some \nof the crucial modifications that address concerns raised since its \npassage in committee by stakeholders.\n  The goal is a bipartisan agreement. With the goal of a bipartisan \nagreement in mind, a couple of the additional improvements I should \nmention--improvements of the bill that is being introduced versus the \noriginal S. 1125.\n\n  First, we provide more compensation to the victims.\n  Second, we revise the funding provisions to help protect the solvency \nof the fund while ensuring that any risk of shortfall rests on \ndefendants and insurers and not the claimants.\n  Third, we incorporated a new administrative system agreed to by \nvarious stakeholders that is easier for claimants to use and can begin \nprocessing and paying claims more quickly.\n  I mention these three only to highlight a few of the significant \nchanges that we believe improve S. 1125 as reported--changes that were \nmade in good faith to address the concerns raised by Democrats and that \nare aimed at ensuring the program established under S. 1125 was the \nmost fair to the victims, the intended beneficiaries.\n  S. 1125 represents an important piece of legislation. We must not \nforget the provisions of banning asbestos proposed by Senator Murray, \nrevised and adopted by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The ban on asbestos is necessary to ensure that the dangers \nassociated with asbestos exposure can be eliminated.\n  We also have a duty to our veterans, many of whom were exposed to \nsubstantial amounts of asbestos while serving our Nation during World \nWar II and on ships, who have limited means of obtaining compensation \nfor asbestos-related illnesses.\n  The revised S. 1125--which will now be S. 2290--represents an easier \nand a faster avenue for the men and women of the armed services to \nreceive fair and just compensation while still keeping intact their \nveterans benefits.\n  Residents and workers of Libby, MT, also need this legislation to \nobtain full and adequate compensation. We must move forward on S. 2290.\n  There no doubt will be constructive proposals from Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to further refine and improve this bill. By \nintroducing this bill today, we encourage that process. It is my hope \nthe process will be useful and not result in any further delays or in \npostponing us addressing this true crisis today.\n  I believe a fair and a reasonable solution in a bill that can pass \nthis body is possible. I believe this is another major step forward to \naccomplish that goal.\n  In closing, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who has \nbeen instrumental from day 1 on this bill and who has worked closely \nwith both sides of the aisle in developing this product we introduce \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful for the distinguished \nmajority leader's remarks and for the tremendous work he has done in \nhelping to bring this bill to the floor at this time, without which I \ndon't think we would be this far. I have to say this is one of the most \nimportant bills in our country at this time. I am very grateful to him, \nand grateful to all of those who worked on this bill.\n  I rise today, along with the distinguished majority leader, to \nintroduce S. 2290, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act--the \nFAIR Act--of 2004. This is a substitute bill that Senators Frist, \nDeWine, Voinovich, Miller, Allen, Chambliss, Hagel, Domenici, and I \nhave spent a great deal of time developing. I particularly want to \ncommend Senator Specter and Judge Becker of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals for their efforts in bringing interested parties together to \ndiscuss the further development of this legislation. We are pleased to \ninclude many agreements from that mediation process in this bill.\n  Let me start by noting that the United States Supreme Court has sadly \nbut appropriately characterized the asbestos litigation system in our \ncountry as ``an elephantine mass.'' The Wall Street Journal aptly \ncalled it ``a job-eating asbestos blob.''\n  Without question, we face a crisis of epidemic proportions.\n  First, our asbestos system is inequitable. In our lottery-like \nsystem, juries award enormous damages to a special few, many of whom \nare not impaired at all and have never suffered a day of sickness. In \nother words, our system makes millionaires out of people who are not \nsick and who may never become sick. Meanwhile, people who are truly \nsick from asbestos receive little or nothing.\n  Let me illustrate this point. In a recent Mississippi case, six \nplaintiffs who were not sick--not one day of sickness--were awarded a \ntotal of $150 million. The plaintiffs did not claim to have ever missed \na day of work because of asbestos injury. They did not claim any \nmedical expenses related to asbestos, and they did not have asbestos-\nrelated physical impairment. Meanwhile, truly sick asbestos victims \nunder the Johns-Manville bankruptcy trust receive a mere 5 cents on the \ndollar. A jackpot justice system like the one we have is unfair, and it \nis unjust. That is happening all over because about 10 percent of the \nplaintiffs bar, the personal injury lawyers, I think to the irritation \nof the 90 percent, are forum shopping these bills in jurisdictions \nwhere they can get big verdicts for bad cases. Frankly, what is \nhappening today on asbestos compensation should not take place in this \ngreat country of America.\n  In addition to the gross inequities with respect to who gets \ncompensated, the system is so overwhelmed by claims that truly sick \npeople can wait years and die before even getting their day in court.\n  The fact is, our courts are simply unable to handle the volume of \nasbestos litigation. Unless Congress acts to end the delays and the \ndistortions caused by these voracious personal injury lawyers--as I \nsay, only about 10 percent, maybe less than that, of the personal \ninjury bar--our system will remain broken.\n  Another unacceptable feature of our current system is that most of \nthe money that should be going to compensate the truly injured, guess \nwhere it goes? It goes into the pockets of the lawyers. One actuarial \nfirm estimates personal injury lawyers bringing these cases will siphon \nmore than $60 billion out of asbestos litigation before it is over, and \nthat is a conservative estimate.\n  As unfair as the system is today, the future is even more grim. \nExcessive damage awards, along with the transaction costs associated \nwith the lawsuits, deplete the financial resources of the defendant \ncompanies and send more and more of them into bankruptcy. Many of these \nbusinesses are union businesses. These union workers lose their jobs \nbecause we have not resolved this problem. As legal and financial \nresources are exhausted by those who are not sick, those who truly are \nafflicted with asbestos-caused diseases are less and less likely to be \ncompensated.\n  According to the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, a very prestigious \ninstitute, ``about two thirds of the claims are now filed by the \nunimpaired, while in the past they were filed only by the manifestly \nill.''\n  Our asbestos system does not only burden unfairness on the truly \nsick; it is also devastating to our economy. According to Rand, the \nnumber of claims continues to rise, with over 600,000 claims already \nfiled. Typically, claimants filed against dozens of defendants; more \nthan 8,500 companies have been named as defendants in asbestos \nlitigation. With only a handful of the original asbestos manufacturing \ncompanies, the ones that are really liable, remaining today, new \nindustries are being targeted for lawsuits.\n  For instance, it has been reported that the big three automakers \n``are defending approximately 15,000 cases based on claims alleging \ninjury due to exposure to asbestos in brakes and clutches.''\n  Even nonmanufacturers, businesses that just supply asbestos, are now \nfacing claims. These include plumbing, heating, and automotive supply \nstores. As funds from asbestos companies continue to dry up, we can \nexpect the enterprising personal injury bar to continue to target \ncompanies that have\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\ntangential relations to the claims and little or no real culpability.\n  One company is one of the large insurance companies that has never \ninsured for asbestos, never had anything to do with asbestos. Basically \nit has never had a claim for asbestos up until recently, but they have \nbeen dragged into 60,000 cases because they were one of the early \nmedical teams that came to the conclusion that mesothelioma comes from \nasbestos exposure. They did medical evaluations that concluded and \nhelped to make the cases for those who truly are suffering, people who \nnow are getting five cents on a dollar. They have been dragged into \n60,000 cases that they should not have been dragged into. They will win \nevery one of those cases, no question about it. That last case they \ntried--and they did win it, by the way--cost $2 million just in defense \nfees alone. Times that by 60,000 and you get an idea of the nightmare \nthat insurance company is going through all because of voracious--I \nthink in some cases, dishonest, small percentage of the personal injury \nbar--personal injury lawyers who are bringing these cases.\n  Now, as funds from the asbestos companies continue to dry up, we can \nexpect the enterprising personal injury bar to continue to target \ncompanies that have tangential relations to the claims but little or no \nreal culpability or liability. Rest assured, without congressional \naction, the problem will not go away. Last year, a record 100,000 \nasbestos claims were filed. At least 70 companies have already gone \ninto bankruptcy due to asbestos liability. By the way, many of those \ncompanies were union companies. Many union members lost their jobs.\n\n  Does anyone wonder why manufacturing may be going down in America? \nBlame those who are always on the side of the personal injury lawyers, \njust to mention one corruption of the law.\n  Of course, each bankruptcy does bring with it lost jobs, lost \npensions, and weaker financial markets. The nonpartisan American \nAcademy of Actuaries reports ``bankruptcies in corporate asbestos \ndefendants have affected 47 states resulting in the loss of 52,000 to \n60,000 jobs. With each displaced worker losing 25,000 to 50,000 in wage \nand 25 percent of their 401(k).'' In other words, their pensions.\n  Rand estimates this litigation will eventually result in a staggering \n430,000 lost jobs. Where are our colleagues on the other side when it \ncomes to jobs? Here is a way of saving 430,000 manufacturing jobs and \nmost of them will vote against this bill. Why? I will get into that in \na few minutes.\n  The Supreme Court repeatedly called upon Congress to take action, but \nyears have slipped by and we have not resolved the problem. Unless we \nact now, three things are certain. One, there won't be enough money to \ncompensate people who are truly sick from asbestos exposure; two, \nhundreds of thousands of working Americans are going to lose their jobs \nand their pensions as these businesses go bankrupt; and three, personal \ninjury lawyers will continue to get richer and richer.\n  I am not against them getting rich when they bring honest cases. I am \nnot against them doing well when they earn the money. But this is like \nrolling off the log the way the current tort system is so broken and \nout of whack.\n  We need a comprehensive solution that is fair and we need it now. \nThat is why we are introducing the Fairness Asbestos Injury Resolution \nAct of 2004, called the FAIR Act, the Hatch-Frist-Miller Act. I am \npleased we have been able to make changes in this bill from the bill we \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee. This bill will address the \nconcerns that have been raised. This legislation offers a fair and \nefficient solution. The bill provides a clear net monetary gain for \nlegitimate victims with faster and more certain compensation. In \naddition, the legislation is important to our economy by providing \ncertainty to American businesses, retirement savings, and it will \npreserve jobs, as well.\n  The Americans injured by asbestos have waited long enough for a fair \nsystem of fair compensation. Many of them would not have to wait any \nlonger once this bill passes.\n  Nor can American workers afford to wait around while they lose their \njobs and their pensions and while they die from mesothelioma and other \nasbestos-related diseases. The only people who can afford to wait are \nthose who profit from the sick and from the hard-working Americans.\n  S. 1125, the Fairness and Asbestos Injury Act, the FAIR Act, as \nreported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, represented an \nunprecedented advance on a workable solution to the complex and \ndifficult issues that have stalled previous attempts at similar \nlegislation. Landmark agreements were reached on asbestos injury \ncompensation cases such as medical criteria, and over 50 consensus-\nbuilding changes were adopted overall. Nonetheless, a number of issues \nwere left open for further discussion and additional concerns were \nraised that were not satisfactorily addressed by the committee. We did \nour best but we needed to make some of these changes, so we have.\n  Since the bill was recorded out of committee, various State courts \nand members of both parties have continued working.\n  The Hatch-Frist-Miller substitute bill being introduced reflects \nagreements on some of these difficult issues reached during these \nnegotiations and attempts to address a number of concerns that have \nbeen raised but have not yet been subject to widespread agreement. In \nparticular, the Hatch-Frist-Miller bill raises claims values. It \nstreamlines the administrative system to be up and running quickly. It \nincreases liquidity and upfront funding for faster compensation of \nclaims, and if a fund runs out of money, that risk will be on the \ndefendants and the insurers, not on the claimants.\n  These are some of the highlights of the numerous changes made to make \na fairer system for claimants. I fully expect that passing this \nlegislation is going to be an uphill battle due to the strong grip of \nthe powerful personal injury bar. Personal injury lawyers, by the way, \nhave already been well compensated with respect to asbestos litigation \nhaving already taken an estimated $20 billion for themselves so far in \nlegal fees.\n  I have faith in the fairness and common sense of Americans. I believe \nthey can see through the self-interest of personal injury lawyers who \nwant to maintain a system that unduly benefits them. Americans will \nunderstand that without reform true victims of asbestos exposure, as \nwell as businesses, employees and pensioners will pay the price.\n  I look forward to debating and further refining this important bill \nwhen we return from the April recess. This bill, as most bills, is not \nperfect. No piece of legislation is without some imperfection in the \neyes of someone or some special interest. But if there is ever a case \nfor not letting the perfect become the enemy of the good--and the very \ngood, at that--it is this asbestos bill.\n  I am aware some will argue strongly this bill is too big, it is too \ncostly. I am also aware some will argue this bill is too small and does \nnot go far enough. But the truth is, if either of these perspectives \nfail, we will be left with the undesirable status quo. Unless we adopt \nsomething very close to what we are proposing, the victims of asbestos \nand those being asked to provide a fair level of compensation will \ncontinue to suffer--probably without anybody benefiting except the \npersonal injury bar, and then a very small percentage of them.\n  When we take up this bill in the next few weeks, let us strive to \nachieve a proper balance between the interests of those afflicted and \nthose individuals and firms who are called upon to provide the \ncompensation for this important program.\n  Some say--I think somewhat cynically--many of our colleagues on the \nother side are not going to vote for this bill because no amount of \nmoney is going to make them satisfied because two of their major \nconstituencies are against the bill, and have been, so far, against any \nbill. Some have said they are afraid the personal injury bar will not \nput up at least $50 million for John Kerry in this election if they \nvote for this bill. Others are saying without that money, they might \nnot be able to elect John Kerry President. I think that is a pretty \ncynical approach, of course. But if it is true, or there is any truth \nto it, then it is pretty pathetic that they would let these hundreds of \nthousands of people go down the drain without just compensation, which \nwe have in this bill, because of politics.\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n  By the way, the other reason is because the AFL-CIO has not signed \nonto this bill. That is not quite true. There are a few unions that are \nfor this bill. They know it is important. They know they are going to \nlose jobs, they are going to lose pensions, they are going to lose \nopportunities if these companies keep going bankrupt. About 70,000 \njobs, it is estimated now, have been lost.\n  These are two very large constituencies of the Democratic Party. I \ncannot blame Democrats for at least considering that they are concerned \nabout this bill. But I think the union leaders know this is an \nimportant bill, and they know it is a good bill. Frankly, they do not \nwant to have to make that decision during an election year.\n  Well, I do not care whether it is an election year or nonelection \nyear; we cannot wait any longer. If we do not pass this bill and do the \nbest we can do for these workers and for these companies, and for all \nconcerned, in the way we have, these companies are going to have to \ncome up with this whopping amount of money in this bill. They are the \nones who are going to have to do it.\n  I saw yesterday in the Wall Street Journal they thought the \nGovernment was going to have to come up with lots of money. Well, some \nactually make a pretty good argument the Government should. We have \nmade it very clear the Government is not going to. This is not going to \nbe part of our deficit burden we have in this country. Let some make \ntheir effective arguments the Government knew asbestos was harmful, yet \nimposed it by regulation in our ships and in so many other ways. Be \nthat as it may, we are not imposing this on Government. These companies \nare going to have to come up with this money. It has been a monumental \neffort by those of us who have fought this through to bring together \nenough money to be able--according to those who analyze the economics \nof this, those who are honest and decent in analyzing it--to pay the \nclaims we have under the medical criteria in this bill. And the medical \ncriteria happen to be fair as well.\n  Let me close. First of all, I hope that is not the reason why our \ncolleagues vote against this bill. Unfortunately, I believe that \nprobably is the reason--those two reasons. There may be others as well, \nbut they are not justified after all the hard work that has been done \nby both Democrats and Republicans in bringing the bill this far.\n  Let me close by thanking the majority leader, Senator Frist, for the \nwork he has done, and especially thank Senator Specter for his \nHerculean efforts in bringing the bill to its present form, and Judge \nBecker, for whom I have the utmost of respect and affection. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this fair solution to a broken system that has \nlanguished far too long.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2291. A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 14-24 Abbott Road in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, \nas the ``Mary Ann Collura Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am honored to introduce a bill on \nbehalf of Senator Frank Lautenberg and myself to authorize the renaming \nof the main post office in Fair Lawn, NJ as the Mary Ann Collura Post \nOffice.\n  Mary Ann Collura was the first female police officer in Fair Lawn, \nwhere she served the people in her community as an outstanding officer \nand role model for eighteen years. On April 17, 2003, Officer Collura \nwas fatally shot while attempting to arrest three men after a car \nchase. She was the first Fair Lawn police officer ever killed in the \nline of duty.\n  The idea for naming the Fair Lawn post office in honor of Officer \nCollura came from a Fair Lawn high school student, which is indicative \nof the admiration the people of Fair Lawn have for her. She was known \nfor her courage, kindness, and genuine caring for others. Officer \nCollura was also a pioneer in Fair Lawn. She started a program to \nprotect trick-or-treaters on Halloween by giving them glow sticks, \nwhich has expanded and is now a countywide program.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I are proud to be joining Representative \nSteven Rothman and the entire New Jersey congressional delegation in \nthe effort to rename the Fair Lawn post office in honor of Mary Ann \nCollura. By naming the main post office in town after such a brave \nwoman, we pay her the respect she earned, and memorialize her in a way \nbefitting a person of her stature. She is a true hero and will be \nmissed.\n  I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REDESIGNATION.\n\n       The facility of the United States Postal Service located at \n     14-24 Abbott Road in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, and known as the \n     Fair Lawn Main Post Office, shall be known and designated as \n     the ``Mary Ann Collura Post Office Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the facility referred \n     to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Mary Ann Collura Post Office Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 2292. A bill to require a report on acts of anti-Semitism around \nthe world; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, during the last several years, I have \nbeen deeply concerned with the rise of antisemitism in countries \nthroughout the world, including countries that have traditionally been \namong the world's strongest democracies.\n  Today, as Jewish people across the world celebrate Passover, a \nfestival of freedom and redemption, I rise to again call attention to \ngrowing antisemitism and to urge a renewed effort to combat this \nserious problem, both at home and abroad.\n  Although some of my colleagues might not be aware, I have had the \nopportunity to visit the State of Israel seven times, as mayor of \nCleveland, Governor of Ohio, and as a Member of the Senate. I will \nalways remember visiting Yad Vashem on my first visit in 1980, and \nagain on several other visits, and the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv in \n1982. That experience truly brought home to me the horrors of the \nHolocaust and the role antisemitism played in leading to the Holocaust.\n  I vowed I would do everything in my power to make sure it would not \nhappen again. Frankly, I never thought during my lifetime I would have \nto try to keep that vow. Unfortunately, antisemitism's deadly, ugly \nhead is rising again. Working with other groups, I am determined to do \neverything I can do to stop it. There must be zero tolerance of \nantisemitism.\n  In May of 2002, following a disturbing number of antisemitic \nincidents in Europe, I joined members of the Helsinki Commission in a \nhearing to examine the rise of antisemitic violence in Europe. I was \nshocked by the reports I heard. Now, nearly 2 years later, the news is \nnot much better. The first 3 months of 2004 have seen numerous acts of \nantisemitism abroad.\n  For example, in Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish synagogue \nand community center were set on fire. In St. Petersburg, Russia, on \nFebruary 15, 2004, vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones in a \nJewish cemetery, painting them with swastikas and antisemitic graffiti.\n  Antisemitic incidents are not unique to Europe. In Australia, on \nJanuary 5 of this year, antisemitic slogans and symbols were burned \ninto the lawns of Tasmania's Parliament House.\n  In Toronto, Canada, over the weekend of March 19, 2004, vandals \nattacked a Jewish school, cemetery, and area synagogues, painting \nswastikas and antisemitic slogans on the walls of the synagogue and on \nresidential property in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood nearby.\n  This alarming trend has not gone unnoticed. The high number of \nantisemitic incidents in Europe and other parts of the world has caused \nthe United States, working with our allies and international \norganizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, to take action.\n  Efforts to highlight growing antisemitism began in earnest following \nthe Helsinki Commission hearing in May 2002, to which I have just \nreferred. During that hearing, I called on the\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\nOSCE to conduct a separate session on antisemitism during the annual \nmeeting of the OSCE parliamentary assembly in Berlin in July 2002. I \nwas pleased this did in fact take place. Delegates to this meeting also \nunanimously passed a resolution calling attention to the dangers of \nantisemitism, which I cosponsored. I was honored to be in Berlin for \nthe meeting, joining Representative Chris Smith, who serves as chairman \nof the Helsinki Commission and continues to be a great leader on this \nissue. We are very fortunate to have Chris Smith heading the Helsinki \nCommission in the House of Representatives. He is doing a wonderful \njob. Work continued upon our return with letters to the President and \nSecretary of State, underscoring the importance of a strong U.S. \ncommitment to the fight against global antisemitism.\n  Last June, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani led the U.S. \ndelegation to the first conference of the OSCE dedicated solely to the \nissue of antisemitism.\n  The conference took place in Vienna, bringing together \nparliamentarians, officials, and private citizens from all 55 OSCE \nparticipating states. This conference was the product of much hard work \nand would not have been a reality without the strong support of \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, Under Secretary of State for Political \nAffairs Mark Grossman, and our Ambassador to the OSCE, Stephan Minikes. \nStephan Minikes, by the way, I think is the most outstanding ambassador \nthe United States has sent to the OSCE in a very long time.\n  The Vienna conference was a step in the right direction. I believe \nMayor Giuliani best captured the significance of the event when he \nremarked:\n\n       The conference represents a critical first step for \n     Europeans who have too frequently dismissed anti-Semitic \n     violence as routine assaults and vandalism. Antisemitism is \n     anything but routine. When people attack Jews, vandalize \n     their graves, characterize them in inhumane ways, and make \n     salacious statements in parliaments or to the press, they are \n     attacking the defining values of our societies and our \n     international institutions.\n\n  While the Vienna conference provided a solid foundation, followup to \nthe meeting is absolutely essential. As such, the OSCE will convene a \nsecond conference on antisemitism in Berlin later this month. I believe \nthis meeting is urgently needed, and I am pleased Secretary Powell has \nasked me to serve as a member of the U.S. delegation to this critical \ngathering.\n  Again, this meeting in Vienna would not have happened without the \nstrong support of our Secretary of State and his team at the State \nDepartment.\n  In Berlin, our goal is to ensure we move beyond rhetoric and move \nforward to institutionalize the fight against antisemitism in the OSCE. \nWe hope to put in place an action plan to formalize a process to \nidentify, monitor, and measure efforts to combat antisemitism in each \nof the 55 OSCE participating states, including the United States.\n  Too often, as the Presiding Officer knows, there is a lot of talk at \nthese meetings but no action. If we are to be successful in our effort, \nwe must establish a commitment to action--action that can be monitored. \nThis is the message I have continued to stress.\n  Last July, I wrote to those individuals who joined Mayor Giuliani as \nmembers of the U.S. delegation to the Vienna conference, including \nAbraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, Mike Levin of the \nNational Conference on Soviet Jewry, David Harris of the American \nJewish Committee, and Dave Mariaschin of B'nai B'rith, asking them for \nrecommendations for action, things that can be done to encourage \ntangible steps rather than just dialog. They came back to me with \nrecommendations for the Berlin conference which I then sent to \nSecretary of State Colin Powell.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Secretary \nPowell, including the proposed agenda for the Berlin conference, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2004.\n     Hon. Colin L. Powell,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Powell: I would like to take this \n     opportunity to thank you for your continued leadership on \n     efforts to combat anti-Semitism abroad. The United States has \n     played an important role in highlighting the need to take \n     action on this issue, both through our bilateral \n     relationships and interaction with international \n     organizations such as the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\n       Significant progress has been made during the last year on \n     efforts to raise awareness of the rise in anti-Semitic \n     violence in Europe and other parts of the world. The Vienna \n     Conference on Anti-Semitism convened by the OSCE last June \n     was an important step in the right direction; however, I \n     believe that the follow-up to this meeting is critical. As \n     such, I was pleased that you, and others, expressed support \n     for a second meeting on anti-Semitism during the OSCE \n     Ministerial in Maastricht.\n       As the United States prepares for this follow-up meeting, \n     scheduled to take place in Berlin this April, I believe that \n     we should work together to establish clear objectives and \n     outline a solid agenda. It is in this spirit that I would \n     like to share with you the attached recommendations for \n     action items that have been outlined by a number of \n     nongovernmental organizations with a long-standing interest \n     in the issue of anti-Semitism. I hope that you find them \n     useful as planning for the Berlin conference continues.\n       Again, thank you for ongoing work to raise awareness of \n     this serious problem. I look forward to working with you in \n     the months leading to this important event.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George V. Voinovich,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 21, 2004.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: On behalf of our organizations, we \n     commend you for your leadership in the domestic and global \n     fight against anti-Semitism, particularly your role in \n     gaining the attention and commitment of European governments. \n     We are writing to respond to your request for actionable \n     steps the United States can take to facilitate concrete \n     responses to anti-Semitism in the OSCE region.\n       In anticipation of the upcoming April 2004 OSCE anti-\n     Semitism conference in Berlin, we have compiled the following \n     points for your consideration. We also take this opportunity \n     to reiterate the important role that you and other Senators \n     are playing in this process, and the indispensable diplomatic \n     campaign by the U.S. Government.\n\n\n                         Berlin OSCE Conference\n\n       1. Program should include plenary speeches and workshops in \n     the areas of:\n       Governmental/Parliamentary action;\n       Law Enforcement: monitoring, hate crimes response, anti-\n     bias education;\n       Education: Making anti-bias education a component of \n     education from an early age;\n       The role of the media in setting a tone for tolerance in \n     the public debate.\n       Following the opening plenary, multiple concurrent \n     workshops would enable the program to cover more ground and \n     make the two days as productive as possible for delegation \n     members from law enforcement, educational and other areas.\n       2. Governments should be encouraged to:\n       Reflect the seriousness and sense of urgency with which the \n     OSCE views the problem by appointing high-level government \n     delegations;\n       Appoint delegations which also include officials from \n     agencies outside the foreign ministry who are poised to play \n     a role in implementing relevant programs against anti-\n     Semitism (e.g., interior, education, justice, police, \n     parliament), which should also be a consideration in \n     assembling the U.S. delegation;\n       Include non-governmental leaders in their national \n     delegations, reflecting interdenominational, human rights and \n     Jewish community perspectives;\n       Utilize the conference as a forum to bring to light best \n     practices from their country where relevant, including \n     governmental as well as community examples;\n       Report on progress toward implementing Holocaust-related \n     and other tolerance education, with reference to the Task \n     Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, \n     Remembrance, and Research;\n       Publicly repudiate incitement and other efforts to turn \n     political grievances into appeals to ethnic hatred, anti-\n     Semitism and the denial of Holocaust history;\n       Counter Middle Eastern sources of anti-Semitic and other \n     hate material.\n       3. Preparation and Follow-Up:\n       In Berlin, announce the establishment of ministerial \n     working groups or task forces in the areas such as education, \n     monitoring, and law enforcement. These tracks would work \n     together to monitor implementation of recommendations and \n     convene follow-up meetings of experts to assess progress on \n     implementation and exchange strategies. The United States, \n     Germany and the Bulgarian OSCE Chairmanship should \n     communicate now with counterparts to interest key players and \n     recruit ministers in advance who would be willing in Berlin \n     to announce their involvement and assume specific \n     responsibilities (e.g., German Interior Minister Otto Schily, \n     French Minister of Interior Nicolas Sarkozy and Education \n     Minister Luc Ferry).\n       Craft an agenda for the working groups, and establish \n     ongoing interface with the OSCE Office for Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), including the annual \n     OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting (HDIM) in Warsaw.\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\n       4. A joint declaration and program of action against anti-\n     Semitism should be developed in advance consultations and \n     unveiled in Berlin by the consenting governments.\n\n\n                    osce monitoring of anti-semitism\n\n       ODIHR should craft a data collection model. A visit to the \n     United States and other relevant OSCE countries by Ambassador \n     Strohal and his team would enable vital consultations with \n     hate-crime monitoring experts in and out of government.\n       In addition to collecting and analyzing data, ODIHR needs \n     to implement its new mandate by working with OSCE member \n     states to promote in-country programs and legislation. ODIHR \n     should also begin evaluating and developing recommended \n     standards for reporting and classifying of incidents.\n       OSCE law-enforcement programs should include an anti-bias \n     unit where possible.\n       A session in the October HDIM should be devoted to a status \n     report on this and related initiatives.\n       As you know, Senator, our organizations are in close \n     coordination with the United States Government, with each \n     other and with other governments and interested parties to \n     maximize the possibilities for Berlin and beyond. We \n     appreciate your initiative in soliciting our input on this \n     timely and vital matter, and look forward to continuing our \n     work with you and your Senate colleagues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mark B. Levin,\n       Executive Director, NCSJ: Advocates on behalf of Jews in \n     Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States & Eurasia\n     Daniel S. Mariaschin,\n       Executive Vice President, B'nai B'rith International\n     Malcolm Hoenlein,\n       Executive Vice Chairman, Conference of Presidents of Major \n     American Jewish Organizations\n     Abraham H. Foxman,\n       National Director, Anti-Defamation League\n     Hannah Rosenthal,\n       Executive Director, Jewish Council for Public Affairs\n     David A. Harris,\n       Executive Director, American Jewish Committee.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I am pleased the State Department has \ntaken these suggestions into consideration in working to prepare the \nagenda for the Berlin conference. There has been a great deal of effort \nto ensure this conference meets my expectations and others', and it is \nmy sincere hope this meeting will help move toward the goal of zero \ntolerance for antisemitism in the world today. While I believe we must \ndo all we can to encourage our allies and partners abroad, as well as \nour international organizations, such as the OSCE, the United Nations, \nand the EU to combat antisemitism, it is important we redouble our \nefforts at home to call attention to this problem.\n  Tomorrow the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will conduct a \nhearing to examine antisemitism in Europe. This continues discussion on \nthe issue following a hearing that took place last October. While this \nis significant, we can and we ought to do more.\n  Today I introduce legislation calling attention to the growing \nproblem of antisemitism abroad. This bill, called the Global \nAntisemitism Review Act of 2004, urges the United States to continue to \nstrongly support efforts to highlight antisemitism through bilateral \nrelationships and interaction with international organizations, such as \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n  Further, the legislation requires the Secretary of State to submit to \nCongress an annual report on acts of antisemitism worldwide. The report \nwill include a description of the following for each foreign country; \nin other words, we are going to have a report on each one of the 55 \nmembers of the OSCE.\n  First, a description of physical violence against or harassment of \nJewish people or community institutions, such as schools, synagogues, \nor cemeteries, that occurred in that country; second, the response of \nthe government of that country to such attacks; third, actions by the \ngovernment of that country to enact and enforce laws relating to the \nprotection of the rights to religious freedom with respect to Jewish \npeople; and finally, the efforts made by that government to promote \nantibias and tolerance education.\n  The last point I think is so important. If we are truly to be \nsuccessful, it is imperative we work to promote tolerance and bring \nabout a change in the hearts and minds of those people responsible for \nacts of antisemitism and other hate crimes. We can do something about \ntheir mouths, their hands, and their feet, but the real challenge for \nus is to change their minds and their hearts.\n  Last year, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed \nresolutions calling on the State Department to thoroughly document acts \nof antisemitism worldwide. This bill would take it one step further. I \nbelieve it is essential, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting swift passage of this legislation which will underscore the \nhigh priority Congress and the U.S. Government have given to zero \ntolerance of global antisemitism.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Anti-Semitism Review \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Acts of anti-Semitism in countries throughout the \n     world, including some of the world's strongest democracies, \n     have increased significantly in frequency and scope over the \n     last several years.\n       (2) During the first 3 months of 2004, there were numerous \n     instances of anti-Semitic violence around the world, \n     including the following incidents:\n       (A) In Australia on January 5, 2004, poison was used to \n     ignite, and burn anti-Semitic slogans into, the lawns of the \n     Parliament House in the state of Tasmania.\n       (B) In St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 15, 2004, \n     vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones in a Jewish \n     cemetery, painting the stones with swastikas and anti-Semitic \n     graffiti.\n       (C) In Toronto, Canada, over the weekend of March 19 \n     through March 21, 2004, vandals attacked a Jewish school, a \n     Jewish cemetery, and area synagogues, painting swastikas and \n     anti-Semitic slogans on the walls of a synagogue and on \n     residential property in a nearby, predominantly Jewish, \n     neighborhood.\n       (D) In Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish \n     synagogue and community center were set on fire.\n       (3) Anti-Semitism in old and new forms is also increasingly \n     emanating from the Arab and Muslim world on a sustained \n     basis, including through books published by government-owned \n     publishing houses in Egypt and other Arab countries.\n       (4) In November 2002, state-run television in Egypt \n     broadcast the anti-Semitic series entitled ``Horseman Without \n     a Horse,'' which is based upon the fictitious conspiracy \n     theory know as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The \n     Protocols have been used throughout the last century by \n     despots such as Adolf Hitler to justify violence against \n     Jews.\n       (5) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-\n     Semitic series, entitled ``Ash-Shatat'' (or ``The \n     Diaspora''), which depicts Jewish people hatching a plot for \n     Jewish control of the world.\n       (6) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused \n     international organizations such as the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate, and \n     bring renewed focus to, the issue, including the convening by \n     the OSCE in June 2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated \n     solely to the issue of anti-Semitism.\n       (7) The OSCE will again convene a conference dedicated to \n     addressing the problem of anti-Semitism on April 28-29, 2004, \n     in Berlin, with the United States delegation to be led by \n     former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch.\n       (8) The United States Government has strongly supported \n     efforts to address anti-Semitism through bilateral \n     relationships and interaction with international \n     organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union, and the \n     United Nations.\n       (9) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address \n     the rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, \n     both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed \n     resolutions expressing strong concern with the sharp \n     escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe and calling on \n     the Department of State to thoroughly document the \n     phenomenon.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n        It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Government should continue to \n     strongly support efforts to combat anti-Semitism worldwide \n     through bilateral relationships and interaction with \n     international organizations such as the OSCE; and\n       (2) the Department of State should thoroughly document acts \n     of anti-Semitism that occur around the world.\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     and the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives a report on acts of anti-Semitism around the \n     world, including a description of--\n       (1) acts of physical violence against, or harassment of, \n     Jewish people, and acts of violence against, or vandalism of, \n     Jewish community institutions, such as schools, synagogues, \n     or cemeteries, that occurred in each country;\n       (2) the responses of the governments of those countries to \n     such actions;\n       (3) the actions taken by such governments to enact and \n     enforce laws relating to the protection of the right to \n     religious freedom of Jewish people; and\n       (4) the efforts by such governments to promote anti-bias \n     and tolerance education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2294. A bill to authorize the conveyance of certain Federal land \nin the State of New Mexico; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce an \nuncontroversial piece of legislation that I hope will receive prompt \ncommittee action and will make its way quickly to the President's desk \nfor his signature.\n  I would first like to familiarize the Senate with the important \nmission and related work of the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park in Las \nCruces, NM. The Chihuahuan Desert is the largest desert in North \nAmerica and contains a great diversity of unique plant and animal \nspecies. The ecosystem makes up an indispensable part of southwest's \ntreasured ecological diversity. As such, it is important that we teach \nour young ones an appreciation for New Mexico's biological diversity \nand impart upon them the value of this ecological treasure.\n  The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park is a non-profit institution that \nhas spent the past six years providing hands-on science education to K-\n12th graders. To achieve this mission, the Nature Park provides \nclassroom presentation, field trips, schoolyard ecology projects and \nteacher work shops. The Nature Park serves more than 11,000 students \nand 600 teachers annually. This instruction will enable our future \nleaders to make informed decisions about how best to manage these \nvaluable resources. I commend those at the Nature Park for taking the \ninitiative to create and administer a wonderfully successful program \nthat has been so beneficial to the surrounding community.\n  The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park was granted a 1,000 acre easement \nin 1998 at the southern boundary of USDA-Agriculture Research Service \n(USDA-ARS) property just north of Las Cruces, NM. This easement will \nexpire soon. It is important that we provide them a permanent location \nso that they are able to continue their valuable mission.\n  The bill I introduce today would transfer an insignificant amount of \nland: 1,000 of 193,000 USDA acres to the Desert Nature Park so that \nthey may continue their important work. The USDA-ARS has approved the \nland transfer, noting the critically important mission of the Desert \nPark. I have no doubt that senators on both sides of the aisle will \nrecognize the importance of this land transfer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Jornada Experimental Range \n     Transfer Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Chihuahuan Desert \n     Nature Park Board.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF LAND TO CHIHUAHUAN DESERT NATURE PARK \n                   BOARD.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--The Secretary may convey to the Board, by \n     quitclaim deed, for no consideration, all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the land described in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (a) consists of not more than 1000 acres of land \n     selected by the Secretary--\n       (1) that is located in the Jornada Experimental Range in \n     the State of New Mexico; and\n       (2) that is subject to an easement granted by the \n     Agricultural Research Service to the Board.\n       (c) Conditions.--The conveyance of land under subsection \n     (a) shall be subject to--\n       (1) the condition that the Board pay--\n       (A) the cost of any surveys of the land; and\n       (B) any other costs relating to the conveyance;\n       (2) any rights-of-way to the land reserved by the \n     Secretary;\n       (3) a covenant or restriction in the deed to the land \n     described in subsection (b) requiring that--\n       (A) the land may be used only for educational purposes;\n       (B) if the land is no longer used for the purposes \n     described in subparagraph (A), the land shall, at the \n     discretion of the Secretary, revert to the United States; and\n       (C) if the land is determined by the Secretary to be \n     environmentally contaminated under subsection (d)(2)(A), the \n     Board shall remediate the contamination; and\n       (4) any other terms and conditions that the Secretary \n     determines to be appropriate.\n       (d) Reversion.--If the land conveyed under subsection (a) \n     is no longer used for the purposes described in subsection \n     (c)(3)(A)--\n       (1) the land shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, \n     revert to the United States; and\n       (2) if the Secretary chooses to have the land revert to the \n     United States, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) determine whether the land is environmentally \n     contaminated, including contamination from hazardous wastes, \n     hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, petroleum, or \n     petroleum by-products; and\n       (B) if the Secretary determines that the land is \n     environmentally contaminated, the Board or any other person \n     responsible for the contamination shall remediate the \n     contamination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs.Boxer):\n  S. 2295. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Homeland Security \nDepartment's Directorate of Science and Technology, establish a program \nfor the use of advanced technology to meet homeland security needs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by a \nnumber of my colleagues representing southern and northern border \nStates, including Senators Kyl, Dorgan, Schumer, Clinton, and Boxer in \nintroducing the Border Security and Technology Integration Act of 2004. \nThis bill was developed together with my fellow Arizonan, Congressman \nKolbe, who has introduced the House companion to this bill. It is \ndesigned to identify and address gaps in border infrastructure and \nenforcement and promote our Nation's security efforts.\n  As estimated one million people enter this country illegally every \nyear. Last year, more than 300 people died illegally crossing the \nborder separating the United States and Mexico--and over 200 of those \ndeaths occurred in the Arizona desert. Although the vast majority of \nthese individuals do not intend to harm our Nation, we must recognize \nour vulnerability to security threats and take action to address \nidentified safety and security lapses. Improving enforcement along our \nporous borders, as proposed in this legislation, would be one very \nimportant step in our efforts to promote national security.\n  While I commend the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for its \nmany actions taken over the past year, much remains to be done to \nsecure our Nation. We do not have sufficient control of our Nation's \nborders, and that fact represents a serious threat to our Nation's \nsecurity. The solution is two part. We must couple comprehensive \nimmigration reform with improvements in infrastructure and enforcement \nin the border region--one without the other will never solve this \nproblem. Last summer I introduced comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation to address our broken immigration system. The Border \nSecurity and Technology Integration Act of 2004 would address the other \nhalf of the border security equation--improving technology, \ninfrastructure, and coordination in the border region.\n  The Border Security and Technology Integration Act is intended to \nimprove security along the vast expanses of land between ports of entry \nalong our Nation's northern and southern borders. It would direct the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct comprehensive \nvulnerability and threat assessments throughout Bureau of Customs and \nBorder Protection field offices to determine what technology and \nequipment are needed to improve security. The bill would establish two\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\nnew border technology pilot programs, one to address aerial \nsurveillance and another to address ground surveillance, that together, \nwill comprehensively evaluate technologies that can improve security \nalong the borders.\n  With jurisdiction along the border divided among a number of Federal, \nState, local, and tribal government agencies, coordination and \ncommunication between entities too often falls short. To address this \nproblem, this bill would direct DHS to develop plans to improve \ncoordination, communications integration, and information sharing among \nthe various governmental agencies.\n  The bill also would provide additional direction to the Science and \nTechnology (S) Directorate within the DHS. The S Directorate is \nresponsible for coordinating research, development, testing, and \nevaluation activities for all elements of DHS. It also has distinct \nprogram areas dedicated to addressing each major category of weapons of \nmass destruction, such as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, \nand high-explosives. In fiscal year 2004, DHS received $1.04 billion in \nresearch and development (R) funding, with $874 million appropriated \nto the S Directorate.\n  The Border Security and Technology Integration Act is intended to \nimprove the coordination and integration of R needs and priorities \nmanaged by the S Directorate. Although most of Department's R \nactivities are within the S Directorate, other directorates within \nDHS also include an R component. The lack of consolidatoin of R \nactivities raises concern about the potential for duplication and \nmisuse of R funds. The FY 2005 budget request recognizes the need to \nconsolidate research funds, and to assist with this effort, this bill \nwould direct DHS to identify all R activities outside of the S \nDirectorate and consolidate these activities within the Directorate to \nminimize waste and duplication of efforts.\n  Technology transfer, which is defined as ``a process by which \ntechnology developed in one organization, in one area, or for one \npurpose is applied in another organization, in another area, or for \nanother purpose'' is an essential component of the new S Directorate. \nThis legislation will direct the Undersecretary of the S Directorate \nto establish a Technology Transfer and Licensing Office to facilitate \nthe transfer of technologies into and out of the S Directorate and to \nhandle licensing activities for the S Directorate. It also would \ndirect DHS to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of \nestablishing a nonprofit government-sponsored enterprise for investing \nin private sector enterprises that develop new technologies that show \npromise for homeland security applications.\n  Again, border security and immigration reform represent national \nsecurity issues for all Americans and matters of life and death for \nmany living along the border. Since January, over 2,000 suspected \nsmugglers and well over 155,000 undocumented immigrants have been \napprehended across Arizona.\n  The Federal Government's inability to adequately secure our borders \nperpetuates a state of lawlessness, shifting substantial financial and \nsocial burdens to residents of the border region. Violent crimes in \nPhoenix, alone, have risen 400 percent over the past year, largely due \nto human smugglers. Across the Nation, hospitals spend well over $200 \nmillion a year providing uncompensated care to undocumented immigrants, \nforcing many hospitals along the border to close their doors or \ndramatically reduce services. Cash-strapped local law enforcement \nofficials spend millions of dollars covering the cost of incarcerating \nundocumented immigrants. Frustrated by this situation, some residents \nhave taken the law into their own hands, forming vigilante groups to \npatrol the border.\n  While DHS has recently launched several initiatives, including \nOperation ICE Storm and the Arizona Border Control Initiative, which I \nhope will substantially improve security in the Arizona border region, \nwe must do more. Manpower alone can never secure the border. We need a \ncomprehensive border-wide security approach that involves people, \ninfrastructure, and technology.\n  I urge may colleagues to support our efforts to address border \nsecurity in a reasoned and responsible manner. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Infrastructure and \n     Technology Integration Act of 2004''.\n\n                        TITLE I--BORDER SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to strengthen the national security by encouraging \nand assisting in the expansion and improvement of educational programs \nto meet critical needs at the elementary, secondary, and higher \neducation levels; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the need for \nlegislation to help attract the most highly skilled Federal workforce. \nTo help reach that goal, we need an education system that will ensure \nthat every young person has the tools needed to succeed in the 21st \ncentury.\n   I have spoken many times about the fall of 1957, when the Soviet \nUnion launched Sputnik into orbit. We were caught off guard as a \nNation. The start of the space race revealed to us that major changes \nhad to be made to preserve our national security and to pull ahead in \nscientific and technological innovation.\n   One year later, Congress passed landmark legislation--the National \nDefense Education Act. The purpose of the act was ``to strengthen the \nnational defense and to encourage and assist in the expansion and \nimprovement of educational programs to meet critical national needs.'' \nThe National Defense Education Act provided assistance to State and \nlocal school systems to strengthen instruction in science, math, \nforeign languages, and other critical subjects. It also created low-\ninterest student loan programs and fellowships to open the door to \nhigher education to a greater number of young people.\n   This coordinated national effort helped our Nation meet its goals. \nBy 1969, Americans had landed on the moon. The United States became the \nmost technologically advanced nation in the world. A new generation of \nhighly skilled mathematicians, scientists, and technology experts were \nhired to staff laboratories, universities, and Federal agencies. \nColleges and universities also established centers for foreign language \nstudy and research.\n   Sadly, this Nation received another wake-up call on September 11, \n2001.\n   The week after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller made a \npublic plea for Arabic and Farsi speakers to assist as translators, \nsignaling the alarming deficiency in fluent speakers of languages \ncrucial to our national security needs. It does our Nation little good \nto have sophisticated weapons programs if we don't have the scientists \nto back them up. It does our Nation no good to have expanded \nintelligence gathering capabilities if what we retrieve sits \nuntranslated. The United States must have the brainpower to match its \nfirepower.\n  Today I join Senator Akaka to introduce a bill to make investments in \nour future as a Nation through investments in our education system.\n  The Homeland Security Education Act will fund partnerships between \nlocal school districts and foreign language departments in institutions \nof higher education. These new foreign language partnerships will \nprovide intensive professional development opportunities for foreign \nlanguage teachers at every level from Kindergarten to 12th grade. The \npartnerships will foster contact and communication between university \nfaculty and K-12 teachers in order to improve teachers' knowledge of \nthe languages they teach as well as their teaching skills. Partnerships \nwill also use grant funds to recruit foreign language majors to the \nclassroom. Our bill will give priority to partnerships that include \nhigh-need school districts and that put a focus on languages that are \ncritical for our future security needs.\n  Our bill will encourage more undergraduates to complete degrees in \nmathematics, science, engineering, and the less-commonly taught, \ncritical foreign languages by establishing a program to forgive the \ninterest on a borrower's student loans if he or she earns a degree in \none of these subjects. This will provide an incentive for students who \nare interested in language, math or science to study them in depth.\n  The bill establishes grants for partnerships between school districts \nand private entities to help schools improve science and math \ncurriculum, upgrade laboratory facilities, and purchase scientific \nequipment. The private sector partner will donate technology or \nequipment to the school district; provide scholarships for students to \nstudy math, science or engineering in college; establish internship or \nmentoring opportunities for students; or sponsor programs targeted to \nyoung people who are under-represented in the fields of math, science \nand engineering.\n  In order to stay on top of innovations in science and technology, \nmore professionals in these fields will need to be proficient also in a \nforeign language. This is imperative to our national security--even \nsome scientific documents and articles in the public domain are beyond \nthe translation capabilities of our government. The Homeland Security \nEducation Act will make\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\ngrants available to colleges and universities to establish programs in \nwhich students take courses in science, math and technology taught in a \nforeign language. Funds will also support immersion programs for \nstudents to take science and math courses in a non-English speaking \ncountry.\n  The Homeland Security Education Act authorizes $20 million for the \nNational Flagship Language Initiative, which was authorized in the last \nCongress. The funds will be used to provide institutional grants to \nuniversities to graduate specific numbers of students with the foreign \nlanguage proficiencies needed by the government and will allow the \nuniversities to operate foreign language immersion programs overseas. \nParticipating institutions will make available a negotiated number of \nslots to student applicants who are Federal employees.\n  With this legislation, we hope to address some of the gaps in \nhomeland security that have been identified by numerous experts and \npanels, including the Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security in \nthe 21st Century. We must do everything possible to ensure that our \nintellectual preparedness is equal to our military preparedness. I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Education \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) American elementary and secondary schools need more \n     qualified teachers in mathematics and science.\n       (2) American colleges and universities must place new \n     emphasis on improving the teaching in areas of disciplines \n     that are critical to the interests of the United States.\n       (3) American elementary and secondary schools need the \n     equipment and resources to improve education in science and \n     mathematics.\n       (4) Foreign language proficiency is crucial to the economic \n     competitiveness and national security of the United States. \n     Significant improvement in the quantity and quality of \n     foreign language instruction offered in United States \n     elementary and secondary schools is necessary.\n       (5) All Americans need a global perspective.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Foreign language skills and area expertise are integral \n     to, or directly support, every foreign intelligence \n     discipline and are essential factors in national security \n     readiness, information superiority, and coalition \n     peacekeeping or warfighting missions.\n       (2) Federal intelligence and defense agencies have been \n     reporting shortfalls in language capability.\n       (3) Communicating in languages other than English and \n     understanding and accepting cultural and societal differences \n     are vital to the success of peacetime and wartime military \n     operations.\n       (4) The optimum time to begin learning a second language is \n     in elementary school, when children have the ability to learn \n     and excel in several foreign language acquisition skills, \n     including pronunciation.\n       (5) Foreign language study can increase children's capacity \n     for critical and creative thinking skills, and children who \n     study a second language show greater cognitive development in \n     areas such as mental flexibility, creativity, tolerance, and \n     higher order thinking skills.\n       (6) Children who have studied a foreign language in \n     elementary school achieve expected gains and score higher on \n     standardized tests in reading, language arts, and mathematics \n     than children who have not studied a foreign language.\n       (7) Proficiency levels required to perform national \n     security functions have been raised, and what was once \n     considered proficiency is no longer the case. The ability to \n     comprehend and articulate technical and complex information \n     has become critical.\n       (8) Languages taught in universities are often not the \n     languages that address national security needs. The top \n     languages the United States Defense Language Institute \n     requires are Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Pashto, \n     Persian-Farsi, Portuguese, Russian, and Serbian-Croatian. \n     Existing foreign language proficiency in nontargeted \n     languages also provides a foundation for subsequent foreign \n     languages, even if unrelated.\n       (9) Immersion through work or schooling abroad is very \n     beneficial for developing needed language proficiencies.\n       (10) Federal agencies have identified the need for \n     employees proficient in foreign languages who have diverse \n     skills including cryptography, translation (particularly with \n     technical documents), debriefing, and interrogation.\n\n     SEC. 302.

Mr. President, today I rise to join my good friend from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, in reintroducing the Homeland Security \nEducation Act. Our legislation would improve science, math, and foreign \nlanguage education in the United States by offering incentives for \nstudents to study these subjects and provide much needed funding to \nelementary, secondary, and post secondary institutions to improve \neducational programs in these critical subject areas.\n  As my colleagues know, the demand for individuals with technical and \nlanguage expertise is growing. In 2001 the United States Commission on \nNational Security/21st Century, also known as the Hart-Rudman \nCommission, concluded that America's need for many skilled people in \nscience, math, computer science, and engineering is not being met. If \nwe do not address this problem, America's position as a global leader \nwould be challenged. With the acceleration of the internationalization \nof science and technology activities, assets, and capabilities, U.S. \nadvantages in many critical fields are shrinking and may be eclipsed in \nthe years ahead.\n  While science, math, and engineering skills are especially critical \nfor the defense and homeland security industries, expertise in these \nfields is also critical to the United States' success in the global \neconomy. America's ability to lead depends particularly on the depth \nand breadth of its scientific and technical communities. Our education \nsystem must produce significantly more scientists and engineers to meet \ndemand and maintain our global leadership in science and technology. We \nneed to develop more qualified math and science teachers and provide \neducational incentives to encourage students to pursue careers in these \nfields. However, there will not be enough qualified workers to perform \nnew technology jobs including those jobs critical to maintaining \nnational security. It is more important than ever that we prepare the \nchildren of today with the skills necessary to succeed tomorrow.\n  Also critical for success in today's world is proficiency in foreign \nlanguages. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, placed renewed \nemphasis on the need for individuals possessing critical language \nskills. Shortly after the terrorist attacks, FBI Director Robert \nMueller made a public plea requesting speakers of Arabic and Farsi to \ntranslate intelligence documents, left untranslated due to the lack of \nforeign language speakers.\n  The investigations surrounding the attacks underscore how critical \nforeign language proficiency is to our national security. The joint \nCongressional Intelligence Committee inquiry into the terrorist attacks \nfound that prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community was not \nprepared to handle the challenge of translating the volumes of foreign \nlanguage counter-terrorism intelligence it had collected. Agencies \nwithin the Intelligence Community experienced backlogs in material \nawaiting translation, a shortage of language specialists and language-\nqualified field officers, and a readiness level of only 30 percent in \nthe most critical languages used by terrorists. These backlogs still \nexist.\n  Our foreign language needs have grown significantly over the past \ndecade with increasing globalization and a changing security \nenvironment. Foreign language skills are needed to support traditional \ndiplomatic efforts and public diplomacy programs, military and \npeacekeeping missions, intelligence collection, counter-terrorism \nefforts, and international trade.\n  Unfortunately, the United States faces a critical shortage of \nlanguage proficient professionals government-wide. According to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, agencies have shortages in translators and \ninterpreters and an overall shortfall in the language proficiency \nlevels needed to carry out their missions. Our national security would \nbe enhanced if our law enforcement officers, intelligence officers, \nscientists, military personnel, and other federal employees could \ndecipher and interpret information from foreign sources, as well as \ninteract with foreign nationals.\n  America needs people who are fluent in local languages and who \nunderstand foreign cultures. The stability and economic vitality of the \nUnited States and our national security depend on American citizens who \nare knowledgeable about the world. We need civil servants, area \nexperts, diplomats, business people, educators, and other public \nservants with the ability to communicate at an advanced level in \nforeign languages and understand the cultures of the people with whom \nthey interact.\n  The good news is that there has been a recent jump in enrollment in \nforeign language courses at the university level, according to the \nModern Language Association. A total of 1.4 million students enrolled \nin foreign language classes in the Fall of 2003. This is a 17.9 percent \njump since 1998 and represents the highest foreign language enrollment \never.\n  At the same time, many foreign language programs at the elementary \nschool level have suffered deep cuts. Many school districts are \nresponding to funding shortages by reducing or eliminating their \nforeign language programs. In some districts, French and German \nprograms have been cut to save Spanish programs, while less commonly \ntaught languages, such as Russian and Japanese, are being phased out \naltogether. Although my own state of Hawaii leads the nation in cutting \nedge foreign language immersion programs for elementary school students \nand is one of the top nine states in the nation in the percentage of \npublic primary schools offering foreign language immersion programs, \nmore must be done.\n  Experts tell us we should develop long-term relationships with people \nfrom every walk of life all across the world, whether or not the \nlanguages they speak are considered ``critical'' at the time. Experts \nalso tell us that an ongoing commitment to maintaining these \nrelationships and language expertise helps prevent crises from \noccurring and provides diplomatic and language resources when needed.\n  They are right. We cannot afford to seek out foreign language skills \nafter a terrorist attack occurs. The failures of communication and \nunderstanding have already done their damage. We must provide an \nongoing commitment to language education and encourage knowledge of \nforeign languages and cultures.\n  In 2001, my good friend and former colleague, the late Senator Paul \nSimon said, ``In every national crisis, our nation has lamented its \nforeign language shortfalls. But then the crisis goes\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\naway, and we return to business as usual. One of the messages of \nSeptember 11 is that business as usual is no longer an acceptable \noption.'' Senator Durbin and I are reintroducing this important \nlegislation today in order to reaffirm our ongoing commitment to \nforeign language and science education.\n  In addition to the legislation we are introducing today, I have also \nintroduced, with Senator Durbin and several of our colleagues, S. 589, \nthe Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act, to address these skill \nshortfalls in the federal government. The Senate passed S. 589 in \nNovember, and the bill is pending before the House. However, we must \nnow ensure that we not only provide incentives to recruit individuals \nwith these skills, but also ensure that there is a talented applicant \npool from which to recruit. This new bill, the Homeland Security \nEducation Act, will do just that.\n  The Homeland Security Education Act would provide incentives for \nstudents to obtain degrees in science, math, and foreign languages by \noffering to repay the interest on their student loans. Our legislation \nwould also strengthen science and math instruction in elementary and \nsecondary schools and promote foreign language education at all levels \nof study by encouraging greater training of foreign language teachers \nand the development of more rigorous foreign language education. These \nmeasures could have a significant impact on strengthening our nation's \nexpertise in areas critical to national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and \nimprove our science, math, and foreign language education programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Pryor, \n        Mr. Hollings, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Edwards, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 2300. A bill to amend the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, \nand Modernization Act of 2003 to eliminate privatization of the \nmedicare program and to reduce excessive payments to health maintenance \norganizations and other private sector insurance plans; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, senior citizens expected the Congress and \nthe President to work together to provide prescription drug benefits \nunder Medicare. Instead, Republicans in Congress and President Bush \nrammed through a radical right-wing proposal to privatize Medicare and \nforce senior citizens into HMOs. Their program is a giveaway to special \ninterests at the expense of senior citizens. It is a dress rehearsal \nfor privatizing social security. And it is wrong.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Medicare Trustee's report announced that \nMecicare's financial position had deteriorated substantially, with the \nprojected date of Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Insolvency slipping \nfrom 2026 to 2019. In part, the shakier status of the trust fund was \ndue to the Bush administration's mismanagement of the economy, which \nhas reduced payroll tax collections. But a major part of the weakened \nstatus of the Trust Fund is the excessive payments to HMOs, PPOs and \nother alternatives to conventional Medicare. These excess payments not \nonly weaken Medicare, but they raise premiums for senior citizens and \nadd to the deficit.\n  Today, we are introducing legislation--the Defense of Medicare Act--\nto repeal the parts of the prescription drug bill that are designed to \nundermine Medicare. Senior citizens have earned their Medicare with a \nlifetime of hard work--and they deserve the program they have been \npromised.\n  President Bush's original strategy was to deny senior citizens any \ndrug benefit unless they joined an HMO or other private insurance plan. \nThat proposal was a non-starter, so the White House and Republicans in \nCongress developed a more devious way to achieve the same goal.\n  The Bush administration privatizes Medicare in three ways. First, it \noverpays private plans by $1,200 per beneficiary--and throws in a $12 \nbillion dollar slush fund to boot. Let me repeat that. Every time a \nsenior citizen joins an HMO it costs Medicare $1,200 more than it would \ncost to cover that same senior citizen under the regular Medicare \nprogram. The goal--to make Medicare unable to compete.\n  According to the Medicare actuary, the excess payments to private \nplans as the result of the new bill will cost the Medicare program $46 \nbillion dollars--money that could be used to improve the inadequate \ndrug benefit or to address the discrimination that will cause three \nmillion senior citizens to lose their good private retiree drug \ncoverage or to reduce beneficiary premiums.\n  Those big new checks are already flowing to Medicare HMOs. Every \nsenior citizen--and every American family--should understand what this \nmeans. The Bush administration is using senior citizens' own Medicare \nmoney to undermine the Medicare program they depend on. The Bush \nadministration has put the interests of HMOs and the insurance industry \nfirst--and the interests of senior citizens last.\n  The second way the Republican Medicare bill forces senior citizens \ninto HMOs is by specifying that if just one private stand-alone drug \nplan offers drug coverage, the only way a senior citizen can get a drug \nbenefit is by joining an HMO or other private insurance plan. Think \nabout that. If the insurance plan charges premiums that are too high or \ndoesn't cover the drugs your doctor prescribes, your only choice if you \nwant a drug benefit at all is to join an HMO. That's the Bush \nadministration's original plan.\n  Finally, the bill forces up to seven million senior citizens into a \nso-called demonstration program that will punish senior citizens with \nhigher premiums unless they join an HMO or other private insurance \nplan.\n  The Bush administration is spending twenty-three million dollars of \nMedicare money to convince senior citizens that the Republican bill \nmeans, in the words of one of their commercials, ``Same Medicare. More \nBenefits.'' This use of Medicare funds to advance the Bush re-election \neffort is probably illegal. It is certainly unethical. But most of all \nit is false. If this bill is allowed to stand, senior citizens won't \nhave the same Medicare. Instead, they will have a debased, devalued \nprogram and financially less secure program that will require them to \ngive up the doctors they trust to get the affordable medical care they \nhave been promised.\n  Our legislation will repeal the provisions of the bill that squander \nMedicare money on fattening the profits of HMOs and the insurance \nindustry. It will preserve Medicare for today's and tomorrow's senior \ncitizens. It is a test of the conscience of the Senate, and we will \ninsist on its consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 2301. A bill to improve the management of Indian fish and wildlife \nand gathering resources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a discussion draft \nbill that has been developed by Indian tribal governments to provide \nfor the improvement of the management of Indian fish and wildlife \nresources and to reaffirm that tribal governments are the principal \nmanagers of natural resources on tribal lands.\n  The introduction of this discussion draft bill is intended to advance \nthe process of consultation with Indian tribal governments, as well as \ntribal and Alaska Native organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States and Indian tribes have a government-\n     to-government relationship;\n       (2) Indian tribes exercise governmental authority over \n     their citizens and their lands, and retain all aspects of \n     their inherent sovereignty not explicitly ceded to the United \n     States;\n       (3) the wise use and sustainable management of tribal fish \n     and wildlife resources has a direct effect on the economic \n     security and health and welfare of Indian tribes;\n       (4) Indian tribes retain the sovereign governmental \n     authority to exercise some aspects of civil jurisdiction over \n     non-members on their reservations, including the exercise of \n     some aspects of civil jurisdiction on non-trust lands;\n       (5) Federal canons of construction require that any \n     modification of a treaty must be expressly provided for by \n     the Congress;\n       (6) the United States has a trust responsibility to \n     protect, conserve, and manage tribal natural resources, \n     including fish and wildlife and gathering resources, \n     consistent with the rights reserved by Indian tribes as \n     reflected in treaties and other agreements with the United \n     States, and judicial decrees;\n       (7) the United States' trust responsibility extends to all \n     Federal agencies and departments, and absent a clear \n     expression of Congressional intent to the contrary, the \n     United States has a duty to administer Federal fish and \n     wildlife conservation laws and resource management programs \n     in a manner consistent with its fiduciary obligation to honor \n     and protect the rights reserved by Indian tribes as reflected \n     in treaties and other agreements with the United States, and \n     judicial decrees;\n       (8) Federal statutes and regulations affecting tribal fish \n     and wildlife resources and management activities shall be \n     interpreted in accordance with long-standing principles of \n     Federal-Indian law, statutes, and judicial decrees which \n     inform the relationship between Indian tribal governments and \n     the United States;\n       (9) the United States recognizes that fish and wildlife \n     resources located on tribal lands, in regional tribal \n     resource management areas, and in ceded territory in which \n     hunting, fishing and gathering rights reserved by Indian \n     tribes in treaties and other agreements with the United \n     States, and in judicial decrees, continue to provide \n     sustenance, cultural enrichment, and economic stability for \n     Indian tribes through employment in resource management \n     occupations;\n       (10) Indian tribal governments retain sovereign \n     governmental authority and jurisdiction to regulate hunting \n     and fishing activities on tribal lands as well as \n     governmental authority to regulate the hunting and fishing \n     activities of tribal citizens on lands outside of reservation \n     boundaries;\n       (11) Indian tribal governments serve as co-managers of fish \n     and wildlife resources with governments of other tribes, \n     States, and the United States, sharing management \n     responsibilities for fish and wildlife resources pursuant to \n     treaties and agreements with the United States, statutes, and \n     judicial decrees;\n       (12) since time immemorial, Indian cultures, religious \n     beliefs and customs have centered around their relationships \n     with fish, wildlife and gathering resources, and Indian \n     people have relied on these resources for food, shelter, \n     clothing, tools and trade;\n       (13) Indian fish and wildlife resources are renewable and \n     manageable natural resources that are among the most valuable \n     tribal assets and which are vital to the well-being of Indian \n     people;\n       (14) Indian lands contain millions of acres of natural \n     lakes, woodlands, and impoundments, thousands of perennial \n     streams, and tens of millions of acres of wildlife habitat;\n       (15) Indian and Alaska Native fish and wildlife programs \n     contribute significantly to the conservation and enhancement \n     of fish, wildlife and gathering resources, including those \n     resources which are classified as threatened or \n     endangered,\n       (16) Federal, State, and tribal fish hatcheries produce \n     tens of millions of salmon, steelhead, walleye, and other \n     fish species annually, benefitting both Indian and non-Indian \n     sport and commercial fisheries in the United States and \n     Canada, and serving Indian subsistence and ceremonial needs;\n       (17) Indian reservations and Alaska Native communities \n     continue to suffer from the highest rates of unemployment in \n     the nation, and the current economic infrastructure and \n     capital base of many tribes and Native communities does not \n     provide adequate support to take advantage of economic \n     opportunities;\n       (18) comprehensive and improvement management of Indian \n     fish and wildlife resources will yield greater economic \n     returns, enhance Indian self-determination, strengthen tribal \n     self-governance, promote employment opportunities, and \n     improve the social, cultural, and economic well-being of \n     Indian and neighboring communities;\n       (19) the United States has a responsibility to provide \n     assistance to Indian tribes to--\n       (a) enable integrated management and regulation of hunting, \n     fishing, trapping and gathering activities on tribal lands, \n     including the protection, conservation, and enhancement of \n     resource populations and habitats upon which the meaningful \n     exercise of Indian rights depend;\n       (b) develop integrated resource management plans, \n     cooperative management agreements, and regulations addressing \n     hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering activities on tribal \n     lands, including the protection, conservation, and \n     enhancement of resource populations and habitats upon which \n     the meaningful exercise of subsistence activities depend;\n       (c) maintain fish hatcheries and other facilities and \n     structures required for the prudent management, enhancement \n     and mitigation of fish and wildlife resources; and\n       (d) assist Indian tribal governments in developing and \n     enhancing economic opportunities associated with the \n     conservation and management of fish and wildlife resources;\n       (20) the United States -is committed to the goal of \n     supporting and enhancing tribal self-government, tribal self-\n     sufficiency and the economic development of Native \n     communities as expressed through numerous Federal statutes; \n     and\n       (21) while the existing network of Federal laws and \n     programs provide a framework for the protection and \n     management of Indian fish and wildlife resources, gathering \n     resources, and the operation and

A bill to improve access to physicians in medically \nunderserved areas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Brownback in \nintroducing important legislation aimed at ensuring that our medically \nunderserved communities have access to the doctors they need. This bill \nreauthorizes the popular Conrad State 30 program for 5 years, satisfies \nthe initial intent of the program to let states decide for themselves \nabout how best to fulfill their health care shortage needs, and \nclarifies existing law to ensure that Conrad State 30 waivers are \nexempt from the H-1B visa cap.\n  The Conrad State 30 J-1 visa waiver program has been a great asset \nover the last decade, bringing crucially-needed doctors to serve \nmedically underserved areas throughout our country. Forty-nine states \nnow participate in the program, accounting for 1027 doctors in 2003. \nEach of these doctors is serving patients that might otherwise not be \nserved, providing valuable medical services to communities that \notherwise might have to go without.\n  Unfortunately, today's reality is that many areas of the country, \nespecially rural communities, have a very difficult time recruiting \nAmerican doctors. These health facilities have had no other choice but \nto turn to foreign medical graduates. J-1 visa waivers allow foreign \nphysicians to practice in medically-underserved communities after their \nJ-1 status has expired without first returning to their home countries. \nThese waivers allow foreign physicians to receive nonimmigrant, H-1B \nstatus for three years. In order to receive the waiver, the physician \nundergoes numerous background and security checks, and must agree to \nserve a medically-underserved community for three years. If he or she \nfails to fulfill that commitment, the physician is subject to immediate \ndeportation.\n  Prior to the creation of the State 30 program, J-1 visa waivers \nexclusively involved finding an ``interested federal agency'' to \ncoordinate the request. This was found to be a long, cumbersome, and \nbureaucratic process. By allowing states to directly participate in the \nprocess of obtaining waivers, the program relieves some of the burdens \non participating Federal agencies and allows decisions regarding a \nstate's health care needs to be made at the state level by the people \nwho know best. Since 1994, the program has been reauthorized a number \nof times; the most recent reauthorization expires in June 2004.\n  The bill Senator Brownback and I introduce today contains 3 parts. \nFirst and foremost, it contains a 5-year reauthorization. Five years is \na reasonable amount of time for Congress to be able to reassess the \nphysician needs of the country and to take appropriate steps in the \ncourse of an additional reauthorization.\n  Second, consistent with the original intent of the Conrad State 30 \nprogram to provide states flexibility, the bill would allow states to \ndecide for themselves where their health care shortages are and how \nbest to use their 30 spots. Currently, states can only place these \ndoctors in shortage areas as designated by the Federal government. \nStates, however, can and should be able to make these decisions for \nthemselves. Instead of Washington, DC, telling a state where there is a \nphysician shortage, a state under this bill could do so for itself.\n  Third, the bill erases any ambiguity about whether Conrad State 30 \ndoctors are exempt from the H-1B visa cap. Through legislation in the \n106th Congress, Conrad State 30 waivers were specifically exempted from \nthe H-1B visa cap. Unfortunately, there is now ambiguity about whether \nthis provision still applies. Our current bill clarifies the original \nintent of this previous legislation, clearly making Conrad State 30 \ndoctors exempt.\n  In concluding, I want to thank Senator Brownback for his help and \nsupport in developing this bill. Our bill is a modest one; it is \nlimited and it is targeted. However, this does not diminish the \nimportance of retaining and improving the Conrad State 30 program. The \nvitality of hundreds of communities and, most importantly, the health \nof thousands of patients across our country depend on it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n       S.J. Res. 31.

Res. 32. A joint resolution to provide for \n     Congressional disapproval of certain regulations issued by \n     the Office of the comptroller of the Currency, in accordance \n     with section 802 of title 5, United States Code; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two joint \nresolutions to fight predatory mortgage lending. The resolutions would \nstrike down the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's recent \nregulations that put millions of families in the sights of predatory \nlenders.\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\n  The middle class--the foundation of our country--is sinking. In the \nlast generation, families have gone from saving for the future to \nborrowing just to get by. Home foreclosure rates have tripled in the \nlast 25 years. This year, more middle-class children will see their \nparents declare bankruptcy than will see their parents get divorced.\n  Working families are vulnerable. They cannot save because they must \nspend more for housing, health care, child care, and college tuition. \nThese expenses are not luxuries. They are the necessities. Without \nsavings, a bump in the road--a lost job or sudden illness--could become \nthe end of the road.\n  There is a lot of work to be done to help families get ahead and \nbuild a secure future. The legislation I am introducing today deals \nwith just one aspect of the problem, but it is an important one: the \nfight against predatory mortgage lenders.\n  There are mortgage companies that cheat people, plain and simple. \nExcessive fees leave families on a treadmill, forcing them to make \nlarge mortgage payments while draining the wealth they have saved in \ntheir home. Many families lose their home altogether. All told, \npredatory lending costs homeowners an estimated $9 billion a year.\n  I am proud that my State of North Carolina is a leader in fighting \npredatory lending. The strong law it passed in 1999 is saving consumers \n$100 million a year, while mortgage credit remains widely available.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government is not doing as well. In fact, \nwe are losing ground. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency in the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued new regulations \nexempting national banks--which hold more than half of bank assets--\nfrom State predatory lending laws.\n  Strong consumer protection laws have been States' responsibility for \nmore than a century. The new rules ignore that tradition, which has \nserved our country well, to create a safe haven for predatory lenders \nin national banking law. They also create an incentive for State-\nchartered banks to escape tough laws by converting to national banks.\n  The resolutions that I am introducing today would strike down the OCC \nrules that preempt State law. It would restore States' ability to \nenforce their predatory lending laws within their boundaries and \nprotect their homeowners against abusive loans.\n  These protections are badly needed. About half of subprime borrowers \nare paying extra interest and fees, when they qualify for better rates. \nThat's hundreds of thousands of Americans who are each paying thousands \nof dollars more than they should for their homes. Even worse, some \nfamilies see their loans refinanced again and again, their equity \ndiminished time and again, until one day they lose their home.\n  It is offensive, but predatory lenders target African-American and \nother minority communities. If you are an upper-income African-American \nfamily, you are twice as likely to get a subprime loan than a lower-\nincome white family is. Think about that: even though you are doing \nbetter, you get a worse loan if you are African-American.\n  That is dead wrong. We need a strong national law to fight predatory \nlending. We don't need a prohibition of the strong State laws now on \nthe books with weak national rules. I urge my colleagues to support \nthese resolutions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolutions be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolutions were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Government \n     Reorganization Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago that is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States;\n       (3) the United States has a special political and legal \n     responsibility to promote the welfare of the native people of \n     the United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (4) under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm \n     treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     and from 1826 until 1893, the United States--\n       (A) recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) accorded full diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii; and\n       (C) entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, \n     1849, 1875, and 1887;\n       (5) pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 \n     Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United States set aside \n     approximately 203,500 acres of land to address the conditions \n     of Native Hawaiians in the Federal territory that later \n     became the State of Hawaii;\n       (6) by setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Hawaiian Homes Commission \n     Act assists the members of the Native Hawaiian community in \n     maintaining distinct native settlements throughout the State \n     of Hawaii;\n       (7) approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian families reside on \n     the Hawaiian Home Lands and approximately 18,000 Native \n     Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands are on a waiting list to receive assignments of \n     Hawaiian Home Lands;\n       (8)(A) in 1959, as part of the compact with the United \n     States admitting Hawaii into the Union, Congress established \n     a public trust (commonly known as the ``ceded lands trust''), \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) the public trust consists of lands, including submerged \n     lands, natural resources, and the revenues derived from the \n     lands; and\n       (C) the assets of this public trust have never been \n     completely inventoried or segregated;\n       (9) Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the \n     ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State;\n       (10) the Hawaiian Home Lands and other ceded lands provide \n     an important foundation for the ability of the Native \n     Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native \n     Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the \n     survival and economic self-sufficiency of the Native Hawaiian \n     people;\n       (11) Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii;\n       (12) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the ``Apology Resolution'') was \n     enacted into law, extending an apology on behalf of the \n     United States to the Native people of Hawaii for the United \n     States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (13) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished to the United States their claims to \n     their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national \n     lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (14) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President--\n       (A) to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) to support reconciliation efforts between the United \n     States and Native Hawaiians; and\n       (C) to consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation \n     process as called for in the Apology Resolution;\n       (15) despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their \n     separate identity as a distinct native community through \n     cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination, self-governance, and economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (16) Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency--\n       (A) through the provision of governmental services to \n     Native Hawaiians, including the provision of--\n       (i) health care services;\n       (ii) educational programs;\n       (iii) employment and training programs;\n       (iv) economic development assistance programs;\n       (v) children's services;\n       (vi) conservation programs;\n       (vii) fish and wildlife protection;\n       (viii) agricultural programs;\n       (ix) native language immersion programs;\n       (x) native language immersion schools from kindergarten \n     through high school;\n       (xi) college and master's degree programs in native \n     language immersion instruction;\n       (xii) traditional justice programs, and\n       (B) by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and local control;\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (18) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their \n     lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in \n     accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and \n     practices, language, and social and political institutions, \n     to control and manage their own lands, including ceded lands, \n     and to achieve greater self-determination over their own \n     affairs;\n       (19) this Act provides a process within the framework of \n     Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their \n     inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community \n     to reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the \n     purpose of giving expression to their rights as native people \n     to self-determination and self-governance;\n       (20) Congress--\n       (A) has declared that the United States has a special \n     responsibility for the welfare of the native peoples of the \n     United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct group of \n     indigenous, native people of the United States within the \n     scope of its authority under the Constitution, and has \n     enacted scores of statutes on their behalf; and\n       (C) has delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to \n     administer some of the United States' responsibilities as \n     they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;\n       (21) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special political and legal relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, \n     ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii \n     into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; \n     73 Stat. 4), by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held as a public trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States' responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands that comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (22) the United States has continually recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, indigenous, native people who \n     exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the indigenous, native \n     people of a once-sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special trust relationship of American Indians, \n     Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States \n     arises out of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native \n     people of the United States; and\n       (23) the State of Hawaii supports the reaffirmation of the \n     political and legal relationship between the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity and the United States as evidenced by 2 \n     unanimous resolutions enacted by the Hawaii State Legislature \n     in the 2000 and 2001 sessions of the Legislature and by the \n     testimony of the Governor of the State of Hawaii before the \n     Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate on February 25, \n     2003.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``225th Anniversary of the \n     American Revolution Commemoration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the American Revolution, inspired by the spirit of \n     liberty and independence among the inhabitants of the \n     original 13 English colonies, was an event of global \n     significance having a profound and lasting effect on the \n     government, laws, culture, society, and values of the United \n     States;\n       (2) the years 2000 through 2008 mark the 225th anniversary \n     of the American Revolution;\n       (3) citizens of the United States should have an \n     opportunity to understand and appreciate the continuing \n     legacy of the American Revolution;\n       (4) the 225th anniversary of the American Revolution \n     provides an opportunity to enhance public awareness and \n     understanding of the impact of the American Revolution on the \n     lives of citizens of the United States;\n       (5) although the National Park Service administers \n     battlefields, historical parks, historic sites, and programs \n     that address elements of the story of the American \n     Revolution, there is a need to establish partnerships that \n     link those sites and programs with sites and programs of \n     other Federal and non-Federal entities to place the story of \n     the American Revolution in the broad context of the causes, \n     consequences, and significance of the American Revolution; \n     and\n       (6) a national program of the National Park Service that \n     links historic structures and sites, routes, activities, \n     community projects, exhibits, and multimedia materials in a \n     manner that is unified and flexible is the best method of \n     conveying to citizens of the United States the story and \n     significance of the American Revolution.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize the enduring importance of the American \n     Revolution to the lives of citizens of the United States; and\n       (2) to authorize the National Park Service to coordinate, \n     connect, and facilitate Federal and non-Federal activities to \n     commemorate, honor, and interpret the history of the American \n     Revolution, including the significance and relevance of the \n     American Revolution to the shape and spirit of the Government \n     and society of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the 225th \n     Anniversary of the American Revolution Commemoration Program \n     established under section 4(a).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 4. 225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION \n                   COMMEMORATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish within the \n     National Park Service a\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\n     program to be known as the ``225th Anniversary of the \n     American Revolution Commemoration Program''.\n       (b) Activities.--In carrying out the program, the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (1) produce and distribute to the public educational \n     materials relating to the American Revolution, such as--\n       (A) handbooks;\n       (B) maps;\n       (C) interpretive guides; and\n       (D) electronic information;\n       (2) enter into appropriate cooperative agreements and \n     memoranda of understanding to provide technical assistance \n     under subsection (d);\n       (3) assist in the protection of resources associated with \n     the American Revolution;\n       (4) enhance communications, connections, and collaboration \n     among units and programs of the National Park Service \n     relating to the American Revolution;\n       (5) expand the research base for interpretation of and \n     education on the American Revolution; and\n       (6)(A) create and adopt an official, uniform symbol or \n     device for the theme ``Lighting Freedom's Flame: American \n     Revolution, 225th Anniversary''; and\n       (B) promulgate regulations for the use of the symbol or \n     device.\n       (c) Components.--The Program shall include--\n       (1) units and programs of the National Park Service \n     relevant to the American Revolution, as determined by the \n     Secretary;\n       (2) other governmental and nongovernmental--\n       (A) sites and facilities that are documented to be directly \n     related to the American Revolution; and\n       (B) programs of an educational, research, or interpretive \n     nature relating to the American Revolution; and\n       (3) through the Secretary of State, the participation of \n     the Governments of the United Kingdom, France, the \n     Netherlands, Spain, and Canada.\n       (d) Cooperative Agreements and Memoranda of \n     Understanding.--To achieve the purposes of this Act and to \n     ensure the effective coordination of the Federal and non-\n     Federal components of the Program with National Park Service \n     units and programs, the Secretary may enter into cooperative \n     agreements and memoranda of understanding with, and provide \n     technical assistance to--\n       (1) the heads of other Federal agencies, States, units of \n     local government, and private entities; and\n       (2) in cooperation with the Secretary of State, the \n     Governments of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, \n     Spain, and Canada.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this Act \n     $500,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3951-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMENDING THE HUSKIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I appreciate the reservation being made over there because \nit was going to come quickly over here.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the situation we have here is just like Las \nVegas.

Those two teams \nhave been so lucky, maybe they should spend a little time in Las Vegas.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, my smile is because it was just yesterday \nabout this time that the distinguished Presiding Officer and myself--\nactually, it was a little earlier than this--were in the Chamber hoping \nthis resolution would not ever make it to the floor, given the fact \nthat our Lady Vols were about to play. This was about 24 hours ago.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Connecticut said earlier today, it \nwas a fantastic game, and to be able to watch last night two \noutstanding women's basketball teams compete in the very best spirit--\nwhich is what sports is all about, which is what competition is all \nabout, which is what hard work is all about--was a great thrill to us \nall.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, a few years may have passed since I had the \npleasure of serving President Ronald Reagan, but I can still remember \nthe liberal naysayers attacking him for his fixed resolve in fighting \nthe cold war. They questioned President Reagan's reasoning, they \nquestioned his strategy, and they questioned America's chances of \ncoming away victorious in a battle to free the Soviet Union and other \ncountries from the grasp of communism. President Reagan rejected \ncommunism, he rejected the Iron Curtain, and he refused to concede that \nfreedom could not prevail.\n  While the Soviet Union was extending its influence and doctrine \nthroughout the world, President Reagan had a different idea for the \ncourse of history. He knew that the enemy must be defeated, not \ntolerated. So in the face of severe criticism, Ronald Reagan did just \nthat. Of course, we now know Reagan was right in his actions to \neradicate communism. Millions were freed, and a global threat no longer \nexists.\n  Does this kind of skepticism have a familiar ring? It should. It is \nfrighteningly similar to the opposition our current President is \nfacing. In fact, some of the faces are even the same. They were wrong \nthen, and they are wrong now.\n  As did Reagan, President Bush determined that terrorism must not be \ntolerated. It must be defeated.\n  Since declaring a global war on terror, the United States has \nsucceeded in two operations against countries that harbored known \nterrorists. We have captured a brutal dictator in Saddam Hussein, \nimmobilized Osama bin Laden, destroyed al-Qaida's base, and Iraq now \nhas a constitution built on democratic principles. We are also seeing \npositive signs from known sponsors of terrorists.\n  After years of successfully hiding from United Nations inspectors, \nLibya has now relinquished its nuclear weapons program. Libya, as well \nas other rogue terrorist regimes, knows this President means business. \nDoes this sound like a record that deserves criticism and skepticism?\n  Since liberating Iraq, the coalition forces have made tremendous \nprogress, but insurgents remain who do not wish to embrace freedom but \ninstead choose violence and terror. Coalition forces are presently \nseeking cleric al-Sadr. He is an individual who has a lot in common \nwith Saddam Hussein. Much like Saddam, he is inciting criminals and \nloyalists of the old regime to take up arms against peace and freedom. \nMuch like Saddam, he is hiding somewhere while others fight his \nbattle--this time in a mosque, not a hole. And much like Saddam, he and \nother rogue supporters will be brought to justice by our forces.\n  We are blessed with brilliant and hard-working men and women, under \nPaul Bremer's leadership, who have sacrificed their way of life in the \nUnited States to aid the Iraqi people in the transition to democracy. \nOur men and women in uniform have done and are doing a phenomenal job \nof bringing stability to nations previously under the reign of terror. \nSadly, there are casualties still occurring abroad, and it is \nheartbreaking.\n  I have personally visited with our men and women in uniform, as well \nas their families, and have seen firsthand their unwavering commitment. \nThey underscored how strongly they felt about their mission and the \nneed to see it through to completion. Just this week, President Bush \nwas in my home State of North Carolina where he met privately with the \nfamily of 26-year-old Army Specialist Christopher Hill. Christopher was \nkilled in Iraq when his vehicle fell victim to a roadside bomb and \nexploded.\n  During the tear-filled meeting, an emotional President Bush spent \ntime with Christopher's young widow, Cheryl Hill, and her 14-month-old \ndaughter. Cheryl Hill was unyielding in her support of President Bush \nas our Commander in Chief. Amidst her prayers for her family, Cheryl \ntold the President she not only supports him 100 percent, she prays for \nhim as well.\n  I conclude with a story that pulled at my heartstrings this week. A \nsoldier in Iraq was gravely injured when his vehicle was hit by a \nrocket-propelled grenade while on patrol. His driver and gunner were \nkilled. He suffered extensive burns on his legs, back, and face and \npermanent nerve damage to his left leg.\n  After undergoing rehabilitation and several skin grafts in Germany, \nhe told his commander to send him back to Iraq or he would not \nreenlist. He went through tests to ensure he was still mission capable \nand was ultimately sent back to Iraq to resume his post. When this \nseriously injured soldier was asked why he returned to Iraq after that \nkind of ordeal, he simply responded, ``The job is not done.''\n  Simple words, but how powerful and how poignant. Our job is not done, \nbut I know we have men and women capable of completing it. May God \nbless each and every one of them and may God continue to bless those \nwho yearn for freedom around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very important \ntopic this evening. But I first want to commend and concur with the \nSenator from North Carolina in terms of our support for our troops. I \nthink this is such a critical time. It is such a challenging, dangerous \ntime for our men and women who are serving us now, particularly in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. All of us, 100 percent of this body, and I know the \nHouse, as well as the administration, join together in saluting, \ncommending, and sending our prayers to them every single day.\n  I also wish to give my respect and honor and support to all of our \nmen and women who are serving us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3952-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3952-S3956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a subject \nthat I have certainly spoken about before on the Senate floor. This is \nan issue of great concern, an issue that is\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nnear and dear to my heart, and that is the question of Medicare. Right \nnow, though, too many people are calling the new Medicare law that we \npassed ``Medigate'' because of all of the issues that have come \nforward, both in implementing the new law and in issues that relate to \nwhat we knew, what was withheld from us, all of the information and \ninaccuracies in fact that have come forward since passing this \nlegislation.\n  I am very concerned, as I have indicated on many occasions, that the \nnew law includes provisions that would undermine Medicare as we know \nit; that many beneficiaries would be worse off, either losing their \ncoverage or paying more under the new Medicare law. To add insult to \ninjury, this new law does nothing to lower the cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  Every day, as we look more closely at what some are calling Medigate, \nover and over again we find there are new concerns about the Medicare \nbill. Senator Bob Graham spoke earlier, and I commend him as a champion \nof protecting Medicare. Throughout his tenure in the Senate, he has \nbeen a thoughtful and passionate champion on this issue.\n  He spoke about Richard Foster, who was threatened that if he told us \nthe real numbers on what it would cost, he would be fired. Now we see \ncharges and countercharges, questions being raised about what is \nhappening.\n  Sadly, we have heard this same story repeated over and over again in \ndifferent ways about people who had the courage to stand up and \ndisagree with the current administration, or, in this case, a career \npublic servant who was just trying to do his job and give us the \ninformation to which we had the right and, in fact, needed to know \nbefore we passed this Medicare bill.\n  As I have indicated in expressing my concerns, we started out with a \nbill that would provide a real, comprehensive prescription drug benefit \nfor seniors, a bill that would lower prices for everyone, and we ended \nup with neither of those things. Instead, we ended up with a bill that \nis focused on helping the pharmaceutical industry increase their \nprofits and on helping the insurance industry.\n  This bill is a bad bill for Americans. It is a bad law for American \nseniors, the disabled, and for our families. So I have chosen to put \ntogether what I call the ABCs on Medicare in terms of what has happened \nand what the concerns are in the areas that we need to work together to \nchange before this takes effect in 2006. I call it the ABCs of the new \nMedicare plan.\n  First, A is for the attacks on Medicare through privatization in this \nbill. Secondly, it is a bad benefit. It is not a good benefit for \nseniors. There is a large gap in coverage. There are high out-of-pocket \ncosts. There are uncertain premiums. We know the premiums will be going \nup.\n\n  Coverage loss is another issue. We know that 2.7 million retirees \nwill lose prescription drug coverage in private plans. These are people \nwho had plans; they worked hard all their lives; they retired; they may \nhave given up a pay raise in order to make sure they had retiree health \ncare coverage. We know that 2.7 million of them or 1 out of 4 people \nwith private retirement plans right now will lose them. They will be \ndropped from coverage because of the way this benefit is designed.\n  We also know the discount cards are of little help. I will speak more \non that in a moment, but one piece that I thought was going to actually \nhelp people was a discount card, a discount of anywhere between 10 \npercent and 25 percent. Now there are serious questions being raised \nabout whether there will be any real discount for people in the end.\n  Finally, this law eliminates provisions to lower prices.\n  When we look at this privatization of Medicare with bad benefits--\nsome people lose their coverage, the discount cards are not what were \nadvertised, and the fact that we see no provisions to lower prices--I \nsuggest we ought to start over and make sure we get it right. We have \ntime to do that.\n  The attacks on Medicare through privatization--what does that mean? \nWe know a couple of things. We know what will happen in 6 short years. \nMr. President, 2010 sounds like a long time away. It is 6 years from \nnow. In 2010, for people in 10 different demonstration areas--we don't \nknow where they will be, but in 10 areas around the country--if folks \nwant to stay in traditional Medicare they are going to end up paying \nmore. In fact, in those areas, we find that CBO says it could cost up \nto 25 percent more to stay in traditional Medicare. Others will be \nforced into private HMOs.\n  How is this going to work? In 2010, for people who are in this \ndemonstration area, Medicare will change from a defined benefit to a \ndefined contribution. What does that mean? It means instead of having \nthe same Medicare wherever you go--which, by the way, is what the ad \nsays, ``same Medicare, more benefits''--it will not be true for people \nin these areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services indicated he \ndid not know if the ad would be true: Same Medicare, more benefits.\n  In fact, it is not true for people in these areas around the country \nbecause what will happen is instead of having your same Medicare with \nthe same premium and copay anywhere you live anywhere within Michigan, \nwhether it is Upper Peninsula, Grand Rapids, Detroit, or Lansing, or \nMississippi, Texas, or Minnesota, instead of knowing what you have and \nbeing able to pick your own doctor, for folks in these demonstration \nareas this will become a defined contribution.\n  Essentially, they will be given the equivalent of a voucher for a \ncertain amount of money; then Medicare beneficiaries can decide whether \nthey want to go to an HMO, whether they want to go to a private \ninsurance company, or whether they want to stay in traditional \nMedicare. If the costs go up of going into a private plan, the \nindividual would have to pay the difference. If the person stays in \ntraditional Medicare, again it is anticipated that the costs will go up \nby 25 percent.\n  Why is that? If you are healthy, you are younger, wealthier, so you \ndon't mind taking a risk that your costs are going to go up. You \nprobably can get a deal in a private plan, particularly if you are \nhealthier and younger, so you will get a better rate.\n  Folks who are older, more disabled, sicker won't be able to get a \nvery good rate from private insurance companies. Instead they will stay \nin traditional Medicare. Fewer people in traditional Medicare, the cost \nis not spread as far, the risk pool is not as big--therefore, costs go \nup.\n  What we see is an effort, in just 6 short years, to demonstrate in 10 \nareas around the country a different kind of system that puts the risk \nand the possibility of increased costs on the senior citizen, on the \ndisabled. It begins to unravel Medicare as we know it.\n  I believe that is by design. I believe when Newt Gingrich said we \ncan't directly eliminate Medicare but we are going to let it ``wither \non the vine,'' when he made those comments a number of years ago, I \nthink that is exactly the kind of thing he was talking about in these \ndemonstration projects. As I have indicated, we know the costs of \nMedicare will go up by about 25 percent as a result of this.\n  Why would we want to do this? The reality is Medicare costs less to \nadminister in terms of health services than private plans. We know \nthat. The Congressional Budget Office says it costs 13.2 percent more \nmoney to go through an HMO right now, or private plan, than it does to \nstay in traditional Medicare. We also know Medicare is more cost \nefficient. Only 2 percent of Medicare expenditures are used for \nadministrative costs. The private sector spends about 15-percent \nadministrative costs.\n  We have a system that works; it is efficient; it doesn't cost much to \nadminister; and everybody gets covered. This is a great thing. Medicare \nis a great American success story. If you are 65 or older or you are \ndisabled in this country, we have set as a priority, as an American \nvalue, that we want to make sure our people have health care in this \ncountry. We want to make sure we don't forget our seniors, forget those \nwho are disabled. A system was put together that worked.\n  Instead of celebrating that system, there is an effort now to \ndismantle it, unravel it, and to help do that in this bill. This bill \nwould overpay private plans by $46 billion so they can compete more \neasily. Right now, most people aren't picking private HMOs through \nMedicare+Choice. To make them more attractive, $46 billion that could \nbe spent to lower prescription\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\ndrug prices is being given to private companies and HMOs so they can \nmore effectively compete with Medicare.\n  There is also a slush fund of $12 billion for private companies in \nthis bill. It doesn't go to paying for prescription drugs; it goes to \nsubsidize the insurance industry so they can compete more effectively, \neven though right now we know we would save money if we put a \nprescription drug benefit through Medicare as we know it and beefed up \na system that is already working.\n  Second, this is a bad benefit. In fact, I wish this was a good \nbenefit. We all want to have the very best benefit possible for our \nseniors. Unfortunately, we are in a situation where, first of all, \nthose with a very low income, who are under Medicaid right now and will \nbe moved over to Medicare, may actually find themselves paying more \nbecause the copays are higher. Think about that. Folks who are choosing \nbetween food and medicine, the folks we have all talked about when we \nwent home under this bill, actually may pay more than staying with the \ncurrent system we have right now.\n  There are some folks who will receive some assistance, but first they \nwill need to pay $35 a month in premiums, in fees. In order to be \nexempt from that, that person will have to qualify as low income and \nhave less than $6,000 in assets. Think about that. That is not that \nmuch money. Someone would have to have less than $6,000 in assets to be \nable to qualify for the low-income benefit and not have to pay the \npremiums or the copays.\n  But assuming someone is having to pay, assuming $35 a month, a $250 \ndeductible, then after someone has paid $250 they would have a 25-\npercent copay on any prescription drugs they purchased up until a total \nof $2,250.\n  But after you have spent $2,250 in prescription drug costs out of \nyour pocket, you have to continue to pay the premium but get no help \npaying for your medicine until you reach $5,100 in drug spending. That \nis a huge gap. Some call it a donut hole. It is a huge gap. You have to \ncontinue to pay. You don't get any help.\n  What does that mean in the end? It means in the end you are paying \n$4,050 out of pocket when you have a prescription drug bill totaling \n$5,100. So your drug bills are $5,100 and of that you are paying \n$4,050. You are still paying 80 percent. We can do better than that. \nThat is a bad benefit for our seniors.\n  Let me also speak about the loss of coverage. We have 2.7 million \nretirees who will lose coverage because they have a private retiree \ncoverage right now through their business, and the way it is designed \nit will not allow that to continue. The incentive will not be there for \nthe business to continue this even though folks have worked their whole \nlives to make sure they had coverage when they retired. That was part \nof their benefit plan, part of their salary, and what they have worked \nfor their entire life.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes. I will gladly yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On the point she just made, as I traveled about the State \nof Illinois over the last several days, I have run into retirees who \ntalked to me about having the rug pulled out from under them. After \nhaving worked for years, they expect to receive retirement income and \ncertain benefits. Then because of a company's change in policy, these \nretirees find they will lose their health care benefits.\n  But the Senator from Michigan is saying under the new prescription \ndrug plan supported by the Bush administration, you anticipate when \nthis goes into effect over 2\\1/2\\ million retirees across this country \nwill find these companies basically dumping the coverage they already \nprovided and instead trying to replace it with their plan. Is that what \nthe Senator anticipates as the outcome here?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes. What we are finding--and certainly when we \nstarted, we wanted the baseline to do no harm. We shouldn't have people \nworse off than they are now after we passed this. Yet 1 out of 4 \nretirees, or 2.7 million retirees, will find themselves in that \nsituation, according to the estimates.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Michigan will further yield for a \nquestion, it is my understanding as well if a retiree in America wanted \nto sign up for President Bush's prescription drug plan but then \nrealizes, as the Senator described earlier, there is a big gap in \ncoverage, for example, that the language of the law itself prohibits \nthat retiree from buying in addition to this plan their own private \nhealth insurance coverage to fill in the gap in the plan. So it \nbasically takes away the power of the senior, the choice of the senior \nto try to cover their own expenses by expressly prohibiting that senior \nfrom purchasing insurance to supplement President Bush's prescription \ndrug plan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. It is stunning, actually. I am so glad the Senator \nraised that issue. My mother raised it with me after listening to the \ndebate. The first thing she said to me after this was passed was, You \nare telling me I can't have my Medigap policy. There is a huge hole in \nthe middle of it. There is no coverage. This particular law says under \nyour own choice you cannot voluntarily go out and buy a Medigap policy. \nIt makes absolutely no sense.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question, one of \nthe fundamental issues with the President's prescription drug plan is--\nas I am sure the Senator has mentioned, or will in the course of her \nremarks--there is no mechanism in place in this plan for Medicare \nitself as an insurance program that Americans are familiar with, that \nseniors trust; there is no provision in this bill for Medicare to offer \nthis prescription drug coverage and bargain with the drug companies to \nreduce costs for seniors. There is an express prohibition for Medicare \noffering that kind of prescription drug benefit. Is that not correct?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct. There is only one group that benefits \nfrom that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Michigan be recognized for an additional 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  What we have in this new law adds insult to injury. Not only could we \nkeep the system which everybody knows about, which is the traditional \nMedicare, we could have done a traditional prescription drug benefit \nthrough Medicare. It is less expensive. It is more efficient. We could \nhave provided a better benefit. But on top of that, Medicare is not \nallowed to use their clout to negotiate lower prices. The VA does it.\n  We know if we were to negotiate on behalf of 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries, we could dramatically bring down the price. The problem \nis the pharmaceutical industry knows that, too, and they were \nsuccessful, unfortunately, with their six lobbyists for every one \nMember of the Senate to get that language in this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Michigan respond to this question? \nWhy is it if this plan does not offer Medicare, the option to help pay \nfor prescription drugs for seniors, and if this plan has so many gaps \nin it where people won't receive coverage, and this plan expressly \nprohibits seniors from buying Medigap coverage to help fill the gaps, \nthat an organization like the American Association for Retired Persons \nwould support this plan? Does the Senator from Michigan know if the \nmembers of that organization were surveyed as to whether they supported \nthis plan?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is one of the things that disappoints me more than \nanything else about what happened. I certainly have not heard from \nMichigan AARP members saying they support this plan. In fact, after \nlocal chapters in Michigan found out the details, they have been \nwriting letters to the national AARP indicating they do not support \nthis.\n  This is something that in no way, in my humble opinion, should have \never been supported by the AARP.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question, if I am \nnot mistaken, the polling I have seen says over 60 percent of AARP \nmembers oppose President Bush's prescription drug plan. But their \nleadership, Mr. Novelli,\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nappeared at a press conference and endorsed it. I notice he has had a \nfew things to say lately. He dislikes drug companies, but it is a \nlittle late for that conversation.\n\n  As you take a look at their prescription drug plan, isn't it \ninteresting to the Senator when President Lyndon Johnson created \nMedicare and the bill was passed, he only needed 8 months to put the \nMedicare Program in place to cover seniors, and this President says he \nneeds more than 2 years before he can actually offer the benefits of \nhis prescription drug program. Does the Senator from Michigan have any \nidea why this takes so long and why the President wants to wait?\n  Ms. STABENOW. First of all, it is very simple, I think. They don't \nwant people to know the real facts about this new law. They want to be \nable to put ads on television that say same ``Medicare, but more \nbenefits'' when, in fact, it is not the same Medicare, and certainly by \n2010 it is not the same Medicare with more benefits. Some people won't \nbe able in fact to be able to get those additional benefits. They are \npushing out 2 years the implementation hoping they can campaign now and \npeople will not really see what is taking effect.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent after the Senator from \nMichigan has completed her remarks that the Senator from Minnesota be \nrecognized to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota said I could \nspeak before him. I would ask to have 10 minutes right now.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I will take my time after the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor, and \nhas 11 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much. I thank my friend from Illinois.\n  I would simply also go on to say one of the things I find deeply \ndisturbing is while seniors have to wait for whatever meager benefits \nare in this bill, $46 billion has begun to be spent and given to HMOs \nto subsidize this effort now. Money is being spent from the Medicare \nbill we passed, but it is not being spent on helping people be able to \npay for their medicine, which is another outrage, frankly, in this \nlegislation.\n  Let me speak to one other issue. It is true, we see nothing in here \nthat will allow Medicare to negotiate group prices.\n  There is one thing we thought was going to be helpful this year, a \ndiscount card. We were told it would provide from a 10-percent to 25-\npercent discount on prescription drugs. These are going to be available \nin the next couple of months.\n  As the Wall Street Journal has reported, the prescription drug \nprovision for our seniors and the disabled increased 3.5 times faster \nthan the overall rate of inflation in 2002. The prices for prescription \ndrugs has increased more than 3.5 times the rate of inflation in the \nlast year and a half. In fact, Families USA has done a study looking at \nthe price increases that have occurred since the passage of the bill.\n  This is of great concern to me because it appears seniors may get \nsome help. But will they really? Let me demonstrate why I wonder. I \nwill show the savings in two ways.\n  We were told it would be either a 10-percent savings through a \ndiscount card or up to 25 percent. If we start with 10 percent, we have \nseen an increase in Celebrex of 23 percent. A 10-percent decrease with \na discount card, you still see a price increase of 13 percent.\n  Seniors are asked to pay $30 for this discount card and they can only \nchange it once. Deeply disturbing to me, a senior may decide: I take \nCelebrex and I need as much of a discount as I can receive. I will pay \nmy $30 for this year. But the folks administering this can change which \ndrugs are on the discount list every 7 days. So somebody pays their \n$30, scrapes that together in order to be able to get some meager help, \nand then they find out next week Celebrex is not on the list. Or next \nweek Lipitor is not on the list, or Zoloft or Zocor. So the seniors are \nlocked in but those administering the program are not locked in.\n  For whom is this bill written? For whom are the regulations written? \nI argue, not our seniors but for the prescription drug industry.\n  If it is a 10-percent discount, given the increases that have been \ngoing on--anywhere from 15, 16, 19, to 23 percent--seniors are not \nreally getting a discount if it is a 10-percent discount. That is like \nright before a sale, the store you go to buy your tires from increases \nthe cost of the tires 25 percent, then they put a sign in the window \nthat says 10 percent off. That is what we are concerned about.\n  Now, if it is a 25-percent discount, which would be much better, even \nwith a 25-percent discount card, if Celebrex has gone up 23 percent, it \nmeans seniors are really getting only a 2-percent discount. Or Lipitor, \ngoing up 19 percent, you are getting only a 6-percent discount. On and \non and on.\n  There is another area Families USA raised which is of great concern. \nFirst, they say it is difficult to know what kind of a discount you are \ngetting if you do not know the base price. That is what we are seeing. \nWe are seeing the base price go up so it is tougher to get a real \ndiscount.\n  Second, we know under the discount card program the sponsors of the \ncards are required to pass along to our seniors only a position of the \nshare of the rebate they get from the drug manufacturers. Let's say \nthey negotiate a 30-percent discount. They do not have to pass all of \nthat on to the senior. Instead, they can use that as profits to them.\n\n  There are a lot of issues that relate to this, a lot of concerns. In \nfact, Senator Daschle has introduced a bill, which I cosponsored, that \nrequires that savings be passed on to the senior.\n  The regulations under this discount card foster a number of bait-and-\nswitch schemes by the sponsors that I talked about before. They are \nlocked in, they cannot change, or they can only change once, yet every \n7 days the product being discounted can change.\n  There is a positive aspect, a $600 credit for low-income seniors and \npeople with disabilities who are placed on the discount card. If you \nqualify, you get essentially up to $600 which you can use to purchase \nprescription drugs. That is a positive feature. However, my concern is, \ngiven the regulations and the certification process to qualify for low \nincome, and the fact you have to have less than $6,000 in assets, too \nmany people will not qualify for something that was put in place to \nhelp.\n  There is something we could do, something that was not in this bill, \nsomething that would make a difference. There is bipartisan support. \nInstead of dealing with the discount cards and the prescription drug \nprices that are going up three and four times the rate of inflation, \nmeaning there is not a real discount, real help for people, if we join \ntogether, colleagues on both sides of the aisle are supporting this, \nand allow the pharmacist at the local drugstore in Lansing, Detroit, or \nGrand Rapids, or Marquette, to be able to do business with a local \npharmacist in Canada or other countries that have similar safety \nprovisions as the United States, we could really drop prices in half on \nCelebrex.\n  Instead of figuring out these discount cards, seniors having to pay a \n$30 fee in order to receive them, we simply do what should have been \ndone sometime ago, something that can be done safely, if we had simply \nallowed the local pharmacist to be able to do business with a \npharmacist in Canada.\n  I talk about Canada because that is the easiest and closest for me in \nMichigan. I have taken a number of bus trips with seniors to Canada. We \ncould drop prices 50 percent. We could drop the price of Lipitor 40 \npercent; Zoloft, 37 percent; Prevacid, 50 percent; Zocor, 47 percent.\n  For women with breast cancer, and I had the opportunity to take a \nnumber of women to Canada who are on Tamoxifen, this is most startling. \nIt costs $340 in the United States for a month of breast cancer \nmedication. Women can receive that same drug in Canada for $39. There \nare things we can do.\n  In conclusion, while I believe the Medicare law passed did not end up \nbeing a bill in the best interests of our seniors, the disabled, or the \ntaxpayers of this country because of the inability\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nto lower prices, I do believe there are things we can do. There are \nthings we can do together. One of those would be to open the \nopportunity for local pharmacists to bring down prescription drug \nprices at a huge discount for our seniors. I am hopeful we will bring \nthat up together in the Senate. I believe we can get that done while we \nare in the process of fixing this Medicare law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3956-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3956-S3957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee that had jurisdiction over the prescription drug bill for \nseniors, and as one of those who worked on the final product as a \nmember of the conference committee, as one who is very happy we have \nthis piece of legislation passed, as one, after having 36 town meetings \nin my State since the first of the year, who has come to the conclusion \nthat seniors are beginning to look at this program and see it as \nsomething very beneficial to them, I wish to take a few minutes to \nrespond to the exchange that was recently put on by the Senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from Illinois--not to address the enlarged \npicture they just talked about but to address some misconceptions that \ncan come from parts of their statements.\n  I would start, first, with the issue of the provision in the bill \nthat deals with the Federal Government not negotiating the price of \ndrugs. That was put in there for a very specific purpose. That specific \npurpose was, we know what the situation is with the Veterans' \nAdministration negotiating drug prices. Yes, prices are lower for drugs \nbecause they are doing that, but we have found that the Veterans' \nAdministration will not pay for every particular drug that a doctor \nmight want to prescribe.\n  I had this brought home to me very clearly in my Des Moines town \nmeeting, where the first question I had was from a constituent who was \nmad because her doctor prescribed a drug for which the VA was not going \nto pay. We do not want the Government bureaucrat in the medicine \ncabinet of the senior citizens of America. We do not want the \nGovernment bureaucrat coming between the doctor and the patient. We see \nthat in the VA program.\n  What we have done in the legislation is to build upon a 40-year \npractice of the Federal Government, and all health care, but \nparticularly for prescription drugs for Federal employees, through the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan. We do not pretend to duplicate \nthat plan, but there is some good experience of those plans negotiating \nwith drug companies to bring down the price of drugs. So we do not have \nto have the Federal Government negotiating drugs. In fact, as I said, \nwe specifically do not want it negotiating it. We do not want the \nbureaucrat in your medicine cabinet because we have plans that have \nbeen set up in this bill to negotiate with drug companies to bring down \nthe price of drugs, exactly the same way the plans for the Federal \nemployees bring down the price of drugs. They are very well thought out \nand a very good practice, but, most importantly, we do not want to \nduplicate the shortcomings of the Veterans' Administration program.\n  The second point I would give further explanation to is the exchange \nthat went on belittling the AARP for backing this legislation. I \ncompliment the AARP because we would not have a bill without the AARP \nbacking this legislation, because the AARP had the capability of \nhelping us get a bipartisan coalition. Without them, we would not have \nhad a bipartisan coalition, and you do not get anything done in the \nSenate that is not done in a bipartisan way.\n  Now, what is odd about Democrats finding fault with the AARP backing \nthis bipartisan bill is that the year before, in 2002, the AARP was \nbacking Senator Kennedy's bill. So it seems to me that for Democrats \nthe AARP is OK if they are backing a Democrat bill, but if they want to \nback a bipartisan bill, it is a sin for the AARP to do such a thing.\n\n  The AARP is looking at individual pieces of legislation, looking out \nfor the greater good of their members, and helping get a product as \nopposed to, presumably, people on the other side of the aisle who want \nan issue rather than a product. So I think the AARP has done very well. \nI compliment them for doing that. We would not have a bill without \nthem.\n  What Democrats have to get over is that the senior citizens of \nAmerica are not Democrat property. They are individual Americans, and \nthey ought to be seen as individual Americans, and they and their \norganizations not be denigrated because the Democrats think they have a \ngrip on all seniors of America; they do not. But that is the resentment \ntoward the AARP.\n  Another issue I want to explain is the impression that we have given \nthe bureaucracy 2 years to institute the permanent program for the \nreason that we wanted to get way beyond the next election. It was said \nthat maybe the first Medicare Program, in 1965, was implemented in 8 \nmonths. I was told it was a little over a year. So, to me, 2 years--38 \nyears later--to do the first major improvement to Medicare in 38 years, \nto do it right--and it was not the President who decided it would take \n2 years, as was indicated. Way back when we were dealing with the \ntripartisan bill, in the year 2002, I and my staff asked the \nbureaucracy: We want this done right. How much time should we give you \nto implement it? These nonpolitical people, being honest with us, said \nabout 2 years. So we gave 2 years for the implementation of it. It had \nnothing to do with the President of the United States. It had nothing \nto do with the upcoming election. It is just our desire that if you are \ngoing to implement the first improvement in Medicare in 38 years, you \nought to do it right. It was not our judgment of how much time it takes \nbut a nonpolitical judgment of how much time it takes. That is what we \nwere told, and that is what we did.\n  We do not wait for 2 years for this program to kick in. We have the \ntemporary program that starts June 1, the discount card, and the \nsubsidy for low-income people to get $600 this year and $600 next year \nto help them buy drugs while we are waiting to get the permanent \nprogram in place. Congress made that decision to take 2 years, not the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Now, there was also, throughout this discussion we heard, all sorts \nof insinuations that somehow this is a bill to benefit pharmaceuticals. \nWell, let me tell you, if the pharmaceutical companies had their way, \nthere would not be any bill. But they knew there was going to be a \nbill. The drug companies that patent prescription drugs do not want \ngenerics out there. A very major provision of this bill to bring down \nthe cost of drugs is that provision that does away with the legal \nsubterfuge by which drug companies extend the life of their patent by \nmaking arrangements today with generic companies to keep their drug off \nthe market, and they pay them to do it, so that, effectively, the \npatent is extended beyond 17 years. We did away with that. The \npharmaceutical companies did not want that provision changed but we did \nthat.\n  Another impression that is misleading has to do with the true cost of \nthis bill. We hear the Congressional Budget Office says it is $395 \nbillion. Then a month or two later the Center for Medicare Services \nsays it is $535 billion.\n  Mr. President, is my time up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the Senator from Minnesota allow me to have 2 \nmore minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Senator had 15 minutes in his \noriginal request, so he has 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  The bottom line is, we have these accusations about what the true \ncosts are. So I want to respond to those accusations we have heard that \nthe ``true costs'' of the Medicare bill were somewhat hidden from \nCongress before the final vote. This is simply political, election year \nhyperbole. The opponents of the drug benefit are making this claim \nbecause the final cost estimate from the CMS Office of the Actuary was \nnot completed before the vote took place.\n  Let me be very clear. The cost estimate was not withheld from \nCongress because there wasn't a final cost estimate from CMS to \nwithhold. Their cost estimate wasn't even completed until after \nDecember 23, long after the House and Senate vote.\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\n  Let me also be clear we did have the official cost estimate on the \nMedicare bill before the vote, and that is the one from the \nCongressional Budget Office. As I have said, as both Senators from \nMinnesota know, the Congressional Budget Office is God when it comes to \nCongress having to go by a figure of what something costs. It doesn't \nmatter what the Treasury Department says, OMB, or even CMS. The \nCongressional Budget Office is what we go by. If you don't go by it, \nyou are subject to a point of order. That point of order takes an \nextraordinary majority to overcome.\n  No government official should ever be muzzled for providing critical \ninformation to Congress. If that happened last year, that was wrong. \nThese accusations about whether information was withheld have raised \nquestions as to whether Congress had access to a valid and thorough \ncost estimate for the prescription drug bill before the final vote. It \nshould also be made clear that while the cost analysis by the Office of \nActuary is perhaps helpful, it is not the cost analysis Congress relies \nupon but that of the Congressional Budget Office, as I have already \nsaid. It is their cost estimate we use to determine whether legislation \nis within authorized budget limits.\n  For Congress, if there is a true cost estimate, it is by the \nCongressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office cost \nestimate is the only one that matters. When Congress approved a $400 \nbillion reserve fund to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit, \nthis meant $400 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nnot according to the Center for Medicare Services.\n  With all due respect to the dedicated staff working at the Center for \nMedicare Services Office of the Actuary, their cost estimates were \nirrelevant to the process. The Congressional Budget Office worked \nclosely with the conferees to the prescription drug bill and the staff \nto ensure a full analysis of the projected costs was complete. The \nconferees and staff regularly and constantly consulted with the CBO \nthroughout the development of the Senate bill and in preparation of the \nconference agreement. The Congressional Budget Office worked nearly \naround the clock and on weekends for months to complete an extremely \nthorough and rigorous cost analysis of the prescription drug bill. That \ncost estimate, the official cost estimate, was available to every \nMember of Congress before the measure was presented to the House or \nSenate for a vote.\n  It is also pretty disingenuous for the opponents of the Medicare \nbill--on the other side of the aisle, especially--to suggest the price \ntag for the Medicare bill causes them concern. The fact is, they \nsupported proposals that cost hundreds of billions more than what we \nended up passing last year. The House Democratic proposal last year \nwould have cost nearly $1 trillion, and the Senate Democratic proposal \nin 2002 cost $200 billion more than the bill that was enacted into law.\n  Further, there were more than 50 amendments offered on the floor of \nthe Senate during the debate on the Senate bill that would have \nincreased the cost of the bill by tens of billions of dollars.\n  The bottom line is, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind we had \na true cost estimate for the prescription drug bill last year, and \neveryone had access to it before the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to concur \nwith the sentiments that have been expressed earlier by a couple of my \ncolleagues regarding the heroism of our Armed Forces in Iraq. However, \nI also want to point out our proper admiration for their extraordinary \npatriotism and courage and our sad but necessary condolences to the \nfamilies of those Americans who are still losing their lives in \nincreasing numbers in Iraq or who are suffering serious life-\nthreatening and lifelong disabling injuries from those battles, those \nappropriate tributes and condolences and our unanimous bipartisan \nsupport in this body for our troops--who continue to risk their lives \nthere and in Afghanistan and Bosnia and Kosovo--should not prevent us \nfrom questioning the Bush administration's policies or lack of policies \nwhich are exposing those courageous Americans to those continuing \nattacks and ask what are the administration's plans to respond to the \npresent escalation of attacks in Iraq. What are the administration's \nplans to bring all of our courageous men and women home with their \nvictory secured?\n  In fact, we owe it to them, those whose lives are on the line on our \nbehalf, whose families are enduring every day and night the fear it \ncould be their loved one who will be next to give up his or her life in \nthe service of their country or their bodies, we owe it to them, those \nserving, and to their families to ask the hard questions of the \nadministration and not hide behind platitudes.\n  I am, for one, tired of sitting in secret and top-secret briefings, \neither as a Member of this Senate or as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and being told how well everything is going over in \nIraq, given the chorus line again and again, just to find out, often \nthe next day, that that is not true.\n  Last Tuesday a week ago, late afternoon, then Wednesday morning in \nIraq, I was given those same kind of assurances by representatives of \nthe highest level of the administration, the Department of Defense, and \nour military officials. Hours later, American contractors were ambushed \nin Iraq and bodies mutilated and displayed in obscene ways in that \ncountry. And hours after that, American marines were attacked and, in \nfact, were surprised, so that if it had not been for the intervention \nof U.S. commandoes, private security forces, even worse casualties \ncould have occurred.\n  In the next few days, the escalating attacks in Iraq have caused the \nlargest number of Americans to be killed of any time in this last year \nsince the war began. It seems clear, based on the information I have \nbeen provided, that our military intelligence was unable to anticipate \nthose attacks or to forewarn our Armed Forces of their imminence, their \nseverity, which also resulted in additional casualties.\n  I am deeply troubled by reports in the press that the administration \nhas\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nbeen intentionally trying to downplay the seriousness of those \ninsurrections. Last Wednesday, as Americans were being mutilated, the \nonly public event on the President's schedule was a meeting with \nmembers of the Baseball Hall of Fame. That night, he conducted a \nfundraiser for his reelection. Last Monday, as other Americans were \nlosing their lives, including a Minnesota soldier who was 19 years old, \nfrom Moose Lake, MN, giving his life in Iraq, the President threw out \nthe opening pitch at the baseball game in St. Louis, MO. That night, he \nheld another fundraiser for his reelection that raised $1.5 million. \nThen he flew on to, according to reports, his ranch in Crawford, TX, \nfor the rest of the week.\n  I don't think you can downplay, or should try to downplay, the \nseriousness of these attacks. I think we should face the realities that \nare occurring, and the Congress and the American people should be told \nwhat is happening, why it is happening, and how it is we are going to \nrespond to these atrocities without any greater loss of American life. \nThat is absolutely essential. We are heading to a weekend of great \nreligious significance, following a weekend of great religious \nsignificance to many of our citizens, and at this time what we are \ndoing there is something that is deeply troubling to this Senator, as I \nknow it is to many of the people I represent in Minnesota. We want to \nsee a victory there. We want to see the sacrifices that have been made \nby American troops justified, and we want it preserved as a victory \nthat will last. But we want to know from this administration what the \nplan is, what the timetable is, what is going to happen, and what we \nare doing to forestall these events and warn our forces so they are not \nambushed or caught unaware and lose their lives.\n  We in Congress deserve to get the facts and the truth. Starting \ntomorrow morning, when we have a briefing from the Secretary of Defense \nand others in the military command, it is time to give us the facts, \nthe truth, the real situation, and not put on any whitewash or window \ndressings but to tell us what we as elected representatives of the \npeople of this country have a right to know, and what the people of \nAmerica have a right to know. What is happening? Why is it becoming \nmore severe? What are the consequences to the troops? And what are the \nadministration's intentions to deal with them?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/07/senate-section/article/S3958-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
