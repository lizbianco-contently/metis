Mr. President, this week we have been talking about a \nfundamental standard to guide our debates in the Senate.\n   As we do our work, we need to ask a simple question: ``Are we doing \nright by America?'' We need to ask that question on policies affecting \nfarmers, seniors, and veterans. And we always need to ask whether we \nare doing right by American families when it comes to economic \npolicies.\n   While the economy has finally started adding jobs these past few \nmonths, this comes after 2\\1/2\\ years in which the economy lost jobs \nevery month. What is clear to many of us is that we still have a long \nway to go, and we need to do more to help improve our economy. That is \none of the main reasons it is so unfortunate that we have not completed \nthe long-overdue transportation reauthorization bill--legislation that \nexpired at the end of last September.\n   The ability to plan how roads and bridges will be built has suffered \ngreatly due to Congress's failure to get this bill completed on time. \nWell over 100,000 jobs have been lost due to this delay. And each month \nthat we do not complete our work brings more job losses.\n   Job creation will suffer, too--in South Dakota and across the \ncountry. In my State, because our construction season is short, there \nis not enough time to plan ahead and put people to work, even if we \npassed a bill today. But we will not pass a bill today.\n   Earlier this year, on February 12, the Senate passed S. 1072, the \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act. \nIt was passed by an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 76 to 21. The \nSenate bill would authorize $318 billion over 6 years and is revenue-\nneutral. It is fully paid for and does not increase gas taxes.\n   Nearly 400 organizations, representing the full spectrum of \ntransportation interests, all support the Senate funding level.\n   The Chamber of Commerce, the Associated General Contractors, the \ngovernors, the State legislators--the list goes on and on. All attest \nto the need for this kind of infrastructure investment.\n   The Senate bill would create over 1.7 million jobs--new, good jobs \nfor the millions of Americans who are looking for work. In my State, \nthe Senate bill would create over 6,500 jobs. It would also provide for \nimportant transportation needs on our rural roads and Native American \nreservations, and would allow us to move forward with high-priority \nprojects in towns like Sioux Falls, Rapid City, Yankton, and Pierre. \nThese are important projects that simply will not get completed without \nthe assistance of the Federal Government.\n   One might ask: ``What was the Bush administration's response to the \nSenate's bipartisan job-creating bill?'' Their response has been, a \nveto threat--hardly the answer that Republicans and Democrats alike \nwere hoping for; hardly the response that the economy needs; and hardly \nthe response that the infrastructure deficit we have in this country \ncries out for.\n   Fast forward to April 2. After a bipartisan House plan to offer a \nbill at a $375 billion level was scuttled by the Bush administration \nand the Republican House leadership, the House passed H.R. 3550, the \nTransportation Equity Act. This bill authorizes only $284 billion over \n6 years, and is not fully paid for. Again, one might ask: ``What was \nthe Bush administration's response to the House bill?'' If it did\n\n[[Page S7776]]\n\nnot like the original bipartisan House proposal at $375 billion, and it \ndid not like the bipartisan Senate bill at $318 billion, how about the \nreduced bipartisan House bill at $284 billion? The answer was another \nveto threat.\n\n  Again, hardly the answer that House and Senate Republicans and \nDemocrats were hoping for from their President and hardly the response \nthe economy needs.\n  Fast forward one more time to June 23, when the Senate conferees \nvoted in the conference committee meeting with the House to resolve the \ndifferences between the two bills. The Senate made a formal offer to \nthe House in the amount of $318 billion and requested that the House \nrespond to the offer at the next meeting on July 7. So, yesterday, \nafter 2 weeks' time, the House and Senate met again. There had been \nhopeful signs that the House conferees might be prepared to accept the \nSenate's funding level, and many of us thought we might have a \nbreakthrough that would move the bill forward. But what did we hear \nyesterday? The House was not yet prepared to respond to the Senate's \noffer.\n  What is clear to many of us is that unless the White House and the \nRepublican leadership in the House release their stranglehold on House \nconferees, we will not have a transportation bill this year.\n  Transportation has almost always been--and has been in the Senate \nagain this year--a bipartisan priority. Chairman Inhofe has done a \nsuperb job of guiding the bill forward. But he cannot do it alone.\n  I remain hopeful that the Bush administration will realize that our \neconomy, our infrastructure, and American families need and deserve a \ngood transportation bill, a bill that will create good jobs and provide \nthe investments in our Nation's infrastructure that are so desperately \nneeded.\n  We need more than a President who simply says ``no''--a President who \nsays he will veto a final transportation bill with either the Senate or \nthe House spending levels.\n  By continuing to say ``no,'' the President jeopardizes 1.7 million \nnew jobs in our Nation and 6,500 jobs in South Dakota alone. He puts at \nrisk necessary improvements for rural and Native American roads.\n  Next Tuesday, there will be another meeting of the conferees. I hope \nthis critical issue of the investment level will be resolved, and that \nwe can get on with the business the American people expect us to \nconduct. If we ask ourselves, Are we doing right by America on this \ntransportation bill? The answer is that the Senate has done right. The \nHouse has made a start. But, unfortunately, without the President's \nconstructive participation, we cannot complete the assignment. We will \nnot have a transportation bill. We will not create needed jobs. We will \nbe failing the American people.\n  I urge all Americans to let their Representatives in the House know, \nand let the President know, that we cannot afford to fail when it comes \nto this important bill.\n  We can do better, and I remain hopeful that the President will \nconfront the challenge, reverse his continued opposition, and join the \nSenate in supporting a transportation bill that makes sense for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I also want to address a concern that many of us \nexpressed yesterday about our current circumstances, procedurally and \nparliamentarily.\n  The majority leader threw down the gauntlet again last night in a \nvery unfortunate decision. That decision, of course, was to file \ncloture. Having filled the tree, which means not only are Senate \nDemocrats precluded from offering amendments before we have even \noffered the first amendment or had one vote, it is now the majority's \ndecision to thwart the effort to have the kind of debate that all of us \nanticipated on class action and, simply said, we will have wasted an \nentire week in what is a very limited legislative period to begin with.\n  There is no question the cloture vote will be defeated. We will have \nwasted that week. We could have disposed of most of the amendments by \nnow. Most of my colleagues had already expressed to me a willingness to \noffer their amendments with very short time limits. How ironic that in \nthe name of saving time we have wasted time.\n  I made a legitimate and bona fide heartfelt offer yesterday that we \nlimit Democratic nonrelevant amendments to 5, relevant amendments to \n10. I thought it was an interesting juxtaposition--the majority leader \nactually offered an unlimited list of relevant amendments which would \nhave prolonged debate perhaps for weeks if that had been agreed to.\n  We have made a good-faith offer. I am troubled and again frustrated \nthat we have come to this point. We have wasted a week. We will waste \nmany more days, if not weeks, in the future with this practice. We have \nlearned from the past how unproductive these approaches to debate can \nbe. It is too bad we have to learn all over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7776-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, one of the things that has struck me \nsince I have been in the Senate is that during debate in the Senate, \nparticularly during morning business, Senators seem to have no sense of \nhistory. They seem to create a crisis out of the moment and have no \nsense of placing their statements in any kind of historic context. This \nis an opportunity for missing what really is happening. If you do not \nplace something in its context, you do not understand it properly. For \nthat reason, I have decided to talk a little bit about the debates that \nhave been going on with respect to the economy, where the economy is, \nwhere the economy is going.\n  Let me take listeners back to the election of 1992. I have particular \nfocus there because that is the election in which I was first chosen to \ncome to the Senate. During that election, there was a lot of \nconversation about the economy. We were in a recession, everybody said. \nWe are in a terrible slowdown, everybody said. In fact, as we now know, \nlooking at it in historic context, things were on the rise. There had, \nin fact, been a recession, but we were in recovery during the election \nof 1992. It just did not feel like a recovery.\n\n  That is one of the historic lessons we should all learn. The sense of \nwhere we are is almost always lagging events. That is, we have a feel \nthat we are in a recession when, in fact, we are in a recovery. On the \nflip side of that, we can have a feel that we are in a recovery when we \nare, in fact, in a recession. It is because things take a little while \nto sink into the consciousness even though they are going on in \nreality.\n  In 1992, then-Governor Clinton and I, running, obviously, for \ndifferent offices, both were faced with an electorate that felt the \neconomy was in trouble. We both talked about what we needed to do to \nget the economy out of trouble. Then, when the normal course of the \nbusiness cycle brought the economy back, the temptation on the part of \nall politicians was to take credit for that, as if the recovery that \nwas taking place in 1993 and 1994 occurred solely because we had been \nelected. That is very satisfying for a politician to want to do. It \ndoes not happen to be intellectually accurate, but it is something \neverybody does.\n  As I say, I was elected in 1992. In 1993, I joined the Banking \nCommittee. As a member of the Banking Committee, I had the occasion to \nlisten to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when he came before \nthe Banking Committee to make his report on the state of the economy. I \nremember very clearly because the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, Alan Greenspan, had been appointed by a Republican President and \nwas viewed as a Republican\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\nholdover, some of the Democratic members of the Banking Committee were \nvery critical of him at the time. They said: If this is a recovery--\nvoices dripping with sarcasm--where are the jobs? I remember charts \nbeing held up in the Banking Committee to confront Alan Greenspan to \nsay, if it is a recovery at all, it is a jobless recovery. Where are \nthe jobs? Greenspan was subjected to heavy criticism from Democratic \nmembers of the Banking Committee because somehow it must be his fault \nthat there was a jobless recovery.\n  Looking back, again in the context of history, we know that the \ncreation of jobs is always what the economists call a lagging \nindicator. That is, a recovery starts; it takes hold; the jobs that had \nbeen lost in a recession are always the last thing to come back in a \nrecovery.\n  The jobs started to come back in 1994, in 1995. The Clinton \nadministration took credit for that: We did it; the only reason the \njobs came back is because Bill Clinton was elected President in 1992. \nThe Republicans had an answer to that: No, we did it; the only reason \nthe jobs came back is because Newt Gingrich became Speaker in 1995. In \nfact, of course, the business cycle was well entrenched, the recovery \nwas underway, and the jobs came back, probably without regard to who \nwas President or who was Speaker. It was part of the standard business \ncycle.\n  Then we got into that period of boom, and everybody was excited that \nthe boom was going to go on forever. I remember asking Alan Greenspan \nin one of his other appearances before the Banking Committee, as we \nwere talking about the continual rise in the economy: Mr. Chairman, \nhave we repealed the business cycle? Is the business cycle over, and we \nare never going to have another recession?\n\n  Chairman Greenspan smiled that wry smile of his and said: No, \nSenator, we have not repealed the business cycle, and there will be a \ncorrection, a recession--call it what you will--at some point in the \nfuture. We cannot predict when and we cannot predict how deep, but it \nwill be there.\n  The point of this in political terms is that President Clinton and \nthe Congress that was elected with him in 1992 inherited a strong \nrecovery tide in the economy. However much we took credit for it \nourselves, we really had little or nothing to do with it.\n  Now, let's go ahead 8 years to the election of 2000. In the election \nof 2000, it felt as if the economy was still enormously strong. \nRemember, I discussed our feelings of how things are going usually lag \nreality. In fact, we now know that the economy started to slow down in \n2000. We now know that gross domestic production growth, which is the \nmain measure of recessions and recoveries, was dropping sharply in the \nlast two quarters of 2000, but it did not feel like it. The layoffs had \nnot started yet because businesses were hoping this was temporary. \nEmployment was still up, and we talked about this enormously strong \neconomy we were having.\n  Looking back on it now, we know that the President who was elected in \n2000 inherited a slowing economy headed toward recession, in contrast \nto the President who was elected in 1992, who inherited a strong \nrecovery headed toward a period of great growth. Naturally, in the \npolitical world, that President was blamed for that slowdown. It all \nhappened on his watch, so it was all his fault.\n  Interestingly enough, I recall that in the election of 2000, there \nwas one candidate who spoke of the coming slowdown, and he was attacked \nfor trying to talk down the economy for political purposes. That was \nGovernor George W. Bush of Texas, holder of a Harvard MBA, who could \nsee the signs that this slowdown was coming and talked about it during \nthe campaign, only to be attacked by his political opponents for his \npessimism.\n\n  But he inherited a slowing economy, a slowdown that started in 2000. \nThe GDP went negative in the first quarter of 2001 and hit its worst \npoint in the third quarter of 2001, simultaneous with September 11 and \nthe hit that gave to the economy.\n  So we did have a recession. It was advertised and forecast by the \neconomic information that preceded it, and the President and the \nCongress have been struggling with that recession and the recovery that \nhas followed ever since.\n  It is interesting to me that even though that recession was shorter \nand shallower than the recession that had occurred 8 or 9 years before, \nthe rhetoric on the Senate floor referred to it as ``the worst economy \nin 50 years.'' We were told this President was ``the worst President \nsince Herbert Hoover.'' No sense of history, no understanding of the \nreality, no connection with the real data--but that kind of rhetoric \nhas been used on the floor of the Senate.\n  It is also interesting that the same attack that was made when Bill \nClinton was a fresh President was made again with respect to this \nrecovery: Where are the jobs? The same questions I heard thrown at Alan \nGreenspan by the Democrats on the Banking Committee have now been \nthrown not at Alan Greenspan but at George W. Bush: Where are the jobs? \nOnce again, economic history shows that jobs are the lagging indicator, \nthat jobs come at the end of the turnaround and not in the middle of \nit. And now, exactly on time where economic history would indicate, the \njobs have started to appear.\n  All of a sudden, the argument that this is a jobless recovery no \nlonger holds any water. We have increased jobs for 10 consecutive \nmonths. In the months of March, April, and May, we added more jobs to \nthe economy than were lost in the 3 months following 9/11. We had the \ndisaster of 9/11 and 3 months of a loss of jobs. As the airline \nindustry went into the tank, the hospitality industry and others were \nshattered by the 9/11 situation. We lost a tremendous number of jobs. \nIn March, April, and May of 2004, we added more jobs than were lost in \nthat corresponding 3-month period following 9/11.\n  So now we do not hear about the jobless recovery any more. Now the \nrhetoric has shifted to ``the middle-class squeeze.'' I heard one \nSenator on the Senate floor stand here and say: Property taxes in my \nState have gone up so high the middle class cannot handle it--to which \nI want to say, you mean George W. Bush is responsible for the fact that \nproperty values in your State have gone up, and your State legislature \nhas responded to that by reassessing property and raising property \ntaxes in your State? That is the President's fault?\n  Well, in today's political atmosphere, of course, it is the \nPresident's fault. Anything that happens is the President's fault.\n  The point I want to make is, in historic terms, just as President \nClinton inherited an economy that was on the rise because of forces \nthat were in place prior to his election, just as President Bush \ninherited an economy where the forces were on the decline prior to his \nelection, the next President, the one who will be inaugurated on \nJanuary 20, 2005--whoever he may be--will inherit an economy that is \nstrongly on the rise where all of the economic indicators are up and \nwhere the groundwork for a significant period of growth and prosperity \nhas already been laid. Whoever that President is will take credit for \nthat growth, even though the groundwork for it has been laid prior to \nhis inauguration.\n\n  Now, I will say that if that President is George W. Bush, he might be \nentitled to some of that credit. But the fact is, the combination of \nthe actions in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board and in \nfiscal policy by the Congress of the United States has been responsible \nfor creating the atmosphere of economic growth and strength the next \nPresident and the next administration will preside over.\n  I repeat what I say here often: We politicians need to have a greater \nsense of humility and reality and understand we do not control whether \nthe economy is good or bad. If we could control that, the economy would \nconstantly be good. What politician of either party would deliberately \npreside over policies that make the economy go bad and the voters get \nmad? If it were up to the Congress to say, ``Do this, and the economy \nwill be good'' or ``Do that, and the economy will be bad,'' every \nCongress, regardless of ideological stripe, would always say, ``Let's \ndo what makes the economy good.''\n  So maybe it is time to visit just a little bit about what causes the \nbusiness cycle. It is not elections. Recessions are caused by one of \ntwo general categories of events. One which we cannot control is \noutside shocks, such as 9/11, such as the oil shock that set off the \nrecession in the 1970s. Recessions are\n\n[[Page S7778]]\n\ncaused by shocks that are outside our control.\n  Or the second general category: They are caused by a series of \nmistakes, mistakes that business men and women make. They make \ndecisions about purchasing stock and then discover they have too much \ninventory. They make decisions about going into a market and discover \nthat the market will not work, and they have to lay people off. They \nmake decisions about the future of their product and then discover the \nproduct will not sell, so they have to cut back.\n  When the number of decisions that are wrong exceeds the number of \ndecisions that are right, in an $11 trillion economy, you get a \nrecession. The recession is the way those mistakes are paid for. The \nrecession is the way the impact of those mistakes are corrected.\n  Perhaps the most dramatic one I can think of was the recession of \n1958 where the automobile industry collectively made a series of major \nmistakes. They assumed the boom they had in previous years--1955 model \nyear, 1956 model year, 1957 model year--was going to go forward, and \nthen suddenly they discovered they had huge amounts of inventory on \ntheir hands, as people did not buy cars at the same level they had \nprojected. As a consequence, the automobile industry started to shut \ndown until the inventory got sold off. That meant the steel industry, \nthe aluminum industry, the glass industry, the rubber industry, all had \nto shut down because they were not building cars, and we had one of the \nmost difficult recessions we have had in the postwar period in 1958. \nThe recession was the way you corrected those mistakes. It did not have \nanything to do with who was elected President or who was elected to the \nCongress; it was caused by a series of bad business decisions on the \npart of people in the automobile industry.\n\n  Look at the recession we have just gone through. What did it come on \nthe heels of? Yes, 9/11 was there. Yes, there were some outside shocks. \nBut it came after what we called the dot-com bubble. A lot of jobs were \ncreated in companies that were not earning anything. They had no income \nother than selling stock on the stock market. People got caught up in \nthe froth of the dot-com bubble: This is going to be a great future; we \nare going to buy the stock, and we are going to get rich.\n  Somewhere along the line somebody said: But where are the earnings? \nWhen it dawned on people these companies with these brilliant \nprojections and plans had no earnings, shareholders decided they did \nnot want to hold those stocks anymore. The dot-com bubble burst. The \nstock market collapsed, and we were on our way toward a correction or, \nif you will, recession. It had nothing to do with who got elected.\n  But this point I want to make: Maybe we in government can't create \neconomic growth. Maybe it doesn't matter who gets elected in terms of \neconomic power. But we can certainly do dumb things that can hurt it. \nThe Federal Government can't create jobs, but the Federal Government \ncan mess up the economy in such a way that jobs are destroyed.\n  How do we do it? One of the ways that we disrupt the economy, and we \ndo it regularly, is by our tax policy. We can create an atmosphere \nwhere it is easier for the economy to grow, or we can create an \natmosphere where there are penalties in the form of taxes when the \neconomy grows.\n  I have told this story before about my own experience founding a \ncompany and making it grow in what some have called the decade of \ngreed. When Ronald Reagan was President and the Congress created a \nsituation where the top marginal tax rate was 28 percent, oh, what a \ntremendous windfall for the rich to have the top marginal tax rate at \n28 percent. What they don't realize, those who talk about how terrible \nthis was, is that the enormous economic growth we had in the 1980s, and \nindeed on into the 1990s, in my view, was spurred by the fact that a \ncompany like ours, starting with four employees and growing ultimately \nto 4,000, was able to finance that growth because we were able to keep \n72 cents out of every dollar we earned.\n  When the Clinton administration came in, and the Congress responded \nto his call, the top marginal tax rate went effectively to over 40 \npercent, which meant a starting business was able to keep only 60 cents \nout of every dollar that it earned and had to go someplace else to \nfinance its growth rather than from internal funds.\n  I have made these points before. I have learned in the Senate there \nis no such thing as repetition because on the other side of the aisle \nwe get the repetition day after day about how terrible the economy is.\n  I say again, in conclusion, the next President, whoever he is, will \npreside over a strong and robust economy. The groundwork for that \nreality has been laid during the last 4 years. Whoever takes credit for \nit in the next 4 years will be taking credit for work that was done \nprior to his taking office.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Utah. Certainly, the impact of the economy on all these things is \na little hard to determine and easy to make political. I hope we can \nunderstand and stick with some of the economic elements that are there \nand then deal with the political ones that go with it.\n  First, let me say I am a little disappointed in the way we are moving \nin the Senate, frankly. We don't have many days left to deal with a \nnumber of issues. Frankly, I think we have about four or five issues \nthat we ought to be dealing with. One, of course, is the difficult one \ncalled the budget.\n  Some people out there say: Why do you fool with it? You don't pay any \nattention to it anyway.\n  That is not true. It is a way to protect spending within the limits \nof the budget. If you don't have one, that makes it difficult.\n  Appropriations, of course, must be done by the end of September in \norder to continue to deal with the things we must do.\n  I believe our energy policy, where we are going in the future, ought \nto be laid out. That is one of the most important issues we have before \nus.\n  And as the Democratic leader said this morning, the highway bill has \nthe most direct impact on the creation of jobs of anything we could do, \nand we have completed all the efforts on that for some time.\n  I am certainly hoping that we can move forward. Unfortunately, we \nhave been held up by this idea of having unrelated amendments to every \nbill. We ought to fix that issue. When we are on an issue, we ought to \nstick with that issue and have only amendments that are pertinent. But \nthat is not the case, of course. We use every bill as an opportunity to \nbring up something totally unrelated, and that has been a problem.\n  In any event, I will discuss a little while this morning something \nthat is related to what we are talking about on the Senate floor. It \nisn't part of the bill, nor do I expect to put it in as an amendment, \nbut I think it is something that is quite important to the legal \nsystem, particularly as it affects decisions vis-a-vis public lands. Of \ncourse, being from Wyoming--the Presiding Officer being from Alaska--a \nlarge percentage of our States is public lands. So how decisions are \nmade with respect to those is very important.\n  Furthermore, we find ourselves with an increasing number of lawsuits. \nUnfortunately, we almost have ourselves in a position of managing \nthrough lawsuits as opposed to managing based on good decisions.\n  I would like to talk a moment about venue shopping. We have been \nsteamrolled in Federal land issues by judges who are thousands of miles \naway from the area where the question is raised. Specifically, these \ncourts have systematically denied access to Yellowstone and Grand Teton \nNational Parks. We have national parks to protect them, and at the same \ntime, so that people can enjoy them and have access to them. Those are \nthe important things.\n  Special interest groups that have different feelings about it like to \nsearch out over the country for a venue where they think they can go \nthat will give them the best opportunity to succeed in the lawsuits \nthat they have filed. Environmentalists tend to go to a venue in \nWashington, DC, for a more sympathetic court than those courts\n\n[[Page S7779]]\n\nthey are closest to and deal with the issues that are there. This \naction, of course, is contrary to the system of circuit courts, judges \nthousands of miles away from disputes involving certain impacted areas. \nThose lawsuits should be tried in the courts of primary jurisdiction \nbecause they are the courts that are there.\n\n  We have had a real problem in Yellowstone National Park. The district \ncourt judge here in Washington decided to move back again on something \nthat we thought was resolved. The Park Service had asked for relief \nfrom Judge Sullivan's December order because it would have left an \nimpossible decision. It then moved back to a Wyoming court where it \nbelonged, a Federal circuit court, of course. So now we find ourselves \nwith 2 years of indecisiveness which means we have not made a decision. \nPeople don't know whether they can go into Yellowstone Park in the \nwinter.\n  I have introduced legislation that would limit the ability of \nindividuals to venue shop. Federal land issues arising in a particular \nState ought to go to that circuit court in which the Federal judges \nthere are involved. These Federal judges have the same qualifications \nas anywhere else, and that is what Federal courts are for. That is why \nwe have different venues. So it is important. Access to public lands is \nvery important to our State and certainly we need to exercise the \nsystem that has been set up.\n  The Federal judiciary is a system of circuits. Wyoming is in the \nTenth Circuit. Unfortunately, this system now allows people to go \naround the Tenth Circuit and go to another place where they think they \nwill have better success.\n  My friend from Montana is here. I hope and I am pushing for a bill \nthat says you ought to go to the circuit in which the problem arises \nfor the Federal court jurisdiction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7779-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             A ROCKY START\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, we all came back from our States after \nthe Fourth of July break knowing that we would be working on a short \ntimeline. Lots of legislation and policy has to be done before we end \nthis Congress and all go home and campaign for election and reelection. \nWe are off to kind of a rocky start. Not only do we not have a budget \nand the rules that we must abide by within a budget in order to proceed \nto appropriations and to make any sense out of the appropriations \nprocess, but we also do not have our appropriations process as being \nsort of supplanted, that we may have to take another tack in order to \npass them and keep the Nation's Government in business.\n\n  This week, we have witnessed that we are not really ready to pass any \nlegislation in this body. We, as 100 Senators, are concentrating on \nvotes and issues that lean to doing the business of a political party \nrather than doing the people's business, which we were sent here to do. \nThis is the people's forum. All people in this country expect us to get \nour work done. We have issues that are held up, yes, in policy, but the \nbusiness of financing this Government in a direction that faces the \nchallenges that we do at this time is also being held up.\n  I am sorry we could not move on to the class action legislation. It \nwas not the intent of this Senate to do that, as objections were thrown \nout that blocked the legislation no matter what the conditions were, \nlet alone amendments--no agreement on them or a timeframe in which to \nfinish the legislation.\n  This is important for small business. Class action is important for a \nState such as mine, because we are a State of small businesses. We \ndon't have any large corporations in the State of Montana. Lawsuits--\nand frivolous lawsuits--are just sapping the life out of the people who \nperform the services and deliver the goods for the rest of the \ncitizenry in the State of Montana. That is not being allowed to move \nforward. Under any condition, there is an objection. Are we heading \ntoward the small end of the tunnel whenever we get down to the end of \nthe session, and then everything breaks loose--issues, bills, and \narticles are moved much faster. Sometimes they move so fast there are \nsome unintended consequences.\n  I am disappointed that we don't finish our business. This is the \npeople's house. Issues are on the line. We are just wasting our time. \nIn fact, we are doing it to the point where we might as well be home, \nworking at home, and whenever we decide we want to do business, then we \nwill come back to town and complete the Nation's work.\n  It is incumbent upon all of us who share the same responsibility, not \nonly to our States but to this country, to complete the work at hand, \nproviding economic opportunities for more people, which we have done.\n  Look at the statistics. More people own homes now in the United \nStates than ever before in the history of this country, and the same is \ntrue about Montana. More people are working today than any other time \nin Montana history. We gained jobs in the last 4 years, when the rest \nof the country was struggling. We want to keep that trend going, \nexpanding. Yet we are held up here on issues that are very important in \norder to make sure that the expansion continues.\n  I appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It is time to \nmove from the frivolous discourse that we have heard in the last couple \nof weeks and this week, and get on with the business at hand and vote. \nLet the will of the American people be heard and done. It is our \nresponsibility. It falls on each and every one of our shoulders, and if \nwe are part of an obstructionist move, we must reassess our position \nand understand what is at stake.\n  I appeal to my colleagues. It is time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is this Senator allotted a certain amount of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday I stood before the Senate and \nnoted that it had been almost a full year since the identity of a \ncovert CIA agent was revealed in print by the columnist Robert Novak. \nIt has been 360 days and counting. Next Wednesday, it will be 1 full \nyear. It is time to ask, Why hasn't the White House cleared this up?\n  Madam President, 360 days have gone by since a CIA agent's name was \nrevealed by top White House officials. We know how agent Valerie \nPlame's coverage was blown. Back in September, the Washington Post \nreported that two senior White House officials called at least six \nWashington journalists and disclosed the identity of a covert CIA \nagent.\n  It has also become fairly clear why the agent's cover was blown. It \nwas part of an ongoing effort to discredit and retaliate against \ncritics of this administration, especially those who revealed that \nintelligence used to justify the war in Iraq was flawed or fabricated. \nNow Ms. Plame, as we know now, is married to former Ambassador Joseph \nWilson. Ambassador Wilson was sent on a factfinding mission to Niger to \nexamine claims that Saddam Hussein had sought to purchase uranium from \nthat nation. He found no evidence to support the claim. But President \nBush, nonetheless, made that claim in his State of the Union Address.\n  How those famous 16 words read by the President to the listening \nNation about the efforts by Saddam Hussein to purchase uranium from \nNiger made it into the State of the Union Address remains a great \nliterary mystery. Who lied in President Bush's State of the Union \nspeech? We still don't know. We do know that Ambassador Wilson \npublished an article disputing the uranium claim in the New York Times. \nApparently to discredit and punish Mr. Wilson, senior White House \nofficials leaked the identity of Wilson's wife and the fact that she \nwas a CIA operative.\n  One day Ms. Plame was a valued human intelligence asset; the next day \nshe was political cannon fodder. What we still don't know almost 1 year \nlater is who the senior White House officials responsible for this \ndestructive leak were. We still don't know who it was that gave this \nclassified information to the White House, to the leakers. Was it \nsomeone at the NSC? Was it someone at the CIA? Was it the same person \nwho made the decision to include the\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\nfalse claims about uranium from Niger in the State of the Union \nMessage?\n  Madam President, 20 years of training and experience and millions of \ndollars were invested in this agent. Leaking her identity violated the \nlaw and constituted a betrayal of this country. Yet, for all we know, \nthe person responsible for this betrayal could at this very moment \nstill be exercising a senior decisionmaking role in this \nadministration. This apparently is an administration where the buck \nnever stops, an administration where abuses occur, but no one at the \ntop is ever forced to accept responsibility.\n  In her 20-year career, Valerie Plame operated with unofficial cover, \nwhich means she had no diplomatic immunity. Effectively, her only \ndefense was a painstakingly created and maintained cover. She worked \nclosely with undercover operatives and a network of contacts. All were \npotentially placed in jeopardy and exposed to danger by the disclosure \nof her status.\n  Last November, we heard testimony from three former CIA experts. They \nall agreed on the far-reaching damage this disclosure represented for \nMs. Plame's broader network of contacts and for the intelligence \ncommunity as a whole. After all, what guarantee does any intelligence \nagent now have that they could not be the next victim of some \nadministration's smear campaign?\n  Vincent Cannistraro, former chief of operations and analysis at the \nCIA Counterterrorism Center, said of the Plame disclosure:\n\n       The consequences are much greater than Valerie Plame's job \n     as a clandestine CIA employee--they include the damage to the \n     lives and livelihoods of many foreign nationals with whom she \n     was connected and it has destroyed a clandestine cover \n     mechanism that may have been used to protect other CIA \n     nonofficial cover officers.\n\n  James Marcinkowski, a former CIA operations officer, seconded this by \nsaying:\n\n       The deliberate exposure and identification of Ambassador \n     Wilson's wife, by our government, was unprecedented, \n     unnecessary, harmful and dangerous.\n\n  Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst and State Department employee, \nsaid:\n\n       For this administration to run on a security platform and \n     allow people in the administration to compromise the security \n     of intelligence assets, I think is unconscionable.\n\n  No one in this Chamber, after listening to these three men, could \nhave any doubts about the damage this act has done to the relationship \nbetween the intelligence community and the administration. From all \nreports, the special prosecutor, finally appointed the day before New \nYear's, Mr. Fitzgerald, has been conducting a very aggressive \ninvestigation. He has issued subpoenas, called witnesses before a grand \njury, and interviewed the President and Vice President.\n  I inquired as to whether the President or Vice President were put \nunder oath. I am informed they were not. Now I find this more than \npassing strange that the previous President of the United States, \nPresident Clinton, when he was being questioned about his relationship \nwith a White House intern, was put under oath and filmed, and yet this \nPresident and this Vice President, the head of an administration where \npeople leaked the identity in clear violation of the law of a CIA \noperative, are interviewed; they are not put under oath; they are not \nfilmed. Would someone please explain the priorities?\n  In fact, the President has been kind of cavalier and dismissive of \nthis entire situation. In his only public statement about the leak, he \ntold reporters, and this is a direct quote from President Bush:\n\n       . . . I don't know if we are going to find out the senior \n     administration official. Now, this is a large administration, \n     and there's a lot of senior officials. I don't have any idea.\n\n  That is what George Bush said on October 7, 2003.\n  What I would like to know is, where is the President's outrage? Where \nis the recognition that this is not the same as leaking promising \nnumbers on the economy? Where is the President's fury that one of his \nown valuable intelligence assets has been destroyed? And what about the \nVice President? We know he can be relentless when he is on a quest for \ninformation to justify the case for the war in Iraq. Where is his \ndetermination to find the people who have destroyed the confidence of \nthe intelligence community in this administration?\n  All we hear from the President and the Vice President is silence on \nthis issue, as if they do not want to know who leaked this information, \nor they know and they do not want to be held accountable. In either \ncase, it is inexcusable for the President or Vice President.\n  The disclosure of Ms. Plame's identity represents an extremely \ndamaging breach of national security. She worked gathering human \nintelligence, exactly the type of intelligence we have heard over and \nover again since September 11, 2001 that is so critical to our fighting \nterrorism.\n  Only 2 days ago, National Public Radio reported on the fact that \nthere is a growing consensus on the need to improve our human \nintelligence capacity. There is a recognition that after years of \nincreasing reliance on intercepts and satellite imagery, only solid \nhuman intelligence can help us deal with the type of insurgency we face \nin Iraq in effectively fighting al-Qaida.\n  The other critical point that was made is that sending troops to a \ntraining course on intelligence gathering is not enough. According to \none CIA agent, he said it takes 10 years to season somebody as a case \nofficer in order to judge the information and the people they are \ndealing with, check on bona fides. That is the kind of asset Valerie \nPlame used to be, and, as Mr. Cannistraro pointed out, the damage that \nwas done was not only to her but to her network and potentially to all \nCIA human intelligence operatives.\n  One publication reported after reading of her own blown cover, Ms. \nPlame immediately sat down to make a list of all of her contacts and \nassociates who could be in jeopardy. I can only hope when we find out \nthe identity of this leaker or leakers, that person is forced to see \nthis list and be confronted with the full extent of their betrayal of \nthis country and our citizens.\n  Usually when the cover of agents like Valerie Plame is blown and \ntheir contacts placed in jeopardy, it is a result of espionage. The \nperpetrators, when convicted, face life in prison or even death. In \nmany ways, it is almost worse that this was done as an act of political \nrevenge. The disclosure of Ms. Plame's identity was unquestionably a \nvicious act of political intimidation and retribution, but it is much \nmore than that. It is part of a clear pattern of coverup, concealment, \nand contempt for the truth. That is why so much rests on the outcome of \nMr. Fitzgerald's investigation.\n  We need to identify and prosecute those responsible for this damaging \nepisode, and in so doing we need to send a clear message to the \nPresident and the Vice President that sacrificing intelligence assets \nand breaching national security is too high a price to pay for \nmaintaining the issue of deceit that was used to justify the war in \nIraq to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise this morning to talk about \nwhere we are going with our Nation's energy policy and what this body \nand the House of Representatives are going to do in protecting \nconsumers and ratepayers from continued market manipulation and energy \nfraud.\n  This morning, most of America woke up to a picture of one of \nAmerica's corporate leaders led off to an indictment in handcuffs. Yes, \nthat is right, Ken Lay from the Enron Corporation, while not found \nguilty today, was indicted on 11 different counts, including wire \nfraud, securities fraud, and making false and misleading statements. \nThe question is whether this 65-page indictment of Ken Lay, which does \nprove that no one is above the law, is going to bring justice to \nratepayers and consumers in America who have suffered from market \nmanipulation at the hands of Enron.\n  I say that because there are still about 10 States in America that \nhave utilities that are being sued by Enron. That is right, even though \nEnron has manipulated contracts, even though there are documents from \nFederal investigators showing that market manipulation has happened, \nEnron still has the audacity to sue utilities across\n\n[[Page S7781]]\n\nthe country forcing them to pay on fraudulent contracts. For the State \nof Washington there has not been an insignificant consequence for our \neconomy. The fact that people in Snohomish County had a more than 50-\npercent rate increase and have had that rate increase in place for some \ntime, shows the great impact it has had on our ability to keep jobs, \nkeep people in their homes with proper heating. Even the school \ndistricts have had challenges. Snohomish, Mukilteo, and Everett School \nDistricts have estimated that they will pay $2-plus million in energy \ncosts if their utility is forced to pay Enron. That money could go for \nhiring teachers, putting classroom materials together, and helping to \npromote programs under the No Child Left Behind Act, but at the same \ntime they are getting hit with exorbitant energy costs.\n  So my constituents want to know whether this 65-page indictment is \ngoing to lead to justice for Americans who have been impacted by this \nmatter.\n  Washington is not the only State. Nevada, the State of the Presiding \nOfficer who understands this issue well, has been impacted. There are \nStates in the Midwest. There are many utilities that cannot believe \nthat with all this information that has come about they are being asked \nto pay on these fraudulent contracts.\n  I think the question that Federal regulators ought to be asking \nthemselves, and those who are responsible for the indictment of Ken \nLay--I want to applaud the Department of Justice for doing the great \nwork they have done in actually bringing about this indictment today. \nBut the question becomes, How did Mr. Lay influence the rest of the \nregulatory process? If you are the Department of Justice you are \nbringing about justice to individuals believed to have manipulated the \nmarket, financial documents, or made false or misleading statements. \nThen is the Department of Justice not doing its job? The Securities \nExchange Commission, an independent organization that has basically \nhelped in producing this indictment, showing that there has been \naccounting fraud, aren't they doing their job? The question remains, \nWhy aren't energy regulatory officials doing their job. They are the \nones who are supposed to make sure there are just and reasonable rates \nand that there isn't market manipulation. And, basically, they have \nsaid you are right, there weren't just and reasonable rates as it \nrelates to manipulated contracts, but we are keeping those contracts in \nplace.\n  I raise the question this morning, with Ken Lay's indictment, whether \nin fact Mr. Lay did not have undue influence on the process of actually \nhelping to get FERC Commissioners on board, and influencing policy by \nsaying to them, stay the course with the California crisis and in the \nimpact it is having on western markets. Today, I say we definitely need \nrelief from these Enron contracts.\n  Still, Mr. Lay sent a letter to the executive branch basically \nsaying: I am attaching a list of potential candidates we think would do \nan excellent job on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nBasically, he went on in that document to then give a list of issues \nthat he thought were very important to consider for the Commission \nappointees that he thought would help influence the process. \nSpecifically, he talked about how basically the free market should \ncontinue to be allowed, that they should not push in the energy crisis \nfor a variety of resolutions.\n  In fact, he actually said one of the criteria should be: Willingness \nto abolish current native load preference under current tariffs. For us \nin the Northwest, right there he was lobbying the administration to \nsay, only appoint Commissioners to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission who are going to let us have our way, putting whatever Enron \npower on the grid that can go on the grid. If we are willing to pay to \nput Enron energy onto the grid and pay more money than the Bonneville \nPower Administration is willing to pay, nominate FERC Commissioners \nthat are going to let us do that.\n\n  He goes on to say that he wants to select people who are going to \nensure that there are free markets and open access, which is a concern. \nWhile he mentions orderly rules of the road, one of the issues has been \nwhether there have been any orderly rules of the road. I think that is \npart of the concern that we have with his indictment: how much did he \ninfluence the regulatory process?\n  A second thing came to light within the context of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. The committee performed an investigation of how much \nEnron did influence the Commission. In fact, after reviewing memos that \nhad been sent by Ken Lay to the Federal Government, to various \nindividuals, including his support for the nomination of two of the \nCommissioners, basically the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee said \nthat ``documents obtained indicate that Enron attempted to directly and \nindirectly influence the FERC investigation of the California markets \nand subsequent decisionmaking.''\n  So here we have Federal regulators that have been basically nominated \nand pushed by Ken Lay, and not in the normal, let's nominate somebody \nto head up an independent commission with such an important role for \nour economy and Government, way. He sent a letter basically with a \nlitmus test:\n\n       Support these people to be Commissioners of the FERC if in \n     fact they support this philosophy of continuing to let the \n     market go without the proper rules and regulations, and \n     basically let standard market design, something that this \n     body has had a lot of concern about, let that be the policy \n     of the day.\n\n  Well, one of our committees, the Government Affairs Committee, \nbasically found that Enron attempted to have direct and indirect \ninfluence upon FERC's investigation of the market; that they were \ntrying to lobby FERC, if you will, to do nothing about the California \ncrisis. I find that a very interesting connection in this particular \nissue, again, because my ratepayers are continuing to pay exorbitant \namounts for energy, being sued by Enron. They are on the hook for \nmillions more. Madam President, $122 million just from the utility in \nmy home county is what they want to get out of our ratepayers, when \nthey have admitted market manipulation. I find this interesting. The \nday that Ken Lay actually sent the letter to the executive branch was \nJanuary 8, 2001. In it, he is basically saying: I want to get \nCommissioners who think like Enron does. I want to get those people \nmaking these important policy decisions. Here are the policy decisions \nI think they should make. Make sure these markets continue to operate \nin the way that Enron likes.\n  I find it amazing because instead of Ken Lay doing his job on a daily \nbasis as a CEO, with oversight over an organization, he was lobbying \nfor FERC commissioners. Meanwhile, less than 2 days after Ken Lay \nwrites this letter we have audiotapes from Enron traders talking about \nthe ricochet scheme, which was selling power outside of California and \nthen selling it back in, doing that because it could get a higher \nprice.\n  So he writes this letter on January 8, and we have audiotapes on \nJanuary 18 of Enron discussing how they were manipulating the market \nusing the ricochet scheme. On January 23, about 2 weeks after he writes \nthis, there are tapes of Enron traders on the phone discussing how they \nare going to take a contract with a utility in my State, in Snohomish \nCounty, and jack up the price, lying to make them think there was a \nhigher demand for the power, and that way the county would pay more \nmoney.\n  Just after that, 2\\1/2\\ weeks after he sends this letter, there is \nanother audiotape where Enron traders are discussing how much money \nthey are going to make off of the Snohomish County deal and how they \nare going to account for it in two different ways, one at $10 million \nand the other at $20 million, just because that is the way they keep \nthe books.\n  Here is a CEO who is spending his time lobbying Federal regulators on \nhow they should not take a hard stance in California, how they should \ndo nothing about the crisis, how they should continue to let the free \nmarket work its will, and at the same time his own employees are on the \nphone talking about how to manipulate price and gouge consumers.\n  In fact, 2 days after this letter--sent on January 8--on January 10, \ntraders discuss whether they should lie to the Wall Street Journal \nabout their activities.\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\n  Here are the people who work for this company. He could have been \ndoing oversight of the people within his company and the market \nmanipulation, particularly since these individuals, executives of his \ncompany, had come before Congress basically telling everybody that they \nwere doing their job and that market manipulation was not occurring.\n  I have a great deal of concern about whether this indictment of Ken \nLay is going to bring justice for the American people and the \nratepayers. Again, I applaud DOJ for getting the indictment, but the \nquestion is whether people who are still being impacted by this crisis \nare going to get relief.\n  What does Chairman Pat Wood of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission say about Enron? At the time this happened, Pat Wood \ncontinued to be, I guess, a market-oriented person even though the \nderegulation experiment in California had proven to be ill-fated, it \nwas proven people would take advantage and manipulate the market. The \npublication, Inside FERC, wrote that Pat Wood believed that ``the \nmarketmaking style created by Enron should be emulated by other \ncompanies and supported by regulators.''\n  This is after Enron's bankruptcy. Enron had gone bankrupt and we had \nthe chairman, supported by Ken Lay--we had the Federal regulator, who \nis the policeman on the beat supposedly protecting people--saying Enron \nshould be emulated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair. What else did Chairman Pat Wood say \nabout Enron and the market manipulation? I get that he thinks a market \nneeds to be open, but a market without transparency and a market \nwithout aggressive regulators to make sure they monitor for \nmanipulation is not a true market.\n  Pat Wood, again according to Inside FERC, shortly after Enron went \nbankrupt, said, While Enron may be a ``goner,'' . . . ``the innovation \nand entrepreneurial [spirit] that characterized this company remain . . \n. ''\n  I will hope Mr. Wood's observations have changed by today with the \n65-page, 11-count indictment of Mr. Lay. There are lots of things going \non here, and the entrepreneurial spirit that he thought existed in 2001 \nhas definitely been characterized in a different light today. It has \nbeen shown that market manipulation has happened and was perpetrated by \nEnron.\n  I think where we are is taking a closer look at a deeper philosophy \nof what Chairman Wood really believes. It is a philosophy, again, where \nChairman Wood of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was quoted as \nsaying:\n\n     . . . the new breed of energy company, in fact, is going to \n     be the only game in town 5 years from now.\n\n  That is his philosophy. This leads to the kind of hands-off approach \nfor which Ken Lay lobbied. And again, an approach that the Governmental \nAffairs Committee said Enron attempted to put in place through direct \nand indirect influence on the Federal energy regulators. This is \nbasically the policy I think got us into so much trouble in California, \nwithout regulators responding in due time. It is the same philosophy \nthat has gotten utilities in about 10 States in financial risk because \nEnron continues to sue them. Pat Wood is clear in his philosophy. He \nthinks that the Enron model is the only game in town and it is the way \nwe should proceed.\n\n  I can tell you, I don't think it is the only game in town. I don't \nthink we are doing enough on this matter. This body needs to take a \nfirm stand that market manipulation is wrong. It can't be just and \nreasonable. It can't be in the public interest. And it is not what we \nratepayers across the country should be forced to pay on.\n  Again, Pat Wood, Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, has said, ``We're doing the maximum we can do.''\n  We are doing the maximum we can do. He said that in January of this \nyear. In January of this year, while the utility in my State, in \nSnohomish County, was being the policeman on the beat, transcribing \naudiotapes, looking through documents, doing all the homework the \nFederal energy regulators should be doing. While Pat Wood was making \nthe same statement saying we are doing all we can do, my constituents \nin Washington State were proving there was a heck of a lot more to do \nto give ratepayers justice.\n  Again, I applaud what the Department of Justice has done in the \nindictment of Ken Lay. They are going to try to get to the bottom of \nthis story. But what my colleagues need to realize, and understand, is \nwe have an imbalance. We cannot have the Department of Justice doing a \ngreat job with its Enron task force and prosecution of various Enron \nexecutives on accounting and securities fraud. We can't have the SEC \ndoing a great job on making sure there are new securities regulations \nin place to make sure these violations don't happen again, and then \nhave the Federal energy regulators who are in charge of protecting \nratepayers fall down on the job. That is exactly what has happened. \nThey have fallen down on the job, they are not protecting ratepayers. \nWe are going to see that after this indictment we are going to continue \nto pursue this case in the Senate, if we have to, and in the House of \nRepresentatives, to make sure that all Federal agencies do their job, \nand they are giving justice to ratepayers who have been impacted by \nfraudulent contracts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7782-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2062, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2062) to amend the procedures that apply to \n     consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer \n     outcomes for class members and defendants, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist amendment No. 3548, relative to the enactment date of \n     the act.\n       Frist amendment No. 3549 (amendment No. 3548), relative to \n     the enactment date of the act.\n       Frist amendment No. 3550 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to commit), relative to the enactment date of the act.\n       Frist amendment No. 3551 (amendment No. 3550), relative to \n     the enactment date of the act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know that most in the Chamber, and those \nwho are in their offices, went home to their home States over the \nFourth of July break. It is always a treat for me to do that because, \nfrankly, I think I come from one of the most beautiful places in the \nworld. For me to go to California and get ``rooted'' in why I want this \njob, to protect that beautiful place, and to protect the people who \nlive there and to work for them, it is always a joy.\n  Constituents asked me: What are you going to be doing when you come \nback? They had asked me about a number of issues they cared about. They \nare worried about this economy. They say it is uneven. They point out \nthat college tuition is going up more than 20 percent. They are \nsqueezed. They point out that gasoline prices in our State are raging. \nIt is costing them more. They point out that their health care premiums \nare going up. They are worried about even keeping health insurance. \nSome of them do not have any.\n  Those on Medicare are very worried about what they view as a false \npromise of the administration's Medicare proposal which was supposed to \nbe so great for them in terms of prescription drugs. It turns out the \nthing is so bureaucratic and such a nightmare they cannot figure it \nout.\n  Not only that, they express shock when I tell them in that bill we do\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\nsomething outrageous, saying to Medicare, you cannot negotiate for \nlower prices for the people on Medicare. Constituents say: Wait a \nminute. Why does that make sense? If you are sitting across the table \nfrom someone and you represent 40 million senior citizens, you have a \ngood card in your hand that you can play. You can say, if you want to \nhave your high blood pressure medicine on our formulary, if you want to \nhave your heart medicine on our formulary, if you want to have an \narthritis drug on our formulary, you have to give us a better deal.\n  No, this administration and the majority in this body decided to tell \nMedicare they could not negotiate for lower drug prices for our \nseniors.\n  When I go home, people are flooding me with these questions. They are \nvery worried about Iraq. What is the plan? What is the plan to get more \nhelp there? Why are we spending so much there? Why aren't we focusing \non our problems at home? This is what I heard all over my State.\n  They ask: Senator, what is on the agenda when you get back? Which one \nof these issues are you going to take up? What about rail security? We \nare worried about that because we have a lot of Amtrak ridership in \nCalifornia. What about nuclear plant security? When are you doing more \nabout that? I have to tell them the truth; that is, I am not in charge. \nMy party is not in charge of the Senate. The Republican leadership has \nchosen, instead of putting any of those issues you have mentioned on \nthe agenda, they are taking up class action reform because there is too \nmuch forum shopping--at which point they look at me and ask, What?--and \nwe have to protect business from these consumer complaints.\n  They kind of look at me quizzically and say: There are other things \nthat mean a lot more to my family. Then they ask: What are you going to \ntake up after you take up class action reform? We are going to talk \nabout gay marriage. And they say: Well, wait a minute. Every day in my \nlife I have all these pressing issues; I thought the States handled \nthat issue. Well, I say, you are right; the States have always handled \nthat issue.\n\n  I find it amazing, given the Republicans are in charge of this Senate \nand they always believe in States rights and local control, they are \nnow going to bring up the issue of gay marriage, and not only take it \nup--it was taken up once before; Bob Barr in the House wrote the \nDefense of Marriage Act, and Bob Barr said that would take care of \neverything and still says it takes care of everything--but, no, they \nare going it take the most precious document known to human kind, the \nConstitution of the United States, and they are going to now talk about \nmarriage in the Constitution. In fact, marriage has been sacred in the \nvarious religions, along with the rules surrounding marriage, and the \nStates have handled marriage for years.\n  My constituents are completely confused. They have many worries. They \nhave many concerns. They are worried about the fact they are not \nrespected abroad. They are worried about this recovery that they see as \nvery wobbly. They see better corporate profits--although those seem not \nto be going as well--and they do not see the increases in their \nstandard of living.\n  If we look at the numbers, the increase in the take-home pay, when \nyou include inflation and the high cost of living, has only gone up \nabout 1 percent, while all the other issues have gone up over 20 \npercent, the issues people deal with every day.\n  Now I come back to Washington and I am called to a meeting in a \nsecret room in the Capitol. The press knows all about this. We are \ncalled to a secret room in the Capitol. We have to discuss the threats \nto our country. This is very serious stuff. Of course, I cannot go into \neverything that was said, but I can state what has been reported in the \npress, which is not classified. And that is, we need to be on the alert \nat home. We have known since September 11 that al-Qaida has cells in \nour country and that they never give up. If they fail, they go back \nagain. We know all this. We need to stay ahead of the threat.\n  That is why I am so proud to be on the Commerce Committee. I am so \nproud to have as part of the portfolio of the Commerce Committee, rail \nsecurity, aviation security, and port security. These are key issues. \nSince Madrid, for example, and the horrible bombing of the train there, \nwe need to be on our toes. That means we need to pass rail security \nlegislation.\n  This is the great news I have for my constituents and for all \nAmericans. At a time when we are in the middle of an election, where \nthere is a lot of disagreement, where we have even seen language that \nis prohibited to be used in the Senate being used by the Vice President \nof the United States--in other words, a time where emotions are running \nhigh politically--guess what happened on rail security. Every single \nmember of the committee voted for that bill--every single member. From \nliberal to conservative, to moderate, everybody voted for that bill. \nThat means we could easily take up that bill. That means we could \neasily pass that bill.\n  But what do we have before the Senate? Class action. The people who \nwant us to pass this bill say there is a lot of abuse and that we need \nto make sure we take these cases away from the States and put them more \ninto the Federal courts. Again, I find it unbelievable that we have a \nRepublican majority that keeps saying, States rights, States take care \nof it, States do it, but when they are not happy with the way it goes--\noops, forget that. As Roseanne Rosanna-Dana used to say, ``Never \nmind.'' Take it to the Federal court. Everyone knows what will happen \nthere.\n  A lot of these cases are very important. We remember Dalkon Shield \nwas one of those class action cases where women were dying. Not until \nthere was a class action lawsuit was that fixed. That does not mean \nthere aren't abuses. It does not mean that we cannot have reforms.\n  It does say to me that there is no crying need to take this up when \nwe are called to room 407 for a secret briefing about the threats that \nface this country before the election. It is extraordinary to me. And I \nbelieve the American people who are watching what we do here are \nthinking: What is the Senate doing about my life, about my family, \nabout what I need for my kids?\n\n  I went to a press conference on the minimum wage. Do you know the \nminimum wage has not been raised in 8 years? Every colleague here has \nhad a pay raise. For 8 years the minimum wage has not been raised. \nPeople are living below the poverty line. Mr. President, 61 percent of \nthose people happen to be women, many single moms. All we want is a \nchance to do that. We should do that by unanimous consent today. Why do \nwe need to debate it? Eight years long and no increase in the minimum \nwage, zero.\n  These are people who work hard. These are not mostly teenagers; these \nare grownups who are working hard to support their families on the \nminimum wage. The cost of living has gone up 14 percent in those 8 \nyears. The minimum wage has stayed stagnant. These people are falling, \nfalling, falling, falling--and we talk about family values here? And we \nare rushing to do a marriage amendment when the States are taking care \nof that?\n  My State has decided what it wants to do. They have a law. It is not \nperfect. It says there are domestic partnerships and they have rights \nand responsibilities. We could make it better. But do you know what. My \nState has taken care of this, thank you very much.\n  It is all about politics, folks, let's face it. For 5 minutes, why \ndon't we put aside politics and pass the minimum wage and help the \nmillions of people who need it to be done? What are we talking about? \nWe are talking about an increase, over a couple years, of $3,800 a year \nfor these people, who will still be below the poverty line. I bet if \nyou had a vote in this Senate, the way it is made up, to give more tax \nbreaks to the people making a million bucks a year, it would fly \nthrough here, it would fly through this place, even though those in the \nmillion-dollar range are already getting back hundreds of thousands of \ndollars a year. Imagine.\n  So every once in a while I come down to this Senate floor and I say: \nWhy am I here? What are we doing? Are we meeting the needs of the \npeople? And this is a perfect time to do it because there is a bill on \nthe Senate floor that not one person in my State, except\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\nhigh-paid lobbyists in very fancy suits, want to take up. This is true. \nThe things we should take up, the things we talk about in that room, \nthat secret room in the Capitol--making our rail systems safe, making \nour ports safe, making our buses safe--oh, no, we do not have time for \nthat because after we do this for the big businesses in this country, \noh, we are going to go on to gay marriage before the Democratic \nConvention so some people can cast a vote that might hurt them in their \nelection. Shame on us. We should be better than that as Senators. We \nshould be better. So I am going to give us a chance to be better.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2273\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \ncalendar No. 536, S. 2273, the Rail Transportation Security Act, that \nthe bill be read a third time and passed, and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from California \nthat in my capacity as a Senator from the State of Nevada, I object at \nthis time.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from California saying that we should be \nengaged on the Senate floor today on issues relating to homeland \nsecurity; that is, the security of the State of California, the State \nof Nevada, and the other 48 States, and that we should not be wasting \nour time on class action? Next we are going to go to a gay marriage \namendment. Would the Senator acknowledge no matter how strongly people \nfeel about this gay marriage amendment, it has no--zero--I am from \nNevada; I do not gamble personally, but I know a little bit about it, \nhaving been chairman of the Gaming Commission--it has zero chance of \npassing. None. It won't pass. And we are going to spend valuable Senate \nfloor time on an amendment that stands absolutely no chance of passing \nwhen we have at the desk the homeland security appropriations bill, and \nI have been told today we are not going to go to that until September.\n  Now, is the Senator saying we should not be doing class action, we \nshould not be doing gay marriage, we should be doing things that make \nmy family and your family and the rest of America safe from these evil \nterrorists?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend. It is obvious he sees \nit the way I see it.\n  We were called up to a secret meeting today to hear about all the \nthreats on our Nation. That is not an idle trip up to that room. If it \nis to mean anything, we better get busy. I meet with my local police \nand fire. Do you know what? When there is a terrorist attack, the White \nHouse does not get the call; the Senate does not get the call; the \nHouse does not get the call. They dial 911, and our local people--be \nthey in Nevada, be they in New Mexico, be they in California--get the \ncall. They are hurting.\n  The bill I wanted to get us to vote on today--and I have a couple of \nothers I am going to ask since we got objection to this one. The Rail \nTransportation Security Act--this is one that passed out of the \nCommerce Committee, I say to the assistant Democratic leader, \nunanimously. It is very important. I will tell my friend what it does. \nThe bill authorizes grants to all of our railroads and to hazardous \nmaterial shippers for freight and passenger rail security. It is a \ncritical bill.\n  We saw what happened in Madrid. You do not have to haul me up to any \nsecret room. The minute we saw that happen in Madrid, the Commerce \nCommittee, which the Presiding Officer of the Senate is on and \nparticipated in this, we for the second time voted in a unanimous \nfashion--100 percent of the committee--for this rail security bill. \nUnfortunately, there has been objection to it because the Republicans, \nwho control the Senate, are not interested in moving this bill.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2279\n\n  So I am going to give them a chance to move another bill, and that is \nthe port security bill. Port security is another bill that passed out \nof our committee without one dissenting vote. We know the problem at \nour ports. We have containers coming into them. They are not checking \nthem. We do not know who is going to be putting something in one \nof those containers. We are doing better, but we are not giving it the \nattention it deserves.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \ncalendar No. 530, S. 2279, the Maritime Security Act of 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair again informs the Senator from \nCalifornia that in my capacity as a Senator from the State of Nevada, I \nobject.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Ships coming into the United States today have on them \ntransponders. The purpose of that is so those people ashore can find \nout where the ship is and have a better idea of where they are. As we \nspeak, there are about 43,000 very large ships on our oceans--43,000. \nFor them to come to the United States, one of the requirements is they \nhave a transponder on them, like an airplane has, like the situation we \nhad a few weeks ago where the plane was coming into National and the \ntransponder was not working.\n  I say to my friend from New York, even though those ships have \ntransponders----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am from California. I was born in New York, but I am \nfrom California.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry?\n  Mrs. BOXER. You said: I say to my friend from New York. I was born \nthere, but I am from California and have been since I was 25 years old.\n  Mr. REID. We have only known each other 22 years.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know. When we have known each other 23 years, you will \nget it right, I know.\n  Mr. REID. So I say to my friend, there is a transponder on every ship \ncoming into the United States, but we do not have the equipment on \nshore to have the transponders picked up on shore. Why? Because we have \nnot spent the money to do it.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina has fought to have \nmoney placed in these bills so we can have the transponders on shore so \nwe can do what they do with airplanes, with ships.\n  Is the Senator aware we don't even do that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am quite aware we have not done what Senator Hollings \nhas long asked us to do. We have not done the work of homeland \nsecurity. There is a lot of talk. There are a lot of meetings. There is \na lot of yack-yack about it. But when it comes down to where we are \nputting the dollars and where we are putting the emphasis, we are on \nsome bill here I can honest to God tell you, not one person except a \nhighly paid lobbyist has ever talked to me about, class action. I can \nhonestly tell you, on the gay marriage, people have a lot of views in \nmy State, but they believe our State is handling that issue in a good \nway. So there is no reason to go to this.\n  In Madrid, 200 people died, 1,400 people were injured in that rail \naccident. And we go up to 407 up here and we hear all the talk about \nwhat we need to do. I am suggesting as a result of my unanimous consent \nrequests today, both being objected to, when you have this majority \nparty, it is very clear: there is a lot of talk, but there is no \naction.\n  That is a reason why people are disenchanted. It is the reason why \npeople want change around here. They want us to be strong at home. They \nwant us to be respected in the world. And it is time for many changes \nto occur. I am looking forward to those changes, to the day when we can \nvote these bills out of the Commerce Committee without one single \nobjection, and no one on the floor here would then object to taking \nthem up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor intending to talk \nabout an amendment I had prepared to offer to the class action \nlegislation, the underlying class action legislation. I think instead \nof getting into a discussion of that amendment, let me express my \ndisappointment that we are not doing anything this week here in the \nSenate.\n  I was asked last week, as I am sure all of us were by our \nconstituents, what are you doing in the Senate? What is\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\nCongress doing these days? I tried to answer honestly and said: \nNothing. We are treading water in the Senate. We are not doing \nanything.\n  I checked with the Parliamentarian about the procedural status we are \nin in the Senate this morning. I am informed this is the status: We \nhave S. 2062, which is this bill to reform class action procedures. \nThere is an amendment offered to that by Senator Frist, a perfecting \namendment. There is a second-degree perfecting amendment offered to \nthat. There is a motion to commit that has been made by Senator Frist. \nThere is a Frist perfecting amendment to the motion to commit, and \nthere is a Frist second-degree perfecting amendment to the first-degree \nperfecting amendment to the motion to commit. So the obvious question I \nput to the Parliamentarian is, what is there that is in order for us to \noffer at this time for the Senate to consider? The answer is, nothing. \nNothing is in order. The tree is full, as the parliamentary expression \ngoes, and nothing can be offered.\n  There is also a cloture motion that has been filed on the underlying \nmeasure. That would be a motion that will come to a vote presumably \ntomorrow to bring the debate on the underlying bill to a close. Of \ncourse, that motion will come up without Senators having been able to \noffer amendments. I would doubt seriously that that cloture motion \nwould prevail, but that would be a surmise. I don't know that that is \nthe case.\n\n  All of this procedural mumbo jumbo I am reciting in order to make the \npoint that there is no effort I am aware of to move ahead with a lot of \nthe important items that need to be dealt with in the Senate. The \nSenator from California raised a couple of those items that relate to \nhomeland security. There are many others also we could get unanimous \nconsent to move ahead on and that would be good policy initiatives that \nwould benefit our country. I am frustrated--as I am sure many Senators \nare--that we are in this circumstance. I am frustrated this week is \nessentially lost to any productive activity.\n  Next week I am informed we will be debating a constitutional \namendment on gay marriage. I concur with the comments of the Senator \nfrom Nevada that there is no chance the necessary two-thirds vote of \nthe Senate is going to be there to pass that constitutional amendment. \nThe Founding Fathers had great wisdom in saying, when you are amending \nthe Constitution, you can't just do it with a majority vote. You have \nto have a two-thirds vote. I can say with very little fear of \ncontradiction, there are not two-thirds of all Senators who favor going \nahead and passing a constitutional amendment at this time. So again, \nthat will be another wasted week next week.\n  We have one more week then, and then we are in recess for 6 weeks. \nThen we come back in the second week in September and presumably have a \nfew weeks of work there before we adjourn. I regret we are not able to \ndo more. I regret our procedural circumstance we find ourselves in \nprevents me from offering the amendment I had intended to offer. But I \nwill look forward to an opportunity to offer that amendment, if and \nwhen we get to a point where amendments are in order on this pending \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the second-degree \namendment to the motion to commit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to address a \nfew remarks made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle during \nyesterday's debate on the class action bill. First, they repeatedly \naccused the leader of jeopardizing the chances of getting this bill \npassed by filling in the amendment tree. Give me a break. That is the \nphoniest argument I have ever heard. The fact is, they are trying to \nkill this bill, and they are probably going to be effective in doing \nso.\n  I hate to give up--and I haven't given up yet--but that is what is \nhappening. I have been through it so many times around here that I know \nwhen there is a real desire to kill a bill. The way you do it is with \nnongermane amendments that are called killer amendments or poison \npills, because they are political amendments one side or the other does \nnot want. The leader filled the tree because he wanted to protect the \nbill from extraneous amendments that would eliminate any chances of \nthis measure becoming law. Anybody who argues otherwise is being \ndeceptive.\n  Everyone here knows the class action bill was an extremely attractive \nvehicle for extraneous amendments, especially those amendments that \nwere sure to be offered for the sole purpose of scoring political \npoints during an election year. But what my Democratic colleagues \nconveniently overlook is this bill will find itself in the recycle bin \nif it is saddled with a host of irrelevant amendments. While this is \ncertainly a win/win situation for those on the other side of the aisle \nwho oppose this bill, apparently including some of the Democratic \nleadership, I find it a truly puzzling outcome for those who say they \nsupport class action reform. Not only does a loaded bill risk peeling \naway Senate votes from the underlying class action measure, it will, in \nall certainty, undergo changes when it goes through the House. And what \nhappens then? Do we have a conference to resolve our differences? I \nthink the answer is a resounding no. I don't think the other side is \ngoing to permit this because this bill flies in the face of the demands \nof one of their greatest hard money constituent givers, and that is the \ntrial lawyers of America.\n  We all know there is little time left in this Congress to go through \nthe motion of doing a conference. I think the chances of getting a \nconference done in this election year with two conventions and with all \nthe problems we have to address. The appointment of conferees is \nfurther cast into doubt by virtue of the minority leader's threat \nearlier in the year to the appointment of conferees for the rest of the \nyear. So if you add these poison amendments to this bill, these \nextraneous amendments that have nothing to do with the bill, you are \nbasically killing the bill. Everybody knows that. The majority leader \nhad no choice other than to do what he did.\n  I certainly did not hear any assurances from the minority leader \nyesterday on whether he would consent to the appointment of conferees \nto this bill. As such, I am led to believe his position remains \nunchanged. But even if he did consent, I don't think there would be \nenough time to do a conference. We have 62 people who said they would \nsupport this bill. That means all 62 should vote for cloture so we can \nactually pass this bill. But unfortunately, we have some who agreed \nthey would vote for cloture--that was the whole reason for the \nagreement last November--and are now changing their minds and saying, \nwell, this is something I can't support because we want our colleagues \nto have their right to put poison pills on this bill.\n  (Mr. TALENT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, they cannot have it both ways. Let me be clear. It \nis because of the potential feeding frenzy that the leader moved to \nsafeguard the bill from an open season on nongermane, nonrelevant, \nextraneous amendments. He did it to advance the ball on this \nlegislation so it can be considered without the same initiatives we saw \nwith other measures that were considered by the Senate this year. He \ndid it with the hope of reaching a time agreement on amendments. He was \nnot being unreasonable. He even allowed one nongermane amendment the \nDemocrats have tried to get an up or down vote on all year, which \nmembers on this side feel is a terrible amendment. But probably it \nwould pass, who knows. At least some think it would probably pass. I \nthink there needs to be a substitute amendment to it that would \nprobably pass.\n  I want to remind my Democratic colleagues the majority leader made \nthree extremely generous offers regarding the consideration of germane \nand nongermane amendments.\n  First, he asked unanimous consent that amendments be limited to five \nrelated amendments to be offered by each side. So nobody would be \nforeclosed from offering the amendments they might think are important. \nWhen the minority leader objected to the offer, he expanded the request \nto include 10 related amendments on each side. I don't know how he \ncould have been more fair. When the minority leader rejected this even \nmore generous counterproposal, the majority\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nleader yet again expanded the agreement to include an unlimited number \nof related amendments. In other words, amendments that are pertinent to \nthe bill, that are at least germane. Again, the minority leader \nrejected this third offer. Of course, let us not forget each offer \nincluded an up-or-down vote on a nongermane amendment that the \nDemocrats demanded, which is an amendment by Senator Kennedy on the \nminimum wage.\n  We also heard yesterday that filling the amendment tree was \nunprecedented, and we are somehow committing a terrible wrong against \nthe institution of the Senate. How soon we forget the past. I remind my \ncolleagues that the minority leader filled the tree in October of 2002 \non the homeland security bill, which was even a more important bill \nthan this one, although this is an extremely important bill for this \ncountry. Mind you, he filled the tree after promising at the beginning \nof his tenure as then-majority leader he would never fill the tree. But \nhe did so, anyway. To be sure, we even saw Senator Byrd do it when he \nwas the majority leader. Unprecedented? Come on, give me a break. \nTerrible wrong?\n  Let us not hide behind Senate process in order to play both sides of \nthe fence on class action reform. I said it yesterday, and I will say \nit again today: S. 2062 represents a bipartisan agreement we reached in \ngood faith with key Democrats who say they support class action reform. \nWe agreed to a number of their amendments in order to get them to agree \nto vote for cloture. That was the agreement. And implied in that \nagreement was to vote down poison pill amendments that would kill the \nbill. Otherwise, they weren't sincere; we know they must have been at \nthe time, but they would not have been sincere in the bipartisan \nagreement we reached. We reached a compromise because I thought the \nultimate goal was to get class action enacted into law.\n  Let me be clear when I say my agreement to further moderate this bill \nwas in no way predicated on letting this legislation become a \n``Christmas tree'' for unrelated measures. This is never the way we \nhave done business around here. Our agreement was about getting class \naction reform enacted, and that is the very direction our leader is \nmoving us toward. I can only hope my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who say they support this bill can see that. A deal is a \ndeal. They should not break it because politically it might be in their \nbest interest to do so. That works both ways. We should not break it \nbecause politically it might be in our best interest to bring up \nextraneous, nongermane amendments and make them vote on them.\n\n  Another argument my colleagues on the other side raised repeatedly \nyesterday was the Judicial Conference and the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States are somehow opposed to this bill. I have heard this point \nmade over and over. I think it is about time to set the record \nstraight.\n  Let me start by saying Chief Justice Rehnquist has never written a \nletter, issued a statement, nor published an opinion that comes out in \nopposition to this bill. Rather, my colleagues who make this claim rely \non outdated letters from the Federal Judicial Conference espousing \nopinions on prior iterations of this bill--prior iterations, not the \nsame language of this bill.\n  On two prior occasions, the Judicial Conference expressed opposition \nto earlier bills, as offered in the 106th and 107th Congresses that \nwould have expanded Federal diversity jurisdictions over purported \nclass actions. But in March of last year, a substantial shift in \nposition occurred. In a March 26, 2003, letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Judicial Conference expressed its position on the bill \nby stating:\n\n       That Congress may decide to base a statutory approach to \n     remedy current problems with class action litigation by using \n     minimal diversity litigation. The Conference position \n     recognizes that the use of minimal diversity may be \n     appropriate to the maintenance of significant multi-State \n     class action litigation in the Federal courts.\n\n  The Judicial Conference also suggested employing provisions to raise \nthe jurisdictional threshold and fashioning exceptions that would \npreserve a role for the State courts in the handling of in-State class \nactions.\n  Senator Feinstein offered an amendment during the ensuing markup that \nwas directly responsive to these suggestions. Those changes were \nreflected in the version of the bill reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee in early April 2003.\n  Perhaps more important than what was said is what was not said. \nNowhere in the letter does the Judicial Conference express opposition \nto the bill now in consideration. I think this silence is deafening and \nspeaks for itself on where the Judicial Conference stands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the March 26 Judicial Conference letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I write to provide you with the \n     recently adopted views of the Judicial Conference of the \n     United States, the policy-making body for the federal \n     judiciary, on class action legislation, including S. 274, the \n     ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003,'' introduced by you and \n     other co-sponsors.\n       On March 18, 2003, the Judicial Conference unanimously \n     adopted the following recommendation:\n       That the Judicial Conference recognize that the use of \n     minimal diversity of citizenship may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts, while continuing to oppose \n     class action legislation that contains jurisdictional \n     provisions that are similar to those in the bills introduced \n     in the 106th and 107th Congresses. If Congress determines \n     that certain class actions should be brought within the \n     original and removal jurisdiction of the federal courts on \n     the basis of minimal diversity of citizenship and an \n     aggregation of claims, Congress should be encouraged to \n     include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so \n     that federal courts are not unduly burdened and states' \n     jurisdiction over in-state class actions is left undisturbed, \n     such as by employing provisions to raise the jurisdictional \n     threshold and to fashion exceptions to such jurisdiction that \n     would preserve a role for the state courts in the handling of \n     in-state class actions. Such exceptions for in-state class \n     actions may appropriately include such factors as whether \n     substantially all members of the class are citizens of a \n     single state, the relationship of the defendants to the forum \n     state, or whether the claims arise from death, personal \n     injury, or physical property damage within the state. \n     Further, the Conference should continue to explore additional \n     approaches to the consolidation and coordination of \n     overlapping or duplicative class actions that do not unduly \n     intrude on state courts or burden federal courts.\n       The Conference in 1999 opposed the class action provisions \n     in legislation then pending (s. 353; H.R. 1875, 106th Cong.). \n     That opposition was based on concerns that the provisions \n     would add substantially to the workload of the federal courts \n     and are inconsistent with principles of federalism. The March \n     2003 position makes clear that such opposition continues to \n     apply to similar jurisdictional provisions.\n       The Conference recognizes, however, that Congress may \n     decide to base a statutory approach to remedy current \n     problems with class action litigation by using minimal \n     diversity jurisdiction. The Conference position recognizes \n     that the use of minimal diversity may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts. The use of the term \n     ``significant multi-state class action litigation'' focuses \n     on the possibility of multi-state membership within the \n     plaintiff class. The actions to which this term applies are \n     nationwide class actions, as well as class actions whose \n     members include claimants from states within a smaller region \n     or section of the country. Minimal diversity in these cases \n     would facilitate the disposition of litigation that affects \n     the interests of citizens of many states and, through their \n     citizens, affects the many states themselves.\n       Parallel in-state class actions in which the plaintiff \n     class is defined as limited to the citizens of the forum \n     state are not included within the term ``significant multi-\n     state class action litigation.'' Parallel in-state class \n     actions might share common questions of law and fact with \n     similar in-state actions in other states, but would not, as \n     suggested herein, typically seek relief in one state on \n     behalf of citizens living in another state. Accordingly, \n     parallel in-state class actions would not present, on a broad \n     or national scale, the problems of state projection of law \n     beyond its borders and would present few of the choice of law \n     problems associated with nationwide class action litigation. \n     In addition, to the extent problems arise as a result of \n     overlapping and duplicative in-state class actions within a \n     particular state, the state legislative and judicial branches \n     could address the problem if they were to create or utilize \n     an entity similar to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict \n     Litigation, as some states have done.\n       Further, the position seeks to encourage Congress to \n     include sufficient limitations\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\n     and threshold requirements so as not to unduly burden the \n     federal courts and to fashion exceptions to the minimal \n     diversity regime that would preserve a role for the state \n     courts in the handling of in-state class actions. The \n     position identifies three such factors that may be \n     appropriately considered in crafting exceptions to minimal \n     diversity jurisdiction for class actions. These factors are \n     intended to identify those class actions in which the forum \n     state has a considerable interest, and would not likely \n     threaten the coordination of significant multi-state class \n     action litigation through minimal diversity. (The factors do \n     recognize certain situations where plaintiffs from another \n     state may be included in an otherwise in-state action.)\n       The first factor would apply to class actions in which \n     citizens of the forum state make up substantially all of the \n     members of the plaintiff class. Such an in-state class action \n     exception could include consumer class action claims, such as \n     fraud and breach of warranty claims. The second factor would \n     apply to a class action in which plaintiff class members \n     suffered personal injury or physical property damage within \n     the state, as in the case of a serious environmental \n     disaster. It would apply to all individuals who suffered \n     personal injuries or losses to physical property, whether or \n     not they were citizens of the state in question. The third \n     factor recognizes that it may be appropriate to consider the \n     relationship of the defendants to the forum state. Such \n     consideration is not intended to embrace the term ``primary \n     defendants'' (or a similar term), which language has been \n     used in past and present class action bills as part of an \n     exception to minimal diversity. Such a reading could extend \n     minimal diversity jurisdiction to cases in which a single \n     important defendant lacked in-state citizenship. While the \n     relationship of the defendant to the forum may have some \n     bearing on state adjudicatory power, an insistence that all \n     primary defendants maintain formal in-state citizenship is \n     too limiting and may preclude in-state class actions where a \n     defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum state, \n     regardless of citizenship.\n       We would appreciate your consideration of these comments \n     and the position of the Judicial Conference. Should you or \n     your staff have any questions, please contact Michael W. \n     Blommer, Assistant Director, Office of Legislative Affairs, \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, at (202) 502-1700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. To be sure, on the very day the bill was reported from \ncommittee, the ranking member sent letters to the Judicial Conference \nrequesting comments on the revised version of S. 274 as reported out of \ncommittee and further urging that the Judicial Conference propose \nalternative legislative language reflecting its views on how the \njurisdictional provisions should be structured.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of April 11, 2003, from \nSenator Leahy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2003.\n     Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n     Secretary, Judicial Conference of the United States, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Mecham: Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     approved S. 274; the ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003,'' \n     with several amendments. The bill, as amended, would \n     determine whether a federal court has jurisdiction over a \n     class action based on the fraction of the plaintiff class \n     members that are citizens of the same state as the primary \n     defendant.\n       I value the unique perspective of the Judicial Conference \n     regarding class action litigation. Therefore, I request that \n     the Judicial Conference provide Members of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee with its views on S. 274, the ``Class \n     Action Fairness Act,'' as reported out of the Committee \n     today, by April 25, 2003.\n       If you have any questions about this request, please do not \n     hesitate to contact Ed Pagano or Susan Davies of my staff. \n     They can both be reached at 202-224-7703. Thank you for your \n     assistance and continued insight on class action litigation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. In its April 25 response, the Judicial Conference noted \nthat the markup changes to S. 274 were responsive to its previous \ncomments about changing the jurisdictional threshold and preserving the \nrole of the State courts in handling State class actions. Indeed, the \nJudicial Conference expressed no opposition to the revised version of \nS. 274 reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Judicial Conference explicitly declined Senator Leahy's \ninvitation to propose alternative language. The Judicial Conference's \nresolution deliberately avoided specific legislative language out of \ndeference to Congress' judgment and the political process. The letter \nfurther noted that:\n\n       [T]hese issues implicate fundamental interests and \n     relationships that are political in nature and are peculiarly \n     within Congress' province.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of April 25, the Judicial \nConference response, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your letters of April 9, \n     2003, and April 11, 2003. In those letters, you requested \n     that the Judicial Conference provide the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee with legislative language implementing the Judicial \n     Conference's March 2003 recommendations on class-action \n     litigation and the views of the Conference on S. 274, the \n     ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003,'' as reported by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on April 11, 2003.\n       As you know, at its March 18, 2003, session, the Judicial \n     Conference adopted the following resolution:\n       That the Judicial Conference recognize that the use of \n     minimal diversity of citizenship may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts, while continuing to oppose \n     class action legislation that contains jurisdictional \n     provisions that are similar to those in the bills introduced \n     in the 106th and 107th Congresses. If Congress determines \n     that certain class actions should be brought within the \n     original and removal jurisdiction of the federal courts on \n     the basis of minimal diversity of citizenship and an \n     aggregation of claims, Congress should be encouraged to \n     include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so \n     that the federal courts are not unduly burdened and states' \n     jurisdiction over in-state class actions is left undisturbed, \n     such as by employing provisions to raise the jurisdictional \n     threshold and to fashion exceptions to such jurisdiction that \n     would preserve a role for the state courts in the handling of \n     in-state class actions. Such exceptions for in-state class \n     actions may appropriately include such factors as whether \n     substantially all members of the class are citizens of a \n     single state, the relationship of the defendants to the forum \n     state, or whether the claims arise from death, personal \n     injury, or physical property damage within the state. \n     Further, the Conference should continue to explore additional \n     approaches to the consolidation and coordination of \n     overlapping or duplicative class actions that do not unduly \n     intrude on state courts or burden federal courts.\n       S. 274, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     generally provides for federal jurisdiction of a class action \n     based on minimal diversity of citizenship if the matter in \n     controversy exceeds the sum of $5 million, exclusive of \n     interest and costs. (S. 274 as introduced established a $2 \n     million minimum amount in controversy.) The bill also now \n     permits a federal district court, in the interests of \n     justice, to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a class \n     action in which greater than one-third but less than two-\n     thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in \n     the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the \n     state in which the action was originally filed. The court \n     would be required to consider five specified factors when \n     exercising this discretion. (This discretionary provision was \n     not included in the bill as introduced.)\n       In addition, S. 274 as reported provides that the federal \n     district courts shall not have original jurisdiction over any \n     class action in which: (A) two-thirds or more of the members \n     of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate and the \n     primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the \n     action was originally filed; (B) the primary defendants are \n     states, state officials, or other governmental entities \n     against whom the district court may be foreclosed from \n     ordering relief; or (C) the number of members of all proposed \n     plaintiff classes in the aggregate is less than one hundred. \n     As introduced, the second and third exceptions were the same, \n     but the first one originally precluded federal jurisdiction \n     where ``the substantial majority of the members of the \n     proposed plaintiff class and the primary defendants are \n     citizens of the State in which the action was originally \n     filed'' and ``the claims asserted therein will be governed \n     primarily by the laws of'' that state. The replacement \n     language in essence substitutes a numerical ratio for \n     ``substantial majority'' and eliminates the choice-of-law \n     requirement.\n       We are grateful that Congress is working to resolve the \n     serious problems generated by overlapping and competing class \n     actions. The Judicial Conference ``recognizes that the use of \n     minimal diversity of citizenship may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts.'' At the same time, the \n     Judicial Conference does not support the removal of all state \n     law class actions into federal court. Appropriate legislation \n     should ``include sufficient limitations and threshold \n     requirements so that federal courts are not unduly burdened \n     and states' jurisdiction\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\n     over in-state class actions is left undisturbed.'' Finding \n     the right balance between these objectives and articulating \n     that balance in legislative language implicate important \n     policy choices.\n       Any minimal-diversity bill will result in certain cases \n     being litigated in federal court that would not previously \n     have been subject to federal jurisdiction. The effects of \n     this transfer should be assessed in determining the \n     appropriateness of various limitations on the availability of \n     minimal diversity jurisdiction.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The Judicial Conference concluded its letter by stating:\n\n       We are grateful that Congress is working to resolve the \n     serious problems generated by overlapping and competing class \n     actions.\n\n  Finally, another piece of evidence that counters the Judicial \nConference's purported opposition to the class action bill is Chief \nJustice Rehnquist's 2003 year-end report on the Federal judiciary. \nWhile this report criticizes various legislative measures considered by \nthe Congress, absolutely no mention is made of class action reform \nefforts.\n  I suppose this begs the question then, if the Judicial Conference and \nChief Justice Rehnquist stand opposed to this bill, why is there no \nreference to such a measure in their year-end report?\n  Again, I think the silence speaks for itself. I ask my colleagues to \nrefer to the 2003 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary which can be \nfound easily enough on the Supreme Court's website.\n  Mr. HATCH. With all of this said, is it credible to suggest that the \nJudicial Conference, much less the Chief Justice of the United States, \nstands somehow opposed to the class action bill? I think not.\n  I will refer to this ``myth'' chart. The myth is that the Federal \nJudicial Conference opposes the Class Action Fairness Act.\n  These are the facts: The Conference's opposition was directed at \nclass action bills in previous Congresses. In March 2003, the \nConference strongly criticized the current class action system and \nsuggested several areas to modify the Class Action Fairness Act.\n  After the Class Action Fairness Act was modified during markup, the \nConference declined an invitation to criticize or revise the version \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee and thanked the Senate \nfor its efforts to clean up the State court class action mess.\n  That certainly rebuts everything that was said on the floor yesterday \nand today by those who are looking for any excuse they can to scuttle \nthis bill. Unfortunately, some of them are people who have agreed to \nsupport the bill. That seems apparent to me. I hope it is apparent to \nall of those in the various States who have relied on these agreements, \nand at least this agreement made last November, that we would at least \nvote for cloture. That was the whole issue. Then, of course, they could \nstill have any amendment they wanted to bring up that would be germane, \nand they might even be able to bring up nongermane amendments if they \ncould get a supermajority vote on them. So nothing would stop them from \nat least an attempt to bring up nongermane amendments.\n  I would like to also reply to comments made yesterday in defense--can \nanyone believe it?--of Madison County, IL. I heard suggestions that the \nMadison County court is not as renegade as we have portrayed it. After \nall, the number of certifications has not escalated at the same rate as \nthe number of cases brought.\n  Now, this fact may have some appeal on its surface but when one looks \nat why the certifications are so low, I think they will find themselves \nright back to the inescapable conclusion that this court is a downright \nembarrassment to our civil justice system. Any attempt to defend \nMadison County's record on class certification must account for the \nnumber of class actions that were not certified because the defendants, \nknowing that the judicial deck was stacked against them, simply \nconceded defeat and settled rather than go through the motion of \ndefending their lawsuit in this court.\n  As I said yesterday, the plaintiffs' lawyers who descend on this \nsmall rural courthouse in southwestern Illinois know class \ncertification is a sure thing and that all they need to do is come up \nwith a complaint in order to extort a settlement from the unfortunate \ndefendants. These settlements come well before the class certification \nphase of the lawsuit and is exactly why this court is so attractive to \ngreedy, dishonest lawyers--greedy, flagrantly dishonest lawyers--\nlooking to make a quick buck, money hungry lawyers looking to buy their \nnext Gulfstream at the expense of everyday Americans such as Hilda \nBankston, dishonorable lawyers looking to pay off their next \nmultimillion-dollar mansion in Palm Beach, FL, at the expense of \nshattering public confidence in our civil justice system, and \nunscrupulous lawyers seeking to fund the next campaign of a State court \njudge who can tilt the playing field for them in yet another magnet \njurisdiction.\n  There is something clearly rotten in middle America, and when it \ncomes to Madison County, there is only one way to describe it: If you \ngo there, they will pay. If someone is brought in as a defendant there, \neven though they do minimal business in that State, they are going to \npay.\n\n  Finally, I would like to respond to the wild accusations from the \nother side of the aisle that the Republicans are trying to kill this \nbill because the measure does not go far enough to achieve class action \nreform. Give me a break. I do not think this accusation merits a real \nresponse, other than to observe that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will resort to just about anything in order to justify their \nvote against this bill, in order to justify this filibuster against \nthis bill.\n  Despite all the rhetoric we have heard from the other side about how \nthey support class action reform, about how terrible this system has \nbecome and about how we have a modest bill that fixes the problem, we \nwill know their true colors when we vote on cloture either tonight or \ntomorrow.\n  It makes absolutely no difference whether Senators vote no because \nthey oppose the bill or because they want to preserve the sanctity of \nthe Senate process. A vote against cloture is a vote against class \naction reform. It does not get any simpler than that.\n  By the way, how can they make that argument when they have a right to \nbring up any amendment they want to after cloture is invoked? True, \nnongermane amendments will have to have a supermajority vote to pass, \nbut all germane amendments only have to have a majority vote to pass. \nHow can they make these types of clownish arguments?\n  To make a long story short, it is apparent that sometimes money does \ncount around here, and the only reason this thing is fought so hard is \nbecause the major funding institution in this country happens to be the \ntrial lawyers for those on the other side of the aisle.\n  Now, what galls me is that last November, when we had 59 votes for \ncloture, 1 less than was necessary to end the debate, we then made all \nkinds of concessions to three more Democrats--and I think the business \ncommunity knows who they are--that are now in this bill to get their \nagreement that they would vote for cloture when the time came. There \nwas no misunderstanding. Everybody knew there would be an attempt to \nload this bill up with poison pill amendments or killer amendments, if \none wants to call them that. It meant that we at least go to cloture \nand get 62 votes for cloture, and I believe it meant more than that.\n  I think when we make a deal, those who enter into that deal agree to \nsupport the bill, against all amendments, unless we can agree \notherwise. Unfortunately, that is not the interpretation of some who \nagreed to the deal last November. But there could be no \nmisunderstanding. Their agreement last November was to vote for \ncloture. The whole issue was we lacked one vote in putting this bill \nbefore the Senate as a whole and letting it have its day in court, so \nto speak, in a court that is much more fair, much more balanced, and \nmuch more considerate than the courts in Madison County, IL.\n  There is no excuse for the arguments that have been made by the other \nside. If this bill goes down because we cannot get 60 votes for \ncloture, then shame on those who entered into the agreement with us. It \nwas not an easy agreement for some of us because we had to make changes \nthat literally some of us would not have made otherwise. So anybody who \nsays this side does not want this bill to go forward is being less than \ncandid, and I will put it in those terms, although I think probably \nmore stark terms would be acceptable.\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\n  This is an important bill. This bill will correct some of the major \nwrongs in our society from a litigation standpoint. This bill is fair. \nIt is not going to stop truly in-State lawsuits from being tried, even \nin Madison County, but this bill does correct some tremendously rotten \nsituations in our country. It also would be supported by decent, honest \nlawyers throughout the country, at least lawyers who do not always \nthink of the almighty dollar as the only reason they are practicing \nlaw.\n  This is a very important bill. There are a lot of great trial lawyers \nout there who I believe are embarrassed by some of the arguments that \nhave been made by my Democratic colleagues. There are a lot of great \ntrial lawyers who do not need phony courts, or dishonest courts, or \ncourts that go way beyond reasonability, or courts that favor them, or \nmagnet courts to win their cases. Great lawyers are going to be able to \nwin their cases whether they are in State court or Federal court. In \nfact, I suggest they probably have an easier chance in Federal court \nbecause people automatically think those courts are more august and the \ncases more serious.\n  But here we have a case where true advantage is being taken of the \nclass action system by a limited number of lawyers in our society who \nare getting fabulously wealthy and rich because of forum shopping to \ncourts like the Madison County court that are going to find for the \nplaintiffs no matter what the law or the facts say. That is wrong. When \nplaintiffs are right, they ought to recover, but when they are not \nright, they should not recover. The courts ought to be the bulwark of \nstanding for what is right and not what is wrong. In the political \nsystem that exists in Madison County, IL, it is a system that, if it is \nnot corrupt, it is the closest thing to it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for being \nwilling to assume the chair for a few minutes so I could make a brief \nstatement about the bill pending before us. I want to say, as I \nlistened when I was in the chair, I appreciated his eloquence on behalf \nof the bill.\n  The Senate will realize pretty soon that I have a bit of a cold. If I \npause to take a sip of water now and then, it is not for the dramatic \neffect but so I can finish the statement.\n  I had originally not intended to say anything about the legislation, \nalthough I support it. Anybody who has gotten around their States and \nheard about the destructive impact of abusive lawsuits on jobs and \neconomic growth has to support doing something. I was not planning to \nspeak on it, but the other night I was presiding when this debate \nbegan, and I was fortunate to hear Senator Carper from Delaware give \none of his initial remarks. I don't think he realized I was listening \nas I was presiding because I was doing a little paperwork, but I did \nlisten.\n  I heard him give examples of abuses of class actions that have \noccurred around the country, items such as a class action lawsuit in \nIllinois against a bottled water giant named Poland Spring which \nclaimed that the company's water wasn't pure and wasn't from a spring. \nUnder the settlement the consumers received coupons for discounts on \nthe water. The company didn't agree they had done anything wrong, \ndidn't agree to change the water, and all the plaintiffs got were \ncoupons to buy more of the water they were complaining about. But their \nattorneys got $1.35 million.\n  In a Texas class action settlement with Blockbuster over late fees on \nmovie rentals, class members received coupons for more movie rentals. \nThe attorneys received $9.25 million. I don't know how my family missed \nout on those coupons--I guess because we didn't live in Texas.\n\n  I could go on, but Senator Carper made the point that there was \nobviously a need to remedy these abuses and a need to do that without \nundermining the efficacy of the class action lawsuit in principle. In \nother words, we need to be able to have class action lawsuits because \nsometimes a whole lot of people will be done a small wrong. Each of \nthem will experience some wrong that is so small it is not worthwhile \nfor any one individual to sue, so if they can get together in a class \nwe can remedy that wrong and the attorneys can get reasonable \nattorney's fees.\n  But when there is, in fact, no remedy for the plaintiffs, when there \nmay have been no wrong, and when there are these outside attorneys' \nfees, it is obviously something unjust because it is unjust to make \npeople pay when they have not done anything wrong and it is not very \ngood for the rest of us.\n  We all know how it works. Those awards are paid and then it is passed \nalong in the form of higher prices or fewer jobs. Senator Carper's \npoint was it should not be all or nothing at all. We should not have to \nhave a system where either we have no class action remedies or we allow \nthese abuses to continue year after year. There is no reason in \nprinciple why we should not be able to fix the abuses while keeping the \nremedy.\n  He is right. There is no reason in principle we should not be able to \ndo that. There are people of good will on both sides of the aisle who \nwant to do that. There is obviously a solid majority of the Senate who \nwants to do that. Yet year after year, we do not do that. Why?\n  It was his speech and my thinking about it that led me to decide to \ncome down here and make a statement because I think I know the reason \nwhy. It is because of the filibuster, or more precisely it is because \nof the way the Senate allows the filibuster to be conducted.\n  This principle of filibusters is actually a pretty good thing. I \nthink if a determined minority in any legislative body believes \nsomething is really bad, it makes sense to give them some remedy to \nstop that legislation from passing. In fact, I submit to you that the \nfilibuster has been consistently abused in the Senate. Why has that \nhappened? Because the discipline on the filibuster is public \naccountability. The public doesn't like obstructionism for its own \nsake. If they see that happening, they will not like it; and if the \nAmerican people do not like something happening here and focus on it, \nit tends to stop. I have been around here long enough to see that.\n  But because of the way the filibuster is conducted in this body, it \nis almost invisible. Therefore, the people do not know it is happening, \nand therefore there is no accountability. That is why we have the \nabuses of it. Why is it invisible? In the Senate, in the first place, \nas you know, the passage of a bill requires many different steps: the \nintroduction of the bill, assignment to a committee, first and second \nreadings, and all of that.\n  In most legislative bodies, those steps are pro forma. In the Senate, \nmany of those steps are debatable. And anything that can be debated can \nbe filibustered.\n  The classic idea of a filibuster, as in ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' with final passage of some bill, people speaking all \nnight to prevent it from being voted on doesn't have to happen in the \nSenate. You can filibuster a bill on any number of points. You can \nfilibuster it after it has passed to keep it from going to conference. \nThe public doesn't know what is happening.\n  The second and bigger reason is that in the Senate, as all of us here \nknow--and I think the public may be beginning to realize--you don't \nhave to talk to filibuster.\n  I have served now in my third legislative body. It is a tremendous \nhonor to serve here. The pinnacle of the legislative career is to serve \nin the Senate. In most legislative bodies, when people are finished \ntalking about the proposition that is pending, you vote on the \nproposition.\n  Many times I have sat in the Chair where the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah is now sitting. When the last speaker has finished some \neloquent set of remarks, I have asked, Who seeks recognition? And \nnobody seeks recognition. It doesn't mean we vote. It means we go to a \nquorum call, as we did a little while ago. You don't have to speak\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\nto filibuster. You don't have to debate. You just have to decline to \nagree that debate will end. Unless everybody here either agrees to a \nunanimous consent agreement, or vote by a 60-vote majority to end \ndebate on a cloture motion, which itself is a rather clumsy way to end \ndebate, the debate goes on and on.\n  To allow a filibuster in that way, and make it so invisible, tends to \nempower the extremes in a legislative body in any given proposition.\n  In most legislative bodies the power in any given proposition, once \nit reaches the floor of that body, belongs in the middle. It makes \nsense, doesn't it? Because to pass it you have to have the middle with \nyou, typically. But here the filibuster empowers those folks who like \nconfrontation most. I am not running them down. Every legislative body \nhas to have people whose instinct is to say: I am not going to give in. \nI am going to stand up for this. I believe in this, or I think it is \nwrong, or I think it is right, and I am not going to give in much. It \nis important to have those folks in a legislative body. But you can't \nhave them running the whole show all the time. It empowers those \npeople. It tends to educate people to the temper of partisanship.\n\n  It is so tempting when you are in the minority to stop everything \nthrough the invisible filibuster and then blame the majority for not \nbeing able to pass something. That happens in this whole Congress. I \ndon't blame my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  It is so tempting it would require almost a heroic effort, \nparticularly given how divided the country is on a partisan and \nphilosophical standpoint, for them not to have done that.\n  The way the Senate does it makes interest groups more militant. This \nbill is a classic example of that. Everybody who looks at this issue \nknows that we have problems with litigation, at least in certain areas. \nWe have problems in State class action abuses. We have problems with \nthe whole asbestosis system which is driving dozens of big companies \ninto bankruptcy and reducing the number of deep pockets that are \navailable to pay for people who really are sick and have asbestosis. We \nclearly need reform in these areas.\n  What would happen if the process was healthier is that our friends in \nthe personal injury bar would know that something was going to happen \nand would sit down and negotiate, and we would come up with a moderate \nbill, I think, probably pretty similar to what we have before us today. \nWe would pass it more or less by consensus. But what do you do when you \nhave this filibuster? You can just say no. You can say it doesn't \nmatter how bad it gets, we are going to pressure and lean on those in \nthe Senate who are generally with us philosophically, and we will stop \neverything from happening. We are empowering the tactically more \nextreme in this body. We are educating people to the temper of \npartisanship. We are driving interest groups, which are pretty militant \nanyway, to be even more extreme. Then we are gumming up the few bills \nthat do pass because now, if you are sitting here and you have some \nconstructive measure you are trying to pass, and you know the only \nlegislation that is going to get through this body this year is the \ndefense authorization, let us say, or the tax relief bill for \nmanufacturers that we have to pass--because if we don't pass it we are \ngoing to get increasing trade sanctions all over the world--if these \nare the two or three bills you know you are going to pass, what do you \ndo? You take your constructive measure which you have wanted to pass \nfor months but can't because nothing else is going through the Senate, \nand you say: Well, that train is leaving the station and maybe none of \nthe others are, so I am going to put my bill on that.\n  You use the opportunity to offer nongermane amendments, which \npersonally I like and support. So you offer all kinds of amendments \nthat are completely unrelated to the bill before you just because you \nknow it is the only opportunity you are going to have to pass anything.\n  Then the public wonders how we get immigration bills on class action \nreform bills, or how I did this: I put a bill that I believe in very \nstrongly to help fight sickle cell disease on a tax relief bill for \nmanufacturing, and I would do it again. But that is because of the way \nwe are running this place.\n\n  What is the effect? It affects everything that gets filibustered. We \nhave seen filibusterss so far in this Senate and in this Congress on \nthe Energy bill, medical malpractice reform, the welfare bill, a number \nof judges, the asbestosis bill, the class action bill, and a number of \nother bills which are slow-walked through--the highway bill, the JOBS \nbill, the faith-based bill. And that doesn't even count all the bills \nthat aren't even brought up because the leadership knows they are going \nto be filibustered.\n  Nobody is ever held accountable. The public wonders why the Senate \ndoesn't work.\n  I am going to say something. I get around this town and I get around \nMissouri. I am afraid that we are being held in increasingly low \nregard. I am afraid the Senate is being reduced to its constitutional \nminimum of authority and effectiveness in this town. We are like a big \nroadblock. Ideas don't come out of here and go places. It is like the \ncommercial about the roach motel. They check in but they don't check \nout. That is what happens here. The legislative ideas check in and they \nnever check out.\n  I know some people say that is a good thing. We don't want anything \nto pass.\n  I just sat down this morning preparing these remarks and I made a \nlist of the things which I think we are going to have to address. This \nis a top 10 list: Keep America strong; a long-term solvency issue \ninvolving Social Security and Medicare--I am on the Aging Committee. I \nwill go into that more in a moment. The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, \nhas spoken eloquently on those issues.\n  The rising cost of health care is a problem, shortage of oil and \nnatural gas, need for alternative energy sources to protect our energy \nindependence and security, the failing electricity transmission grid in \nall parts of the country, the need to renew the distressed and urban \nneighborhoods, a burgeoning immigration system, a crumbling \ntransportation infrastructure system, shortages of water in parts of \nthe country, contamination of water resources, management of federally \nowned natural resources, and a policy we are going to take regarding \ndefense both in the war on terror and also the potential rising power \nof competitors, such as England and China.\n  This is the top 10 list. I am not even counting the more divisive \nissues or the cultural issues on which it would be nice if we could \nwork them out and be able to act. Some of these problems may go away on \ntheir own. I am a believer in that.\n  America is a great country. Maybe if we do not do anything, some of \nthem are going to go away. But they are not all going to go away. Some \nof them are going to get worse. We cannot solve any of them without \nsome element of participation by the Federal Government. Maybe it is \njust reform of regulations to allow people in the country to solve the \nproblem.\n\n  We are going to have to have Federal participation. That will \nrequire, at some point, a Senate that works better than the Senate is \nworking now. We have reached the point where the paralysis in this body \nis threatening the welfare of the people. Some may say--and I heard it \nsaid with response to the motion for cloture--respect for the \ntraditions of the Senate means we cannot do anything about this. \nEveryone who has been here a while, and I have not been here a while, \ntells me that never before has the filibuster been taken to this \ndegree.\n  If we were to apply a corrective, we would be restoring rather than \noverturning the traditions of this great body. And it is a great body. \nIt is a privilege to be here. I don't know that I have ever worked with \nas motivated and passionate and intelligent a group of people. I call \non Members on both sides of the aisle to consider carefully whether it \nis not time to change our practices in a way that permits us to work \ntogether, that encourages those who seek compromise solutions to the \nproblems facing the country. Not to do so would be a historic \nabdication of the responsibilities of this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will speak in a moment about this \nclass action bill and why I oppose it. I want to start by noting my \nstrong disagreement with the procedural tactics used by the majority to \nblock amendments to the bill. I have some familiarity with the strategy \nof filling the amendment tree. This was done time after time, year \nafter year, when campaign finance reform legislation was brought to the \nSenate floor. This is the procedure that is used to block the Senate \nfrom working its will on a bill.\n  The Senate has a long tradition of an open process for amendments. \nAny Senator has the right under our rules to offer any amendment to any \nbill. That is how the Senate works. It is amazing to me that the \nmajority leader would engage in this tactic when he has not only \nmajority support for the bill, but a supermajority in support.\n  Democratic supporters of the bill thankfully are not prepared to \nblock their colleagues from offering amendments. So I guess it appears \nthat this bill is going to be sacrificed in order to prevent amendments \nfrom being offered. I commend my Democratic colleagues who support this \nbill for not being intimidated by the arguments made on the Senate \nfloor that they somehow are breaking their agreement by standing up for \nthe rights of their colleagues to offer amendments. From the very \nstart, it was clear that these Senators had agreed to support the \nmotion to proceed in order to get the bill to the floor of the Senate \nand to vote for cloture, if that motion was again filibustered. They \nnever agreed to vote against all amendments or to block all amendments.\n  Turning to the bill itself, I oppose the Class Action Fairness Act, \nS. 2062, and I will vote against the bill.\n  The main reason for my opposition is that notwithstanding its title, \nI do not think this bill is fair. I do not think it is fair to citizens \nwho are injured by corporate wrongdoers and are entitled to prompt and \nfair resolution of their claims in a court of law. I do not think it is \nfair to our State courts, which are treated by this bill as if they \ncannot be trusted to issue fair judgments in cases brought before them. \nI do not think it is fair to State legislatures, which are entitled to \nhave the laws that they pass to protect their citizens interpreted and \napplied by their own courts. This bill is not only misnamed, it is bad \npolicy. It should be defeated.\n  Make no mistake, by loosening the requirements for Federal diversity \njurisdiction over class actions, S. 2062 will result in nearly all \nclass actions being removed to Federal court. This is a radical change \nin our Federal system of justice. We have 50 States in this country \nwith their own laws and courts. State courts are an integral part of \nour system of justice. They have worked well for our entire history. It \nis hard to imagine why this Senate, which includes many professed \ndefenders of federalism and the prerogatives of State courts and State \nlawmakers, would support such a wholesale stripping of jurisdiction \nfrom the States over class actions. By removing these actions to State \ncourt, Congress would shift adjudication away from State lawmakers and \nState judges towards Federal judges, who are often unfamiliar with the \nnuances of State law. In my opinion, the need for such a radical step \nhas not been demonstrated.\n  Class actions are an extremely important tool in our justice system. \nThey allow plaintiffs with very small claims to band together to seek \nredress. Lawsuits are expensive. Without the opportunity to pursue a \nclass action, an individual plaintiff often simply cannot afford his or \nher day in court. But through a class action, justice can be done and \ncompensation for real injuries can be obtained.\n  Yes, there are abuses in some class actions suits. Some of the most \ndisturbing have to do with class action settlements that offer only \ndiscount coupons to the members of the class and a big payoff to the \nplaintiffs' lawyers. I am pleased that the issue of discount coupons is \naddressed in the bill, because the bill we considered in October 2003 \ndid nothing about that problem. The bill now requires that contingency \nfees in coupon settlements will be based on coupons redeemed, not \ncoupons issued. Attorney's fees will also be determined by reasonable \ntime spent on a case and will be subject to court approval. The bill \nalso allows a court to require that a portion of unclaimed coupons be \ngiven to one or more charitable organization agreed to by the parties. \nThese are all good changes, but they do not change my view that the \nbill, as a whole, unfairly interferes with the States' administration \nof justice.\n  There are three possible outcomes of this bill being enacted. Either \nthe State courts will be deluged with individual claims, since class \nactions can no longer be maintained there, or there will be a huge \nincrease in the workload of the Federal courts, resulting in delays and \nlengthy litigation over procedural issues rather than the substance of \nthe claims, or many injured people will never get redress for their \ninjuries.\n  I don't believe any of these three choices is acceptable.\n  I appreciate that the supporters of S. 2062 modified the new \ndiversity jurisdiction rules for class actions in an effort to allow \nplaintiffs in class actions more opportunities to remain in State \ncourt. Under the new bill, a district court must decline jurisdiction \nif two-thirds of the plaintiffs and the primary defendants are from the \nstate where the action was filed, there is at least one defendant who \nis a citizen of that State from whom significant relief is sought and \nwhose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted \nby the proposed class. In addition, the principal injuries resulting \nfrom the alleged conduct of each defendant must have occurred in the \nState in which the action was originally filed. Finally, the new bill \nprovides that district court can only decline jurisdiction if during \nthe 3-year period preceding the filing of the action, no other similar \nclass action has been filed against any of the defendants even if the \ncase is filed on behalf of other plaintiffs.\n  These criteria are an improvement on the underlying bill. But the \njurisdictional requirements for class actions to remain in State courts \nare still too burdensome. Under the new language, for example, a class \naction brought by Wisconsin citizens against a Delaware-based company \nfor selling a bad insurance policy would probably be removed to Federal \ncourt even if Wisconsin-based agents were involved in selling the \npolicies. And the filing of a class action in one State court may lead \nto the successful removal of a similar case filed in another State on \nbehalf of plaintiffs in that State. The bottom line is that this bill \nwill continue to send the majority of class actions to Federal court. \nThe proponents of this bill have chosen a remedy that goes far beyond \nthe alleged problem.\n  Furthermore, under S. 2062, many cases that are not class actions at \nall are included in the definition of ``mass action,'' a new term \ncoined by this bill. S. 2062 simply requires that the plaintiff must be \nseeking damages of more than $75,000 for the case to be considered a \nmass action and removable to Federal court. This provision unfairly \nlimits State court authority to manage its docket and to consolidate \nclaims in order to more efficiently dispense justice.\n  A particularly troubling result of this bill will be an increase in \nthe workload of the Federal courts. These courts are already \noverloaded. The Congress has led the way in bringing more and more \nlitigation to the Federal courts, particularly criminal cases. Criminal \ncases, of course, take precedence in the Federal courts because of the \nSpeedy Trial Act. So the net result of removing virtually all class \nactions to Federal court will be to delay those cases.\n  There is an old saying with which I'm sure we are all familiar: \n``justice delayed is justice denied.'' I hope my colleagues will think \nabout that aphorism before voting for this bill. Think about the real \nworld of Federal court litigation and the very real possibilities that \nlong procedural delays in overloaded Federal courts will mean that \nlegitimate claims may never be heard.\n  One little-noticed aspect of this bill illustrates the possibilities \nfor delay that this bill provides, even to defendants who are not \nentitled to have a\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\ncase removed to Federal court under the bill's relaxed diversity \njurisdiction standards. Under current law, if a Federal court decides \nthat a removed case should be remanded to State court, that decision is \nnot appealable. The only exception is for civil rights cases removed \nunder the special authority of 28 U.S.C. Sec.  1443. The original \nversion of this bill allowed defendants to immediately appeal a \ndecision by a Federal district court that a case does not qualify for \nremoval.\n\n  Fortunately, the revised bill now requires such appeals to be decided \npromptly. It does not, however, do anything about the fact that the \nlower court may take months or even years to make a decision on the \nmotion to remand. That means that a plaintiff class that is entitled, \neven under this bill, to have a case heard by a State court may still \nhave to endure years of delay while its remand motion is pending in the \nFederal district court. Where is the ``fairness'' in that? I plan to \noffer an amendment, if I even get the chance to address that problem \nand I hope the bill's sponsors and supporters will give it serious \nconsideration.\n  It is important to remember that this debate is not about resolving \nquestions of Federal law in the Federal courts. Federal question \njurisdiction already exists for that. Any case involving a Federal \nstatute can be removed to Federal court under current law. This bill \ntakes cases that are brought in State court solely under State laws \npassed by State legislatures and throws them into Federal court. This \nbill is about making it more time-consuming and more costly for \ncitizens of a State to get the redress that their elected \nrepresentatives have decided they are entitled to if the laws of their \nstate are violated.\n  Diversity jurisdiction in cases between citizens of different States \nhas been with us for our entire history as a Nation. Article III, \nsection 2 of the Constitution provides: ``The judicial Power shall \nextend . . . to Controversies between Citizens of different States.'' \nThis is the constitutional basis for giving the Federal courts \ndiversity jurisdiction over cases that involved only questions of State \nlaw.\n  The very first Judiciary Act, passed in 1789, gave the Federal courts \njurisdiction over civil suits between citizens of different States \nwhere over $500 was at issue. In 1806, in the case of Strawbridge v. \nCurtiss, the Supreme Court held that this act required complete \ndiversity between the parties--in all other instances, the Court said, \na case based on State law should be heard by the State courts. So this \nbill changes a nearly 200-year-old practice in this country of \npreserving the Federal courts for cases involving Federal law or where \nno defendant is from the State of any plaintiff in a case involving \nonly State law.\n  Why is such a drastic step necessary? Why do we need to prevent State \ncourts from interpreting and applying their own State laws in cases of \nany size or significance? One argument we hear is that the trial \nlawyers are extracting huge and unjustified settlements in State \ncourts, which has become a drag on the economy. We also hear that \nplaintiffs' lawyers are taking the lion's share of judgments or \nsettlements to the detriment of consumers. But a recent empirical study \ncontradicts these arguments. Theodore Eisenberg of Cornell Law School \nand Geoffrey Miller of NYU Law School recently published the first \nempirical study of class action settlements. Their conclusions, which \nare based on data from 1993-2002, may surprise some of the supporters \nof this bill.\n  First, the study found that attorneys' fees in class action \nsettlements are significantly below the standard 33 percent contingency \nfee charged in personal injury cases. The average class action \nattorney's fee is actually 21.9 percent. In addition, the attorneys' \nfees awarded in class action settlements in Federal court are actually \nhigher than in State court settlements. Attorney fees as a percent of \nclass recovery were found to be between 1 and 6 percentage points \nhigher in Federal court class actions than in State court class \nactions.\n  A final finding of the study is that there has been no appreciable \nincrease in either the amount of settlements or the amount of \nattorneys' fees awarded in class actions over the past ten years. The \nstudy indicates that there is no crisis here. No explosion of huge \njudgments. No huge fleecing of consumers by their lawyers. This bill is \na solution in search of a problem. It is a great piece of legislation \nfor wrongdoers who would like to put off their day of reckoning by \nmoving cases to courts that are less convenient, slower, and more \nexpensive for those who have been wronged. It is a bad bill for \nconsumers, for State legislatures, and for State courts.\n  This bill seems not to be about class action abuses, but about \ngetting cases into Federal court where it takes longer and is more \nexpensive for plaintiffs to get a judgment. The cumulative effect of \nthis bill is to severely limit State court authority and ultimately \nlimit victims' access to prompt justice. Despite improvements made \nsince the last time the Senate considered this bill, the bill will \nstill place significant barriers for consumers who want to have their \ncases heard in State court. Remand orders are still appealable, and the \nmass tort definition does not protect State courts' authority to \nconsolidate cases and manage their dockets more efficiently. All the \nelements outlined in the bill before us will result in the erosion of \nState court authority and the delay of justice for our citizens. \nTherefore, I cannot support this unfair ``Class Action Fairness Act'' \nbill, and I will vote no.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Threats to Our Nation\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, this is a very difficult time for our \nNation. A few hours ago, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appeared at a press conference to discuss in some detail what \nhe could say publicly about the continuing threats our Nation confronts \nbecause of the diabolical plots of the terrorists to undermine our way \nof life, to destroy American life, to disrupt American life. Earlier \ntoday there was a closed door hearing for the Senate that went into \neven greater detail.\n  A few weeks ago I personally was briefed by representatives of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the FBI, the CIA, others within our \nGovernment who follow the terrorist threats on a daily, even hourly \nbasis. I believe it is fair to say there has been, ever since September \n11 and I think one can argue even before, a concerted effort by those \nwho subscribe to the nihilistic philosophy or theology that underlies \nthe fundamentalist Islamic terrorists that whatever they could do to \nstrike against our country or American interests or American allies \nanywhere in the world somehow furthered their perverted cause, their \nsense of purpose to try to strike against freedom and democracy, \nagainst women's rights and roles, against what the United States \nrepresents as a beacon of opportunity for so many around the world.\n  Representing the State of New York, I saw firsthand the horrific \ndamage the terrorists caused because of their attacks on the World \nTrade Center and of course at the Pentagon, and then the crash in \nPennsylvania of a plane thought to be headed toward either this \nbuilding or the White House.\n  I have met recently, about 2 hours ago, with a group of interns who \ncame to my office. I love meeting with the young people who work here \nin Washington during the summer. They come with such energy and \nenthusiasm. They were asking me a variety of questions. One of them \nsaid: Senator, what do you spend most of your time doing?\n  I told them that certainly, because of September 11, I have spent the \nbulk of my time worrying about and working on behalf of New York to \nhelp us recover from the attacks, to help us rebuild, to help us try to \nrepair, so far as possible, the shattered lives and lost dreams of so \nmany thousands of people. Then, once having become a member of the \nArmed Services Committee in January, a year and a half ago, I have been \nimmersed in the details and challenges of how we defend our country, \nhow we best protect our interests, how we take care of the young men \nand women in uniform.\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\n  Running through all of that work has been a commitment to do \neverything I could do as a U.S. Senator to ensure that we were \nvigilant, we took every step necessary and possible to protect our \nfellow men, women, and children.\n  I have taken that responsibility very seriously. I have introduced \nlegislation to try to put both more resources into homeland security \nand to allocate those more effectively to ensure that our first \nresponders, our police and our firefighters and our emergency workers, \nhad the resources necessary to do the job we expected them to do \nbecause, in effect, they are our frontline homeland soldiers.\n  I have worked to protect our rail lines and our courts, to ensure \nthat our critical infrastructure has been given whatever help can be \noffered so we are prepared, so we are vigilant, because none of us can \npredict whether there will be an attack or where one might occur. I am \nwell aware of that. That is not something that we can stand here today \nand say we know is going to happen, but we can say with confidence \nthere are people right now, meeting throughout the world in cafes in \nEurope, in tents in North Africa, in caves in Afghanistan, who wish us \nill and who will do everything they possibly can to kill as many \nAmericans, to injure as many Americans, and to destroy as much of \nAmerica as possible.\n  I don't think we have a higher priority in the Senate than to work \ntogether in a bipartisan--frankly, a nonpartisan--way to provide the \nresources and to do what is necessary to protect the people we \nrepresent.\n  That is why it grieves me to come to the floor of this Senate having \nwatched now for several weeks as we have done nearly everything but \nfocus on the real business of America. We have an appropriations bill \nstanding in line for homeland security that we cannot get to the floor. \nInstead, we are engaged in these nonsensical, futile, parliamentary, \npolitically partisan games. It is a shame, and it reflects on all of \nus, but it reflects most on the majority leadership of this body.\n  It is one thing not to know exactly all we should be doing to protect \nour homeland. It is something altogether different not to be doing the \nbusiness we are expected to do to provide as many resources effectively \ndeployed as possible to try to ensure that so far as humanly possible \nwe have done our job.\n  Look at what we are doing today.\n  One can argue about whether dealing with class action is a priority \ngiven everything else going on in our world, but we can't even deal \nwith that.\n  The majority leader comes to the floor, and in a parliamentary move \nmakes it impossible to present any other issue, whether that issue is \nto try to raise the minimum wage for people who haven't had a raise in \nyears or whether it is to try to bring about the reimportation of drugs \nfrom Canada so that people can pay an affordable price for the drugs \nthey should be able to use for their prescriptions.\n  Some issues we hear about all the time. It is indeed frustrating that \nwe are not even dealing with what is allegedly on the Senate floor.\n  But what really frustrates and disappoints me is that this impasse, \nthis games playing, this pure, unadulterated partisan politics, is \npreventing us from dealing with the urgent business, the threats, and \nthe dangers that confront our country. The Homeland Security \nappropriations bill just sits there. We can't get it to the floor. We \nhave passed out of our requisite committees not once but several times \nsteps to make our ports safer, to make our rail lines safer. For \nheaven's sake, we saw what happened in Madrid. How can we in good \nconscience act as though we don't have an obligation and a \nresponsibility to protect our rail lines and our ports, our critical \ninfrastructure?\n  We have just appropriated some additional funds to make sure we have \nmore security in Boston and New York which will be the home of the \nDemocratic and Republican Conventions, part of our great political \ndemocratic tradition in our country.\n  What about the people who do their job every day? What about the \npolice officers in New York who walk the streets every day picking up \ninformation and conveying it to the intelligence-gathering operations \nof our New York Police Department and detectives coordinating with the \nFBI? What are we doing for them? We are cutting the COPS Program. That \nis what we are doing. We are not even adding additional money to \nhomeland security. We are cutting the very lifeblood of what keeps the \npolice on the streets in a city such as New York and so many other \ngreat cities around our country.\n  What about our firefighters? With budget cuts and cutbacks, we are \nnot fulfilling the needs they confront for interoperable communications \nfor hazardous materials, both training and equipment for the personnel \nthat are needed with the highly developed skills to deal with chemical, \nbiological, and radiological attacks.\n\n  I feel as if I am living in some kind of fantasy world, some parallel \narea.\n  We have the Department of Homeland Security Secretary standing before \nour Nation talking about the danger and threats we face. We have \nclosed-door briefings for Members of the Senate and the House. Yet we \ndon't get about the business of doing all we can to make sure we are \nprepared. It is bewildering.\n  When Secretary Ridge announced this morning that we have credible \nreporting that al-Qaida is moving forward with its plan to carry out a \nlarge-scale attack on the United States, then I think we act as though \nwe have nothing better to do, at our peril. Shame on us. Yet here we \nare. We have a person in our Government responsible for giving us this \ninformation based on credible reports, and we are ground to a halt in \nthe Senate.\n  This is one of those times when I think history is watching and will \njudge us harshly.\n  We are 4 days after our Independence Day, 4 months before the \nNovember elections, nearly 5 months after the President submitted his \nbudget request to Congress, and the U.S. Congress has yet to send a \nsingle appropriations bill to fund the U.S. Government to the President \nfor his signature.\n  The Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Department of Justice, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, responsible for \ncoordinating security at both conventions, Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, and a host of others charged with the solemn responsibility of \nprotecting our country have not yet been funded. As is so painfully \nclear, we haven't even taken up the Homeland Security appropriations \nyet.\n  We could be right now debating on the floor of the Senate how much \nmoney our first responders need and whether we are going to take \nseriously the obvious threat to rail lines. And what about those ports \nwith those thousands of containers that come in?\n  Last week, I was privileged to be in Seattle, WA, with my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Murray, who is the No. 1 champion of port \nsecurity in this body. In fact, she was named Port Person of the Year \nbecause of her advocacy for our ports.\n  We went out across the water from downtown Seattle with the skyline \nspread before us to an island that processes a lot of the container \ntraffic. We talked to the Coast Guard, Immigration, and other personnel \nwho run that operation. It is an overwhelming task. You think about \nthis, one of our ports--we have so many of them. The biggest are Los \nAngeles and Long Beach, Seattle-Takoma, and of course, New York-New \nJersey. We have made some progress. I am proud of that progress. But we \nhaven't done what we know needs to be done.\n  We have had report after report after report by distinguished \nAmericans, by experts in security and intelligence, by people who \nunderstand the perverse mentality of our enemies, and they have said \nover and over again that we are not ready, we are not prepared, we have \nnot done our part.\n  Let us get back to business. Let us get serious around here. \nElections take care of themselves. That comes and goes. Our job is to \ndo the people's work right now, today, in July, to deal with important \npressing matters, and there isn't any that is more critical than \nhomeland security.\n  We still have time, although it is a little hard to believe, but we \nonly have about 2 more weeks, which usually translates around here into \n6 days of work, and a day like today when nothing happens. It is \ndiscouraging.\n  There are 100 very smart, energetic, able people in this body who \nknow how to work and how to get things done. They might as well be on a \nbeach somewhere for all their efforts amount to\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\nwith respect to the important issues facing us and the one I am most \nconcerned about; namely, the security in our country.\n\n  Every intelligence report, every briefing, always mentions New York. \nIt mentions other places, too, but it always mentions New York. The \npeople I represent, who have already gone through so much--the \nfirefighters and police officers I represent, who have already set the \nworld class standard for courage and class--I don't want to have to \nlook them in the face and say, We could not get around to giving you \nthe funds you needed to be sure you got those additional pieces of \nequipment that were required. We could not figure out how we were going \nto have the Senate deal with the business as to whether you live or \ndie.\n  I am proud and honored to serve in the Senate. I am especially proud \nand honored to represent New York. But it is hard to understand how we \ncould be turning our collective backs on the most pressing need \nconfronting our country.\n  In 2 weeks we are going to be recessing--Democrats will go to Boston; \nthe Republicans, later in August, will go to New York--and I guess \neveryone hopes and crosses their fingers and prays to God Almighty that \nnothing bad happens.\n  I was raised in a faith tradition that believed God helps those who \nhelp themselves; that we were given a soul, a heart, and head, and we \nwere expected to use all three. I can only hope we will get a signal \nfrom our majority leader that we are going to go back to business, we \nare going to get this process moving again, we are going to bring the \nappropriations for the Department of Homeland Security to this Senate \nand we are going to act--not that we can prevent every bad thing from \nhappening but that we will have done our duty. There is still time. I \nhope, for all our sakes, we act.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nNew York, there is no question the citizens from your State, more than \nany State in the Union, are troubled every day because every day there \nis a story that something bad is going to happen, and New York, as the \nSenator indicated, is always mentioned.\n  I heard the Senator from New York state today that we, the Senate, \nare wasting our time. Class action is important, but is it as important \nto my family as having better security for my family? I have family \nmembers in the Washington, DC area, in Nevada, and one of my sons moved \nto Utah. I would rather we were working on this bill, Homeland \nSecurity, to make my family members more secure.\n  To top this off, when we leave class action--and the majority has \ndecided they simply cannot allow a vote on immigration, or certainly \nthey cannot allow a vote on drug reimportation--we are going to move \noff this legislation and are going to the gay marriage amendment. I \nknow people have strong emotions about that one way or the other. \nHowever, I am willing to say the people for New York and the people of \nNevada, if we weigh on one side the gay marriage amendment and on the \nother side the Homeland Security appropriations bill, this scale would \ntip 95 to 5. Does the Senator agree we have our priorities mixed?\n  And let me ask one other question. I went to my luncheon today and \none of my friends in the press said, do you realize what the \nRepublicans are doing? They are going to say you are obstructing \neverything.\n  Does the Senator from New York understand that is their game? They \nwill say we are the ones obstructing these bills, when, in fact, they \ndo not want to address these issues because they do not want to take a \nvote on overtime, they do not want to vote on extending unemployment \nbenefits, they do not want to have a debate on immigration and drug \nreimportation.\n  Would the Senator agree when a government is controlled by one \nparty--President, the House, the Senate and, I am sad to say, the \nSupreme Court--it is a little hard to blame the other party for \nobstructing? Does the Senator agree?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly, I agree with my good friend and my \ndistinguished leader who makes some excellent points.\n  Even more than that, as the Senator from Nevada knows so well, in the \nface of a disaster or another attack, all of this becomes unimportant, \ntrivial, even frivolous.\n  I have enough respect for all of my colleagues that I hope we are not \nputting ourselves in a position where in the event what has been \npredicted, and given voice to today by Secretary Ridge, comes to pass, \nand people rightly can turn and ask, Where were our elected \nrepresentatives?\n  This goes way beyond politics. This is not about Democrats and \nRepublicans. This is about us as Americans. What are our priorities? \nWhat do we think is important? What are we willing to fight for, stand \nup for?\n  As my good friend points out, the majority has made a different set \nof choices. They have decided they want to create an atmosphere of \ngridlock and obstructionism which means we go so far as not even to \ntake up the Homeland Security appropriations.\n  It is profoundly sad. It would be sad any time, but it is \nextraordinarily disheartening that on a day when the Senate was briefed \nbehind closed doors about the threats, when the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security went before the world to talk about the \nthreats, that we cannot get a debate on the appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I have no doubt my good friend is right, there must be some political \nmachinations going on in some back room, there must be some pollster \nwhispering in someone's ear and saying, If you do this, that, and the \nother, you can come. Maybe people will be fooled into believing--even \nthough you are in charge, and as my friend points out, you are in \ncharge of the White House, the House, and the Senate--that somehow the \nfact that nothing has happened has to be the other side's fault.\n  I am sure people are saying that, but how pathetic is that. What does \nthat say about our values and priorities as a nation? If that is what \nthey care about, trying to score cheap political, partisan points at \nthe expense of bringing up the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations in the face of the warnings we received today, then it \nis going to be clear for all to see the responsibility rests on their \nshoulders.\n  It is not too late. There are a lot of Members who have worked day \nand night to deal with the real business of America. I am sure my good \nfriend, our deputy leader on this side of the aisle who is literally \nhere every waking hour, would be here even more in order to deal with \nthe people's business. And what is the people's business? No. 1, \nkeeping the people safe.\n  Again, I hope we get about what is important, that our majority \nleadership decide they want to put aside these petty, partisan, \npolitical games dealing with scoring cheap points at somebody's \nadvantage, and work for the good of all of our people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from New York would yield for a question.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2537 and H.R. 4567\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator from New \nYork if she would allow me to make a unanimous consent request at this \ntime that the appropriations bills for homeland security be brought for \nimmediate consideration on the floor of the Senate.\n  These bills--S. 2537 and H.R. 4567--are currently on the Senate \ncalendar. After the warnings we received today from Secretary Ridge, \ncould there be anything more important for us to do at this moment in \ntime but to move to these bills so that units of government in New \nYork, in Illinois, in Alaska, in Nevada are provided with the funds \nthey need immediately, so we can move this process beyond all the \npolitical rhetoric and debate on so many issues that take a distant \nsecond place to the security of this Nation.\n  I wonder if it would be appropriate for the Senator to yield to me to \nmake that request, and then I would return the floor to her.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I so yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ntake up for immediate consideration S. 2537, the Homeland Security Act \nof 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\nAlaska and on behalf of Senate Leadership, I object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ntake up for immediate consideration H.R. 4567, the Homeland Security \nAct of 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nAlaska, I object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am disappointed with that decision \nbased on what we have seen today and heard. I hope and I pray nothing \nhappens in this country between now and the time we take these bills \nup. It reflects so badly on the U.S. Senate that we have been given \nfair warning by this administration that we face one of the most \nserious security threats since 9/11 and the Senate is unwilling--there \nhas been an objection to even considering the Homeland Security bills \nat this moment when, in fact, we have nothing else to do here. I hope \nthat history proves that this was not a wrong decision, but it is a \ndecision which, sadly, we will have to live with until the leadership \nof this Senate decides to return.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank my good friend from Illinois and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what those who are following the Senate \ndebate just witnessed is, sadly, a commentary on what has happened to \nthe Senate. We are embroiled in debate on a class action bill relative \nto reforming the laws of America about how lawsuits can be filed. Many \nMembers, in frustration, have wanted to consider many other issues: \nShould America now, after almost 6 years-plus of not increasing the \nminimum wage, finally increase the minimum wage for American workers? \nThe Senator from Idaho has joined the Senator from Massachusetts in \naddressing a very important issue about agricultural workers and \nimmigration. They would like to offer an amendment for that purpose, \nand it has broken down. There can be no agreement reached--at least \nthere has not appeared to be an agreement reached.\n  Now we are just at rest, at ease, standing and doing nothing. It is \nhard to imagine that any of us were elected to the Senate for that \npurpose and particularly as many Members of the Senate, myself \nincluded, were called to a secret meeting, classified meeting this \nmorning, with the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Tom \nRidge, as well as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nRobert Mueller, and were told at that briefing that we face an \nextraordinary threat to America's security. I am not saying anything \nout of school because I can tell you that Secretary Ridge had a press \nconference immediately after that private meeting and said as much to \nthe American people.\n  It strikes me that under those circumstances we should be moving to \nconsider issues relative to homeland security, not just the \nappropriations bills but issues relative to port security and railroad \nsecurity. There are bills on this calendar which have just been \nlanguishing. At this moment in time, when we have nothing else going on \non the floor of the Senate, why are we not moving as quickly as \npossible to consider those important appropriations bills?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a question, Mr. President?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield in just a minute. I will be happy to yield \nafter I make my statement.\n  I just pray that we can reach a point where we can get to these bills \nbefore anything serious happens in America. But I know in my State of \nIllinois and in every other State there are units of local government \nas well as law enforcement units and those who are looking for the \nresources to be able to respond to a national emergency.\n  If something serious should occur, God forbid, it is not likely that \npeople will be calling the Senate switchboard. They are going to be \ndialing 911. They are going to be hoping that on the other end of the \nline there will be a police department, a fire department, an \nambulance, or a hospital that can respond extremely quickly. And the \nquestion is, obviously: Are we doing all we should do on a timely basis \nto provide the resources to these units of local government?\n  Secretary Ridge said today--and I have the highest respect for him; \nhe is an old friend. I came to Congress with him over 20 years ago. He \nwas an excellent appointment by the President. But he said how much we \nrely on State and local first responders. If that is the case, wouldn't \nwe want to move as quickly as possible to make resources available for \nthem so they can be prepared to defend America? That is why we should \nconsider this legislation.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, came to the Senate floor \ntoday and made the same unanimous consent request to go to these \nissues. Again, the majority said no, we are not going to consider these \nissues. There is nothing more important. I would hope we would move to \nthem quickly.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Well, I will seek the floor when the Senator is through.\n  Mr. DURBIN. All right. I would just say, in conclusion, then, at a \ntime and place, I hope we can find this bipartisan agreement to move to \nthese issues. The sooner the better. Once having moved to these issues, \nI think the Senate can dispatch them quickly, on a bipartisan basis, as \nit should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4567 and S. 2537\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am sort of surprised with the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I attended the same briefing. The Homeland Security bill \nhas been reported by the committee to the Senate floor. We have been \ntrying to get it to the Senate floor. I am prepared to present a motion \nto take up the bill right now, and I do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader today, the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar \nNo. 588, H.R. 4567, an act making appropriations for the Department of \nHomeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and \nfor other purposes. Further, I ask unanimous consent that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken, that the text of Calendar No. 583, S. \n2537, the Senate-reported bill, be inserted and agreed to in lieu \nthereof, without waiving any points of order by virtue of this \nagreement, and that the bill, as amended, be considered as original \ntext for the purpose of further amendment; provided that no amendments \nshall be in order which will increase total discretionary spending \nprovided by the bill in excess of the Senate-reported bill totals of \n$32 billion in budget authority and $29.729 billion in outlays; \nprovided that no other points of order shall be waived thereon by \nvirtue of this agreement; provided further that 2 hours be equally \ndivided on the bill, that up to an extra hour be equally divided on \neach amendment, that all amendments be relevant and germane, that all \nvotes occur before 5 p.m. on Monday, and that final passage occur by \nthe same time, 5 p.m. Monday.\n  Now, I have an urgency to get this bill before the Senate, too. I am \ndelighted the Senator has come to floor. I think it is the first time I \nhave ever seen a member of the committee come to the floor of the \nSenate and ask to take up a bill without consulting the chairman. But I \nam prepared to take it up. We were prepared to offer this motion today. \nI ask for the unanimous consent agreement to start today--to start \ntoday--and we will finish it by 5 o'clock Monday.\n  Just as Governor Ridge indicated, there is a real urgency behind this \nbill. I would like to take it up. What this time agreement means is the \nbill will be subject to amendment, but anyone who wants to add money \nhas to find some source to take it out. This bill is consistent with \nthe budget resolution we are operating under, which is the budget \nresolution of 2004. We do not have a new budget resolution, but we do \nhave the budget resolution for 2004, which put caps on 2005.\n  So I am ready to take up this bill. The chairman of the committee is \nready to take it up. If the minority wants to come and ask that it come \nup, I am ready. We are ready right now. We will finish it by 5 o'clock \nMonday. We will have it to the President by 5 o'clock a week from \ntomorrow, I guarantee you that.\n  So I present the unanimous consent request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would object, but I would ask the \ndistinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee, who has worked \nharder than anyone I know in this Chamber to try to move the \nappropriations process forward, if we could not simply do what he is \nsuggesting; that is, bring up the Homeland Security bill this \nafternoon. We can get agreement to go to the bill. No one has seen this \nbill. To be limited to a time limit without having had the opportunity \nto see it--we could even work out an agreement on relevant amendments. \nWe could certainly work out a time agreement on amendments themselves. \nBut there is no question that we could resolve these procedural issues \nimmediately.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending business and \ntake up the Homeland Security bill at 3 o'clock this afternoon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My motion is before the Senate, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Actually, I objected to that, and I have offered a \ncounterproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The bill I have referred to was reported to the Senate. \nIt was reported to the Senate on June 21. It has been before the Senate \nfor quite some time. All I have asked is we have the amendments--it is \nopen to amendment--and that there be an hour on each amendment. All I \nhave asked is the amendments be germane and relevant and that there be \nan hour on each amendment. The only difference between what the \ndistinguished minority leader and I have requested is I asked that no \namendment would be in order which will increase total discretionary \nspending provided by the bill in excess of the Senate-reported bill \ntotals which, again, is the amount that is consistent with the existing \nbudget resolution.\n  I resubmit that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again, I think we are very close to \nreaching an agreement here. That is probably the good news that comes \nin this colloquy. I would object only because I am not sure I \nunderstand the implications of the final provision within his unanimous \nconsent request having to do with the budget. There is no budget. We \ndon't have a budget resolution. So I don't know how we can be guided by \na budget resolution that doesn't exist. If anybody offers an amendment, \nmy guess is it would be declared out of order, as the distinguished \nchairman is currently proposing. I don't think that is his intent, but \nI think that would be the interpretation. And that would, therefore, \nnullify any opportunity to make any alteration to the bill itself. If a \n60-vote point of order is required on any amendment, it negates \nwhatever opportunity there is to amend the bill.\n  I would hope perhaps within the hour we could work through that \nconcern and come back and take up the bill this afternoon and, as the \ndistinguished chairman suggests, finish the bill by early next week.\n  I will talk, of course, with our distinguished ranking member who \nwould certainly need to be consulted before we agreed to do anything on \nthe Senate floor. The distinguished ranking member has also expressed \nconcern about our inability to move forward on this legislation, as \nwell as the ranking member of the subcommittee. But I am pleased that \nthe chairman has responded to our desire to move this legislation. \nLet's hope before the end of the afternoon we can have an agreement in \nplace and take up the Homeland Security bill. No one could have been \nupstairs and heard what we heard and not want as much as possible to \ndeal with all of the issues that are confronting us right now. The very \nleast we need to do is to provide the funding necessary for the \ninfrastructure that is already in place, and we have not even done \nthat. So it is time we do it. It is time we recognize the concerns that \nare out there and deal with the responsibilities we have to fund the \nHomeland Security Department and all the related departments and not \nlet this legislation languish as we tie ourselves up in procedural \nknots on legislation that has no place, at least right now, given our \ncircumstances.\n\n  I will work with the chairman, work with the ranking member. \nHopefully, we can come back to the floor sometime this afternoon and \nreach agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the distinguished leader has missed part \nof my unanimous consent request; that is, that the final vote take \nplace at 5 o'clock on Monday. So we could go to conference with the \nHouse and expect to bring this bill back before we leave for the \nconvention recess. Again, I state, I have a few years around here. I \ndon't remember any Appropriations Committee member raising an issue to \nbring up a bill without consulting the chairman. I remember the days \nwhen had a Member done that, the Appropriations Committee chairman \nwould not have forgotten it. So again, I say to the Senate, we are \nprepared to take up this bill under this time agreement and only under \nthis time agreement today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me again respond to the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, chairman of the committee. I don't know why we have to have all \nthese conditions for taking up an important bill like this. What is \nwrong with coming to the floor, working through the bill, dealing with \namendments. I am frustrated, I suppose, by the extraordinary demands \nput before the Senate. Here it is Thursday afternoon. One of the most \nimportant appropriations bills we will confront and we must deal with, \nthe Senator from Alaska, as well intended as I know he is, is asking \nthe Senate to take it up on a Friday, when he knows most people travel, \nand then resolve it before the end of Monday which is also a travel \nday. We can argue how productive Fridays and Mondays are. And yes, we \nought to be able to work here 5 days a week.\n  That has not been the practice. And certainly if we gave Senators \nwarning, those who have already made travel arrangements could probably \ncancel those travel arrangements. But here we are. He can't really mean \nwhat he has suggested, that he is going to finish an important bill \nlike this over 2 travel days and a weekend. That doesn't work. That \ncertainly wouldn't be recognized by any standard as a good-faith offer.\n  Let's work this bill. Let's get it done. Let's have a debate. Let's \nhave amendments. But let's recognize if we are going to do this, \nshowcasing and posturing for purposes of trying to make it appear as if \nwe are getting the work done is not going to satisfy the Senate. We \nneed to lay this bill down. We need to work through it. We need to get \nit done. We ought to be doing it rather than playing all these \npolitical games with class action and all the other things that are \ncontemplated now by the majority.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska--and we all care \ndeeply about him; he is our President pro tempore--said he wanted to \nbring up the bill--that was objected to--the Homeland Security bill, \nbut under specific conditions, limiting debate and amendments. Does the \nSenator from South Dakota believe every bill that comes up we want to \ncreate a new Senate? We never want to do things the way the Senate has \nacted for 200-plus years. We want to do things the way the House does \nit. We want to have a rule on every piece of legislation.\n\n  This is my second question. Doesn't the Senator believe we could take \nthis bill up and do it in the ordinary course of business, as we used \nto do things? We could finish this bill in a couple of days?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nevada is absolutely right. There are \ntoo many on the other side who want the House rules but the 6-year \nterm. If they want the House rules, I would advise them to run for the \nHouse. We have rules in the Senate that allow for debate. One of the \nadvantages of being a Senator is, you have an opportunity to offer \namendments and have a good debate about issues. That doesn't mean they \nhave to be extended indefinitely. These issues can be resolved and have \nbeen. But issues as important as homeland defense and appropriations \nought\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\nto have an opportunity to be debated, to be vetted, to be discussed, \nand considered in a thoughtful way.\n  What the Senator has suggested, that somehow we take up the bill this \nafternoon and, with 2 travel days and a weekend, resolve all of these \nquestions is not reasonable and certainly not realistic.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one more \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. We have completed on this floor--and we did it in expedited \nfashion--the Defense Appropriations bill. The Senator from South Dakota \nconsented to going to conference. We agreed to do it the day after the \nbill passed. The conferees were appointed. I have here the Senate \ncalendar. The conferees were appointed June 24.\n  Is the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, aware of the \nfact that since this important bill passed the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives--and now it is July 8--has simply never even appointed \nconferees? So all this about having to do it by 5 o'clock so we can go \nto conference is yelling out words that mean nothing. The House hasn't \nappointed conferees on the Defense Appropriations bill since June 24.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I acknowledge the Senator from Nevada is \nabsolutely correct. It is mystifying that they would allow a bill as \nimportant as this to languish and not appoint the conferees we had \nevery expectation would have been appointed the same day we did it in \nthe Senate. Again, it is another illustration of the hyperbolic \nrhetoric we get about concern for conference and process, but when \ngiven the opportunity, no action is taken. That has been true on \nDefense, as well as many other bills. It is regrettable.\n  Clearly, this is another illustration of how unfortunate this whole \nschedule has been. We have wasted another week. We wasted a week with \nthe Defense Appropriations conference report. We could have completed \nour work on the Homeland Security bill this week. Instead, I don't \nthink we have had a vote. If we have had a vote, except for the \nnomination, I don't recall it. We had one vote on a nominee and no \nvotes on any legislative substance. We have wasted this week.\n  We will waste next week, and as we continue to languish with all of \nthis legislative work before us, we inexplicably have no opportunity to \noffer amendments and consider the legislative agenda that would make \nthis a secure country. That is very unfortunate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, \nsee any objection to our considering this appropriation bill first \nthing Tuesday, taking this up on the same type of expedited schedule by \nwhich we took up the Defense Appropriations bill, subject to the same \nbasic rules and completing it next week? This could be done quickly, \ncould it not, if we follow the precedence and rules of the Senate, and \nthere would not be a necessity for some of the conditions the Senator \nfrom Alaska has asked for?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is exactly correct. We would \nbe prepared to accept virtually the same conditions we have agreed to \nin the past on Defense Appropriations and other legislation. If that is \nwhat it takes to expedite consideration of Homeland Security, I think \nit is critical that we attempt to accommodate the Senate and try to \nwork through this very important legislative priority in an expeditious \nway. So the Senator from Illinois makes a very good suggestion. This is \nyet another approach. Let's decide to pick it up on Tuesday and move \nthrough the legislation. We can probably finish by the middle or \ncertainly the end of the next week, and get to conference, even though \nthey have not appointed conferees in the House.\n  My hope is when it comes to Homeland Security, given what we have \nheard today at the briefing, it would be imperative for us to deal with \nboth of these bills in the most expeditious manner.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am not going to make a unanimous consent \nrequest. The Senator from Alaska doesn't care for that from a member of \nthe committee. I would like to suggest to the Senator from South Dakota \nthat I hope there could be a conversation involving our leader on the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and Senator Stevens, as well as \nSenator Frist. I hope we can propose specifically to begin \nconsideration of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nbill on Tuesday morning and bring it to a conclusion and completion as \nquickly as possible.\n\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota if he would consider trying to \nconvene such a conversation with his fellow Senators.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that will be, once again, the topic of \ndiscussion as I discuss the schedule with the majority leader. There \ncannot be a higher priority for our country and the Senate than dealing \nwith homeland security issues.\n  Why we have not taken up the railroad security issue is another \nmatter that is troubling to many of us. There are a number of bills \nrelated to our security that ought to be addressed, ought to have the \nhighest priority. Certainly, Homeland Security Appropriations, railroad \nsecurity, a number of other issues continue to sit without \nconsideration. I cannot think of a better time to take it up than this \nafternoon and tomorrow, but no later than Tuesday; and I think the \nsuggestion made by the Senator from Illinois is a good one. I will make \nit to the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we also have to project ourselves \ninto next week. I have read in the press that the majority, when we get \noff of the bill we have been dealing with all week, class action, is \ngoing to go to a constitutional amendment dealing with gay marriage. \nNow is there anybody who believes that amendment, which is doomed to \nfailure no matter how you feel about it--how do the people in South \nDakota feel about going to an amendment dealing with gay marriage \ninstead of doing an appropriations bill dealing with homeland security?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am sure the people of South Dakota share the same \nfeeling as the people in Nevada, Illinois and across the country. They \nwant us to do our work and they want us to recognize there are very \nserious obligations we have that ought to be met. I cannot think of a \nmore serious obligation than to provide for the security of this \ncountry. The longer we ignore it, the more we put our country at peril. \nI think it is critical we address these issues in a bipartisan way, a \nnonpoliticized way, an expeditious way; and certainly by taking this \nlegislation up next week, we would be doing that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the current business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 2062, the class \naction bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The Chair has indicated that the Senate is presently considering the \nclass action bill; therefore, I would think it appropriate for me to \nadd a title to the remarks I am about to make, a title which would be \nas follows: ``Protecting the People's Interests Instead of the Campaign \nInterests.''\n  This morning, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI Director \nMueller briefed Senators, and I am told that he indicated that al-Qaida \ncells are operating in the United States and that multiple and \nsimultaneous attacks are possible before the November elections.\n  Now, I have been listening, as I sat home with my sick wife, to talk \nabout an amendment to the Constitution. I have been married now more \nthan 67 years to a coal miner's daughter, and I have been listening to \nall of the wrangling that has been going on on this floor. I therefore \nfelt it appropriate to make these few remarks, especially in the light \nof what I am told Secretary\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\nRidge said; namely, credible reporting now indicates that al-Qaida is \nmoving forward with its plans to carry out a large-scale attack in the \nUnited States in an effort to disrupt our Democratic process.\n  Just a month ago, the Attorney General announced that he had credible \nintelligence from multiple sources that al-Qaida plans to hit the \nUnited States hard in the next few months.\n  In the weeks following the Madrid railway bombing, the Washington \nPost reported that the President informed the Republican congressional \nleadership that he was all but certain that terrorists would attempt a \nmajor attack on the United States before the November elections.\n  Why are we wrangling over this political bill? Why not be talking \nabout protecting the people of the United States and their properties \nagainst such an al-Qaida attack? It would seem to me that should have \npriority over politics.\n  Your lives, the people out there who are watching this Senate floor \nthrough those electronic lenses, your lives, we are told, are at stake. \nThen why do we have before this Senate this class action bill? Why not \ntalk about the people's lives that are at stake? The administration \nsays the people's lives are at stake and that we may expect multiple \nattacks. What a sinister threat we are obviously facing in this \ncountry. What are we doing on this floor? Wrangling, wrangling, \nwrangling over a class action bill. That is not going to sit very well \nwith the American people, I don't believe, once they stop and think \nabout it.\n  It would also be appropriate at this point, although it isn't very \ncommon that it is done on this floor--the Holy Bible is probably not \nsomething that one should carry onto the floor of the Senate, but I am \ngoing to read just two verses of Scripture from the book of St. Luke, \nchapter 13. These two verses are the sixth and seventh verses:\n\n       He [meaning Jesus] spake also this parable; A certain man \n     had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and \n     sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n       Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, \n     these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and \n     find none: cut it down;--\n\n  Cut it down--\n\n     why cumbereth it the ground?\n\n  I believe there is a day of reckoning coming and it isn't afar off, \nwhen the American people are going to look at this fig tree and say: \nThese 3 years I come looking for fruit on this fig tree and I found \nnone, cut it down. They are going to say that to this administration, \nto this White House. These 3 years--these 3 years--behold, these 3 \nyears I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none.\n  Where are all the wranglers? The people of this country are going to \nrender a reckoning to those who are in the leadership in this country \nand they are going to say: Behold, these 3 years I came here seeking \nfruit on this tree and found none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the \nground?\n  Just a few weeks ago, the 9/11 Commission released interim reports \nconcluding that the terrorists who are intent on doing us harm are \ncunning and agile. These reports also indicate that our Government \nagencies were not prepared to deter or respond to such attacks. I fear \nthat we are still not prepared to deter or respond to such attacks. \nDespite the threats, despite the dangers, despite even today's warnings \nfrom Secretary Ridge, the Senate this afternoon continues to debate \nlegislation to reform the class action lawsuit process.\n  The Senate has spent 3 days on the bill without a single rollcall \nvote. Next week it is expected that the Senate will debate a proposed \nconstitutional amendment on marriage.\n\n  Now, hear me, listen to that, a proposed constitutional amendment on \nmarriage. There are few people in this Chamber who know as much about \nthat subject as I do. My wife and I having been married now 67 years, \ngoing on toward 70, if it is the Lord's will.\n  It is expected that the Senate will debate a proposed constitutional \namendment on marriage. Well, these are important matters. Nobody would \nsay otherwise. But, frankly, they are not that urgent. They are not \nlife or death issues, but they are the priority for the Senate majority \nleadership.\n  I believe there are other, more urgent matters that we should be \nconsidering. The Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously reported \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill 3 weeks ago, on June 17. \nSince June 17, the bill has sat collecting dust. Why are we not \ndebating that bill? I say to the leadership: Why are we not debating \nthat bill?\n  In response to the Madrid train bombings, both the Senate Banking \nCommittee and the Senate Commerce Committee reported bills authorizing \nnew Federal programs to secure our mass transit systems and our rail \nsystems. The Governmental Affairs Committee has reported a bill \nauthorizing first responders grants. The Senate has passed an \nauthorization bill to increase resources for the Coast Guard. But where \nis the bill? The bill is mired in conference.\n  Why are we not moving forward on these bills? Why are we piddling \naround here, talking about a political bill, class action suits--class \naction suits? In the face of all the dire warnings that this \nadministration, this White House, this Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, this President--all of the dire warnings that we \nhave heard, in the face of that yet we are here piddling around, \ndawdling, arguing, wrangling over a class action bill. How about that, \nthose of you people out there in the prairies, out there on the rivers \nand the river valleys, out there in the Rocky Mountains, those of you \nin Appalachia? How about that? Your life, the lives of your children \nare at stake.\n  They say these terrorists are prepared to strike in multiple places \nand yet the Senate is dawdling, talking about a class action bill.\n  We only have 2 weeks left after this one. We need to act. Are we \ngoing to wait until we go home? Are we going to wait until after the \nconventions meet? Are we going to wait another 6 weeks and then come \nback and bring up the appropriations bill making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security? Is that what we propose to do, daudle? \nFiddle-faddle? What is wrong with the Senate?\n  The Senate is a do-nothing place these days, a far cry from what the \nSenate has been in the years I have seen go by.\n  While the Bush administration has consistently promised the American \npeople that they are making this country safe, the facts show the \nadministration has consistently put homeland security on the back \nburner. Time after time after time, the distinguished Democratic whip \nwho sits on the Appropriations Committee of the Senate, not only a \nhighly respected member of that committee but a very able member of \nthat committee, knows that we have tried time and time and time again \nto add moneys for homeland security in that committee and here on the \nSenate floor. And time and time and time again, we have been turned \ndown by a Republican administration and by the Republican leadership of \nthis body. Deny that, if you may. I can furnish chapter and verse \nregarding the amendments that we have called up trying to bring greater \nsafety to the American people against a terrorist attack, and time and \ntime again those amendments have been defeated on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  For this administration, homeland security can wait and wait and wait \nand then wait. What do they want to do, wait another 6 weeks now until \nwe come back after the August recess and then take up the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill? Is that the game? What might happen in \nthe meantime?\n  This administration created a new Department of Homeland Security \nthat rearranges the deck chairs, but it cannot energize that Department \nwith the financial resources that it needs to make America and the \nAmerican people safer, and many of the resources that are provided to \nthe Department have yet to be spent. Get that. Many of the moneys are \nstill in the pipeline. They have been in the pipeline. They have yet to \nbe spent.\n  What a dawdling White House.\n  In response to the terrorist threat, one might have anticipated that \nthe President would have requested the supplemental appropriations for \nsecuring our mass transit systems, for inspecting more containers \ncoming into our ports, for increasing inspections of air cargo, or for \nincreasing the number of Federal air marshals. One might have expected \nthat the President would have amended his 2005 budget request\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\nto increase his anemic, 3-percent proposed increase for the Department \nof Homeland Security. What a shame. What a sad commentary on a White \nHouse that plays Russian roulette with the lives of the American \npeople.\n  Instead, the White House did nothing. Instead, the Department seems \nsatisfied with a go-slow, business-as-usual approach to homeland \nsecurity.\n  The Department issued advice to mass transit systems for improving \nsecurity but provided no funding to increase law enforcement presence \nor to deploy K-9 teams.\n  Despite the approach of a busy summer season for airline passengers, \nthe Department of Homeland Security has allowed the number of Federal \nair marshals to shrink precipitously, and the President's budget would \nresult in even deeper reductions next year.\n  I have worked with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens of Alaska, year after year, month after \nmonth, time after time to increase appropriations for the Department of \nHomeland Security. Senator Stevens and his committee have brought out \nbill after bill, and we brought bill after bill to the Senate floor \nover these years. We have joined together hand in hand on many \noccasions to seek the administration's help and have asked the \nadministration to send up Tom Ridge before the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to testify back before he became a Secretary and subject to \nthe confirmation of the Senate. Our requests fell upon deaf ears.\n\n  Despite concerns about the safety of our borders, the Department, in \nMarch, imposed a hiring freeze on Customs officers and Immigration \ninspectors. Millions of dollars that Congress approved for port \nsecurity, for bus security, for hazardous materials grants 9 months ago \nhave not been awarded. Millions of dollars that Congress approved in \nFebruary of 2003, 17 months ago, for the purchase of additional \nemergency equipment for the 28 urban search and rescue teams have not \nbeen spent. Millions of dollars have not been spent.\n  Having this money sit in Washington, DC, does not make any American \ncitizen any safer.\n  As a result of the President's decision not to seek supplemental \nappropriations, the Transportation Security Administration was forced \nto cut funding for training passenger and baggage screeners and for \npurchasing equipment for airport checkpoints.\n  You who listen today, it is your life and the lives of your family \nmembers and your neighbors and your friends that are at stake.\n  As the lines at our airports get longer and longer this summer, our \ncitizens will wonder who is responsible. Who is responsible for this \nlackadaisical, careless attitude on the part of our government? Where \nare our government leaders? Where is the Senate? Why is the Senate so \nmute? That great deliberative body, where is it? Why is it so mute? Why \nare we today debating a class action bill when our lives are at stake?\n  It has been 2\\1/2\\ years since Richard Reid, the so-called shoe \nbomber, tried to blow up an aircraft in flight over the ocean with \nexplosives that he carried onto the aircraft. Are we any closer to \ndeploying systems that could check passengers for explosives? Sadly, \nsadly, the answer is no, no, no.\n  It has been over 2\\1/2\\ years since the Congress passed the USA \nPatriot Act and set a goal of tripling the Border Patrol and Customs \nofficers on the northern border. Have we met the goal? Sadly, we are \n1,428 officers short of the goal.\n  It has been nearly 3 years since 9/11 when police and firemen in the \nWorld Trade Center could not talk to one another on their radios and \ntragically hundreds of them perished never to rise in this world again.\n  Are we any closer to providing police and firemen across the Nation \nwith interoperable communications equipment? Sadly, the answer is no.\n  The EPA has estimated that there are 100 chemical plants in this \ncountry--several of them down in southern West Virginia, where one of \nthe greatest chemical complexes in the Western Hemisphere exists. The \nEPA has estimated that there are 100 chemical plants in this country, \neach of which if attacked could harm over 1 million people. In February \nof 2003, the National Infrastructure Protection Center, which is now \npart of the Department of Homeland Security, issued a threat warning \nthat al-Qaida may attempt to launch conventional attacks on nuclear or \nchemical plants. A year and a half later, has the Department actually \nhardened the security of the chemical plants? Sadly, that same old \nrefrain: No.\n\n  More than 95 percent of the Nation's overseas cargo moves through our \nports. The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that a 1-month closure of a major \nU.S. port would cost our national economy $60 billion. We inspect only \n9 percent of the cargo containers that come into our ports. There are \n361 ports.\n  In order to help secure the ports, the Coast Guard estimates $1.1 \nbillion is required to implement the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct in the first year and $5.4 billion over 10 years. How much did the \nPresident request? The President requested only $46 million for port \nsecurity grants, a cut of 62 percent.\n  We need to do more than that. The American people expect more than \nthat. The American people have a right to expect more than that. The \nAmerican people have a right to expect from this administration, this \nWhite House, better consideration, better safety, greater concern.\n  There is a day of reckoning coming, and it is not far off.\n  Let me turn to this old book our fathers and mothers read.\n\n       A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and \n     he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n\n  He found none.\n\n       Then, said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, \n     these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and \n     find none; cut it down. Why cumbereth it the ground?\n\n  The owner of that vineyard is coming soon, just a few more months. \nThe American people are coming to that vineyard seeking fruit thereon \nand they are going to say these 3 years we have come seeking fruit on \nthis fig tree and found none. Cut it down.\n  Listen to that, White House. Cut it down.\n  On March 11 of this year, terrorists attacked commuter trains in \nMadrid, Spain, killing nearly 200 innocent passengers. The President of \nthe United States has not requested a dime for mass transit security. \nNo one is suggesting we set up a passenger screening system at our \ntrain stations like we have at airports, but we should be investing in \nadditional guards, better training, additional K-9 teams, better \nsurveillance. Americans use public transportation over 32 million times \nper workday. The Senate Banking Committee has reported a bill \nauthorizing over $3.5 billion for fiscal year 2005 for mass transit \nsecurity and the Senate Commerce Committee has reported a bill \nauthorizing $1 billion for rail and Amtrak security. Our citizens \ndeserve to be secure as they travel to work and back home again.\n  Time and time again over the last 3 years I have offered amendments \nto provide funding for securing our mass transit systems and the White \nHouse consistently called the amendments wasteful or unnecessary \nspending. We need to do more.\n  The Hart-Rudman report on the terrorist threat in this country \nrecommended a $98 billion investment in equipping and training for our \nfirst responders over the next 5 years, yet the President did not \nrequest an increase in first responder funding. Instead, the President \nhas proposed to cut first responder funding in the Department by over \n$700 million, including a $246 million cut in fire grants, and \ngovernmentwide the President is proposing cuts of $1.5 billion. We need \nto do more, not less. We are living in perilous times. Perilous times. \nWe are a country that faces increasing threats from terrorists right \nhere at home.\n\n  As Secretary Ridge was said to have explained to the country this \nmorning, there is a growing concern about a potential terrorist attack \nbefore the November election. We are vulnerable, and the continual \nwarnings and calls for vigilance only magnify that vulnerability.\n  What is our response to the Secretary's warnings in this Senate, in \nthis dear old body which has been my home for almost 46 years? We give \nwhistles to staff in the Capitol and we hope for the best. We sit back \nand wait and wait and wait on an appropriations bill that is right here \nthat could have been called up days ago. We sit back\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nand wait and wait on this appropriations bill that would improve \nHomeland Security. Instead of action, we delay. Instead of action, we \ncall up a class action bill. Instead of action, we get wrangled in \npolitical arguing. We delay Homeland Security funds for police officers \nand firefighters. We delay immediate investments in border security and \nport security. We say loudly for all the country to hear, Homeland \nSecurity can wait.\n  No, it cannot wait. Homeland Security cannot wait. And remember, \nthere will be a day of reckoning. It will come as surely as I stand \nhere in this place, as sure as the sparks fly upward. That day of \nreckoning is coming ever near around the corner.\n  Indeed, the majority leader could have scheduled the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill this week, but rather than bring up that \ncritical legislation this week the majority chose to go to the class \naction bill. And once the Senate began consideration of the class \naction bill, then it was decided that Senators could only offer those \namendments the leadership deemed appropriate. Now, how is that? How is \nthat for filling the tree?\n\n  Here we are in the middle of July, with 11 more legislative days left \nbefore the Senate recesses for the respective party conventions; and \nthat is going to be for 45 days we will recess, take or give a little. \nSo the Senate has acted on exactly one appropriations bill, the Defense \nAppropriations bill.\n  Now that is not the fault of the Senate Appropriations Committee. No, \nyou can bet on that. That is not the fault of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  It is said that actions speak louder than words, and I believe that \nto be true in this case. Given all of the priorities facing this \ncountry, the majority leader has said, I am told, the most urgent need \nthe Senate should consider is the class action bill and has further \nindicated that next week the Senate will consider a constitutional \namendment that no one believes has the number of votes needed for \nadoption. Amend the Constitution of the United States--here it is, \nfolks. I hold it in my hand. Let's just amend it one more time.\n  Homeland security funding will sit on the sidelines. Is that what the \nSenate should be about, I ask you, the people out there? This Senate \nshould step back from this folly and put the people's interests first--\nthe people's business, the people's lives.\n  I simply do not understand why the Senate is twiddling its thumbs on \nlegislation that could be considered at some other time rather than \naddressing homeland security issues when it matters most.\n\n     I watched them tear the building down,\n     A gang of men in a busy town;\n     With a ho-heave-ho, and a lusty yell,\n     They swung a beam and a sidewall fell.\n     I asked the foreman, ``Are these men skilled,\n     And the men you would hire if you had to build?''\n     He gave a laugh and said, ``No, indeed;\n     Just common labor is all you need.\n     I could easily wreck in a day or two\n     What builders have taken years to do.''\n     I thought to myself as I went away,\n     Which of these roles have I tried to play:\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Measuring life by the rule and square,\n     Am I shaping my deeds to a well-made plan,\n     Patiently doing the best I can?\n     Or am I a wrecker who walks the town,\n     Content with the labor of tearing down?\n\n  Think about it.\n  Now, I had not been told about my dear friend's, the chairman's, \nproposal about taking this up, even though I am the ranking member, \nactually the senior member of the committee, the only person on that \ncommittee who has been on it for 46 years, the senior Democrat in this \nwhole creation here. I was not told about any proposal that my chairman \nwas about to make.\n  I would be happy to consider any proposal. I want to work with the \nchairman. I say, why not take up this bill on Monday of next week? Why \nnot? Why not bring this bill up on Monday, and let's have at it? I will \nleave that question for the leadership. I hope it will receive some \nconsideration.\n\n       A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and \n     he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n       Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, \n     these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and \n     find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, there are many arguments hot and heavy \nbeing made today about the important issues that confront our country, \nissues about our security, about our troops, about the hot summer that \nis threatened by terrorists, about our economy and its recovery, and I \nknow there are strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. But I hope \ntoday to show the American people that we are bigger than just \npartisans, that there are times when our Nation's elected officials can \ncome together, put aside political and party differences, and actually \ndebate and pass legislation.\n  My bill that I am talking about now in the company of Mike DeWine, \nthe Senator from Ohio--and I believe Senator Dodd of Connecticut will \nsoon join us--is a bill, I suppose, on a smaller subject than war and \npeace and economic recovery, but it is nevertheless a bill about life \nand death, so it is important. It is not a far-reaching bill. It is not \neven all that expensive, certainly not in relationship to all that our \nCongress will consider, but it represents an important milestone in our \ncountry's battle against mental illness and specifically youth suicide.\n  Later tonight, this bill will be introduced by the majority leader. I \nthank him for his sensitivity and willingness to proceed on this bill. \nHe has been of enormous help to my wife and me in this struggle. I \nthank also Senator Daschle for truly making this a bipartisan issue. \nSee, what Senator Frist and Senator Daschle understand is that mental \nillnesses do not register by party; they afflict Republican and \nDemocratic families alike.\n  I would like to thank Senator Gregg, the chairman of the committee, \nand his staff for their willingness to proceed with this legislation. \nIt would not have happened without him.\n  I would like to thank Senator DeWine. He and his wife Fran know \nsomething about family suffering, having lost a child of their own, so \nhe has been unusually sensitive to Sharon and me on this issue. He has \nchampioned one of the bills, the major part of this bill we will take \nup today.\n  I thank you, Senator DeWine.\n  I want to show further how we as partisans, as Republicans and \nDemocrats, are first Americans. During the hearing we had on this bill, \nit was Senator Dodd, who is the ranking member of the committee, who \nsuggested that if we accomplish little else in this Congress, we at \nleast ought to do this much. Senator Dodd is one of the nicest and most \ndecent Members of this Chamber.\n  There are other Senators of whom I want to take note.\n  Senator Jack Reed has been especially sensitive and has helped to \nwrite a big portion of this bill as it relates to campus suicide.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic whip--his family also having \nsuffered with a suicide--has been a champion of mental health issues \nand specifically on the issue of how to intervene, interdict, and to \nstop suicide when it is at all possible.\n  Finally, I would like to speak of Senator Kennedy. I have looked at \nhim often in this Chamber. I have thought of him as a lion in \nwinter. He certainly has a lion's roar in this Chamber. Yet underlying \nthe lion's roar, Senator Kennedy has a heart that is filled with \ncompassion for people. No one on either side of the aisle should ever \nquestion his motive, and his motive is as good as gold even though you \ncan reasonably disagree with his method. He has been of unusual help to \nme and to Sharon as we suffer the loss of our son. He has known much \nsuffering in his days, and I thank Senator Kennedy.\n\n  Finally, I must mention Arlen Specter, the subcommittee chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee that helps fund the mental health issues. \nFor a long time, he has found ways to fund programs to help with mental \nillnesses. And he has been helpful in a tight year with a tight budget \ntrying to find the resources that can be utilized for the authorization \nof funds this bill will provide.\n  Enough of those things, and now to the substantial.\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\n  Most of you can probably discern by now that my emotions are still \nsomewhat tender. I didn't volunteer to be a champion of this issue. But \nit arose out of the personal experience of being a parent who lost a \nchild to mental illness through suicide.\n  Last September, Sharon and I lost our son Garrett Lee Smith to a long \nbattle that he suffered from mental illness. He suffered emotional pain \nthat I cannot begin to comprehend, and he ultimately sought relief by \ntaking his life. While Sharon and I think about Garrett every day and \nmourn his loss, we take solace in the time we had with Garrett and say \nto all those who suffer the loss of loved ones that the very best \nantedote for grief is the gratitude you had for your loved one for a \ntime on Earth. Sharon and I have committed ourselves each in our own \nway to preserving Garrett's memory by trying to help others so that \nother families and children do not suffer a similar fate.\n  Sharon and I adopted Garrett a few days after his birth. He was a \nbeautiful child, a handsome baby boy.\n  Forgive me.\n  He was thoughtful of everyone around him as he grew older. His life, \nhowever, began to dim in his elementary years. He struggled to spell. \nHis reading and writing were stuck in the rudiments. We had him tested \nand were surprised to learn that he had an unusually high IQ, but he \nstruggled with a severe overlay of learning disabilities, including \ndyslexia.\n  However, it would be many years later until we learned how extensive \nhis true illness was because of his diagnosis, which was a bipolar \ncondition. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is \na brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person's mood, energy, \nand ability to function. Different from normal ups and downs that we \nall experience, the symptoms of bipolar disorder are severe. People who \nsuffer from bipolar experience swings from manic highs where sleep and \neating are not desired, to deep catastrophic depressions where simply \ngetting out of bed can be too much of a challenge.\n  In the United States, more than 2 million American adults suffer from \nbipolar disorder. This illness typically develops in late adolescence \nor early childhood. However, some people have their first symptoms \nduring childhood, while others develop them late in life. It can be a \ndebilitating illness. And, as in Garrett's case, it can lead to worse \ntragedies.\n  As his parents, we knew how long and how desperately Garrett had \nsuffered from his condition and his very dark depression. While we knew \nintuitively that suicide was possible in his case, there are simply no \nparental preparations adequate for this crisis in one's own child, no \nowner's manual to help one in burying a child, especially when the \ncause is suicide.\n\n  So I have committed myself to trying to find meaning in Garrett's \nlife by helping to pass, with the help of my colleagues, an important \nfirst step to ending the epidemic of youth suicide. It is no small \ntask, but one that I believe should be a top priority of this Congress \nbecause every year approximately 30,000 Americans commit suicide in the \nUnited States--a number that is almost twice as high as the number of \nhomicides in our country. Almost 700,000 Americans are treated in \nhospitals every year for self-inflicted wounds and attempted suicides. \nBut keep in mind these figures don't tell the whole story. They do not \naccount for the families, the friends, the coworkers who are affected \nby each suicide. Suicide and attempts do not simply leave an impression \non the individual's life, it leaves a deep impact on everyone who knows \nthe person or a family member of that person.\n  America's youth are committing suicide at staggering rates. Suicide \nis the third leading cause of death for people age 10 to 24 years--the \nthird leading cause. That is why this bill, at Mike DeWine's \nsuggestion, named the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, is so vitally \nimportant. It takes the first significant step toward creating and \nfunding an organized effort at the Federal and State levels to prevent \nand intervene when youth are at risk for mental and behavioral \nconditions that can lead to suicide.\n  The loss of life to suicide at any age is tragic and traumatic. But \nwhen it happens to someone who has just begun life, has just begun to \nfulfill their potential, the impact somehow seems harsher, sadder, more \nout of season, more tragic.\n  Garrett had just begun to reach his potential. His big smile and \ngenerous spirit allowed him to befriend everyone, popular or not. \nWisely or not, his mother and I showered him with creature comforts as \nyet another way to show him that we loved him and that we valued him. \nBut as a testament to his character, we later found out that much of \nwhat we gave him in a material way he readily gave to others less \nfortunate.\n  He also wanted to accomplish three things in life. He wanted to be an \nEagle Scout, he wanted to graduate from high school, and he wanted to \nserve his church on a mission. He accomplished those three things, \nlargely because of the efforts of his angel mother. He loved his \nmission companions, he loved his church, he deeply loved his Savior, \nand a chance of serving others in his name. Unfortunately, his struggle \nagainst his periods of deep depression became too much. We sought out \nhelp from school and church counselors, psychologists, and ultimately a \npsychiatrist. But words of encouragement, prayers earnestly offered, \nand the latest medical prescriptions could not repair our son's hard-\nwiring defects.\n  Garrett's bipolar condition was a cancer to him, as lethal as \nleukemia to anyone else. It filled his spirit with hopelessness and \nclouded his future in darkness. He saw only despair ahead and felt only \npain in the present, pain and despair so potent that he sought suicide \nas a refuge, a release. The bill I offer today with these great \ncolleagues, Republican and Democrat alike, is intended to help other \npeople who suffer from mental illnesses that are so devastating it \nplaces them at risk for taking their own lives. No family should \nexperience the pain we have suffered and no child should face the \nchallenges of mental illness alone.\n\n  When signed into law, this bill will authorize $60 million over 3 \nyears to create a system focused on establishing in each State a \nstatewide early intervention and prevention strategy. It ensures that \n85 percent of the funding will be provided to the entities focused on \nidentifying and preventing suicide at the State and community levels. \nEntities apply to the State for funding and can utilize a variety of \noptions to implement the tenets of statewide strategy.\n  One option that Sharon and I have recently championed in our own \nhometown is the Columbia University Teen Screen Program. We have chosen \nto endow this program in our community in our son's memory, in the town \nof Pendleton, OR, from which I hail.\n  All sixth graders who have their parents' consent will be screened \neach year for mental illnesses that can lead to suicide and they will \nreceive referrals for treatment. Our hope in sponsoring this program is \nto help as many children as possible at as early an age, as young as \npossible, because if we identify mental illness early, we may be able \nto prevent thousands upon thousands of youth suicides.\n  The bill also authorizes the Suicide Prevention Resource Centers that \nwill provide technical assistance to States and local grantees to \nensure they are able to implement their statewide early intervention \nand prevention strategies. It also will collect the data related to the \nprograms, evaluate the effectiveness of the program, and identify and \ndistribute best practices to other States around the country. Sharing \ntechnical data and program best practices is necessary to ensure that \nFederal funding is being utilized in the best manner possible. That \ninformation is being circulated among participants.\n  Finally, the bill will provide funding to help colleges and \nuniversities establish mental health programs or enhance existing \nmental health programs focused on increasing access to and enhancing \nthe range of mental and behavioral health services for students.\n  Entering college can be one of the most disruptive and demanding \ntimes of a young person's life, but for persons with mental illnesses \nthe challenges can be overwhelming. Loss of their parental support \nsystem, familiar and easily accessible health care providers can often \nbecome too much of a burden to bear. That is why we have, for the first \ntime, focused Federal funding on improving the support structures \navailable at our colleges and universities.\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\n  I simply say with emphasis to my colleagues, we have a suicide \nepidemic on American university campuses because kids leave their homes \nand need support structures. As in the case of our son, when you are \nnot there and they do not have someone to fall back on, sometimes the \nmost innocent kinds of disappointments for you and me can be life \nending to them. These are the kinds of situations which we hope to \nbetter predict.\n  I say in conclusion, the components of this bill will ensure that we \nbegin to address the staggering problem of youth suicide. I am pleased \nto be a champion of this cause, not because I volunteered for it but \nbecause I have suffered over it. This bill, with the support of my \ncolleagues, will be a marvelous beginning to say to the American \nmothers and fathers, we care about you, we know your struggles, we know \nyour suffering, and we are trying to help.\n  Where you cannot be there, we are going to do our level best to make \nsure there are professionals, there are people to help, so we can put \nan end to this epidemic and let our youth know that mental illness is \nnot something from which they should shrink but something about which \nthey should seek help.\n  If we do this, my colleagues, I assure you, whatever else we may or \nmay not accomplish in this Congress, we can leave here with pride that \nwe did a very good thing for the young men and women of the United \nStates of America. I urge the passage of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. As my friend from Oregon knows, my father committed \nsuicide. My situation was totally different than that experienced by my \nfriend from Oregon. With my dad there was nothing that had happened \nthat suggested a problem.\n  I went to watch Muhammad Ali work out, spent the morning with \nMuhammad Ali. I had a wonderful time. I took somebody who was working \nwith me. Two of us were alone with Muhammad Ali for a long time. I \nreturned to my office and walked in the door. Joan was the \nreceptionist. I can still see her. This was many years ago. She said: \nYour mother is on the phone. I picked up the phone and she said: Your \npop shot himself.\n  My dad had killed himself at home in Searchlight. For a long time, I \nwas embarrassed; I did not know how to handle that. I, of course, \nacknowledged my dad was dead but like most people who deal with \nsuicide, it takes a while to accept that.\n  My acceptance came many years later when I was part of the Aging \nCommittee in the Senate. Bill Cohen was the chairman. We had a hearing \non senior depression. Mike Wallace, a reporter on ``60 Minutes,'' \ntestified before the committee. He said: A lot of times I wanted to \ndie. I did the most dangerous things I could do, hoping that maybe \nsomething would happen that I would not return. He said: But you know, \nI now take a little bit of medication; I had the opportunity to talk to \nsomeone and I no longer feel that way.\n  So I shared, for the first time ever publicly, what happened to my \ndad. My dad was 56 or 57 years old, much younger than most members in \nthe Senate. I said at that time to Chairman Cohen that I thought we \nshould have a hearing on senior suicide. I shared, for the first time, \nthe story of my dad's death.\n  I didn't know Garrett. Gordon didn't know my dad. My dad was a person \nwho, as we look back, had been depressed his whole life. I cannot give \na long dialog about my dear dad other than to say he was a very strong, \nphysical person, bigger than I am, bigger than his four sons. He never \nlifted a weight, but with his shirt off at the age he was, people would \nthink he had lifted weights. He had big arms, a big chest. He was very \nstrong.\n  He didn't like to be around people, only his family. About a week \nbefore he killed himself, we came out to visit him in Searchlight. My \ndad did not have much in the way of material possessions, but he had \none thing for which he was very proud. It was a specimen.\n\n  My dad worked hard all of his life, never made any money doing \nanything, but he worked like a dog. One time he had a lease on a mine \nand he found some very rich ore at the Blossom. The vein was very \nsmall. It was in a talc-like formation, and it assayed at $18,000 a \nton. He got a few sacks of this. It was in such small quantities you \ncould not even fill up a truck with it.\n  He saved a specimen. All he had left was a specimen; that was \nvaluable to him, at least. Approximately a week before he died, he gave \nit to me. It was unlike my dad. But, of course, as I look back, he had \nbeen planning what he was going to do for some time. His health was not \ngood and he had miner's consumption, and I am sure other problems. He \nsmoked like a chimney all of his life. He coughed every night when I \nwas a little boy. I thought all kids' dads coughed like my dad.\n  But had this legislation, introduced by my friend, been in effect, my \ndad may not have had all the problems he had as he proceeded through \nlife. Suicide is an American tragedy. We know that at least 31,000 \nAmericans every year kill themselves. We know that because those are \nthe deaths that we can say: This was a suicide. But there are, I \nbelieve, thousands of others--automobile accidents, hiking accidents--\nthat are really suicides.\n  So we have done a few things since my work with Senator Cohen. We are \nnow studying, for the first time--it is hard to comprehend this--but \nfor first time in the history of this country, we are trying to figure \nout why people kill themselves. We do not know for sure. One of the \nphenomenons is that most of the suicides are in the western part of the \nUnited States. We do not know why. You would think just the opposite, \nwith the Sun shining and the wide open spaces. But we are studying \nthat. The Surgeon General of the United States has stated it is a \nnational problem.\n  I want my friend from Oregon to understand how important it is that \nhe is stepping forward on this issue. Landra and I attended Garrett's \nfuneral. We were so impressed because no one--no one--tried to mask \nwhat happened to Garrett Smith. Every speaker talked about this fine \nyoung man. Some of the speakers had known him his whole life. But there \nwas not a single speaker who tried to make an excuse or cover up the \nfact that this young man had taken his own life.\n  You see, we have come a long way. After my dad died, killed himself, \nI bought a book on suicide. It was not long ago that you could not bury \nsomeone who committed suicide in a cemetery. Most religions would not \naccept and allow the normal religious ceremonies to take place if \nsomebody had killed themselves. We have gone beyond that in most every \ninstance, and that is good.\n  I want the Senator from Oregon to know how I appreciate his moving \nforward on this national problem. Nevada leads the Nation in suicide. I \nbelieve that anything we can do to focus attention on this problem is \ngoing to be of benefit to so many people.\n  Since this situation with my dad in the committee, we now have a \nnational organization. They have a full-time lobbyist now. SCAN is the \nname of the organization. Their whole existence is based on dealing \nwith the suicide problem that faces this country.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Oregon, I say for the third \ntime, moving forward on this issue. It is a happy day and a sad day \nbecause, as life is, I do not focus on that day when my dad--I went out \nand saw my dad on the bed where he had killed himself. I do not focus \non that, but I did today, and it is good for me that I did focus on it.\n\n  It is good for us that we focus on this. I used to think suicides \nhappened to other people, but they happen to us. There are so many \npeople who I come in contact with who have had a father, a mother--I \nhad a wonderful TV reporter in Las Vegas--and you know it is all \nbusiness with these journalists--who said to me once: Could I talk to \nyou sometime alone? I said: Sure. She told me about the fact that her \nbrother committed suicide, her father committed suicide. This story did \nnot end there. She called me later, after we had our private \nconversation; her own sister then killed herself.\n  Suicide is an illness of which we have to get ahold. It is something \nthat does not happen to others; it happens to us.\n  I am so glad I was able to hear the heartfelt remarks of the Senator \nfrom Oregon today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Smith, for his statement and also for the work he has done in \nputting together this legislation. I ask unanimous consent to be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also compliment my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Reid, for his statement. I have a similar experience. \nMy father also committed suicide. I am not going to go into the \ndetails, but it is a lot of pain. It is very evidenced by the pain in \nthe expression by Senator Smith and Senator Reid that this is a very \nserious problem throughout our country. It is a serious problem, as \nSenator Smith has experienced, unfortunately, particularly with \nteenagers.\n  For teenagers, this is a problem that most people cannot comprehend. \nI did know Garrett. Garrett was a troubled young man with mental \nillness. He was also a very fortunate young man because he had \noutstanding and loving parents. He had an angel for a father and a \nmother, and he received more love than most children would ever dream \nof receiving. Now maybe he is in some ways giving a gift to the country \nbecause Senator Smith, in trying to rationalize maybe, combat this very \nserious problem, is trying to tackle it nationally. I have no doubt as \na result of us passing this legislation we will end up saving a lot of \nlives, maybe thousands of lives. So I just want to associate myself \nwith my very good friend Gordon Smith but thank and compliment him \nbecause we will never know--we will never know--did this save someone's \nlife somewhere in Oregon or Oklahoma or Nevada or New York because \nthere are a lot of troubled kids out there, frankly, who have not \nreceived the attention they need. Maybe it will also lead to greater \nresearch in combating suicide as a whole because it is a big problem \nthroughout this country for many ages, particularly for teenagers.\n  I compliment Senator Smith for the love and attention and focus both \nhe and Sharon focused on Garrett. Garrett was a very fortunate young \nman to have such loving parents. The Senate is very fortunate, our \ncountry is very fortunate, to have his leadership on this very \ndifficult, sensitive issue for them and, frankly, for our country. I \ncompliment him for his work and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank both of my \ncolleagues from Nevada and Oklahoma as well. Their remarks were very \nmoving today. In the midst of all these other matters we debate and \ndiscuss--matters we think are of such great and global and national \nimportance--I don't think anything we have listened to has been as \nimportant as the comments that have been made by our good friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Gordon Smith, and my good friends and \ncolleagues, Harry Reid and Don Nickles. I was aware of the circumstance \nof my friend from Nevada. I was not aware of the circumstance of my \nfriend from Oklahoma. I appreciate both of them adding their voices \ntoday to this discussion. Particularly, though, I think we all feel a \nspecial bond with Senator Smith and what he and his lovely wife Sharon \nhave gone through. I commend him for his courage and determination to \nshare his story with us and the country today.\n  Time does heal wounds. I suspect my friend from Nevada and friend \nfrom Oklahoma still feel tremendous pain, and I suppose that time does \nremove some of the bitterness. But we know that our friend from Oregon \nlost his son only a matter of months ago, and we know the fact that he \ncame to me, to Mike DeWine and Senator Reed, to others, asking with \ngreat determination if there was a way to clear the legislation before \nus this year. I am so glad that he came to us. I will forever remember \nthe hour or so we spent--not many weeks ago--talking about this \nlegislation in my office and trying to find a way to clear it. Gordon, \nit is because of you that we are here today.\n  I commend the majority leader and the Democratic leader and others \nfor insisting that we find some time here to allow this legislation to \nbe considered and, I believe, adopted unanimously by our colleagues. I \nknow the other body is considering legislation as well.\n  If I could, I would like to spend a couple of minutes speaking about \nthis important issue, and I hope this time maybe there are people \nlistening. I know occasionally people follow C-SPAN. There are probably \ntimes when they wonder why they are watching us at all, but maybe \ntoday, as a result of our conversation and the tremendous remarks by \nour colleagues who have talked about this issue in very personal terms, \nin addition to the underlying legislation, there will be people \nlistening whose lives might be transformed. My admiration for the three \nof our colleagues who have spoken today, particularly our colleague \nfrom Oregon, is unlimited. He has done a great service, if nothing \nelse, by sharing his story with America. That has great value.\n\n  There are people listening to this who I know full well are going \nthrough similar circumstances and wondering how to cope, or a child out \nthere who may be wondering whether anyone can pay any attention to his \nor her needs, or trying to find a place he or she can go to try and \nresolve these conflicts. I think this discussion is a worthy one for \nthis historic Chamber to be engaged in.\n  Adolescent years are the most difficult in many ways. We spend a lot \nof time talking about early childhood development, and rightfully so. \nThose are formative years in a child's life. There is much more we \ncould do to try and assist parents and young children beginning the \njourney of life to get it right from the beginning. And we spend a \ngreat deal of time talking about higher education, talking about the \ncost and getting jobs and the like. Certainly that has great value as \nwell. However, we don't spend enough time talking about those \nadolescent years, those middle years from age six to 24. I can think of \nonly a few instances where we have actually had hearings and talked \nabout the problems of adolescents, those tremendously changing years \nthat can be so terribly complex for an individual of that age.\n  I hope that as a result this discussion, the legislation we are \nintroducing will have some ability, some impact, maybe, in focusing our \nattention on those questions. Let me go back and, first of all, again \nthank my colleague Senator Mike DeWine, with whom I have worked on this \nissue, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who has done a tremendous job as well \non this legislation, and my colleague Richard Durbin of Illinois, who \nwants to be added as a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that he be \nadded as a cosponsor to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. As has been pointed out by our friend from Oregon, suicide \namong our Nation's young people is an acute crisis that knows no \nsocioeconomic boundaries. My State of Connecticut, as well as all other \nstates in the nation, suffer from this tragedy. In fact, my hometown of \nEast Haddam, Connecticut--a small rural community of 8,000 people--has \nnot been immune.\n  In 2001, I chaired the first Congressional hearing on youth suicide, \nand I was alarmed at the disturbing statistics that were read at that \nhearing. Well, those statistics have not changed and they are worth \nrepeating again today. According to the most recent data from the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 3,000 young people--\n10 percent of all suicides--take their lives in the United States every \nyear. It is the third overall cause of death between the ages of 10 and \n24. Young people under the age of 25 account for 15 percent of all \nsuicides completed. In fact, more children and young adults die from \ntheir own hand than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, \nstroke, and chronic lung disease combined.\n  Equally alarming are the numbers of young people who consider taking \nor attempt to take their own lives. Again, recent CDC figures estimate \nalmost 3 million high school students or 20 percent of young adults \nbetween the ages of 15 to 19 consider suicide each year, and over 2 \nmillion children and young adults actually attempt suicide. Simply put, \nthese figures are totally unacceptable and of a crisis proportion.\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\n  Sadly, we rarely find these facts disseminated widely among public \naudiences. We rarely read them in newspapers or hear them on \ntelevision. Individual cases, yes, but not the national numbers.\n  We know youth suicide is integrally linked to mental health issues \nsuch as depression and substance abuse. Yet we also know all too well \nthat both youth suicide and children's mental health continue to carry \nan unfortunate stigma, a stigma that all too often keeps these crucial \nissues unspoken and discourages children and young adults from seeking \nthe help they so desperately need.\n  We have a societal obligation to break through this stigma attached \nto youth suicide and children's mental health. Again, the comments of \nour colleagues this afternoon have taken a major step in that \ndirection. When people in public life can address these issues in \npublic forums and talk about them in personal terms, then they help us \nbreak down the barriers and stigmas that exist. That is why I feel so \nstrongly about the willingness of our colleagues today, particularly \nSenator Smith, to share their personal thoughts with us.\n  We also have a societal obligation to instill in our young people a \nsense of value, of self-worth and resilience. All too often children \nand young adults considering suicide lose sight of themselves, their \ntalents, their potential in life, and all too often they lose sight of \nthe love their families, friends, and communities have for them, as our \nfriend from Oregon so eloquently described.\n  I am pleased our Nation has already taken positive steps toward \nbetter understanding the tragedy of youth suicide and its emotional and \nbehavioral risk factors. Several recent reports like the President's \nNew Freedom Commission on Mental Health, the National Strategy for \nSuicide Prevention, and the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent \nSuicide have made youth suicide a top national public and mental health \npriority.\n  Today hundreds of community-based programs across the country offer a \nvariety of early intervention and prevention services to thousands of \nchildren and young adults--services that include comprehensive \nscreening, assessment, and individualized counseling. Every State and \nmany tribal nations have begun developing or already have implemented a \nyouth suicide early intervention and prevention strategy that \ncoordinates appropriate services in schools, juvenile justice systems, \nfoster care systems, mental health programs, substance abuse programs, \nand other youth-oriented settings.\n  Furthermore, the Federal Government has stepped up in its role in \nboth supporting these community-based activities and conducting \nrelevant research and data collection. Several mental health and public \nhealth agencies have shown a great interest in youth suicide, including \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. However, \ndespite these important gains, we still face significant challenges.\n  Today a large number of States, localities, tribes, and service \nproviders are finding themselves with unprecedented budget deficits, \nmaking the establishment of new services and the retention of existing \nservices increasingly more difficult.\n  Furthermore, youth suicide early intervention and prevention \nstrategies are often underfunded or understaffed to be properly \neffective. And while a number of Federal agencies have supported youth \nsuicide activities, there have been no comprehensive interagency \nstrategies implemented to share data, disseminate research, or evaluate \nthe efficacy of youth suicide early intervention and prevention \nprograms.\n  Today I am introducing bipartisan legislation with my colleagues \nSenators Mike DeWine, Jack Reed, Gordon Smith, Harry Reid, and Dick \nDurbin, named in memory of Garrett Lee Smith. This legislation further \nsupports the good work being done at the community level, the State \nlevel, and the Federal level with regard to youth suicide, early \nintervention and prevention in four principal ways.\n  First, it establishes new grant initiatives for the further \ndevelopment and expansion of youth suicide early intervention and \nprevention strategies and the community-based services they seek to \ncoordinate.\n  Second, it authorizes a dedicated technical assistance center to \nassist States, localities, tribes, and community service providers with \nplanning, implementation, and evaluation of these strategies and \nservices.\n  Third, it establishes a new grant initiative to enhance and improve \nearly intervention and prevention services specifically designed for \ncollege-age students.\n  And last, it creates a new interagency collaboration to focus on \npolicy development and the dissemination of data specifically \npertaining to youth suicide. I continue to believe that funding for \nconcrete, comprehensive, and effective remedies for the epidemic of \nyouth suicide cannot be done by lawmakers on Capitol Hill alone. They \nmust also come from individuals, such as doctors, psychiatrists, \npsychologists, counselors, nurses, teachers, advocates, clergymen, \nsurvivors, and affected families who are dedicated to this issue or \nspend each day with children and young adults who suffer from illnesses \nrelated to youth suicide.\n  I believe we have made an important first step with this legislation \ntoday. That step has been implemented by the comments of my colleagues \non the floor of the Senate. However, I also know that our work is not \ndone. I sincerely hope that as a society we can continue to work \ncollectively both to understand better the tragedy of this incredible \nproblem of youth suicide and to develop innovative and effective and \npublic mental health initiatives that reach every child and young adult \nin this great Nation of ours, compassionate initiatives to give them \nencouragement, hope, and love, and most important, life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first congratulate my colleagues \nfrom Nevada and Oklahoma for their very moving statements in regard to \ntheir dads. Let me also say to my colleague from Oregon that his \nstatement was certainly one of the most moving statements I think any \nof us have ever heard in this Senate Chamber. Our hearts, collectively \nas Senators, continue to go out to our colleague and Sharon for the \nloss of Garrett.\n  Senator Smith and Sharon have taken their tragedy, the pain of this \ntragedy, the loss of Garrett and there is nothing in the world worse \nthan the loss of a child--and focused it on trying to do good. We see \nit today with this legislation for which Senator Smith has been such a \nstrong advocate. We are on the Senate floor, frankly, because of him. \nWe would not have been to this point without him, without his advocacy. \nWe saw it in the testimony when Senator Smith and Sharon came to our \ncommittee hearing that Senator Dodd and I held several months ago. They \npublicly talked about Garrett's death; they talked about him and talked \nabout the issue. Senator Smith described earlier the community teen \nscreening with sixth graders in Pendleton that they have established. \nSo they are courageous. They have taken this immense pain and, in spite \nof that, in the face of that, they are doing something very positive.\n  Those of us in the Senate are blessed and we are burdened with the \nopportunity to use the bully pulpit of the Senate to focus public \nattention on issues. I say to my colleague that there are many parents, \ntragically, as he knows, who have suffered as he and Sharon have this \nyear. He has the unique opportunity--and has taken that, as he is in a \npublic spotlight; it is a burden he has, but he has taken that burden \nand done something with it. What he has done with it is he has taken \nthat spotlight and used the bully pulpit of the Senate to talk to the \nAmerican people about this issue. Many people today will watch this and \nmany more will read about it tomorrow. There are many people who read \nabout the committee hearing we held, and they heard when Senator Smith \nand his wife talked about this issue. Many people they will never know \nhave been impacted, or maybe they were alerted to a problem they might \nhave with their child, and maybe parents\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\nwere given inspiration and encouragement to seek help. These are things \nthat individuals don't ever know about. But I know, and we all know, \nthat what they have done has truly made a difference. This bill will \ntruly make a difference.\n\n  I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Jack Reed for their work. This bill \nwe are introducing today is a combination of two bills. One was \nintroduced by Senator Reed as the lead sponsor. It was his idea; he \ntook the lead. I was the Republican cosponsor. We introduced a bill. \nThe other bill was Senator Dodd's bill. He was the lead on that, and I \nwas the cosponsor. We worked on that bill together. This is a \ncombination of those two bills that we bring to the floor today.\n  I also thank Senator Harry Reid for his great support and his work. I \nthank the majority leader. I thank Senator Daschle and I thank Senator \nGregg. They all have been very supportive. We thank them for allowing \nus to bring this bill to the floor today.\n  We have held hearings on the mental health concerns of youth and \nchildren. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services, I have been able to do this. The one hearing we talked \nabout, Senator Dodd cochaired with me. At the hearing on youth suicide, \nit became clear that thorough and actionable plans are needed to deal \nwith this issue affecting our children and young adults.\n  At that hearing, as I indicated, Senator Smith, supported by his wife \nSharon, courageously shared the story of their son Garrett. They told \nof his struggle, their family's brave struggle with his depression, and \nGarrett's struggle with that depression, a battle that he tragically \nlost this past September. In honor of their son, Gordon and Sharon are \ndedicated to helping other youth and their families who are struggling \nwith mental illness.\n  At that same hearing in March, the Reverend Dr. Paul Tunkle \ncourageously spoke of the loss of his daughter. Reverend Tunkle is an \nEpiscopal priest now serving in Baltimore. His wife Judy is a \npsychotherapist. Their daughter Althea, or Lea to those close to her, \nbegan to exhibit symptoms of psychological problems when she was in \ngrade school. She began to experience additional problems as she began \nher university studies. Her grades began to suffer. Exacerbating her \nmental health problems, Lea was raped while away at school. After \nattempting suicide twice, Lea killed herself on her third attempt at \nthe age of 22.\n  Tragically, these stories that we have heard are not uncommon. \nStatistics tell us that approximately every 2 hours a person under the \nage of 25 commits suicide. We also know that from 1952 to 1995 the rate \nof suicide in children and young adults in this country tripled, and \nthat between 1980 and 1997 the rate of suicide in 15- to 19-year-olds \nincreased by 11 percent.\n  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide was the \n11th leading overall cause of death in the United States in the year \n2001; however, it was the third leading cause of death for youths aged \n15 to 24. Shockingly, we also know that suicides outnumber homicides 3 \nto 2 for the overall population. These alarming numbers emphasize the \nneed for early intervention or prevention efforts. Too often, the signs \nmay be subtle or hidden until it is too late. While research has \ncreated improved medications and methods for helping those with mental \nhealth problems to recover, there is still much work to be done in \nidentifying those who need help.\n  Study has been done in identifying and categorizing the risk factors \nrelated to suicide. In children and youth, these are known to include \ndepression, alcohol or drug use, physical or sexual abuse, and \ndisruptive behavior. Of people who die from and who attempt suicide, \nmany suffer from co-occurring mental health and substance abuse \ndisorders. Children with these risk factors, as well as children who \nare known to be in situations at risk for acquiring them, should be \nincluded in comprehensive State plans.\n  Children and youth specifically addressed in State plans should \ninclude those who attend school, including colleges and universities, \nthose already receiving substance abuse and mental health services, and \nthose involved in the juvenile justice system, as well as those in \nfoster care.\n  We also learned at our hearing that our colleges and universities are \nsuffering under an ever-growing caseload and they need additional \nresources to help students in these critical years. We know that \nsuicide is the second leading cause of death in college students today, \nand reports indicate there has been a dramatic increase in college \nstudents seeking care at campus counseling centers.\n  From 1992 to the year 2002, Big Ten Schools, for example, noticed a \n42-percent increase in the number of students seen at these counseling \ncenters. Surveys conducted over the past decade suggest the prevalence \nof depression among college students is growing and eclipses the rate \nof the general public. Many public and private schools have been \ndealing with budget crises recently which do not allow them to respond \nadequately for this growth in need. In fact, last year 27 percent of \ncounseling centers reported cuts to their budgets.\n  The accreditation standards for university and college counseling \ncenters recommend that the counselor-to-student ratio be 1 counselor \nper 1,000 to 1,500 students; however, alarmingly, the 2003 ratio in \nschools with over 15,000 students is instead 1 counselor per 2,500 \nstudents, and that is a problem. Due to these numbers, schools are \nreporting that students are forced to wait, sometimes days, to see a \ncounselor. In the year 2002, 116 college students committed suicide; \nhowever, only 20 of these students had been seen by a college counselor \nbefore the suicide.\n  As a result of the need for increased attention to the problem of \nsuicide and the need for increased access to help, Senators Dodd, \nSmith, Jack Reed, Harry Reid, and I are introducing the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act. This bill will provide grants to States, tribes, \nand State-designated nonprofit organizations to create statewide plans \nfor early intervention and prevention efforts in schools, juvenile \njustice systems, substance abuse programs, mental health programs, \nfoster care systems, and other child and youth support organizations. \nThese plans will seek to serve the children where the children are. \nThis bill will help ensure that States with youth suicide rates that \nare higher than the national average are given preference so they are \nbetter equipped to combat this tragic problem.\n\n  This act also will authorize a suicide prevention resource center. \nThis center will provide information, training, and technical \nassistance to States, tribes, and nonprofit organizations involved in \nsuicide prevention and intervention for a number of purposes, including \nthe development of suicide prevention strategies, studying the costs, \neffectiveness of statewide strategies, analyzing how well new and \nexisting suicide intervention techniques and technologies work, and \npromoting the sharing of data.\n  Further, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act would provide competitive \ngrants to institutions of higher education to create or expand mental \nand behavioral health services to students. These grants will help \nfinancially strapped college and university mental health centers \nobtain the necessary resources to serve the mental and behavioral \nhealth needs of the students.\n  Let me again thank my colleagues for their support of this very \nimportant legislation. Our children are simply too important to not \nproperly address their mental health needs. This is a good bill, and it \nis the right thing to do.\n  I add one final comment. I think this bill will be signed into law. \nThis bill will save lives. This bill will make a difference. I thank \neveryone who has worked so hard on it. I thank my colleague again for \nbeing the spark behind this. He has been the person who has been \ntalking to Members, getting their support, making the plea. I thank him \nso very much for doing it.\n  We are going to pass this bill and it is going to make a difference, \nbut there is something else we should be doing, and that is the Mental \nHealth Parity Act. This Senate, this Congress, must get around to this \nbill. That bill also will save lives. It will make a difference. It \nwill make mental health services available to people.\n  I see my colleague from New Mexico, who just walked into the Chamber. \nHe has been an advocate for this bill. The time is ripe for the Mental \nHealth Parity Act to come to the Senate floor, to\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nbe voted on, and to be passed. I thank my colleagues. I thank the \nChair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators Smith, Dodd, \nDeWine, and Reid, to discuss the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act which \nwill be introduced today. I thank and commend them.\n  I particularly commend Senator Gordon Smith. We are here today \nliterally because he has worked tirelessly to bring this legislation to \nthe Senate floor, to work with us and to advocate strenuously that this \nlegislation come to the floor of the Senate today. It is rightfully \ndesignated the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act.\n  Garrett, unfortunately, struggled for years and sadly took his own \nlife last September. We heard this afternoon the heartfelt words of his \nfather talking about this wonderful young man. We all sense that as \nGarrett struggled, he did it with loving and caring parents.\n  As my colleague Senator DeWine pointed out, the Smiths have taken \ntheir pain and transformed it into purposeful action to ensure that \nother families and other young people do not have to suffer and endure \neven today the pain that lingers at the loss of this fine young man, \nand I thank the Senator for his leadership and for his decent and \ngallant heart.\n  We are here today because we are responding to an extraordinary \nproblem, a problem that seems to many of us to be difficult to \ncomprehend: why a young person, in the prime of life, with so much \nahead, would take their own life.\n  Sadly, suicide takes the lives of over 4,000 children and young \nadults each year. It is now the third leading cause of death among 10 \nto 24 year olds in America. The rate of suicide has tripled from 1952 \nto 1995. Yet despite the astounding statistics, we still do not fully \nunderstand what is driving so many young people to the extreme of \ntaking their own life.\n  What we hope to achieve with this legislation is to show them that \nthere is an answer, that suicide is not the way out, that there is help \nfor whatever is troubling them, and that they can live lives that are \nfull, happy, and complete.\n  A Chronicle of Higher Education survey found that rates for \ndepression in college freshmen are on the rise. Without treatment, the \nChronicle points out, depressed adolescents are at risk for social \nfailure, social isolation, promiscuity, self-medication with drugs and \nalcohol, and suicide. That is a description of failure, not a \ndescription of successful living.\n  A 2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center Directors found that \n85 percent of counseling centers on college campuses are reporting an \nincrease in the number of students in need of services.\n  Mr. President, 81 percent were concerned that increasing numbers of \nstudents are there with severe psychological problems; 67 percent \nreported a need for more psychiatric services, and 63 percent reported \nproblems with growing demand for services without an appropriate \nincrease in resources. That is why, working with Senator DeWine, \nworking with my colleagues Senator Dodd and Senator Smith, we have \nincorporated in this act support for college counseling centers. It is \nnot coincidental that Garrett was beginning his first year at the \nUniversity of Utah, had left home, was in a new environment, was \nstruggling with all of the powerful forces of independence and of \nchange young people experience when they go off to school. That is a \nparticularly vulnerable time.\n  We understand college is a time of great intellectual development, \nbut it is also a time of extraordinary personal and interpersonal \ngrowth and change. When children go off to college, we need to make \nsure they have the support they need during this critical transitional \nperiod.\n  Additionally, there are many adults going to college and they have a \nparticular dilemma of balancing their studies with their family \nresponsibilities. Yet campus after campus lacks the resources to \nsupport their counseling staffs to deal with these real issues, these \nreal psychological issues.\n  Part of what we seek to do through the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act \nis ensure colleges and universities around the country have the \nresources to reach out to students, to provide essential mental and \nbehavioral health services, and to educate families about potential \nsigns of trouble.\n  Part of this process is not only treating the youngster, it is making \nparents aware of these signs so they can intervene successfully and in \na timely fashion. Our colleges and universities are struggling to \naddress the wide range of problems experienced by students--drug and \nalcohol problems, eating disorders, depression, schizophrenia, suicide \nattempts. With insufficient resources, many schools offer limited or \nvery cursory services to students. We hope to begin to change that with \nthis legislation.\n  We hope through this legislation to begin to shine a light on the \ngrowing problem of youth suicide. This legislation provides resources \nand technical assistance to States to develop and implement robust \nearly intervention and suicide prevention strategies across the Nation. \nIt also seeks to address the overwhelming need for mental and \nbehavioral health services on college campuses, as I have discussed. \nThis is an important bipartisan measure and a tribute, a fitting \ntribute to Garrett and to the faith and dedication and decency of the \nSmith family, Gordon and Sharon.\n  I again express my thanks to Senator Dodd and Senator DeWine. When \nyou look at legislation in this body that attempts to provide practical \nsupport and help to young people, you usually find two names on the \nlegislation--Dodd and DeWine. It is always a privilege to join these \ngentlemen.\n  I also want to thank Senator Harry Reid, who spoke movingly of his \nown experience, the death of his father through suicide. Senator Don \nNickles similarly gave a moving tribute to Sharon and Gordon. Let me \nalso thank Dr. Harsh Trivedi, a fellow in my office, a psychiatrist who \nis now on a fellowship up in Boston. He did most of the work on the \nCampus Care and Counseling Act, which is the legislation incorporated \nin this act. I also thank Lisa German of my staff, who does so much to \nhelp us on these issues, and also Catherine Finley on Senator Smith's \nstaff, who has been of remarkable help and assistance.\n\n  Let me thank the leadership, Senator Daschle, Senator Frist, Senator \nReid, Senator Nickles, because they let us bring this bill to the floor \ntoday to move forward to pass it.\n  This is an example of the kind of work we can do when we work \ntogether, the kind of work the American people demand of us. It is, as \nI said, a fitting tribute to Garrett and I hope an enduring tribute to \nhis father who worked so hard to get it to the floor today and to pass \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the leadership on the majority side asked if \nwe could move the vote to an earlier time tonight, rather than have the \ncloture vote in the morning. I am sorry to report that the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Carper, has indicated he will not agree with that. \nAll other Members on our side have agreed to the vote tonight. It is \nnow set for the morning.\n  I apologize to all my colleagues that we cannot do this tonight. \nThere are a lot of things Members have to do tonight, and especially \ntomorrow. It would save everyone a lot of time.\n  I want the record to reflect that I think it is unwise that that is \nthe case. I told my friend from Delaware I would indicate he is the \nproblem with our having the vote earlier.\n  I apologize, because I have had a number of calls from Senators on \nthis side of the aisle. We thought we were going to be able to work \nthat out, but we have been unable to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                     Campus Care and Counseling Act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I first want to say to Senator Smith, I \nwant you to know that since we weren't going to do anything today, I \nhad gone home. I don't live very far, so it is not a terrible \nsacrifice. But I was in less than good clothes, starting a restful \nevening a little early when I heard what was going on and I decided to \nquickly--maybe I look that way--dress up and come over here, after I \nheard you speak.\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\n  Let me say to you, I am very proud of you. I am not totally familiar \nwith the bill, but I hope you will make me a cosponsor. I ask consent \nthat Senator Hutchison be made a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to talk to the Senate today about a very sad \nsituation. I want to address these remarks at a couple of Republicans, \nwhose names I don't know, but I will soon, who have holds on the most \nimportant bill that has to do with mental illness in America. I am very \nhopeful we can carve out a niche as you desire, to try to give some \nhelp to those who are suffering so much that they commit suicide, and \nall of the various participants in that activity from mothers and \nfathers to doctors to counselors--everyone. I am hopeful we will get \nthat done.\n  Second, I didn't hear anyone mention, but I will mention to you, \nSenator, the doctors, the general practitioners who see thousands and \nthousands of our young teenage men and women who are most vulnerable. \nMaybe we need an annual crash course for them because they are not \nseeing the basic signals of mental illness in their patients. I tell \nyou, I am not a doctor and I am not a genius, but I can tell you, \nbecause I have already learned, what I would look for in a patient who \ncame to me for anything so I could rule out whether they had \ndepression; so I could rule out whether they were manic depressive, or \none of the other serious mental illnesses. But I am afraid we are going \nto have to start with some system of insisting that our doctors find \nout about it as the first and biggest clearance mechanism in the United \nStates.\n  Having said that, I want to discuss a little bit about the worst \nthing happening in the United States about mental illness. First, \nSenator Smith, you are speaking of the effect of mental illness. \nBecause someone is a depressive, they have an illness, and the illness \nmay or may not lead to suicide. But there are five major illnesses that \nare mental, and any of them might cause suicide. But the most important \nthing is all of them cause tremendous sorrow and tremendous grief and \ntremendous misunderstanding on the part of parents and friends of those \nwho have the disease.\n  I might say, Senators, we have at least moved away from the stigma \nand everybody is at least willing to talk about these as illnesses. \nEveryone is talking about how do we help rather than how do we hide.\n  Everyone is talking about getting these people who have symptoms to a \ngood doctor so they can get both discussions going and medicines that \nare so helpful. Everybody is talking about that. But, my friends, the \nreal problem is all children with these diseases are not the fortunate \nchildren of that Senator. They are the unfortunate children of poor \npeople, of people who make a little bit of money, with a loving mother \nand father and a schizophrenic child who perhaps are living on $25,000 \na year. The problem is they don't have enough money to have caregivers \nhelp them. Guess what. The insurance companies don't help them either \nbecause we have a definition of sick and illness in the insurance \npolicies that is 50 years old. They did not know anything about mental \nillness. So they ruled it out.\n  I don't know if you know this, but almost every group insurance \npolicy in America writes coverage for cancer, coverage for \ntuberculosis, and coverage for every major disease. But when it comes \nto mental illness, it is either stricken or it has an asterisk down at \nthe bottom. It gets significantly less coverage, or none.\n  There are parents who have given up on their children because they \ncannot pay the bills anymore. They go look for their children in the \nslums; they go look for their children in jails, because there are more \nchildren with mental illness in the jails of America than in the \nhospitals to take care of the mentally ill people. Why are they there? \nBecause nobody takes care of them. Why doesn't anybody take care of \nthem? Because most people went broke trying to take care of them.\n  Sitting up there at that desk is a bill called parity--equal--parity \nof insurance coverage for the mentally ill. It has been cleared on that \nside. It came out of committee. And somehow or other a couple of \nRepublican Senators have a hold on it. I will try to find out who they \nare and I will go beg them to let us pass the parity bill. But I tell \nyou: If it doesn't work, we are going to take it up. I know the leader \nwants to get bills through expeditiously. But I am going to tell him \ntonight, patience has run thin and we have to get it done. It has been \nworked through the committee chaired by Judd Gregg. He has one \namendment. That is great. He has at least told us he wants one hour. \nBut others are not even letting us know who they are, and they are \nholding up this bill.\n  Let me tell you what happened to America. America has the greatest \nmedicine, the greatest services, and the greatest caretaking machine \nfor the hearts of our people. If you have something wrong with your \nheart, they know how to take care of it. They will put you in a \nhospital. There is coverage by insurance if you have group insurance.\n  In the meantime, the tests, the knowledge, the information about \nheart conditions gets a lot of resources. Clinics are built and \nhospitals are built because there are resources because heart is \ncovered by insurance.\n  We take care of our hearts and we fail to take care of our heads, our \nbrains. We take care of our heart and spend money on it, and we will \nnot spend anything on mental illnesses. It is no longer a joke. It is \nno longer a stigma. Everybody around knows. Our President, as recently \nas 6 months ago, said, Don't bother me. I already know it is a disease. \nLet us find some way to help. That is what I say. If your bill does it, \nlet's pass it. I am on it. I would like to pass it.\n  But we are ready to pass the most significant bill to help anyone who \nhas any of the major illnesses and be sure that the group insurance \npolicy covers them. Thus, their parents can take them to doctors, \nparents can see to it their children get medical care rather than the \nasterisk on the policy that says you get less or nothing if the disease \nor illness is mental illness.\n  I came down here not because I wanted to set aside or argue or \ncontend that I have the most important bill. There were 80 Senators on \nthis bill at one time--79, bipartisan, the bill for parity.\n  I submit to my friend Gordon Smith, who came to the floor and told us \nfrom his heart what this is all about, that you would agree and \nprobably would agree wholeheartedly that all of the medicines and \ndoctors you called upon to help your son did something good. You \nprobably are not bashful or regretful of what you paid. But how much \nworse would you be in your heart if you couldn't afford it and you had \nan insurance policy from your business group and you took them to a \ndoctor and they said schizophrenia isn't covered because it wasn't \ncovered when we knew nothing about it, so we are going to leave it \nuncovered, even when we know something about it. It is still exempt.\n  This bill at the desk for parity is not a big cost. People say it is \ngoing to break business, and insurance companies are going to have to \nraise rates. We think we know what that is going to be. We are prepared \nto answer it.\n  But let me tell you, I am as capitalist as anyone here. I am as \nconcerned about business and business men and women as anyone here. But \nthis society has a real problem when it exempts insurance companies \nfrom having to pay the cost of mental illness while they pay the cost \nof all other illnesses. That isn't right.\n  I saw my friend Senator Reid on the floor speaking about his family \nand his father. I saw the great Senator, Senator Smith. I saw Senator \nNickles also. I don't have to tell you about my daughter. You all know \nabout my daughter. I have eight children and I have one who has been \nsick since she was 13. So I know all about this. I am glad we can \nafford to pay for what she needs. But I would feel bad if I had an \ninsurance policy and it covered everybody else in my family for \ndiabetes and a heart condition and didn't cover her.\n  I think we have to pass the bill. I am really tired. When it comes to \npushing, I am probably as easy a pushover as anyone around, so I just \nlet it go by. It will come up someday. But I am saying it is going to \nget passed in this Senate before we get out of here.\n  I am going to tell our leader he has been patient with me. We weren't \ngoing to do anything until it got out of committee. We told you that. \nWe worked\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\nhard and long to get it out of committee. It took a long time.\n  Now it is sitting at that desk. We are taking up all kinds of things \nwhile we are not able to send a signal to the 7\\1/2\\ million or 8 \nmillion parents who need this bill, who need some indication that we \ncare, that we are not going to have an insurance policy that covers our \nheart and not an insurance policy that covers our brain.\n  That is what the issue is about. Can you imagine a country as great \nas ours saying, Well, when we first started writing health insurance \npolicies we didn't know that schizophrenia was a disease. We did not \nknow manic depression was a disease. We did not know severe depression \nwas a disease.\n\n  We go through the years and we find out these illnesses are diseases, \nbut since they weren't originally known to be a disease, we are going \nto let group insurance policies continue to exempt them.\n  Now we know. There is no one, I say to my friend Senator Dodd, who \nhas been a greater help on discussing the issue of whether these dread \nmental illnesses I have just enumerated are illnesses or diseases. Yet \nwe let insurance companies continue to write policies as if we did not \nknow it was a disease.\n  From my standpoint, I will do anything in any area that will help us \nhelp those with mental illness. If you have a bill that will help \nprevent suicide, I am for it. But I can state that if we do not have a \nbill that forces group insurance policies to cover mental illness as \nother illnesses, the effect of the suicide bill is going to be \nminimized to the extent that parents cannot afford what they need.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. On our side, as the Senator knows, we have pushed very hard \nfor this bill authored by you and the late Senator Paul Wellstone. It \nwas an odd couple, Wellstone-Domenici, but it was one bound with \nfriendship. The two Senators found a place where they agreed and they \nwent to all ends to make sure that legislation passed.\n  As the Senator told me when I was talking a few minutes ago, we need \nto do this for a lot of reasons, but one is to respect the memory of \nPaul Wellstone.\n  On our side, we would be willing to take up that bill and spend 1 \nhour. We will do it at midnight, 6 o'clock in the morning. One hour is \nall we want. We will only take 30 minutes of that hour. I want everyone \nto understand, on our side, we want 30 minutes. If that is too much \ntime, we will cut it down.\n  Does the Senator understand we will do everything? Everyone knows we \nhave worked closely together for so many years on appropriations. What \nthe Senator has done on this mental health parity will go down in the \nhistory books. We need to make sure it passes, and the history books \nhave something definitive, not a matter only initiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici be added as an original cosponsor of the Garrett Lee Smith \nMemorial Act, along with Senator Corzine and my colleague Senator \nWyden, from Oregon, and Senator Hatch, who have also requested they be \nadded as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the Senator from New \nMexico, in the darkest of hours after my son's death, his call was one \nof the most important that I received because he has struggled with his \ndaughter. He has now spoken here with a passion on mental health issues \nso that I think all America better understands, if they listened to \nhim.\n  Pete Domenici of New Mexico was the first person who said to me that \nmy son had an illness that I could not fix. My son had an illness not \nunlike leukemia or cancer or congestive heart failure; that it was, in \nfact, a lethal illness and not to beat myself up about it. I beat \nmyself up, anyway--I still do--wondering, would have, could have, \nshould have, but Pete Domenici helped this Senator to go back to work, \nto find joy again in living, and to share with him the passion that \ncomes from suffering and the understanding that comes from a loved one \nwho is beyond rational reach.\n  I have come to believe that it is true, what Pete Domenici taught me \nin my darkest hour; that is, that mental health is just as real a \nproblem as physical health and that we need to learn more about it. We \nneed more professionals trained about it; we need more focus on it. It \nhas ramifications for business that result in lost worktime, no-shows, \nlayoffs, family tragedies.\n  With a little bit of intervention, a little more compassion, we can \nget ahead of this and begin to treat it as we might other diseases.\n  I admit, we have a lot more to learn. My bill, our bill, does not \ninclude parity. My bill is a start. My bill is a slice of the problem. \nThe Senator from New Mexico is right. His bill takes on the whole \nproblem in a way that ultimately we need to resolve as a Congress and \nas a country.\n  I thank Senator Domenici for listening to me, for putting his clothes \nback on, for coming back on down here, sharing with me, with all of \nAmerica who care about this issue, that this problem is bigger than my \nbill addresses, our bill addresses, but it is legislating within the \nrealm of the possible.\n  It is a good beginning, an important beginning. Perhaps it is aimed \nat just the most vulnerable among us, and that is our youth who need a \nlittle more help than we have been giving as a country.\n  I thank the Senator. I turn back his time to him.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make an observation and I will yield.\n  When one is involved in an issue such as this for 15 years, as I \nhave, you go to a lot of meetings. You go to a lot of meetings with \nmothers and fathers, with groups of those who are mentally ill. We hear \nthe saddest stories one could ever imagine.\n  I remember a gentleman and his wife came up to me and said: We have \ntwo children.\n  I asked: Where are they?\n  She looked up at him as if, Should we tell him? He was a CPA, very \nproud. She said: Tell him. He said: Senator, we don't know where our \ntwo children are. Well, we think they are in the slums of some city or \nin the jails of some city.\n  I said: What are you talking about?\n  He said: Well, they are both sick with schizophrenia and we don't \nhave any more money to pay for them. We are broke.\n  I said: Do you have insurance?\n  He said: Oh, we have a lot of insurance, but the insurance doesn't \ncover our kids' illnesses. So we spent everything we had and then they \ngot arrested because they did not act right. They don't act right. They \ndo everything strange. They steal; if they see these little carts, they \nsteal hotdogs. Maybe somebody arrested them for that and put them in \njail.\n  When people start telling these stories, it is not an accident, they \ndid not tell of a one-time event. You know there has to be a lot more, \nright? You run into one in your own constituency--if you start running \ninto one, two, or three problems that had to do with your mail, you \nwould come home and ask: What is wrong with the mail? You don't say: \nWhat is wrong with the letter that came from Harry Reid that you didn't \nanswer, but you know something is wrong when you have two or three \npeople telling you, for a couple of days, about this thing that I just \ndescribed.\n  It is a big problem. I can tell you there is no reason it has to be.\n  Last, there are no shelters. There is nobody in the business of \nproviding facilities because there is no money to pay for anything, \nright? If money flows from the back of a mentally ill person--there is \na little knapsack on him that says ``insurance''--if it flows from him, \nit will flow to businessmen who might build these kinds of facilities. \nBut nobody is going to do that because there are no resources.\n\n  So with that, instead of yielding to my wonderful friend, Senator \nDodd, I am just going to yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was going to ask my colleague to yield, \nbut he has spoken eloquently enough. I was\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\njust going to once again thank him and Nancy, his lovely spouse, as \nwell, who have been real champions on this issue for as long as I have \nbeen here, almost a quarter of a century.\n  I was thinking of the number of times, in my own public service of \nnow almost 30 years, that I have been with audiences--50 people, 100 \npeople, 200 people--talking about this subject matter. I oftentimes \nwill turn to the audience and say to the audience: I want any of you \nhere who have not been affected by this issue to raise your hand. If \nthere is someone in the audience out here who has not had a father or a \nmother or a sister or a best friend or a cousin who has been affected \nby one form of mental illness or another, just raise your hand. I am \ncurious to know if there is anybody here who has not been touched by \nthis issue. I have never, in my 30 years of public service, in my home \nState of Connecticut, when I have ever raised this issue, ever had \nanybody raise their hand--in 30 years. Everyone--every single \nAmerican--has been touched by this issue.\n  You would think, in this kind of environment, when we all understand \nthis issue--and we have gone through one of the most moving moments of \nmy 24 years in the Senate today, listening to the eloquent comments of \nmy colleagues from Oregon and Nevada and Oklahoma speaking about their \nown personal experiences--you might think at a moment like this we \nwould be able to come together to not only deal with the legislation \nthat we have authored together to deal specifically with teenage \nsuicide and related issues, but we might also find some time, right \nnow, in the midst of this, to bring up and vote on a bill that enjoys \noverwhelming support in this body.\n  It would be one thing if the Senator from New Mexico and others who \nhave joined him in this matter were in a minority, but there is a \nmajority of us who believe exactly as does the Senator from New Mexico, \nthat it is the 21st century--we are not in the 17th, 18th, 19th, or \neven 20th century--and we are still treating this issue as if somehow \nit belongs in the recesses and shadows and darkness of some corner, \ndespite the fact that almost every single one of our fellow citizens \nunderstands this issue because they have confronted it very directly in \ntheir own homes and in their own neighborhoods. Yet we can't seem to \nfind, as the Senator from Nevada has suggested, the 15, 20, 30 minutes \nor an hour to give us a chance to vote. Maybe people will want to vote \nagainst it. If they do, that is their business. But I believe there is \na majority of us who would like to see this get done.\n  So I want to say to my friend from New Mexico, who I have worked with \non this issue--and I appreciate our colleague from Nevada raising the \nname of Paul Wellstone, who was a great champion of this issue as well \nduring his service in the Senate--that I don't know when this is going \nto happen--I hope sooner rather than later--but I want my friend from \nNew Mexico to know: Don't you ever doubt for a single second this is \nnot going to get done. It may not be today and it may not be tomorrow \nor next week, but I promise you that before long--hopefully before \nthis session ends, if not sooner--we are going to get this legislation \npassed, and we are going to give the President an opportunity to sign \nit into law to begin to make a difference for the people in this \ncountry. So then I can not only ask the question to those audiences in \nmy own State, ``Is there anyone who has not been affected by this?'' \nbut I can ask, ``Is there anybody who cannot get help?'' because we \nhave insisted the insurance companies and others start treating this \ncondition as if it were any other ailment people can get coverage for \nand their families get protection.\n\n  Once again, I thank my friend from Oregon, and I thank his lovely \nwife Sharon and their family for their courage and their willingness to \nshare with the country their feelings.\n  There have been many moments of pride when you watch a piece of \nlegislation become law. There are very few that will equal the moment \nwe are going to have this evening. My hope is that we will adopt this \nlegislation named after Garrett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of our very able Senate staff brought to \nme something I need to share with everyone here today. This is a report \nfrom the New York Times, dated today. Among other things, it says:\n\n       Congressional investigators--\n\n  This was a House committee, which I am sure does competent work--\n\n     said Wednesday that 15,000 children with psychiatric \n     disorders were improperly incarcerated last year because no \n     mental health services were available.\n\n  This was a report. This came out yesterday. The study:\n\n     . . . found that children as young as 7 were incarcerated \n     because of a lack of access to mental health care. More than \n     340 detention centers, two-thirds of those that responded to \n     the survey, said youths with mental disorders were being \n     locked up because there was no place else for them to go \n     while awaiting treatment. Seventy-one centers in 33 states \n     said they were holding mentally ill youngsters with no \n     charges.\n       The 15,000 youths awaiting mental health services accounted \n     for 8 percent of all youngsters in the responding detention \n     centers.\n       Dr. Ken Martinez of the New Mexico Department of Children, \n     Youth and Families said the data showed ``the criminalization \n     of mental illness'' as ``juvenile detention centers have \n     become de facto psychiatric hospitals for mentally ill \n     youth.''\n       Mental health advocates, prison officials, and juvenile \n     court judges all testified and recommended three types of \n     solutions. . . .\n\n  The main one is ``more extensive insurance coverage.''\n  Just a couple more things from this same report.\n  In Tennessee, a juvenile detention center administrator said:\n\n       Those with depression are locked up alone to contemplate \n     suicide. I guess you get the picture.\n\n  That is a direct quote.\n  Carol Carothers, who directs the Maine chapter of the National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill, says:\n\n       Surely we would not dream of placing a child with another \n     serious illness, like cancer for example, in a juvenile \n     detention center to await a hospital bed or community based \n     treatment. It is outrageous that we do this to children with \n     mental illness.\n\n  So I say to my distinguished friend from New Mexico, thank you for \ncoming down today and enlarging this debate. It needs to be enlarged. \nWe so believe that we need to pass Senator Smith's legislation that I \nproudly cosponsor. But we also have to move to the next step because \nthe next step is just as important, if not more so, because it includes \nso many more people.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is known for a lot of things, but his \nresume will never have anything on it more important. I repeat, we need \nto get it passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I received a note from Senator Hillary \nClinton asking that she be added as an original cosponsor to the \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. So on her behalf, I ask unanimous \nconsent that she be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this afternoon, I have listened to my \ncolleagues speak courageously about their family members they have lost \nto suicide. My heart goes out to all of them, especially, my colleague \nand dear friend, Senator Gordon Smith. By speaking openly about the \ncircumstances of his son, Garrett's death, he has raised awareness to \nthe serious matter of youth suicide. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. I believe the Senate \nwill approve this legislation today due primarily to Senator Smith's \ncourage to speak openly about his own family's experience.\n  This legislation is necessary because it raises awareness of the \nalarmingly high rate of youth suicide--it is much higher than most \nwould believe. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for young \npeople aged 15 to 24, and the fourth leading cause of death for \nchildren between 10 and 14. My own State of Utah is ranked among the \ntop 10 states in the nation for suicide.\n  I cosponsored this bill because it provides grant funding to states \nso each may develop a youth suicide and intervention strategy through \nthe administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration in order to prevent teen suicide. This money may be used \nto develop statewide early prevention and suicide intervention \nstrategies in schools, educational institutions, juvenile justice\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nsystems, substance abuse programs, mental health programs, foster care \nprograms and other child and youth support organizations.\n  The bill also creates a federal Suicide Technical Assistance Center \nto provide guidance to state and local grantees on establishing \nstandards for data collection and the evaluation of this data. Finally, \nthis legislation provides grant funding to colleges and universities to \nestablish or enhance their mental health outreach and treatment centers \nand improve their youth suicide prevention and intervention programs.\n  I became deeply interested in this issue when I found out that my \nhome State of Utah suicide rates for those ages 15 to 19 have increased \nalmost 150 percent in the last 20 years. According to the CDC, in the \nmid-1990s, Utah had the tenth highest suicide rate in the country and \nwas 30 percent above the U.S. rate. This is one statistical measure on \nwhich I want to see my state at the bottom.\n  Teen suicide is an issue that is rapidly becoming a crisis not only \nin my State of Utah but throughout the entire country. Young people in \nthe United States are taking their own lives at alarming rates. The \ntrend of teen suicide is seeing suicide at younger ages, with the \nUnited States suicide rate for individuals under 15 years of age \nincreasing 121 percent from 1980 to 1992.\n  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students. \nIn a 1997 study, 21 percent of the nation's high school students \nreported serious thoughts about attempting suicide, with 15.7 percent \nmaking a specific plan. Although numerous symptoms, diagnoses, traits, \nand characteristics have been investigated, no single fact or set of \nfactors has ever come close to predicting suicide with any accuracy.\n  We need to understand what the barriers are that prevent youth from \nreceiving treatment so that we can facilitate the development of model \ntreatment programs and public education and awareness efforts. This \nbill provides the funding to get these types of initiatives started.\n  Again, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and \nI commend my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith for his commitment and \ndedication on this matter. I know it is such a difficult subject for \nhim but his openness today will make a difference tomorrow.\n  In fact, I believe our floor discussion today on the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act has already made a difference because families who \nhave lost someone to suicide now know that they are not alone. And, if \none life is saved because of our consideration of this bill today, we \nhave done our job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I might add, I think Senator Kennedy as well \nwants to be added as a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not know if there is any further \ndiscussion on this subject matter. If not, I want to move back to the \nsubject matter of the bill.\n  I see my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask if I might speak for a minute.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am glad to yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say that the parity bill, \nwhich is now at the desk, had to go through a standing committee. \nSenator Kennedy is the ranking member of that committee, I say to \nSenator Dodd. I thank him because he was pushing very hard for a long \ntime that we get that bill taken care of. It took a long time, but it \nis out now, and it is in a form that very few can object to.\n  So I say thank you to Senator Dodd and Senator Reid for giving me the \nreassurance that we are going to get it done. I cannot believe we are \nso inept that we cannot. I will, because of tonight, reinstate my \ndedication, and we will get it done before the session is over for \nsure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \nan original cosponsor of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know what I am \ngoing to do at the end of these remarks. So that there will be no \nsurprises, I am going to ask unanimous consent that the anticipated \nvote on cloture that is going to occur later today or tomorrow morning \nbe vitiated indefinitely. I am not making that motion yet, but I am \ngoing to make the motion. I want to give them notice so they can find \nsomeone here who may want to object. I am going to make the motion \nbecause my view is that we have worked long and hard on getting this \nclass action reform bill done. This bill is not perfect, but it is a \nreasonable bipartisan compromise that will reform the nation's class \naction system.\n  Having worked on this legislation last fall with a number of my \ncolleagues, we now find ourselves in the middle of July dealing with \nthis issue. I still have never received an adequate explanation of why \nthis matter was not brought to the floor in January, February, March, \nApril, or any point earlier. Why we waited until as late as we have to \nbring up an issue that has been as important as this makes little \nsense.\n  But my plea to the leadership, particularly the majority leader, is \nto not insist upon this cloture vote right now. Instead, I would like \nto give the leadership some ample time over the weekend to see if they \ncan't fashion a compromise which would allow for the consideration of a \nnumber of amendments, both relevant and nonrelevant, as is the normal \ncourse of Senate business. Then we would come to a final vote and go to \nconference on the class action reform act.\n  I thought the decision to invoke cloture was one that was made last \nevening out of frustration because we were not getting very far with \nthe class action reform bill. We began Tuesday night, but there were no \nvotes that evening. On Wednesday morning, before any amendments were \noffered at all, the majority leader filled the amendment tree, \nprecluding any amendments from being offered without getting his \napproval. Then Wednesday night, the decision was made to file cloture.\n  I am looking at a piece of correspondence dated July 6, the day \nbefore the decision to invoke cloture, from the National Association of \nManufacturers. In his letter to all 100 Senators--dated July 6, not \nJuly 7--he notes a cloture vote will occur and that it is going to be \nconsidered a vote that will be scored on their annual legislative \nreport card.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 6, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 14,000 member companies of \n     the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), including \n     more than 10,000 small and medium-sized manufacturers, I urge \n     you to vote for S. 2062, the Class Action Fairness Act; vote \n     in favor of cloture; and vote against all amendments except \n     managers' amendments.\n       Created for the purpose of efficiently addressing large \n     numbers of similar claims, far too many class action lawsuits \n     are brought solely for settlement value and fees as opposed \n     to helping aggrieved consumers. The Class Action Fairness Act \n     would help mitigate the current situation by giving federal \n     courts original jurisdiction over class action lawsuits where \n     diversity of citizenship occurs and by creating a ``Bill of \n     Rights'' for class members to stem the most flagrant abuses \n     of the current system. Federal courts more consistently \n     decide when class actions should be allowed, and these courts \n     are better equipped to deal with complex cases involving \n     interstate commerce fairly and efficiently. The current \n     system allows plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions to unduly \n     influence national policy through litigation.\n       S. 2062 does not make any changes to substantive law. \n     Rather, it is a reasonable response to an unanticipated \n     problem with the federal rules of judicial procedure and \n     simply reinforces the intent of the Founders that lawsuits \n     involving litigants from different states should be heard in \n     federal court. The NAM believes that this bipartisan \n     legislation will increase judicial efficiency and provide a \n     forum better suited to adjudicating complex class action \n     litigation.\n       Votes for cloture and in favor of S. 2062, the Class Action \n     Fairness Act, and against any weakening amendments (including \n     those\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\n     that would endanger final passage), substitutions or motions \n     to recommit will be considered for designation as Key \n     Manufacturing Votes in the NAM voting record for the 108th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jerry Jasinowski,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DODD. My point is, I would have thought this letter might have \nbeen dated on July 7, not the day before the decision to invoke \ncloture. It raises some suspicion that maybe the intention was all \nalong to file cloture and not to give us a chance to go through the \nnormal processes of debate and amendments.\n  Apparently the fix was in even before we started, which indicates to \nthis Senator that the intention was never to get to this bill. There \nwere numerous meetings over the last several. One of the things we \ntalked about was the importance of setting aside an adequate amount of \ntime for the full consideration of this bill.\n  The Democratic leader offered a proposal of limiting several \nnongermane amendments and a limited number of relevant amendments. The \nmajority leader countered and offered to have even fewer nongermane \namendments and an unlimited amount of germane or relevant amendments. I \nwas mystified by that offer because had it been accepted, we could have \nspent weeks on this bill without ever invoking cloture if we had had \nhundreds of amendments filed that were germane to the underlying bill.\n  I am convinced there is still a formulation of germane/nongermane \namendments that would allow us to consider those in a relatively \nexpedited fashion and then get to final passage of the class action \nreform bill. My plea will be at the appropriate time that we vitiate \nthe cloture vote, let the leaders over the weekend see if they can't \ncome up with some formulation on amendments, and then next week or so \nto return to the legislation.\n  It is a great travesty that we are going to abandon this bill many of \nus have worked long and hard on because a small minority are unhappy \nover the possibility that we might consider as amendments several \nproposals that enjoy broad support in this institution. I realize that \ncan be difficult. But nonetheless, it seems to me you don't shut down \nthe underlying bill entirely because there are some proposals that may \nbe offered that are unappealing to only a handful. Yet that is the \nsituation in which we find ourselves.\n  For those who have worked on this, we are about to miss this \nopportunity, maybe not only for this Congress but for many years to \ncome. That can happen. I have been around here long enough to know if \nyou don't strike when the iron is hot, you may lose the opportunity for \na long time down the road.\n  I appeal to the majority leader, who filed the cloture petition last \nevening, to vitiate that cloture motion. Give himself, the Democratic \nleader, and others who are interested a chance over the next several \ndays to see if they can't come up with a formulation that will allow \nfor the consideration of several amendments under time agreements. That \nought to be the way we proceed, rather than abandoning this effort.\n  I am told the next two issues to be brought up--and the minority whip \ncan correct me if I am wrong--are a constitutional amendment on gay \nmarriage and a flag-burning constitutional amendment, neither of which \nhave any chance of passage in this body. I don't believe anyone agrees \nthere is any chance of them becoming the law of the land. Yet we are \ngoing to shove class action reform, based on the decision of the \nmajority leader, off the table, maybe permanently, in order to consider \ntwo matters that have no chance of being adopted whatsoever.\n  If that is in fact the situation, then those who have been such \nstrong supporters of this proposal outside of this Chamber ought to \nunderstand what the game is. As I have often said, I was born at night, \nbut not last night. I think I understand what is going on here. Maybe \nall this time was only a game to bring the issue up with the full \nknowledge that once you close the opportunity for further amendments, \nyou are then guaranteeing the outcome we are about to have.\n  I am terribly disappointed, after a lot of time being spent on this \neffort, that we have come to this particular moment. We just listened \nto the eloquent comments of our colleague from Oregon on legislation \nthat will be adopted later this evening or next week dealing with \nteenage suicide. We have listened to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, who has worked for 15 years on trying to achieve parity in \nthe provisions providing coverage for people with mental illnesses. \nThere is a significant majority of us in this body who believe that \nlegislation ought to be adopted and then sent to the House for their \nconsideration. They may reject it. It may not be adopted in conference, \nbut we owe those who have fought long and hard a chance to vote on \nthese measures. Certainly the American public might be more impressed \nwith the Senate if we were to deal with the issue of mental health \nrather than with the issue of gay marriage or flag burning.\n  Literally thousands of cases, I am told, by people out there are \nbeing filed in State courts when they belong in Federal courts. I am a \nstrong supporter of that effort. Are people here to tell me the flag-\nburning amendment and a gay marriage constitutional amendment are more \nimportant than dealing with reforming the class action system or the \nissue of mental health parity? I hate to see what the outcome would be \nif I polled the American public what they felt about the priorities of \nthe Senate so close to the election.\n  What issues would America like to see us address? We have the issue \nof the minimum wage. Senator Craig of Idaho has an issue dealing with \nimmigration and joblessness which enjoys the cosponsorship of three-\nquarters of the Members of this body and the support of the White \nHouse. We can't get it to the floor of the Senate. We have the \nprovisions offered by our colleagues from Hawaii who are seeking some \nsupport for legislation that is critically important to their State. I \nmentioned the minimum wage. I mentioned mental health parity. These are \nonly some of the issues.\n  On the question of importation of drugs, we are constantly being told \nthat matter is going to come to the Senate floor for debate. Yet we are \nfinding all of these issues being scuttled, including class action \nreform, to the sidelines so we can deal with a couple of issues that \nhave limited support in this Chamber and I think marginal support if \npeople thought about them out across the country.\n  So I am disappointed by the priorities here. I realize the majority \nhas the right to set the agenda; it is their business to set the \nagenda. The majority party controls this Chamber, they control the \nother body, and they control the White House. They set the agenda. They \nhave decided that the agenda--America's agenda--ought not to be class \naction reform, ought not to be mental health parity, ought not to be \nthe minimum wage, ought not to be immigration reforms, which the Latino \nand Hispanic community and agribusinesses care about so much, and ought \nnot to be the legislation offered by my colleague from Hawaii. Instead, \nit ought to be gay marriage and flag burning, neither of which have any \nchance of being adopted by this body.\n  My colleagues know full well constitutional amendments require \nsupermajorities in order to leave here for consideration by the various \nStates.\n  I see the presence of a colleague on the other side. I wanted to make \nsure someone was here before I make a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the motion to invoke cloture, scheduled \nfor tomorrow morning, be vitiated indefinitely, and that the reason for \ndoing it is to give the leadership an opportunity to try to formulate a \nstructure that will allow for the consideration of the class action \nreform bill in some manner that we can all endorse, support, and allow \nus to get to that issue. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                  Senate Intelligence Committee Report\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow's report of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee will be intensely and extensively critical of \nthe CIA for its intelligence failures and mischaracteri-\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nzations regarding Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction. \nThat report is an accurate and a hard-hitting and well-deserved \ncritique of the CIA.\n  It is, of course, but half of the picture. Earlier today I released \nan example of the other half.\n  A few days ago the CIA finally answered, in an unclassified form, the \nquestion I have been asking them about whether the Intelligence \nCommunity believes that a meeting between an Iraqi intelligence \nofficial and Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers, occurred in \nPrague in the months before al-Qaida's attack in America on 9/11. The \nanswer of the CIA illustrates the point that tomorrow's Intelligence \nCommittee report is extremely useful regarding the CIA's failure, but \nit does not address another central issue--the administration's \nexaggerations of the intelligence that the CIA provided to them. That \nis left for the second phase of the Intelligence Committee's \ninvestigation.\n  This newly released, unclassified statement by the CIA demonstrates \nthat it was the administration, not the CIA, that exaggerated the \nconnections between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. The new CIA answer \nstates that the CIA finds no credible information that the April 2001 \nmeeting occurred and, in fact, that it is unlikely that it did occur.\n  A bit of history. On December 9, 2001, Tim Russert asked the Vice \nPresident whether Iraq was involved in the September 11 attack. The \nVice President replied:\n\n       It's been pretty well confirmed that he [Mohamed Atta] did \n     go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the \n     Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April, \n     several months before the attack.\n\n  Vice President Cheney also said in his interview with CNBC on June 17 \nof this year that the report from the Czechs was evidence that Iraq was \ninvolved in the 9/11 attacks. In his interview with the Rocky Mountain \nNews on January 9 of this year, the Vice President also said that the \nalleged meeting between the hijacker, Atta, and an Iraqi intelligence \nofficial in Prague a few months before 9/11 ``possibly tied the two \ntogether to 9/11.''\n\n  President Bush frequently exaggerated the overall relationship \nbetween al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein. For instance, on the deck of the \naircraft carrier, President Bush stated:\n\n       The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign \n     against terror. We have removed an ally of al-Qaida.\n\n  Now, relative to the alleged Prague meeting itself, Vice President \nCheney continues the misleading rhetoric by stating that we cannot \nprove one way or another that the so-called Prague meeting occurred. \nVice President Cheney said on June 17 on CNBC:\n\n       We have never been able to prove that there was a \n     connection there on 9/11. The one thing we had is the Iraq--\n     the Czech intelligence service report saying that Mohamed \n     Atta had met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official at the \n     embassy on April 9, 2001. That's never been proven; it's \n     never been refuted.\n\n  But what the Vice President continues to leave out is the critical \nsecond half of the CIA's now unclassified assessment that ``although we \ncannot rule it out, we are increasingly skeptical that such a meeting \noccurred.''\n  The Vice President also omits the key CIA statement:\n\n       In the absence of any credible information that the April \n     2001 meeting occurred, we assess that Atta would have been \n     unlikely to undertake the substantial risk of contacting any \n     Iraqi official as late April 2001, with the plot already well \n     along toward execution.\n\n  In summary, the CIA says there is no credible evidence that the \nmeeting occurred, and it is unlikely that it did occur. The American \npublic was led to believe before the Iraq war that Iraq had a role in \nthe 9/11 attack on America, and that the actions of al-Qaida and Iraq \nwere ``part of the same threat,'' as Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul \nWolfowitz has put it.\n  Well, it was not the CIA that led the public to believe that; it was \nthe leadership of this administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four documents, which I \nreferred to in the body of my remarks, be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Response of Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet to Senator \nLevin Question for the Record, March 9, 2004, Armed Services Committee \n                                Hearing\n\n       Question 8. Director Tenet, do you believe it is likely \n     that September 11 hijacker Muhammad Atta and Iraqi \n     Intelligence Service officer Ahmed al-Ani met in Prague in \n     April 2001, or do you believe it unlikely that the meeting \n     took place?\n       Answer. Although we cannot rule it out, we are increasingly \n     skeptical that such a meeting occurred. The veracity of the \n     single-threaded reporting on which the original account of \n     the meeting was based has been questioned, and the Iraqi \n     official with whom Atta was alleged to have met has denied \n     ever having met Atta.\n       We have been able to corroborate only two visits by Atta to \n     the Czech Republic: one in late 1994, when he passed through \n     enroute to Syria; the other in June 2000, when, according to \n     detainee reporting, he departed for the United States from \n     Prague because he thought a non-EU member country would be \n     less likely to keep meticulous travel data.\n       In the absence of any credible information that the April \n     2001 meeting occurred, we assess that Atta would have been \n     unlikely to undertake the substantial risk of contacting any \n     Iraqi official as late as April 2001, with the plot already \n     well along toward execution.\n       It is likewise hard to conceive of any single ingredient \n     crucial to the plot's success that could only be obtained \n     from Iraq.\n       In our judgment, the 11 September plot was complex in its \n     orchestration but simple in its basic conception. We believe \n     that the factors vital to success of the plot were all easily \n     within al-Qa'ida's means without resort to Iraqi expertise: \n     shrewd selection of operatives, training in hijacking \n     aircraft, a mastermind and pilots well-versed in the \n     procedures and behavior needed to blend in with US society, \n     long experience in moving money to support operations, and \n     the openness and tolerance of US society as well as the ready \n     availability of important information about targets, flight \n     schools, and airport and airline security practices.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   New CIA Response Raises Question Again: Where Does Vice President \n                      Cheney Get His Information?\n\n       On July 7th, I finally received an unclassified answer to a \n     Question for the Record that I had posed to Director of \n     Central Intelligence George Tenet after he appeared before \n     the Armed Services Committee on March 9, 2004. I am releasing \n     this response today, because it is further evidence that Vice \n     President Cheney has and continues to misstate and exaggerate \n     intelligence information to the American public. This \n     pattern, the record of which has continued to grow over time \n     suggests that Vice President Cheney is getting his \n     intelligence from outside of the U.S. Intelligence Community. \n     In February I asked him to clarify the basis for some of his \n     statements, but he has not yet responded to my request \n     (letter attached). I am therefore left to continue wondering \n     what his sources are.\n\n\n                     alleged atta meeting in prague\n\n       Vice President Chency persists in his representation that a \n     leader of the 9/11 hijackers, Mohammed Atta, may have met \n     with an Iraqi intelligence official in Prague in April, 2001. \n     When asked on Meet the Press on December 9, 2001 about \n     possible links between Iraq and the 9/11 attacks, he claimed \n     that the April Atta meeting was ``pretty well confirmed.'' \n     His subsequent statements on the Prague meeting have been \n     more qualified, but he continues to present the alleged \n     meeting as if it were something about which there wasn't \n     enough information to make an informed judgment, i.e., it may \n     have happened, or we don't know that it didn't happen. Most \n     recently, on June 17, he wrapped the suggestion in the \n     following verbal package: ``We have never been able to \n     confirm that, nor have we bee able to knock it down, we just \n     don't know . . . I can't refute the Czech claim, I can't \n     prove the Czech claim, I just don't know. . . . That's never \n     been proven; it's never been refuted.''\n       This characterization does not fairly represent the views \n     of the Intelligence Community. I have long been award of this \n     difference, and have pressed the Central Intelligence Agency \n     (CIA) to declassify their views on whether they believe this \n     meeting took place. Finally, a few days ago, they provided a \n     public, unclassified response to that question.\n       The CIA stats publicly, for the first time, that they lack \n     ``any credible information'' that the alleged meetin took \n     place. They note that the report was based on a single source \n     whose ``veracity . . . has been questioned,'' and that the \n     Iraq intelligence official who was purportedly involved and \n     who is now in our custody denies the meeting took place. \n     Further, they assess that Atta is ``unlikely'' to have ever \n     sought such a meeting because of the substantial risk that it \n     would have involved. The full CIA response is attached.\n       As we learned Tuesday, the 9/11 Commission reviewed all of \n     the intelligence, including investigations by both U.S. and \n     Czech officials, and indeed all of the intelligence that the \n     Vice President received, and stands by its conclusion that \n     the meeting did not occur.\n       The CIA and 9/11 Commission staff statements are not \n     equivocal; while it is impossible to disprove a negative, \n     after a systematic and thorough review of the evidence it is \n     their judgment that the meeting was unlikely or did not take \n     place. However, the\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\n     Vice President continues to simply claim that the evidence is \n     some how ambiguous or unclear, and leaves out the conclusion \n     of the CIA. On June 17, Vice President Cheney said that ``we \n     just don't know'' whether the meeting took place. He went \n     further to suggest that the report has ``never been \n     refuted,'' but acknowledged that the only piece of evidence \n     he'd ever seen to support an Iraq connection to September 11 \n     was ``this one report from the Czechs.'' This is the one \n     report from the single source that the CIA now publicly \n     acknowledges has been called into question.\n       Earlier this year in a January 9, 2004 interview with the \n     Rocky Mountain News, Vice President Cheney said that, after \n     the initial Czech report of a meeting, ``we've never been \n     able to collect any more information on that.'' But again, \n     this is simply not true: the 9/11 Commission lays out \n     information that was gathered by the FBI that places Atta in \n     the United States during the week of the alleged meeting in \n     Prague, and the CIA clearly had information about the \n     unreliability of the source as well as the refutation by the \n     other purported party in the meeting.\n       In his numerous public statements Vice President Cheney has \n     not been reflecting the view of the Intelligence Community on \n     the issue of the Atta meeting. On what information has the \n     Vice President been relying?\n       Outside of the Intelligence Community, the only other U.S. \n     government source of information I know on the Iraq-al Qaeda \n     connection, including the alleged Atta meeting in Prague, is \n     the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas \n     Feith. Under Secretary Feith has acknowledge that his office \n     provided information to Vice President Cheney's office on \n     these matters.\n       In the summer of 2002, Under Secretary Feith prepared \n     several versions of a classified briefing on the Iraq-al \n     Qaeda relationship. The briefing was given first to Secretary \n     of Defense Rumsfeld, then to Director Tenet and the CIA in \n     August, and finally to the staffs of the Office of the Vice \n     President (OVP) and the National Security Council (NSC) in \n     September. The version of the briefing given to Vice \n     President Cheney's staff included three slides that were not \n     included in the version given to the CIA.\n       One of those slides, which has since been declassified at \n     my request and is attached, was critical of the way the \n     Intelligence Community was assessing the Iraq-al Qaeda \n     relationship. Under Secretary Feith has acknowledged to Armed \n     Services Committee staff that he added two other slides which \n     concerned the Atta meeting issue, and which were not part of \n     the briefing given to the CIA.\n       The two slides remain classified despite my request for \n     declassification.\n       The Atta meeting is, unfortunately, not the only instance \n     in which the Vice President appears to have relied on \n     analysis other than that of the Intelligence Community. As \n     the Intelligence Committee report to be released tomorrow \n     will indicate, the CIA intelligence was way off, full of \n     exaggerations and errors, mainly on weapons of mass \n     destruction. But it was Vice President Cheney, along with \n     other policymakers, who exaggerated the Iraq-al Qaeda \n     relationship.\n\n\n          weekly standard article on iraq-al qaeda cooperation\n\n       On January 9, 2004, Vice President Cheney told the Rocky \n     Mountain News that, on the question of the relationship \n     between Iraq and al qaeda, ``one place you ought to go look \n     is an article that Stephen Hayes did in the Weekly Standard \n     here a few weeks ago, that goes through and lays out in some \n     detail, based on an assessment that was done by the \n     Department of Defense and forwarded to the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee some weeks ago. That's your best \n     source of information.''\n       The article to which Vice President Cheney astonishingly \n     enough referred as the ``best source of information'' says it \n     was based on a leaked Defense Department Top Secret/Codeword \n     document. Aside from the sense of wonder that is engendered \n     when the Vice President seems to confirm highly classified \n     leaked information by calling it the ``best source'' of \n     information, the Intelligence Community did not even agree \n     with the Defense Department document on which the Weekly \n     Standard article was purportedly based. On March 9th, when I \n     asked Director Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, \n     about Vice President Cheney's comments, allegedly based on \n     the classified Defense Department document, he said that the \n     CIA ``did not agree with the way the data was characterized \n     in that document.'' He also said that he would speak to Vice \n     President Cheney, to tell him that the Intelligence Community \n     had disagreements with the Defense Department document.\n       The document in question was prepared by Under Secretary \n     Feith. It was very similar to the series of briefings that \n     Under Secretary Feith had provided to Secretary of Defense \n     Rumsfeld, then to Director Tenet and the CIA, and finally to \n     the staffs of the Office of the Vice President and the \n     National Security Council in the summer of 2002.\n\n\n        other examples of exaggeration by vice president cheney\n\n       Unfortunately, these are not the only cases where the Vice \n     President, as just one key Administration spokesman, has \n     exaggerated or misstated the intelligence on issues related \n     to Iraq. In fact, they are just two examples of a consistent \n     pattern of such exaggeration where the policymakers--not the \n     CIA--were the exaggerators, before and after the start of the \n     war, and continuing up to the present. There are others.\n\n\n                 iraq's mobile biological weapons vans\n\n       As late as January 22, 2004, Vice President Cheney said to \n     National Public Radio that ``we know for example that prior \n     to our going in that he had spent time and effort acquiring \n     mobile biological weapons labs, and we're quite confident he \n     did, in fact, have such a program. We've found a couple of \n     semi trailers at this point which we believe were, in \n     fact, part of that program.'' He concluded by saying ``I \n     would deem that conclusive evidence, if you will, that he \n     did in fact have programs for weapons of mass \n     destruction.''\n       That is not what the Intelligence Community believed at the \n     time. David Kay, the CIA's chief inspector in Iraq said the \n     previous October that the Iraq Survey Group had ``not yet \n     been able to corroborate the existence of a mobile BW \n     [biological warfare] production effort,'' and that it was \n     still trying to determine ``whether there was a mobile \n     program and whether the trailers that have been discovered so \n     far were part of such a program.''\n       When I asked Director Tenet about Vice President Cheney's \n     comments, he said he had spoken to him about it, to tell him \n     that was not the view of the Intelligence Community.\n\n\n                   aluminum tubes for nuclear weapons\n\n       On September 8, 2002, Vice President Cheney made an \n     unqualified statement about the aluminum tubes on Meet the \n     Press:\n       ``He [Saddam] is trying, through his illicit procurement \n     network, to acquire the equipment he needs to be able to \n     enrich uranium to make the bombs.''\n       Tim Russert: ``Aluminum tubes.''\n       VP Cheney: ``Specifically aluminum tubes. . . . it is now \n     public that, in fact, he has been seeking to acquire, and we \n     have been able to intercept and prevent him from acquiring \n     through this particular channel, the kinds of tubes that are \n     necessary to build a centrifuge. . . . But we do know, with \n     absolute certainty, that he is using his procurement system \n     to acquire the equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium \n     to build a nuclear weapon.''\n       There was a fundamental debate within the Intelligence \n     Community before the war as to the intended purpose of the \n     aluminum tubes that Iraq was trying to import. The Department \n     of Energy, the Nation's foremost nuclear weapons experts, and \n     the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, \n     did not believe the aluminum tubes were for centrifuges to \n     make nuclear weapons. Instead, they believed they were for \n     conventional artillery rockets. But Vice President Cheney did \n     not acknowledge any division within the Intelligence \n     Community. He stated that the U.S. knew ``with absolute \n     certainty'' that Iraq was trying to obtain the tubes for \n     nuclear weapons purposes.\n       Tomorrow the CIA will be properly called to account for \n     their failures expressed in Phase I of the Intelligence \n     Committee report.

We've found a couple of semi \n     trailers at this point which we believe were, in fact, part \n     of that program. . . . I would deem that conclusive evidence, \n     if you will, that he did in fact have programs for weapons of \n     mass destruction.''\n       In his speech on February 5, 2004, Director of Central \n     intelligence George Tenet said that ``there is no consensus \n     within our community over whether the trailers were for that \n     use [biological weapons] or if they were used for the \n     production of hydrogen.''\n       David Kay, former leader of the Iraq Survey Group, \n     testified to Congress on October 2, 2003 that ``we have not \n     yet been able to corroborate the existence of a mobile BW \n     [biological warfare] production effort.'' He indicated that \n     the ISG was still trying to determine ``whether there was a \n     mobile program\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\n     and whether the trailers that have been discovered so far \n     were part of such a program.''\n       In July, David Kay was interviewed by BBC television for a \n     program that aired in England in late November, and here in \n     the United States on January 22, 2004. In response to a \n     question as to whether he thought it had been premature for \n     the Administration to assert in May that the two trailers \n     were intended to produce biological weapons agents, Kay said \n     ``I think it was premature and embarrassing.'' He said ``I \n     wish that news hadn't come out,'' and concluded ``I don't \n     want the mobile biological production facilities fiasco of \n     May to be the model of the future.''\n       On January 28, 2004, Dr. Kay stated in testimony before the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee that ``I think the consensus \n     opinion is that when you look at those two trailers . . . \n     their actual intended use was not for the production of \n     biological weapons.''\n       Given those assessments, I would appreciate knowing what is \n     the intelligence basis for your statements that ``we're quite \n     confident [Saddam] did, in fact, have such a [mobile \n     biological weapons labs] program,'' that the trailers ``we \n     believe were, in fact, part of that program,'' and that those \n     trailers are ``conclusive evidence'' that Iraq ``did, in \n     fact, have programs for weapons of mass destruction?''\n       I would be pleased to receive that information on an \n     unclassified or classified basis.\n       With respect to the second intelligence issue, during your \n     interview with the Rocky Mountain News on January 9, 2004, \n     you recommended a source of information relative to the issue \n     of whether there was a relationship between al Qaeda and \n     Iraq: ``One place you ought to look is an article that \n     Stephen Hayes did in the Weekly Standard here a few weeks \n     ago, that goes through and lays out in some detail, based on \n     an assessment that was done by the Department of Defense and \n     was forwarded to the Senate Intelligence Committee some weeks \n     ago. That's your best source of information''\n       That article states that it is based on ``a top secret U.S. \n     government memorandum'' prepared by the Defense Department, \n     which was purportedly leaked to the Weekly Standard. The \n     article then goes on to describe in detail and quote \n     extensively from the document it says was leaked.\n       On October 15, 2003, the Defense Department had issued a \n     News Release about the article that seems to disagree with \n     what you said. According to the Defense Department, ``News \n     reports that the Defense Department recently confirmed new \n     information with respect to contacts between al Qaeda and \n     Iraq in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee are \n     inaccurate.''\n       Furthermore, the DOD news release noted that the \n     ``classified annex'' sent by the Defense Department to the \n     Senate Intelligence Committee ``was not an analysis of the \n     substantive issue of the relationship between Iraq and al \n     Qaeda, and it drew no conclusions.''\n       I would appreciate if you would advise whether you were \n     quoted accurately.\n       I look forward to your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2062. I \nam sorry the Senator from Connecticut is not in the Chamber.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. We have had a signoff--people heard me a little earlier \ntoday say we had an objection to having a vote on the cloture motion \nthat the majority leader has filed. We can now do that. I understand \nthe majority wants that to take place. I ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture vote on the matter now scheduled for tomorrow occur tonight at \n6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, as I was saying, I am sorry the Senator \nfrom Connecticut is not in the Chamber because I have such great \nrespect for his opinion, particularly his opinion regarding this bill. \nI know what a keen interest he has in this bill, and when he talks \nabout the fact that we ought to delay this for 1 more week because the \nmajority has set the agenda and the agenda next week calls for matters \nthat might not be relevant to this particular issue, I simply remind \nthe Senator from Connecticut, who is my dear friend, that this bill has \nnot just come to the floor.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I was there in April of 2003 \nwhen this particular bill was voted out of the Judiciary Committee. We \nwere all here in November of 2003 when we had a cloture vote on this \nbill. So this is not something new that has just come about. This bill \nhas been under negotiation actually since the 105th Congress.\n  In 1996, the negotiations began on a class action bill. I think to \nnow ask for another delay for another week on the cloture vote is just \nsimply not called for, and that is the reason we need to go ahead with \nthe vote tonight. My colleagues are either for class action reform, \nthey are either for a bill that is a bipartisan bill, or they are \nagainst it. It is that simple at this point in the negotiations.\n  There was a proposal made by this side of the aisle to the other side \nof the aisle that when this bill came to the floor that we allow only \ngermane amendments, amendments that are relevant to the issue of class \naction, to be brought to the floor as legitimate amendments that would \nbe debated and voted on. The other side of the aisle would not agree to \nthat. So therefore we have evolved into a different format on the floor \ntoday.\n  I do rise in strong support of S. 2062, the Class Action Fairness Act \nof 2004. It is a product of negotiations between Senators on both sides \nof the aisle in an effort to gain the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture \nand proceed to an up-or-down vote on the merits of the bill. To a great \nextent, the bulk of the tort reform needed in this country will be \nhandled on the State court level, where most civil complaints are \nfiled.\n\n  That is a very significant point. As a trial lawyer, I remember that \nI usually wanted to file my cases in State court, and they ought to \nstill have that right to do so. But there are times when it was \ndictated to you as a lawyer that you had to go to Federal court. It is \nbecause we have had a handful of State court jurisdictions in the \nUnited States where a grossly disproportionate number of class action \nsuits are filed, and that is just not right. That is why these \nnegotiations were instituted in 1996. That is why over the last 8 years \nwe have been going back and forth with Members on both sides of the \naisle being involved and have come up with a fair bill that does allow \nfor certain exceptions that I am going to talk about in just a minute.\n  People have referred to these jurisdictions where a majority of the \nclass actions have been filed as magnet courts because they draw in \nclass action suits with their soft juries and their pro-plaintiff \njudges. That is just a matter of fact. Under the Class Action Fairness \nAct, businesses can break loose from these magnet State courts and get \na fair trial in a Federal jurisdiction.\n  S. 2062 differs from the previous versions of the class action bill \nin several ways, and those changes have been negotiated on both sides \nof the aisle over the period not from just last April or November, but \nfrom 1996, over the last 8 years. I am going to focus my remarks on one \nchange I think makes a lot of sense, and that is the addition of a \nlocal class action exception.\n  Under the provisions of S. 2062, class action cases will remain in \nState court if the following conditions are met: First, more than two-\nthirds of class members have to be citizens of the forum State. Second, \nthere has to be at least one in-State defendant from whom significant \nrelief is sought by members of the class and whose conduct forms a \nsignificant basis of the plaintiffs' claims. Third, the principal \ninjuries resulting from the alleged conduct or related conduct of each \ndefendant have to have been incurred in the State where the action was \noriginally filed. Finally, there cannot be any other class action cases \nasserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the \ndefendants on behalf of the same or other persons filed in the \npreceding 3 years.\n  Those are pretty fair and reasonable exceptions. You are still going \nto have probably most of the class action suits filed in State court \nwith this exception being in place.\n  Under the local class action exception, a limited group of local \nclass action cases would be allowed to stay in State court where the \nfacts of the case warrant this treatment. Some examples would be a \nplant explosion or an\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\noil spill, where one or more of the defendants are in the same State as \nthe catastrophe and a supermajority of the plaintiffs are there as \nwell. These are truly local actions and ought to be treated as such \nbecause they do not lend themselves to the egregious forum shopping \nthat lands cases which should be filed in Federal court in one of these \nso-called magnet courts around the country.\n  Despite all of the progress we have made in our negotiations on S. \n2062, it seems we have some Senators who plan to offer amendments that \nwould weaken this bipartisan legislation or weight it down with \nnongermane issues that will lead to the bill's defeat. The passage of \nnongermane amendments to this class action reform bill will probably \ndoom its passage. For this reason, I will vote against all nongermane \namendments, and I plan to vote against any germane amendments that \nwould weaken S. 2062 in its present form.\n  In summary, we now have a class action bill which is supported by \nboth sides of the aisle. Despite the misinformation that has been \nspread around, this bill will actually promote the proper assignment of \nclass action cases between State court and Federal court dockets. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against any amendments that would weaken or \nkill S. 2062 and then to vote in favor of this bill as a first step in \nrestoring fairness and balance to our Nation's tort system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I, like others of my \ncolleagues, would like to see closure on this issue. Before I got into \npolitics, I was a lawyer. I admire our legal system. In many ways, \npeople have their chance to be judged by their neighbors. I am very \nrespectful of the jury trial. However, in the class action arena of the \nlaw, I find more abuses than solutions. I don't believe the \nConstitution ever envisioned the class action litigation model that we \nhave come up with where you can create your own false diversity and you \ncan run everybody to Illinois or Mississippi because business is \ninvolved.\n  I believe the removal process in this bill where the judge has \ndiscretion to remove cases from State court to Federal court will \ncorrect some abuses. I believe the coupon cases were never what the law \nwas meant to be about.\n  The legal reforms in this bill I support. I have an amendment. I hope \nwe can get to it. It would allow a procedure to be had in terms of \npursuing settlement. Consumers need to be told about the Pinto case and \nneed to be informed when products are dangerous, but companies need not \nbe required to give proprietary information without having their say.\n  I have an amendment that would allow the judge in a particular case \nto rule on whether documents would be subject to seal. I think the \nSouth Carolina rule is a very reasonable rule. But whether we get to \nthis, I believe this bill's time has come, and it is now time for the \nSenate to act. The abuses that are going on in class action are not \nabout treating people fairly, they are about simple greed. These abuses \nneed to be stopped for the betterment of us all. Claimants and \nbusinesses find themselves subject to this.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of cloture on S. 2062, the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 2004. As a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I supported the bill during committee consideration and I \nwill be voting in favor of cloture and final passage as well.\n  The need for this bill is pointed out daily by stories of abuse. We \nhear of attempts to sue McDonald's because people who eat there are \ngetting fat. We hear of lawyers negotiating coupon settlements for \ntheir clients, while they receive millions of dollars in fees. We hear \nof class members actually losing money on settlements.\n  I am a lawyer and I am not happy with that state of affairs. I don't \nthink anyone is more in favor of a strong legal system than I am. And I \ndefine a strong legal system as one where all parties are treated \nfairly, wrongs are redressed, and justice is afforded equally and \nwithout bias.\n  The Class Action Fairness Bill of 2004 does not weaken our legal \nsystem. It rectifies the current imbalance in some areas where some \nparties are not treated fairly; new wrongs are committed, not \nredressed; and justice is overlooked, if not outright disregarded.\n  I say to my friends who oppose this bill that, just as it is \nimportant to make sure that victims have an opportunity to be heard in \nour courts, it is just as important to insure that the defendant is \ntreated fairly. And I don't believe anyone can credibly claim that that \nis the case today in many areas of our country. Justice requires that \nwe act to remedy that.\n  Although I may not believe this bill is perfect, and actually have an \namendment or two of my own, I do not believe we should delay this bill \none moment longer. My amendment is slightly technical, but very simple.\n  It would merely provide for uniform judicial scrutiny of sealed \ndocuments. I have based my amendment on the South Carolina district \nrule for how to obtain a protective order for trade secrets or other \nproprietary information. I haven't heard from one person in South \nCarolina who doesn't like the way it works.\n  It puts all parties on equal footing and preserves judicial \ndiscretion. However, though I firmly believe my amendment would improve \nthe bill, I will be voting for cloture because this bill is more \nimportant.\n  I firmly believe that the Class Action Fairness Act of 2004 is \nexactly that, fair to all parties.\n  It is narrowly aimed at some of the most egregious abuses of the \nclass action system. In fact, I have heard from some folds that the \nbill does not go far enough. However, in my opinion, it is a reasonable \nfirst step in the effort to control what are clearly abuses of the \nsystem.\n  It is reasonable because I don't think anyone in the chamber can \ncomplain about judges taking a look at settlements to make sure the \nclass members are not being victimized further. I don't think anyone \ncan complain about giving federal judges the power to block worthless \nsettlements based on coupons or other gimmicks.\n  We have even had some firms sanctioned for filing cases just to \nsettle with no damages for the class, but significant attorneys' fees \nfor them. We have had other lawsuits end with the lead plaintiffs and \ntheir lawyers receiving large sums and other class members receiving \nnothing, but losing their right to legal action in the future.\n  When the very people class actions are supposed to help are being \nhurt, it is time to do something different.\n  This bill is a reasonable step in the right direction. While some of \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle may not like some provisions, \nthey have to admit that there is a problem that needs to be addressed.\n  In closing, I would just like to urge my colleagues to help us move \nthis bill to conclusion. File your amendments, I have one myself, but \ndon't let your personal desire to offer your amendment get in the way \nof this much needed legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a case that I \nthink perfectly illustrates some of the problems produced by our \ncurrent class action system. This case is, unfortunately, not unique. \nThese outrageous decisions happen all too frequently. The bill \ncurrently under consideration will help fix some of these problems.\n  Reproduced on this poster beside me is an actual settlement check \nfrom a recently settled class action lawsuit. This check is made \npayable to a member of my staff who received it in the mail earlier \nthis year. You will notice that on the check's ``pay to the order of'' \nline, I have covered the name of my staffer so that she may remain \nanonymous.\n  I have also obscured the name of the defendant in this case. \nPlaintiff's lawyers have soaked them once already. I would hate to see \nothers sue this company just because they heard the company settled one \nclass action suit.\n  Along with this settlement check, my staffer received a letter, which \nsays in part:\n\n       You have been identified as a member of the class of . . . \n     customers who are eligible\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\n     for a refund under the terms of a settlement agreement \n     reached in a class action lawsuit . . . The enclosed check \n     includes any refunds for which you were eligible.\n\n  Now as you know, Senate staffers are certainly not the highest paid \npeople in this town. So this woman on my staff reports she was excited \nabout receiving some unexpected money.\n  And then she looked at the enclosed check to see just how big her \nwindfall was. It was a whopping 32 cents. That is right, she received a \ncheck made out to her in the amount of 32 cents.\n  I guess it goes without saying that she was a bit disappointed in her \nnewfound riches.\n  Now, don't misunderstand me. I am not suggesting my staffer deserved \na bigger settlement check. In fact, she tells me she had no complaint \nwhatsoever against the defendant. And she never even asked to be part \nof this lawsuit.\n  Apparently, she just happened to be a customer of a defendant who was \nsued, and it was determined that she theoretically could bring a claim \nagainst the defendant, and so she became a member of ``a class'' that \nwas due a settlement.\n  If this doesn't precisely illustrate the absurdity of the current \nclass action epidemic in this country, I don't know what does.\n  To demonstrate just how far out of whack the system is, let's start \nwith the letter notifying my staffer that she was a member of a class \naction lawsuit, and had been awarded a settlement. This letter and \ncheck arrived via the U.S. mail. The last I knew, it cost 37 cents to \nmail an envelope. The settlement check is for 32 cents.\n  You can probably see where I'm going with this.\n  It cost the defendant in this class action suit, 37 cents to send a \nsettlement check worth 32 cents. That sure makes you pause and think \nabout the absurdity of our class action system.\n  Now, I don't claim to have the economic expertise of some--like my \ngood friend, the distinguished former Senator Gramm of Texas--but I can \ntell you that forcing a defendant to spend 37 cents to send someone a \n32-cent check doesn't make much economic sense. And it certainly defies \ncommon sense.\n  But let me point out the most disturbing element about this lawsuit. \nMy staff researched this case and it may interest my colleagues to know \nthat while the unwitting plaintiff received just 32 cents in \ncompensation from this class action lawsuit, her attorneys pocketed in \nexcess of $7 million.\n  All in all, not a bad settlement--if you happen to be a plaintiff's \nlawyer rather than a plaintiff.\n  And in case you think this plaintiff received an unusually low \nsettlement in this litigation, let me quote from the letter \naccompanying the settlement check:\n\n       At the time of the settlement, we estimated that the \n     average [refund] would be less than $1 for each eligible \n     [plaintiff]. That estimate proved correct.\n\n  So, you see, even before the settlement, it was clear that each \nplaintiff would on average receive less than $1. Yet the attorneys \nstill got more than $7 million.\n  My colleagues may also be interested to know how much the defendant \nwas forced to spend defending this lawsuit.\n  Knowing the extent of the defendant's defense costs is instructive in \ndemonstrating how unjust these abusive suits can be. So we asked the \ndefendant how much it spent defending this suit that provided a \nplaintiff with pennies and her lawyers with millions. But perhaps not \nsurprisingly, the defendant was not willing to discuss that matter.\n  You see, the defendant told us that if it were readily known just how \nmuch they spent defending these types of suits, then that information \nwould almost certainly be used against them in the future.\n  This defendant feared that if their defense costs were known, then \nanother opportunistic plaintiff's lawyer would file another one of \nthese suits. And then that lawyer would offer to settle for just \nslightly less than the millions he knew it would cost the defendant to \ndefend the action.\n  That perfectly illustrates how plaintiff's lawyers exploit and abuse \ndefendants under the current system.\n  Can there be any doubt that the current class action system is in \nneed of repair? When the lawyers get more than $7 million and a \nplaintiff gets a check for 32 cents, something is terribly wrong. When \ndefendants fear disclosing how much they spend fighting these \nridiculous suits because to do so would invite more litigation, \nsomething is terribly wrong.\n  Justice is supposed to be distributed fairly. This is clearly not a \nfair way to distribute justice.\n  Let's try to correct some of the abuses in class action litigation by \npassing this legislation.\n  We are not going to end every 32-cent award to plaintiffs and \nmultimillion dollar award to attorneys, but surely we can curb some of \nthis nonsense.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to express my continued \ndisappointment in the Republican leadership's ability to manage the \nSenate floor effectively. As my colleagues are aware, we have only a \nfew weeks left in this legislative session. Instead of negotiating \nshort-time agreements on a finite number of important amendments, the \nRepublican leader has decided that he would rather slam the door shut \nfor all nongermane amendments.\n  The Republican leader's actions have frustrated Members on both sides \nof the aisle who sincerely want to have a productive legislative \nsession. The citizens of this country did not elect us to engage in a \nstaring contest. We should be using our remaining floor time to \naccomplish consensus legislation.\n  I note that yesterday the Senior Senator from Idaho observed the \nfollowing:\n\n       We have watched an unusual process this morning. There are \n     a good many of us in a bipartisan spirit who are reacting to \n     and I am one of those who does not appreciate what the \n     majority leader has now just done.\n\n  Senator Daschle, who has frequently called for civility and \nbipartisan action on the floor, similarly expressed frustration. I \ncould not agree with them more.\n  Senators have a right to have their legislation be considered by \ntheir colleagues. And despite the majority leader's actions, even \nSenators in the minority should be allowed to offer amendments to the \nclass action legislation before us.\n  Senate Craig acknowledged as much when he ``recognized that Senators, \nunless effectively blocked by [the] procedural action that has just \noccurred, do have the right to offer amendments. Germane or relevant \nand non-relevant.''\n  Yesterday, the senior Senator from Idaho hoped to offer an amendment \nwith wide bipartisan support that would help protect the security of \nour country. He should be allowed to offer this legislation. Similarly, \nother Members of this body should be allowed time for the normal \namendment process.\n  Time and again, the Republican leadership has accused my colleagues \nof obstructing and refusing to give certain measures an up-or-down \nvote. Well, this most recent procedural tactic is the majority leader's \nlatest attempt at looking busy with full knowledge that nothing will be \naccomplished.\n  Senator Frist's drastic action yesterday has stymied the legislative \nprocess and threatened the underlying class actions bill that many of \nmy colleagues have worked so hard on over the past few years.\n  I am disappointed that the Republican leadership has decided that we \ncan afford to waste another week of floor time when bipartisan measures \ncould have been considered and enacted.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I received a letter on behalf of 16 \nenvironmental protection organizations--American Rivers, Clean Water \nAction, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Earthworks, Environmental \nWorking Group, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of Conservation \nVoters, National Environmental Trust, Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Sierra Club, The Ocean Conservancy, The Wilderness Society, \n20/20 Vision, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group--in \nopposition to this class action bill.\n  These environmental protection advocates declare that this bill ``is \npatently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills, contaminated \ndrinking water, polluted air and other environmental hazards involved \nin class action cases based on state environmental or public health \nlaws.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n\n                                                     July 7, 2004.\n\n      Environmental Harm Cases Do Not Belong in Class Action Bill\n\n       Dear Senator: Our organizations are opposed to the \n     sweepingly drawn and misleadingly named ``Class Action \n     Fairness Act of 2004.'' This bill is patently unfair to \n     citizens harmed by toxic spills, contaminated drinking water, \n     polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in \n     class action cases based on state environmental or public \n     health laws. S. 2062 would allow corporate defendants in many \n     pollution class actions and ``mass tort'' environmental cases \n     to remove these kinds of state environmental matters from \n     state court to federal court, placing the cases in a forum \n     that could be more costly, less timely, and disadvantageous \n     to your constituents harmed by toxic pollution. State law \n     environmental harm cases do not belong in this legislation \n     and we urge you to exclude such pollution cases from the \n     class action bill.\n       Class actions protect the public's health and the \n     environment by allowing people with similar injuries to join \n     together for more efficient and cost-effective adjudication \n     of their cases. All too often, hazardous spills, water \n     pollution, or other toxic contamination from one source \n     affects large numbers of people, not all of whom may be \n     citizens of the same state or may be from the same state as \n     the defendants who caused the harm. In such cases, a class \n     action lawsuit in state court based on state common law \n     doctrines of negligence or nuisance, or upon rights and \n     duties created by state statutes in the state where the \n     injuries occur, is often the best way of fairly resolving \n     these claims.\n       For example, thousands of families around the country are \n     now suffering because of widespread groundwater contamination \n     caused by the gasoline additive MTBE, which the U.S. \n     Government considers a potential human carcinogen. According \n     to a May, 2002 GAO report, 35 states reported that they find \n     MTBE in groundwater at least 20 percent of the time they \n     sample for it, and 24 states said that they find it at least \n     60 percent of the time. Some communities and individuals have \n     brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages from MTBE \n     contamination and hold the polluters accountable, but under \n     this bill, MTBE class actions or ``mass actions'' based on \n     state law could be removed by the oil and gas companies to \n     federal court in many of these cases.\n       This could not only make these cases more expensive, more \n     time-consuming and more difficult for injured parties, but \n     could also result in legitimate cases getting dismissed by \n     federal judges who are unfamiliar with or less respectful of \n     state law claims. For example, in at least one federal court \n     MTBE class action, a federal court dismissed the case based \n     on oil companies' claim that the action was barred by the \n     federal Clean Air Act (even though that law contains no tort \n     liability waiver for MTBE). Yet a California state court \n     rejected a similar federal preemption argument and let the \n     case go to a jury, which found oil refineries, fuel \n     distributors, and others liable for damages. These cases \n     highlight how a state court may be more willing to uphold \n     legitimate state law claims. Other examples of state law \n     cases that would be weakened by this bill include lead \n     contamination cases, mercury contamination, perchlorate \n     pollution and other ``toxic torts'' cases.\n       In a letter to the Senate last year, the U.S. Judicial \n     Conference expressed their continued opposition to such \n     broadly written class action removal legislation. Notably, \n     their letter states that, even if Congress determines that \n     some ``significant multi-state class actions'' should be \n     brought within the removal jurisdiction of the federal \n     courts, Congress should include certain limitations and \n     exceptions, including for class actions ``in which plaintiff \n     class members suffered personal injury or personal \n     property damage within the state, as in the case of a \n     serious environmental disaster.'' The Judicial \n     Conference's letter explains that this ``environmental \n     harm'' exception should apply ``to all individuals who \n     suffered personal injuries or losses to physical property, \n     whether or not they were citizens of the state in \n     question.''\n       We agree with the Judicial Conference--cases involving \n     environmental harm are not even close to the type of cases \n     that proponents of S. 2062 cite when they call for reforms to \n     the class action system. Including such cases in the bill \n     does no more than benefit polluters in state environmental \n     class actions at the expense of injured parties in those \n     cases for no reason other than to benefit the polluters. No \n     rationale has been offered by the bill's supporters for \n     including environmental cases in S. 2062's provisions. We are \n     unaware of any examples offered by bill supporters of \n     environmental harm cases that represent alleged abuses of the \n     state class actions.\n       More proof of the overreaching of this bill is that the so-\n     called ``Class Action Fairness Act'' is not even limited to \n     class action cases. The bill contains a provision that would \n     allow defendants to remove to federal court all environmental \n     ``mass action'' cases involving more than 100 people--even \n     though these cases are not even filed as class actions. The \n     S. 2062 contains a narrow exception to the ``mass action'' \n     removal rule if the injury to the plaintiffs is caused by a \n     ``sudden, single accident,'' but has no exception for \n     injuries caused by toxic exposure that occurs over days, \n     months, or years, as frequently happens in environmental harm \n     cases.\n       For example, the bill would apply to cases similar to the \n     recently concluded state court trial in Anniston, Alabama, \n     where a jury awarded damages to be paid by Monsanto and \n     Solutia for injuring more than 3,500 people the jury found \n     were exposed--with the companies' knowledge--to cancer-\n     causing PCBs over many years. Documents uncovered in the case \n     showed that Monsanto kept the public in the dark for decades \n     regarding what the company knew about PCBs, so the ``sudden, \n     single incident'' exception would not apply in large measure \n     because of the companies' own bad behavior. There is little \n     doubt in the Anniston case that, had S. 2062 been law, the \n     defendants would have tried to remove the case from the state \n     court serving the community that suffered this devastating \n     harm. It is, at best, unjustified to reward this kind of \n     reckless corporate misbehavior by giving defendants in such \n     cases the right to remove state law cases to federal court \n     over the objections of those they have injured.\n       The so-called ``Class Action Fairness Act'' would allow \n     corporate polluters who harm the public's health and welfare \n     to exploit the forum of federal court whenever they perceive \n     an advantage to doing so. It is nothing more than an attempt \n     to take legitimate state court claims by injured parties out \n     of state court at the whim of those who have committed the \n     injury.\n       Cases involving environmental harm and injury to the public \n     from toxic exposure should not be subject to the bill's \n     provisions; if these environmental harm cases are not \n     excluded, we strongly urge you to vote against S. 2062.\n           Sincerely,\n       Ken Cook, Executive Director, Environmental Working Group.\n       Ed Hopkins, Director, Environmental Quality Programs, \n     Sierra Club.\n       Betsy Loyless, Vice President for Policy and Lobbying, \n     League of Conservation Voters.\n       William J.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my extreme \ndisappointment over the procedural bind the Senate is in on the class \naction reform bill.\n  Last October I was one of the 59 Senators who voted to allow the \nSenate to proceed to the Class Action Fairness Act because I believed \nthat it was an issue that should be considered and debated in the \nSenate. I still believe that this is an appropriate matter to be \nconsidered in the Senate, and was looking forward to a constructive \ndebate on the legislation this week.\n  In meetings with both supporters and opponents of the legislation I \nhave continually stressed that there needs to be a fair and open debate \non the matter. To me, this means that Senators must be allowed to offer \namendments to the bill. Unfortunately, even before the debate had even \nreally begun, the majority leader came to the floor and created a \nprocedural situation where no Senator would be allowed to offer an \namendment, on class action reform or any other issue.\n  It is regrettable that this path was chosen for consideration of this \nlegislation. I find this to be especially true when the minority leader \nhas offered to limit the number of amendments to the legislation, even \nthough he opposes the bill. If the Republican leadership had accepted \nthis offer we could have been working on substance rather than \ndiscussing procedure for the last few days.\n  As this debate has not been free or fair, in fact no amendments have \nbeen considered, debated and voted upon, I cannot at this time support \nlimiting debate on the Class Action Fairness Act. I am hopeful that the \nmajority will reconsider its rejection of the minority leader's offer \nto proceed on this legislation with limited amendments and that we can \nthen begin to actually debate the legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to be standing here today to \ndebate the merits of why we should be voting for cloture on this bill. \nBut since we all know how this vote will turn out, I just want to \ncongratulate in advance some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle for killing yet another civil justice reform measure this \nCongress.\n  The constituents that they serve--the powerful and well financed \nplaintiffs bar--owe them a deep debt of gratitude for not only killing \nclass action reform but also derailing the asbestos trust fund bill, \nthe medical malpractice reform bill, and gun liability reform bill, to \nname a few. Their truly special interest constituent has survived yet \nanother year devoid of tort reform, and as a result, will continue \nraking in millions of dollars in cash to help finance the Democratic \nparty in the coming months.\n  I am hoping the 62 people who committed to vote for cloture last \nNovember will vote for it. We can even lose two of them as long as we \nhave 60 to vote for cloture. If we have 60, then I will feel a lot \nbetter than I do in giving these remarks.\n  But unlike the caution chorus that they rolled out to kill the \nasbestos bill, the tactics used by my Democratic colleagues to defeat \nclass action reform have been disappointing at best, and downright \ndisingenuous, at worst. We tried to proceed on this bill last year and \nwere led to believe that we would command enough votes to overcome a \nDemocratic filibuster. Indeed, before the cloture vote, we had certain \nmembers declare their support publicly for the bill. But when the \nmoment of truth came, there was at least one member from the other side \nwho voted against proceeding on the bill despite statements to the \ncontrary. And what happened? We fell one vote shy of invoking cloture.\n  After the vote, we had three additional Democratic members come to us \njust days before our Thanksgiving recess eager to strike a deal on \nclass action reform. So we listened, and we negotiated, and then we \ncompromised. And at the end of the day, we reached an agreement on a \nmore modest version of the class action bill. But the honeymoon \ncertainly did not last long as the supporters of the measure started \ndemanding extraneous labor-oriented amendments that included a measure \nto raise the minimum wage; a measure to extend unemployment insurance; \nand a measure to overturn the administration's overtime regulations.\n  We gave them votes on two of the three and then offered yesterday to \ngive them a vote on the third. But of course, we all know that three \nwas not enough.\n  We heard the stories of how the Senate must work its will, and how \nthe hallmark of this institution's procedures cannot be compromised; \nthat we must take on more extraneous amendments that have absolutely \nnothing to do with the business at hand. But what these colleagues know \nvery well is that the more amendments this bill takes on, the less \nlikely it will become law.\n  We have a bipartisan deal on class action reform that now stands on \nthe verge of collapse--a broken deal that will forever stain the honor \nof this hallowed institution the minute the supporters of this bill \ncast a no vote on cloture. In a court of law, we would call it a breach \nof contract, but in the Senate we are not governed by common law \nprinciples when we legislate. Rather, we are governed by honor and \ncredibility--attributes that will lose stock the minute this bill \nfails.\n  Let me just finish by saying that a vote against cloture means that \nyou are not committed to class action reform. Let us not dance around \nthe issue any further, and just call a spade a spade.\n  A vote against cloture means that you care more about helping certain \nunscrupulous plaintiffs' lawyers rather than every day consumers like \nMartha Preston, Irene Taylor and Hilda Bankston. These are the real \nvictims whose horror stories will fall on deaf ears.\n  And a vote against cloture means that a deal will never be a deal \nunless strings are attached. That true bipartisanship will always come \nat a price to be disclosed later.\n  I have been here 28 years. I have never seen, when we finally put a \ndeal together, people who have not been willing to live up to their \ncommitment.\n  Everybody knew back in November of last year that we needed one more \nvote to get cloture. We compromised. We accepted amendments which we \nprobably wouldn't have accepted because we had--we had 59 who would \nhave voted for the bill as it was--to get those extra votes. Now there \nis some indication that those three votes will not be there, and we \nwill probably lose on cloture again. I am hoping that is not true. I am \nhoping all three votes will be there, or at least one that will be \nthere so that we can invoke cloture and proceed on this bill. If we \ncan't, then I have to say this is one of the few times that I have seen \nwhere commitments are made that have not been honored that should have \nbeen honored, and it is a disgrace to this institution, in my humble \nopinion.\n  Keep in mind that if we invoke cloture, that doesn't mean those who \nwant to bring up extraneous, nongermane amendments or nonrelevant \namendments can't do it. They can bring them up after cloture, but they \nare going to have to get a supermajority vote to win. That doesn't \nforeclose them.\n  Anybody who argues that they ought to be able to bring up any \namendments they want when it is hurting the Senate, is not shooting \nstraight. The fact is, they can bring up any amendments they want. They \njust have to get the votes to win. Maybe they will postcloture. I don't \nknow.\n  But in all honesty, we all know the game. It is either we are going \nto get cloture and people are going to live up to their commitment or \nnot, and bipartisanship is even hurt more than it has been up until \nnow. It has been in shambles as far as I can see almost all year long. \nThis has been one of the worst years in my Senate career because of the \nlack of partisanship, the lack of comity that normally exists in this \nbody in the desire to make everything political and the effectiveness \nof making everything political as well.\n  This is one bill that does not deserve that kind of unfair treatment, \nespecially since we compromised last year and took amendments we would \nnot have taken and changed the bill we would not have changed, all for \nthe purpose of getting enough votes to vote for cloture. And now we are \nhere again this year--another year, 6 years in a row--whereby the same \npeople who said they were for this bill and talked us into all these \namendments on the basis that they would vote for cloture may not. I \npersonally hope they will. If they will, it will do more for comity in \nthis body, more for bipartisanship than we have seen all year. It would \nbe a ray of hope to everybody in this body that maybe there is a chance \nof us getting together on things that are important, the things that \nare right, things that we promised, things that will benefit the \nbusiness community, things that will correct the ills which literally \nhave been wrecking this institution and hurting our country \nimmeasurably and will put the screws to these jurisdictions, these \nmagnet jurisdictions, that do not seem to care about the law or \nanything else.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to Henry \nCouzens, a genuine World War II hero and survivor. Mr. Couzens \nperformed extraordinary acts of courage during some of world history's \nmost difficult and tumultuous times.\n  The day after his 18th birthday in 1942, Mr. Couzens applied for the \nAviation Cadets, and after passing all requirements was accepted into \nthe Air Corp Training School. A year later, Mr. Couzens graduated as a \npilot and was commissioned as a second lieutenant to fly P-47 fighter \nplanes. In early 1944, Mr. Couzens arrived in England to fight on the \nfront lines in the European Theatre alongside the 8th Infantry and \n356th Fighter Group. His unit's assignment was to control an area along \nthe English Channel. Their purpose was to escort and protect B-17s and \nB-24s on bombing missions to Germany and other occupied countries.\n  On April 23, 1944, Mr. Couzens was assigned to destroy German \nairplanes on the ground. His target that day was the airfield at \nHaguenau, France. On his third pass over the airfield, he was hit by \nGerman anti-aircraft fire. The hit was so substantial it stopped the \nengine of his plane, forcing him to ``Belly in.'' While he was \nfortunate enough to land alive, the group commander and another pilot \nwere shot down. For a little over a year, Mr. Couzens was a prisoner of \nthe Germans at the famous Stalag Luft III Camp. He endured one of the \ncoldest winters in decades and finally saw freedom when they were \nliberated on April 29, 1945, and became part of General Patton's Third \nArmy.\n  Thank you, Mr. Couzens for defending freedom and democracy. The \nheroics you and your comrades displayed will forever be remembered; you \ntruly are the Greatest Generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7819-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7819-S7821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to address the value of free trade, \nand of the process by which we get it.\n  From ancient times, people have learned that trade among nations \nmeans more economic growth and higher incomes. People have better \nstandards of living, thanks to trade.\n  Free trade allows each nation to devote more resources and energy to \nthose things for which it has a comparative advantage. Partners to free \ntrade thereby get goods and services at lower cost than they would in \nisolation.\n  Conversely, protectionism stunts growth and reduces income. Tariffs \nare taxes. And like other taxes, they can impede the efficient \nallocation of resources. Where nations impose quotas and tariffs, goods \nand services cost more. People live less well than they would with free \ntrade.\n  But you don't have to take my word for it. Look at the record. Take \nAmerica's two biggest recent trade agreements.\n  America entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, \nin 1993, and the Uruguay Round Agreements, the WTO, in 1994. In the \nyears following those major trade agreements, America experienced one \nof its strongest economic expansions.\n  Yes, balancing the budget and funding education also had something to \ndo with it. But trade helped.\n  America experienced 8 years of economic growth. The American economy \ncreated more than 20 million new jobs. The average household's real \nincome rose 15 percent. Americans' standard of living improved.\n  Put the other way around: The opponents of free trade have a \ndifficult job to explain how those major trade agreements hurt the \nAmerican economy in the 1990s.\n  I am a proud advocate of trade. I am an advocate of stronger economic \ngrowth and higher incomes. I want a better standard of living for \nAmericans.\n  So how can we achieve freer trade? How do we lower barriers to trade? \nThat brings us to a discussion of trade procedures.\n  The Senate considers trade agreements under somewhat unique \nprocedures. These special procedures go by several names: fast-track, \ntrade negotiating authority, or trade promotion authority.\n  Under these procedures, legislation to implement a trade agreement \ngets an up-or-down vote within a limited time. Debate is limited to 20 \nhours. No amendments. No filibusters.\n  The Senate is about to consider legislation under these procedures to \nimplement the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We may also \nsoon consider legislation under these procedures to implement the \nUnited States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement.\n  Two other agreements with six Central American countries and Bahrain \nare signed and ready for us to consider whenever the administration \nchooses to move them.\n  With so much trade activity, it is a good time to review the \napplicable procedures.\n  It all begins with the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 3 \nsays that: ``The Congress shall have the power . . . to regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations.'' Since the founding of our Country, it \nis, and has always been, Congress that holds primary responsibility for \ntrade.\n  Now, 535 Members of Congress cannot negotiate trade agreements. The \nlogistics are unimaginable. So our predecessors figured out fairly \nearly that the actual negotiating would have to be delegated to the \nexecutive branch.\n  But that does not mean that Congress has delegated its Constitutional \nresponsibilities. To the contrary, under United States law no trade \nagreement is self-executing. It has no effect on domestic law until \nCongress passes implementing legislation.\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\n  A system where one branch of government negotiates trade agreements \nand another must accept them and turn them into domestic law presents \nchallenges.\n  The system worked well enough in the early days of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. Back then, the executive branch was \nnegotiating agreements to reduce tariffs. Congress would delegate \nauthority to the President to agree to cuts within a specific range. \nAll the President had to do was proclaim those changes once agreed to.\n  In the 1960s, however, the United States and its trading partners in \nthe GATT began to expand the scope of trade negotiations to non-tariff \nmeasures. Without any advance authorization from Congress, the \nadministration negotiated several deals on non-tariff measures in the \nGATT's Kennedy Round.\n  It brought those agreements back to Congress. Congress rejected the \nagreements, refusing to implement them into domestic law. This \nembarrassed the administration. And it frustrated our trading partners. \nThey learned that negotiating with the executive branch is not enough. \nThe final word lies with Congress.\n  Our trading partners became wary. They didn't want to devote years of \neffort to another round of trade negotiations in the GATT if American \nnegotiators could not keep the promises they made. The executive branch \nwanted advance authorization from Congress to negotiate non-tariff \ntrade agreements.\n  The administration proposed treating tariff and non-tariff agreements \nthe same. The executive branch said: Congress should simply authorize \nthe President in advance to negotiate and implement the deals that the \nPresident makes.\n  The Finance Committee resisted. Yes, tariff deals are easy to approve \nin advance. All Congress has to do for a tariff deal is to tell the \nExecutive how low the negotiators can go.\n  But non-tariff deals are more complicated. They can cover things like \nCustoms rules, trade remedies, food safety rules, and intellectual \nproperty rights. It would be too difficult for Congress to approve \nparameters for these kinds of agreements in advance. Congress would \nwant to see the details before deciding to approve and implement these \ndeals.\n  Congress and the President reached a compromise and enacted it in the \nTrade Act of 1974. That Act created the so-called ``fast-track'' \nprocess.\n  Fast-track has something for everyone. It gives the Executive express \nauthority to negotiate tariff and non-tariff agreements, so long as our \ntrade representatives meet general negotiating objectives set out by \nCongress. And it guarantees our trade partners that any agreement will \nreceive an up-or-down vote by a date certain. That way, when they \nnegotiate with the United States, they know that Congress cannot later \namend the agreement or kill it with a filibuster.\n  But, most importantly, fast-track preserves Congress's Constitutional \nprimacy on trade. No agreement gets implemented unless a majority of \nCongress approves.\n  Fast-track procedures require close collaboration between the \nExecutive and Congress at every stage. The President must notify \ncommittees of jurisdiction and consult with them before a negotiation \nbegins and regularly throughout the negotiations. Once talks are \ncomplete, the President must notify Congress 90 days before signing the \nagreement, to permit Congress time to review the terms of the deal.\n  Once the agreement is signed, the President must submit it to \nCongress, along with a draft implementing bill, for approval. Congress \nhas no more than 90 days in which the Congress is in session to act. \nAnd amendments are not in order.\n  But the time when close coordination between the Executive and \nCongress is most critical is the period between when the agreement is \nsigned and when the President submits the agreement to Congress.\n  This is the time when the administration and the trade committees sit \ndown together to craft an implementing bill. The law requires the \nExecutive to consult with the committees of jurisdiction. But because \nthe details of this consultative process are not spelled out by law, \nsome call this stage the ``informal process'' or the ``mock process.''\n  No one should be fooled by these titles. This cooperative drafting \nventure--while not spelled out in the law--is the centerpiece of the \nfast-track process.\n  It is at this stage--before the implementing bill becomes \nunamendable--that the trade committees can weigh in and bring their own \nideas to the table.\n  Congress and the President first used the procedures adopted in the \nTrade Act of 1974 to implement the GATT Tokyo Round agreements in 1979. \nThe Government has since used these procedures to implement the WTO \nUruguay Round Agreements, as well as free trade agreements with Israel, \nCanada, Mexico, Singapore, and Chile.\n  From the beginning, the Finance Committee has strived to make the \ninformal process operate as much as possible like the normal \nlegislative process.\n  For that reason, the Finance Committee always holds a mock markup of \nthe draft implementing bill. Like any markup, this event is open to the \npublic. And Members are free to offer amendments to the draft bill that \nhas been developed by the administration and committee staff.\n  The committee holds a recorded vote on each amendment offered. It \nthen votes on whether to approve the draft bill, as amended, in a \nrecorded vote.\n  Amendments are common events at mock markups. When the Committee \nconsidered the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement in 1984, \ncommittee members offered 13 amendments, and the Committee adopted 3. \nIn 1988, when the committee considered the Canada-United States Free \nTrade Agreement, members offered 9 amendments, all of which were \nadopted. When the Finance Committee considered draft implementing \nlegislation for the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, \nmembers offered at least 15 amendments, of which 14 were adopted. There \nwere more than 30 differences between the Senate and House versions of \nthe bill at the end of the mock markups.\n  By contrast, no amendments were offered last year when the committee \nconsidered the Singapore and Chile implementing bills. That was \nunusual.\n  In each of these cases, consideration of amendments was followed by a \ncommittee vote to approve the draft bill, as amended.\n  In every case except Singapore and Chile, amendments added in the \nmock markup led to differences between the versions of the draft bill \napproved by the Finance Committee and the bill approved by the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  Consistent with normal legislative practice, the two committees \nresolved these differences in an informal or ``mock'' conference. Each \nHouse appointed conferees to participate.\n  To begin the conference process, staff from both parties and both \nHouses jointly prepared a document identifying all the differences \nbetween the two versions of the draft bill. Where agreement was \npossible, staff recommended a resolution.\n  Typically, the House and Senate exchanged offers on more difficult \nissues, which were then resolved at the Member level. In each case, \nMembers and staff were able to resolve all or virtually all conflicts. \nBoth committees could then recommend identical draft bills to the \nadministration for formal submission.\n  This time-tested process really works. It allows Congress to exercise \nits Constitutional prerogatives in full, while still guaranteeing the \nPresident and our trading partners a timely vote on trade agreements.\n  Although these informal procedures are not statutory, they were \ncertainly on my mind when I worked to secure a renewal of the \nPresident's trade negotiating authority in the Trade Act of 2002. I \nfirmly believe that Congress should continue to insist on a meaningful \nand robust informal process.\n  One of the keys to a meaningful informal process is time. In the case \nof the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the informal process took 7 \nmonths. That is how much time elapsed between when the U.S. signed the \nagreement and when the President formally submitted the implementing \nbill to Congress. During that time, the\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\nFinance Committee held hearings, conducted several weeks of informal \ndrafting, and held four mock markup sessions. The informal conference \nalone included 3 days of Member-level meetings and took close to 2 \nmonths to complete.\n  The informal process for NAFTA lasted a full year. It included five \nhearings in the Finance Committee as well as hearings in five other \ncommittees. The Finance Committee staff worked with the administration \nfor months on legislative drafting. The Finance Committee's markup \ninvolved 3 sessions over 2 weeks, followed by a conference.\n  The informal process for the Uruguay Round Agreements Act took about \n9 months.\n  The Singapore and Chile FTAs took less time. That makes sense. The \nagreements required many fewer changes to U.S. law than those that came \nbefore.\n  After walking through the draft bills in detail with the \nadministration, with Committee staff, and with legislative counsel, \nMembers were satisfied. They chose not to offer any amendments at the \nmock markups. No conference was necessary.\n  Affording sufficient time to the process pays off. After the \nPresident formally submits an implementing bill, the fast-track \nprocedures allow Congress up to 90 days to complete action. That is 90 \ndays on which Congress is in session not calendar days.\n  But nowhere near that much time has ever been used. The formal \nprocess took 56 calendar days for the U.S.-Canada Agreement--including \nthe August recess. NAFTA, Singapore, and Chile took a mere 16 days \neach.\n  What lesson can we learn from all this experience? Process matters.\n  Congress needs to be engaged throughout the negotiations. The trade \ncommittees need to play an active role in drafting implementing \nlegislation. Committee members need to have enough time to give \nmeaningful consideration to amendments and to resolve any differences \nbetween the Houses before the Government completes an implementing \nbill. When that happens, the formal fast-track process goes quite \nsmoothly.\n  What does this mean for the future? First, we should not get \noverconfident. Just because the process works smoothly and quickly for \nsome agreements, like Singapore and Chile, doesn't mean we can start \nskipping steps. In fact, with a vote on whether to extend the \nPresident's trade promotion authority for an additional 2 years \npossible next summer, now is no time to get sloppy.\n  More complex agreements may be ahead. CAFTA involves six countries \nand could raise controversial new issues. Any agreements that come out \nof the WTO Doha Round or the FTAA talks could require extensive new \nimplementing legislation. In sum, we would be foolish to assume the \nprocess of developing implementing bills will always be as easy in \nfuture as our recent experience with Singapore and Chile.\n  Second, timing should always be Member-driven. Members should have \nthe time that they need to review the relevant materials and \nparticipate in the informal process. We should never cut that time \nshort just to meet artificial deadlines.\n  When we shortchange the process, we shortchange the Constitution. \nWhen we start cutting corners on process, we begin to abdicate \nCongress's constitutional role in making trade law.\n  A good agreement is no excuse for bad process. A good agreement is no \nexcuse for Congress to surrender its Constitutional role. The ends do \nnot justify the means.\n  Let us work together to advance the process of free trade. Let us \nensure a fair process for reaching our trade agreements, and thereby \nmake future trade agreements easier to achieve. And by advancing those \nagreements, let us work together to earn those benefits of free trade \nof greater economic growth and higher standards of living for \ngenerations of Americans yet to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7821-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7821-S7823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On November 20, 1995, a young transsexual woman named Chanelle Picket \nwas beaten severely and then strangled to death after leaving a gay bar \nin downtown Boston.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer into the Record my statement \nof support of S. 2548, private relief legislation to provide lawful \npermanent residence status to Shigeru Yamada, a 22-year-old Japanese \nnational who lives in Chula Vista, CA.\n  I have decided to offer private relief legislation on his behalf \nbecause I believe that Shigeru Yamada represents a model American \ncitizen for whom removal from this country would represent an unfair \nhardship. Without this legislation, Mr. Yamada will be forced to return \nto a country in which he lacks any linguistic, cultural or family ties.\n  Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two \nsisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. \nYamada's alcoholic father, who had been physically abusive to his \nmother, the children and even his own parents. Since the, he has had no \ncontact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive. Tragically, \nMr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother was killed in a \ncar crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13, Mr. Yamada spent time \nliving with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to live with a close \nfriend of his late mother.\n  The death of his mother marked more than a personal tragedy for \nShigeru Yamada; it also served to impede the process for him to \nlegalize his status here. At the time of her death, Mr. Yamada's family \nwas living legally in the United States. His mother had acquired a \nstudent visa for herself and her children qualified as her dependents. \nHer death revoked his legal status in the United States. Tragically, \nMr. Yamada's mother was engaged to an American citizen at the time of \nher death. Had she survived, her son would likely have become an \nAmerican citizen through this marriage.\n  Mr. Yamada has exhausted his options under our current immigration \nsystem of the United States. Throughout high school, he contacted \nattorneys in the hopes of becoming a citizen. Unfortunately, time has \nrun out and, for Mr. Yamada, the only option available to him today is \nprivate relief legislation.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for Mr. Yamada to be removed \nfrom the United States and sent to Japan.\n  First, since arriving in the United States, Mr. Yamada has lived as a \nmodel American. He graduated with honors form Eastlake High School in \n2000, where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Academically, \nMr. Yamada earned a number of awards including being named an \n``Outstanding English Student'' his freshman year, an All-American \nScholar, and earning the United States National Minority Leadership \nAward. His teacher and coach, Mr. John Inumerable, describes him as \nbeing ``responsible, hard working, organized, honest, caring and very \ndependable.'' His role as the vice president of the Associated Student \nBody his senior year is an indication of Mr. Yamada's high level of \nleadership, as well as, his popularity and trustworthiness among his \npeers. As an athlete, Mr. Yamada was named the ``Most Inspirational \nPlayer of the Year'' in junior varsity baseball and football, as well \nas, varsity football. His football coach, Mr. Jose Mendoza, expressed \nhis admiration by saying that he has ``seen in Shigeru Yamada the \nresponsibility, dedication and loyalty that the average American holds \nto be virtuous.''\n\n  Second, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as a local volunteer. As \na member of the Eastlake High School Link Crew, Mr. Yamada helped \nfreshmen find their way around campus, offered tutoring and mentoring \nservices, and set an example of how to be a successful member of the \nstudent body.\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\nSince graduating from high school, he has volunteered his time as the \ncoach of the Eastlake High School girl's softball team. The head coach, \nMr. Charles Sorge, describes him as an individual full of ``integrity'' \nwho understands that as a coach it is important to work as a ``team \nplayer.'' His level of commitment to the team was further illustrated \nto Mr. Sorge when he discovered, halfway through the season, that Mr. \nYamada's commute to and from practice was 2 hours long each way. It \ntakes an individual with character to volunteer his time to coach and \nnever bring up the issue of how long his commute takes him each day. \nMr. Sorge hopes that, once Mr. Yamada legalizes his status, he can be \nformally hired to continue coaching the team.\n  Third, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would be an immense hardship \nfor him and his family. Mr. Yamada does not speak Japanese. He is \nunaware of the nation's current cultural trends. And, he has no \nimmediate family members that he knows of in Japan. Currently, both of \nhis sisters are in the process of gaining American citizenship. His \nolder sister has married a United States citizen and his younger sister \nis being adopted by a maternal aunt. Since all of his family lives in \nCalifornia, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would serve to split his \nfamily apart and separate him from everyone and everything that he \nknows. His sister contends that her younger brother would be ``lost'' \nif he had to return to live in Japan on his own. It is unlikely that he \nwould be able to find any gainful employment in Japan due to his \ninability to speak or read Japanese.\n  As a member of the Chula Vista community, Mr. Yamada has \ndistinguished himself as an honorable individual. His teacher, Mr. \nRobert Hughes, describes him as being an ``upstanding `All-American' \nyoung man''. Until being picked up during a routine check of his \nimmigration status on a city bus, he had never been arrested or \nconvicted of any crime. Mr. Yamada is not, and has never been, a burden \non the State. He has never received any Federal or State assistance.\n  Currently, Mr. Yamada is a sophomore at Southwestern Community \nCollege, where he is working on finishing his general education so that \nhe can go on to earn his BA in criminal justice from San Diego State \nUniversity. Mr. Yamada's commitment to his education is admirable. He \ncould have easily taken a different path but, through his own \nindividual fortitude, he has dedicated himself to his studies so that \nhe can live a better life. In the future, Mr. Yamada is interested in \npursuing a career in criminal law enforcement by serving as a police \nofficer or an FBI agent.\n  With his hard work and giving attitude, Shigeru Yamada represents the \nideal American citizen. Although born in Japan, he is truly American in \nevery other sense. I ask you to help right a wrong and grant Mr. Yamada \npermanent status so that he can continue towards his bright future.\n  I ask unanimous consent three letters of recommendation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Eastlake High School,\n\n                                    Chula Vista, CA, May 21, 2004.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n       I am writing to bring to your attention the need to support \n     a fine young man, Shigeru Yamada. I am a teacher and coach at \n     Eastlake High School; I have known Shigeru for 8 years, both \n     as a student and as a volunteer coach during the last 5 \n     years. What has singularly impressed me about this young man \n     is that he has created himself and never complained about his \n     life's struggles. His mother died when he was young. He got \n     little support from his aunt--materially, emotionally, \n     spiritually. Yet all the while you would not have known that. \n     He set goals for himself academically and athletically; \n     modeled himself on good ideals of community service and \n     service to his school. He was vice-president of the \n     Associated Student Body at Eastlake High and would have \n     pursued an academic future at UCLA were it not for his \n     citizenship status. Instead, he did what he could do and has \n     gone to community college in an effort to pursue his college \n     degree.\n       All the while, he volunteered his time during these past 5 \n     years to help coach our school's softball team (as well as \n     other sports on campus). It was only recently that I had \n     discovered that it would take him 2 hours with bus transfers \n     just to get to softball practice.\n       I provide this information to you as a testimonial to the \n     character of this young man. Exceptional in attitude and \n     determination. We need this kind of spirit and resolve in \n     America. We do not want to export it somewhere else. Please \n     help.\n           Respectfully,\n                                            Charles R. Sorge, EdD,\n     English Teacher and Head Softball Coach.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Edminster Learning Center,\n\n\n                                         Eastlake High School,\n\n                                  Chula Vista, CA, April 23, 2001.\n     To Mr. Bob Filner:\n       I'm honored to write this letter for Shigeru Yamada. I have \n     known Shigeru since 1997. A very energetic, bright young man \n     whose personal charge and get after if attitude toward \n     accomplishing his goals, have no equal. A person who \n     personifies the notion of a ``hard charger.''\n       As an Instructional aide and Varsity Football coach I have \n     earned great admiration toward Shigeru's work ethic. While in \n     high school, Shigeru received academic honors as an All-\n     American Scholar ('99), United States National Minority \n     Leadership Award ('99 & '00), the National Honor Roll ('00), \n     Golden State Awards, and Who's Who Among High School Students \n     ('98-'00). His commitment toward his duties goes with out \n     question. He managed to be a member of the Associative \n     Student Body. Here he received a Presidential Award ('00), \n     ASB Leadership Award ('00), and Eastlake High School ASB Life \n     Membership Award ('00).\n       Through his many academic accomplishments Shigeru managed \n     to dedicate himself to many extra curricular activities, such \n     as Football, Baseball, and Wrestling. Other activities \n     included, the Boys Choir (The ``E'' Males), AVID (Advancement \n     via Individual Determination), and Link Crew (assisting \n     incoming freshmen).\n       Through my personal experiences as a squad leader in the \n     United States Army (Infantry) and Department Head at Home \n     Depot. I have seen in Shigeru Yamada the responsibility, \n     dedication and loyalty that the average American holds to be \n     virtuous.\n       So with great appreciation please endorse a Bill, so that \n     Shigeru Yamada can stay in the United States and become a \n     patriotic citizen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jose Mendoza,\n     Instructional Aide.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Eastlake High School,\n\n                                                  Chula Vista, CA.\n     To Whom It May Concern:\n       I would like to write this letter of recommendation on \n     behalf of Shigeru Yamada for his outstanding contributions to \n     Eastlake High School and the Eastlake Community. I have been \n     closely tied to Shigeru for approximately 2 years as teacher, \n     coach, and as a friend. Throughout his years at Eastlake High \n     School, Shigeru has participated successfully in many extra-\n     curricular activities and has earned the respect and \n     admiration from staff members, fellow students and the \n     surrounding community. Shigeru has developed into an \n     outstanding performer in Eastlake's football, wrestling and \n     baseball programs. He is strongly admired for his \n     sportsmanship, work ethic and most of all his natural ability \n     as a team leader. For his efforts, Shigeru was recognized for \n     athletic and academic achievements by being selected to the \n     1998-99 San Diego Union Tribune All-Academic Wrestling Team. \n     Although Shigeru spends much of his time with competitive \n     sports, he always finds time to help other students in need. \n     Shigeru is an active participant with the Eastlake Link Crew. \n     This organization was established to assist our ninth graders \n     with finding their way around campus, learning school \n     traditions, tutoring, mentoring, monitoring academic progress \n     and setting examples of how to be a successful member of our \n     campus environment. Academically, Shigeru excels in the \n     mathematics and is presently taking Honors Pre-Calculus while \n     carrying a 3.8 overall Grade Point Average. In addition, \n     Shigeru is an active member in the AVID (Advancement Via \n     Individual Achievement) program. This program helps our \n     students develop academic skills that are beneficial for them \n     when they attend college. Shigeru is also a member of the \n     Associated Student Body. The ASB is the bloodline of our \n     campus. This outstanding group of students work endless hours \n     organizing pep assemblies and lunchtime activities, sells \n     concessions at all extra-curricular events and assist in all \n     campus elections and dances as well as providing support \n     services for faculty and staff members. In several \n     conversations, I have discovered that Shigeru has a strong \n     interest in the field of Physical Therapy with an emphasis in \n     Sports Medicine. I strongly believe that Shigeru is capable \n     of reaching his goals because he is highly motivated, \n     conscientious and extremely competent.\n       It is very easy to praise Shigeru for his personal \n     achievements, but I think his personality is what makes him a \n     great human being. Shigeru is responsible, hard working, \n     organized, honest, caring and very dependable. On a daily \n     basis, Shigeru volunteers his time selling concessions during \n     nutrition break and lunch hour for the ASB food services. \n     This job holds Shigeru accountable for large sums of money, \n     an accurate account of inventories and timely service. Very \n     few students have been trusted with this major \n     responsibility. Another word that describes Shigeru is \n     resiliency.

Mr. President, on August 15 in Coventry, VT, a beloved \nchapter in American music history will come to a close as the jam band \nPhish holds its final concert for legions of devoted ``phans'' and \n``Phish-heads.'' We in Vermont are well known for our superb maple \nsyrup, our wonderful ice cream, our award-winning cheese and our \nbeautiful scenery, but after 21 remarkable years, the jam band Phish \nhas certainly become one of our most famous exports.\n  The four musicians of Phish--Trey Anastasio, Mike Gordon, Page \nO'Connell, and Jon Fishman--met and started playing together as \nundergraduates at the University of Vermont in the early 1980s. The \nband quickly moved beyond its humble beginnings in a dormitory basement \nto playing a small nightclub in Burlington called Nectar's. While they \ntoured for 5 years before releasing any commercial albums, the buzz \naround the band spread as their striking melodies and lively jam \nsessions endeared them to a growing legion of fans.\n  Phish released its first commercial album, Junta, in 1989. Since \nthen, the band has put out more than 35 studio and live albums that \nhave sold millions of copies. They have more than 200 original songs, \nand many of the songs die-hards love most were never recorded in the \nstudio.\n  But the magic of Phish is not as much in its studio recordings as it \nis in its live performances. In an era when slick marketing techniques \noften overshadow the musical accomplishments of the artists themselves, \nthis talented band from Vermont has provided a refreshing contrast by \npromoting free spiritedness and individuality in their music.\n  The band has always been unconcerned about releasing catchy singles \nand making millions of dollars from record sales. Instead they play \nlong jams--oftentimes with songs lasting 30 minutes or longer--and tour \nyear-round. Bucking a trend in the industry, they even encouraged \npeople to tape their shows for free and trade them on the Internet. For \nthe members of Phish, it really is all about their music and their \nfans.\n  Every night on stage is a new and different showcase for the talents \nof the versatile and endlessly creative band members. Whether they are \nplaying electric guitars, keyboards, drums, or vacuum cleaners, Phish's \nimprovisational talent has never disappointed. Many fans--often \nreferred to as ``Phish-heads''--follow the band from concert to concert \nliving off veggie burritos, grilled cheese sandwiches and the charity \nof others.\n  Through it all, Phish has always considered Vermont home. In a \ntribute to their Burlington roots, the band's first album produced with \na major record company was titled A Picture of Nectar. And the band's \nshare of proceeds from sales of the popular ``Phish Food'' Ben and \nJerry's ice cream flavor goes directly toward environmental projects in \nVermont's Lake Champlain Watershed. Now, as they prepare for their \nfinal show in Vermont, it is appropriate that they finish where they \nstarted.\n  Though Phish has sold millions of albums and become a huge success, \nin spirit they remain a group that is unpretentious and unfailingly \nloyal to their fans. Their admirable generosity has fostered a sense of \ncommunity among those who follow the group. The band's break-up is a \nsource of sadness to all of us who know and love them.\n  I congratulate Trey Anastasio, Mike Gordon, Jon Fishman and Page \nO'Connell on their remarkable success. I am grateful for all they have \ndone for Vermont, for American music, and for their fans. Most \nimportantly, we sincerely appreciate their authenticity, their \nenthusiasm and their generosity.\n  While no one wants to see Phish stop playing after this summer, we \ncan all take some solace that their music will live on, in these words \nfrom their song, ``Down With Disease.''\n\n     Waiting for the time when I can finally say\n     That this has all been wonderful, but now I'm on my way.\n     But when I think it's time to leave it all behind,\n     I try to find a way, but there's nothing I can say to make it \n           stop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7823-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           LAUREN AMBER COOK\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

She will represent the graduates of Caldwell \nCounty High School very well when she enrolls at Vanderbilt University \nin the autumn. There she plans to study chemical engineering with a \nfocus on agriculture.\n  The citizens of Caldwell County should be proud to have a young woman \nlike Lauren Amber Cook in their community. Her example of dedication \nand hard work should be an inspiration to the entire Commonwealth.\n  She has my most sincere appreciation for this work, and I look \nforward to her continued service to Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7823-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7823-S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HOMEOWNERSHIP TAX CREDIT ACT\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, President Bush officially \ndeclared the month of June as ``National Homeownership Month,'' and \nwith this annual tradition, America's attention was again drawn to the \nimportance of homeownership and the stability it can bring to families \nand neighborhoods. It is often homeownership that financially anchors \nAmerican families and civically anchors our communities. But I believe \nour focus on homeownership also returns our attention to the basic \nideals of the American Dream. Ensuring access to homeownership, and \nthrough it access to the American Dream, is among the most significant \nways we can empower our citizens to achieve the happy, productive and \nstable lifestyle everyone desires.\n  Having a house of one's own that provides security and comfort to \none's family and that gives families an active, vested interest in the \nquality of life their community provides is central to our collective \nideas about freedom and self-determination. As a nation, we know that \nhomeownership helps the emotional and intellectual growth and \ndevelopment of children. We know that homeowners show greater interest \nand more frequent participation in civic organizations and neighborhood \nissues. We know that when people own homes, they are more likely to \naccumulate wealth and assets and to prepare themselves financially for \nsuch things as their children's education and retirement.\n  In America today, homeownership is at a record high. Unfortunately, \nhowever, there remains a significant gap between minority and non-\nminority populations, leaving homeownership an elusive financial \nprospect for many. The homeownership rate for the nation's African \nAmerican and Hispanic households lags more than 25 percentage points \nbelow White households.\n  In Congress, we have the responsibility of ensuring that the dream of \nhomeownership is possible for more of our citizens. Last year, Senator \nJohn Kerry and I drafted and sponsored S. 875, the ``Community \nDevelopment Homeownership Tax Credit Act,'' a bill that enjoys strong \nbipartisan support in the Senate. This legislation would give \ndevelopers and investors an incentive to participate in the \nrehabilitation and construction of homes for low- and moderate-income \nbuyers. This measure is aimed at reaching President Bush's goal of \nincreasing American minority homeownership by 5.5 million families, \nthus making 5.5 million new dreams come true.\n  Owning a home is an integral part of attaining the security, \ncontinuity, and comfort of living the American Dream. I will continue \nto advocate policies that help make this dream become a reality for our \nNation's families. I ask my colleagues to join me in support-\ning homeownership by cosponsoring\nS. 875.\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7823-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7823-S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HOMEOWNERSHIP TAX CREDIT ACT\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

FLOWERS\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today \nto publicly thank Lieutenant General Robert Flowers, who left his post \nas commander and chief of engineers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \non July 1. General Flowers is one of the finest individuals I have \nworked with as a U.S. Senator representing North Dakota. He is not only \na fine, trusted public servant, he is also a good friend.\n  North Dakota and the Nation owe General Flowers a deep debt of \ngratitude. He served as chief of engineers for 4 years, and he served \nadmirably. During that period, he helped advance the construction of \nthe Grand Forks flood control project and other important flood control \nprojects in the Red River Valley. He also fought hand in hand with the \nNorth Dakota congressional delegation as we have worked to implement \nsolutions to the chronic flood at Devils Lake. Throughout it all, he \nhas always gone above and beyond the call of duty.\n  General Flowers is one of the most capable leaders of the Corps of \nEngineers I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He is a true \nprofessional, and has a unique ability to walk into a difficult \ncondition, assess the situation, and calmly, but decisively, take \naction. He listens carefully to people and has a leadership style that \ninvites creative solutions to complex problems.\n  General Flowers is also a man of tremendous integrity. He cares \ndeeply about the people of this Nation, and his commitment to doing the \nright thing was unmatched. He was willing to fight for the needs of \ncommon citizens, even if it meant leading an uphill fight and \nchallenging others within the Corps. To General Flowers, ``no'' was \nsimply unacceptable. He worked diligently to turn over every stone and \nformulate solutions that are workable and responsive to the water \nchallenges faced by communities across the country.\n  I know that the General Flowers leaves the Corps a much better \norganization due to his leadership. The General set high standards for \nhis team, and they delivered time and time again. I will not forget the \ncontributions General Flowers has made to the people of my State and \nthe country.\n  I want to again express my deep appreciation and respect for General \nFlowers for his service to my state and to our Nation. We in North \nDakota will miss you, General, but wish you all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7824-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RETIREMENT OF ADMIRAL JAMES O. ELLIS, JR. FROM U.S. STRATEGIC COMMAND\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today, it is my honor \nand my privilege to recognize one of the finest officers in the U.S. \nNavy, and a good friend of mine, ADM James O. Ellis, Jr.\n  For the past 3 years, ADM Jim Ellis has demonstrated his leadership \nas commander of United States Strategic Command. During his time at \nOffutt AFB, in Nebraska, Jim Ellis personified the Navy's core values \nof integrity, selfless service, and excellence in all things. I join \nthe many Members and staff who enjoyed the opportunity to meet with him \non a variety of strategic issues and came to appreciate his ability to \nintegrate his many talents at Offutt.\n  Admiral Ellis is retiring from his post tomorrow. There will be a \nceremony in Omaha to honor him that I will attend.\n  Today, it is my privilege to recognize with admiration and thanks \nsome of Admiral Ellis' many accomplishments since he entered the \nmilitary 35 years ago, and to commend the superb service he provided \nthe Navy, the Congress and the Nation. Admiral Ellis is a 1969 graduate \nof the U.S. Naval Academy. He was designated a Naval aviator in 1971 \nand has held a variety of sea and shore assignments since 1972.\n  His sea duty billets as a Navy fighter pilot included tours with \nFighter Squadron 92 aboard USS Constellation, CV 64, and Fighter \nSquadron 1 aboard USS Ranger, CV 61.\n  From early in his career, Jim Ellis' exceptional leadership skills \nwere evident as he repeatedly proved himself in select command \npositions. Admiral Ellis was the first Commanding Officer of Strike/\nFighter Squadron 131, deploying in 1985 with new F/A-18 Hornets aboard \nUSS Coral Sea, CV 43. He served as executive officer of the nuclear-\npowered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, CVN 70, and as commanding \nofficer of USS LaSalle, AGF 3, the Arabian Gulf flagship of the \nCommander, Joint Task Force, Middle East.\n  In 1991, Admiral Ellis assumed command of the USS Abraham Lincoln, \nCVN 72, and participated in Operation Desert Storm while deployed \nduring her maiden voyage in the western Pacific and Arabian Gulf. In \nJune 1995, Admiral Ellis assumed command of Carrier Group FIVE/Battle \nForce SEVENTH Fleet, breaking his flag aboard USS Independence, CV 62, \nforward deployed to the Western Pacific and homeported in Yokosuka, \nJapan. As carrier battle group commander he led contingency response \noperations to both the Arabian Gulf and Taiwan Straits.\n  Admiral Ellis also excelled in a variety of key shore and staff \nassignments that included tours as an experimental/operational test \npilot, service in the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs, and duty as \nF/A-18 program coordinator, deputy chief of Naval Operations, Air \nWarfare. He also served as deputy commander and chief of Staff, Joint \nTask Force FIVE, the counternarcotics force for U.S. Commander in Chief \nPacific. In November 1993 he reported as inspector general, U.S. \nAtlantic Fleet, and subsequently served as director for Operations, \nPlans and Policy, N3/N5, on the staff of the commander in chief, U.S. \nAtlantic Fleet. He assumed duties as deputy chief of Naval Operations--\nPlans, Policy and Operations--in November 1996.\n  Admiral Ellis became commander in chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe \nheadquartered in London, England, and commander in chief, Allied \nForces, Southern Europe headquartered in Naples, Italy, in October \n1998. During his time serving in Europe, Admiral Ellis provided support \nto NATO forces as they waged war over Kosovo.\n  I was especially pleased when he was nominated to continue service to \nthe Nation as commander, U.S. Strategic Command in 2001. As such, \nAdmiral Ellis is responsible for the global command and control of U.S. \nstrategic forces and provides a sweeping range of strategic \ncapabilities and options for the President and Secretary of Defense. \nWhile combatant commander in 2002, Admiral Ellis oversaw the merger of \nU.S. Space Command with U.S. Strategic Command, demonstrating exemplary \nleadership during a critical period of transition.\n  Over the years, Admiral Ellis's leadership, professionalism and \nexpertise enabled him to foster exceptional rapport with many Members \nof both the Senate and the House. I am personally grateful for his \nfriendship. I offer congratulations to him and his wife, Polly, on his \nexceptionally well-deserved retirement. The Congress and country \napplaud the selfless commitment his entire family has made to the \nNation in supporting his military career. I know I speak for all my \ncolleagues in expressing my heartfelt appreciation to Admiral Ellis. We \nwish our friend the best of luck. He is truly a credit to both the Navy \nand the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7824-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7824-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7824-5", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7824-S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1856.

A bill to designate the annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman \nFederal Building and United States Courthouse located at 333 \nConstitution Ave. Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, as the \n``Judge William B. Bryant Annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal \nBuilding and United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \ndesignate the recently-constructed annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman \nUnited States Courthouse in Washington, DC as the ``William B. Bryant \nAnnex.''\n  Thomas F. Hogan, this Court's current Chief Judge, has expressed his \nsupport and the unanimous support of the other judges on the District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. I am proud to join with \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton in moving ahead with the Chief \nJudge's request.\n  Judge Bryant served with distinction of the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Columbia since 1965. He was the Chief Judge on that \ncourt from March 1977 to September 1981.\n  Judge Bryant graduated from Howard University in 1932, and from \nHoward University Law School, receiving an LL.B. in 1936.\n  Judge Bryant's lengthy public service career is one of great \ndistinction. In addition to the time he spent on the Federal bench, \nJudge Bryant served in the United States Army during World War II and \nas an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. After \nserving four and one half years as Chief Judge, Judge Bryant took \nsenior status in January of 1982.\n  Naming the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse after \nJudge Bryant would be a fitting tribute to this distinguished jurist. \nMuch like Judge Prettyman, Judge Bryant had an illustrious career in \npublic service and on the bench. I am honored to offer this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join Congresswoman Norton and \nme in support of this well-deserved commendation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mr. Carper, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Leahy, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2620. A bill to provide for the establishment of an Office of \nHigh-Performance Green Buildings, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``High \nPerformance Green Buildings Act of 2004.''\n  I would like to thank Senator Lautenberg and the other cosponsors for \nworking with me to introduce this important legislation.\n  Preliminary studies are showing that high-performance green buildings \ngenerate huge savings in operations and maintenance costs due to their \nefficient operating systems. These studies have also demonstrated that \nhigh-performance green buildings provide a healthier work environment \nfor the occupants, resulting in fewer absences due to illness. The \noutcome is huge savings in health related costs. All of these savings \nare generated, while sustaining very little impact on their surrounding \nenvironment.\n  In the United States, buildings account for: 36 percent of total \nenergy use; 65 percent of electricity consumption; 30 percent of \ngreenhouse gas emissions; 30 percent of raw materials use; 30 percent \nof waste output and 12 percent of potable water consumption.\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\nWhy not build buildings that strive to conserve our precious resources \nand reduce the harmful pollutants that are damaging to the environment?\n  In an era of great security concern, green buildings have reduced \nenergy requirements and may use renewable sources of energy that are \noff the electricity grid. Green buildings also use less water and some \neven collect rainwater to use throughout the building. Should there be \na terrorist act that damages or destroys our Nation's resources, these \nbuildings could assist in keeping our government up and running.\n  There is no downside to utilizing high-performance buildings. This \ninitiative is taking off in the private sector. According to the US \nGreen Building Council, there are 118 certified green buildings across \nthe United States with 1,395 in the pipeline. This legislation would \nensure that the Federal Government is keeping pace with the real world \nand doing its part to protect the environment and provide a safe work \nplace for its employees.\n  The General Services Administration, GSA, is the largest landlord in \nthe United States, with over 8,700 buildings in their current \ninventory. This legislation creates an office within GSA to oversee the \ngreen building efforts of agencies within the government. GSA is a \nnatural leader to focus on our federal buildings and ensure that they \nare safe, healthy, and efficient.\n  This legislation will coordinate the efforts within the Federal \nGovernment to promote high-performance green buildings, provide public \noutreach, and expand existing research.\n  The bill creates an Interagency Steering Committee to advise the \nOffice within GSA. The Committee will be comprised of key \nrepresentatives of each relevant agency, state and local governments, \nnongovernment organizations, and experts within the building community. \nThis Committee will ensure that the Federal Government stays up to date \nwith technology and the latest advancements to ensure that high-\nperformance buildings operate efficiently while continuing to provide a \nhealthier environment for the occupants.\n  In addition, research efforts will be expanded to focus on buildings \nand the impacts that their systems have on human health and worker \nproductivity. We just don't know enough. Are we making our employees \nsick by providing poor workspace?\n  The High-Performance Green Buildings Act also requires that a good \nhard look be taken at the budget process we have used for years and \nexplore ways to improve the approval process for government projects. \nWe need to grow with the times and ensure that our budget process \nallows us to take into account life-cycle costing. This means that we \nallow our financial experts to factor in savings that green buildings \ngenerate over time, and don't just look at the upfront cost of a \nbuilding. It has been documented that high-performance green buildings \nrecover any initial upfront costs from incorporating efficient systems \nwithin the first few years of operation. The average life of a federal \nbuilding is 50 years. In the times of soaring budget deficits, it is \nimperative that the Federal Government pursue all cost-saving options.\n  High-performance green buildings are not just for federal buildings, \nbut involve any type of building, including schools. This legislation \nalso focuses on providing healthier, more efficient school facilities \nfor our children. The bill provides $10 million in grants to state and \nlocal education agencies for technical assistance and the \nimplementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's, EPA, Tools for \nSchools Program. The bill will help schools develop plans to focus on \nthe design, construction, and renovation of school facilities, and look \nat systematic improvements for school siting, indoor air quality, \nreducing contaminants, and other health issues. This legislation also \nencourages research to study the effects that these systems are having \non student health and productivity. Our children deserve to learn in an \nenvironment that is safe and conducive to learning.\n  Lastly, this bill will promote leadership within the Federal \nGovernment and provide incentives for government agencies to build \nhigh-performance green buildings. It also creates a clearinghouse to \nkeep individuals and entities, including Congress and the government, \ninformed on the information and services that the Office will provide.\n  I strongly encourage your support of the ``High-Performance Green \nBuildings Act of 2004.'' This has been a long time coming and will \nbenefit all of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the ``High-Performance Green Buildings \nAct of 2004'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) buildings have profound impacts on the environment, \n     energy use, and health of individuals, and numerous studies \n     suggest that building environments affect worker \n     productivity;\n       (2) buildings in the United States consume 37 percent of \n     the energy, 68 percent of the electricity, and 12 percent of \n     the potable water used in the United States, and overall \n     construction of buildings (including construction of related \n     infrastructure) consumes 60 percent of all raw materials used \n     in the economy of the United States (excluding materials used \n     for food or fuel);\n       (3) in the United States, buildings generate--\n       (A) 40 percent of the nonindustrial waste stream;\n       (B) 31 percent of the mercury in municipal solid waste; and\n       (C) 35 percent of the carbon dioxide (the primary \n     greenhouse gas associated with climate change), 49 percent of \n     the sulfur dioxide, and 25 percent of the nitrogen oxides \n     found in the air;\n       (4) buildings contribute to the ``heat island effect'' by \n     eliminating vegetative cover and using paving and roofing \n     materials that absorb heat and raise ambient temperatures, \n     accelerating the reaction that forms ground-level ozone;\n       (5) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, on \n     average, people in the United States spend approximately 90 \n     percent of their time indoors, where the concentration of \n     pollutants may be 2 to 5 times and, in some cases, 100 times, \n     higher than pollution concentrations in outdoor air;\n       (6) the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency have connected poor indoor air quality to \n     significantly elevated rates of mortality;\n       (7) health impacts from building materials, such as \n     adhesives, paints, carpeting, and pressed-wood products, \n     which may emit pollutants such as formaldehyde or other \n     volatile organic compounds, are still uncertain but are \n     believed to be potentially significant;\n       (8) according to the Building Owners and Managers \n     Association, because costs relating to employees, at $130 per \n     square foot annually (including health insurance costs), are \n     by far the highest business costs of a building, as opposed \n     to total energy costs at $1.81 per square foot, measures to \n     improve the indoor air quality of a building can be an \n     important investment in reducing long-term employee costs;\n       (9) the use of energy efficient systems and alternative \n     sources of energy--\n       (A) reduces building costs; and\n       (B) improves the security of the United States by ensuring \n     continuing operations despite any potential interruptions in \n     the primary energy supply of the United States as a result of \n     terrorism or other disruptions of the electricity grid;\n       (10) by integrating issues relating to natural resource \n     use, human health, materials use, transportation needs, and \n     other concerns into planning the life cycle of a building, \n     architects, designers, and developers can construct buildings \n     that--\n\n[[Page S7831]]\n\n       (A) are healthier for occupants;\n       (B) reduce environmental impacts; and\n       (C) are less wasteful of resources;\n       (11) a well-designed high-performance green building can be \n     less expensive to build and operate throughout the lifetime \n     of the building than a building that is not a high-\n     performance green building;\n       (12) in 2003, in the document entitled ``The Federal \n     Commitment to Green Building: Experiences and Expectations'', \n     the Office of the Federal Environmental Executive found that \n     ``[t]here is a mixture of diverse Federal green building \n     mandates in law, regulation, and Executive Orders, but not \n     one definitive, clear, and unified policy statement on \n     environmental design. Many within the Federal government are \n     working on green buildings, but additional coordination and \n     integration are needed.'';\n       (13) a central coordinating Federal authority for green \n     buildings would increase efficiency of, improve communication \n     between, and reduce duplication within green building \n     programs; and\n       (14) the General Services Administration, as the largest \n     civilian landlord in the United States, managing more than \n     8,300 buildings owned or leased by the United States, is the \n     appropriate agency to provide Federal agency coordination of \n     green building programs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords \ntoday in introducing the High-Performance Green Buildings Act. This \nlegislation will reenergize the Federal Government's commitment to \nbuilding design and construction into the 21st Century.\n  Buildings have an enormous impact on environmental quality, on energy\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\nuse, and on natural resource consumption. The statistics are \nstaggering. Buildings devour 37 percent of the energy used in this \ncountry, including 68 percent of electricity. They are responsible for \n35 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, the primary greenhouse gas \nassociated with climate change. And they account for 49 percent of \nsulfur dioxide and 25 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions and generate \n40 percent of the Nation's non-industrial waste stream. Moreover, \nbuilding construction and demolition produce 136 million tons of waste \nin this country, and use 12 percent of potable water in the U.S. Mr. \nPresident, for too long these prodigious effects have gone \nunrecognized.\n  The impacts are even more far reaching than that. Since Americans \nspend an average of 90 percent of their time indoors, buildings have a \nconsiderable influence on public health. According to the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, indoor air pollution concentrations may be two \nto five times, and in some cases 100 times, higher than in outdoor air. \nEPA scientists estimates that about 20,000 deaths occur related to \nindoor levels of radon, and that 3000 lung cancer deaths occur among \nnonsmoking adults due to second-hand smoke each year.\n  Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nestimate that an additional 35,000 coronary disease deaths occur each \nyear in this country among nonsmoking adults due to second-hand smoke. \nThese losses do not include exposure to toxic pollutants emitted from \nbuilding materials, such as adhesives, paints, carpets, and pressed-\nwood products, which many researchers believe to be significant. We \nmust confront these environmental and public health challenges and to \ndo so we need a vision for the future. Our legislation offers that \nvision.\n  High-performance green buildings are designed and constructed in ways \nthat significantly reduce or eliminate negative effects on the \nenvironment, on energy use, and on resource consumption. They are also \ndesigned to reduce or eliminate harmful pressures on the health and \nproductivity of building occupants. According to the U.S. Green \nBuilding Council, a national nonprofit organization, green design and \nconstruction practices are directed at five broad areas: 1. Sustainable \nsite planning; 2. Safeguarding water and water efficiency; 3. Energy \nefficiency and renewable energy; 4. Conservation of materials and \nresources; and 5. Indoor environmental quality.\n  Green buildings have many benefits, and while the initial investment \nmay be higher (although not necessarily) than for a traditional \nbuildings, they significantly lower long-term costs for things such as \nheating and cooling. Since new government buildings are intended to be \nused for a long period of time--at least 50 years--it is easier to \njustify any initial higher investment costs. By improving working \nconditions and increasing daylighting, case studies have shown that \ngreen buildings improve occupant productivity and reduce employee \nabsenteeism. This legislation would provide for research to capture and \nmeasure those impacts and incorporate the lessons learned into future \nconstruction.\n  The High-Performance Green Building Act focuses Federal Government \nefforts to promote the environmental, energy, health, and economic \nbenefits that can be realized from green buildings. This legislation \nincorporates the findings of two reports that make recommendations for \nimproving the Federal Government's role in relation to high-performance \ngreen buildings. The first report, ``Building Momentum: National Trends \nand Prospects for High-Performance Green Buildings,'' was prepared by \nthe U.S. Green Building Council and the second report, ``The Federal \nCommitment to Green Building: Experiences and Expectations,'' was \nreleased by the President's Office of the Federal Environmental \nExecutive.\n  Our legislation changes the way the Federal Government manages its \nthousands of buildings. The bill establishes an Office of High-\nPerformance Green Buildings within the General Services Administration, \nGSA, which is the logical place for this office since this agency is \nthe Federal Government's primary landlord. GSA manages over 8,700 \nbuildings owned or leased by the United States. The new office will \npromote public outreach, coordinate and focus research and development, \nand improve life-cycle analysis and budgeting for building \nconstruction. This title also creates an Interagency Steering Committee \nto improve coordination across Federal agencies, and with state and \nlocal governments.\n  This bill would expand the role of EPA in supporting healthier \nbuildings at the nation's schools. Schools can serve as the vanguard \nfor the effort to protect our children's health and the environment, so \nthis title authorizes the Agency to administer grants to state and \nlocal education agencies to support implementation of EPA's effective \nTools for Schools Program. It also authorizes the Agency to develop \nFederal guidelines for school location siting that take into account \nthe special vulnerabilities of children to the contamination of land \nand water.\n  This legislation would incorporate building life-cycle costing as a \ntool to achieve more efficient and economical long-term investments in \ngovernment buildings, by requiring the Comptroller General to review \nthe annual Federal budget process and submit a plan to reach these \ngoals to Congress.\n  In closing, investing in green buildings is good public policy for a \nvariety of reasons. Our bill will allow the Federal Government to take \na leadership role in promoting green buildings. We have a commitment to \nour children and grandchildren to protect and conserve the planet's \nresources and to safeguard public health. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida:\n  S. 2621. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nextend the pilot program for alternative water source projects; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the Authorization for the Alternative \nWater Sources Act of 2000, which I originally introduced, expires this \nyear. I am introducing a bill to extend this law for five years through \nFiscal Year 2009 at an average authorization level of $25 million per \nyear.\n  Our Nation's water supply needs are great and growing. For instance, \neach day the State of Florida adds 900 residents. To satisfy the water \nneeds of this daily population increase, Florida must supply 200,000 \nmore gallons of fresh water per day. Furthermore, the additional \ninfrastructure needed to accommodate new residents blocks rainwater \npenetration into aquifers, lowering the water table. In fact, residents \nof Florida's west coast are increasingly resorting to drinking \ndesalinated water as fresh water sources no longer suffice. Depletion \nof fresh water has resulted in saltwater intrusion into inland aquifers \ntainting water supplies and reducing the ability of soils to grow \nplants.\n  Other States are facing similar crises.\n  In southern New Jersey, water demands are so great that groundwater \nwithdrawals from aquifers have lowered the water table by 200 feet, \ncausing saltwater intrusion.\n  In Georgia and South Carolina, excessive water demand has \nsignificantly lowered water levels causing the upward migration of salt \nwater in the Brunswick area and an encroachment of seawater into the \naquifer at the northern end of Hilton Head Island.\n  On the East Coast, which gets on average 40 inches of rain per year, \nwater resources have long been thought to be inexhaustible. However \nwith changing population patterns and increasing personal and \ncommercial water use, many water-rich areas are finding that the water \nwill not always be there when they need it.\n  The extension of the Alternative Water Sources Act will provide \nStates with the assistance they need to meet the needs of growing \npopulations without harming the environment. It will also provide funds \non a cost-shared basis to States for development of non-traditional \nwater resources that will provide much needed water and prevent future \nenvironmental damages.\n  The bill I introduce today, authorizes the EPA to provide grants, at \nan average $25 million a year for Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009, on a \ncost-shared basis for alternative water source projects. The EPA \nadministrator is required to take into account the eligibility of a \nproject for funding under the existing programs when selecting\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\nprojects for funding under this nationwide program.\n  This law is critical to the environmentally friendly development of \nwater resources in the United States. It authorizes funds for \ninnovative water reuse, reclamation and conservation projects--helping \nmany States meet current and future water supply.\n  Populations in water-rich areas are drawing increasingly on limited \ngroundwater supplies. In the past, groundwater users in the East might \nhave been characterized as private wells and small public water \nsystems. Today, as people move away from traditional population centers \nalong major rivers, groundwater use is increasing. In Pennsylvania, \nabout six million people rely on groundwater.\n  Yet, trillions of gallons of fresh water in the United States are \nwasted and flood into the sea annually. For instance, in Florida, every \nyear approximately 970 billion gallons of fresh water are diverted into \ncanals that flow into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. This \nprecious fresh water would otherwise have replenished aquifers or \nnourished fragile aquatic ecosystems. If properly captured and stored, \nthis water could be used for industrial or commercial activities, \nreducing pressure on precious drinking water sources.\n  Our increasing water needs require immediate attention.\n  We continue to make progress in conservation. In the South Florida \nWater Management District, nearly 200 million gallons of water are \nbeing reused per day. However, demands remain great. For instance, each \nresident in South Florida uses nearly 175 gallons of fresh water per \nday--almost twice the national average. Much of this potable water is \nused for watering landscaping. We must find ways to reserve potable \nwater for drinking and make better use of other sources of water for \nagricultural, commercial and outdoor watering purposes.\n  With innovations in water quantity management, we can curtail such \ntremendous wastes of water and reuse the water that supply storage \nfacilities now cannot absorb.\n  In 1999, I sponsored S. 968, the Alternative Water Sources Act, which \nauthorized funding for alternative water projects in States that do not \nreceive funds for water supply projects. In 2000, my bill was \nincorporated into S. 835, the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act of 2000, \nwhich became Public Law 106-457. Unfortunately, the authorization for \nthe Alternative Water Sources Act is due to expire this year. With our \nNation facing many water quantity management issues, we must act now to \nrenew the authorization.\n  Congress can provide tools to ensure that Americans have the water \nthey need for a healthy and productive future. The Alternative Water \nSources Act is one such tool, and we must not let it expire. I hope \nthat Congress will approve an extension of the Act before the end of \nthe year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PILOT PROGRAM FOR ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCE \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n       Section 220(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n     (33 U.S.C. 1300(j)) is amended in the first sentence--\n       (1) by striking ``$75,000,000'' and inserting \n     ``$125,000,000''; and\n       (2) by striking ``2002 through 2004'' and inserting ``2005 \n     through 2009''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2622. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain Federal land \nin the Santa Fe National Forest and certain non-Federal land in the \nPecos National Historical Park in the State of New Mexico; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing along with \nSenator Domenici the ``Pecos National Historical Park Land Exchange Act \nof 2004''. This bill will authorize a land exchange between the Federal \nGovernment and a private landowner that will benefit the Pecos National \nHistorical Park in my State of New Mexico.\n  Specifically, the bill will enable the Park Service to acquire a \nprivate inholding within the Park's boundaries in exchange for the \ntransfer of a nearby tract of National Forest System land. The National \nForest parcel has been identified as available for exchange in the \nSanta Fe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and is \nsurrounded by private lands on three sides.\n  The Pecos National Historical Park possesses exceptional historic and \narchaeological resources. Its strategic location between the Great \nPlains and the Rio Grande Valley has made it the focus of the region's \n10,000 years of human history. The Park preserves the ruins of the \ngreat Pecos pueblo, which was a major trade center, and the ruins of \ntwo Spanish colonial missions dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n  The Glorieta Unit of the Park protects key sites associated with the \n1862 Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass, a significant event that ended \nthe Confederate attempt to expand the war into the West. This Unit will \ndirectly benefit from the land exchange.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill I have \nintroduced today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, Senator Bingaman and I are \nintroducing the ``Pecos National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of \n2004''. This bill will authorize a land exchange between the Federal \nGovernment and a private landowner that will benefit the Pecos National \nHistorical Park in my State of New Mexico.\n  I am pleased to be working on this legislation again with Senator \nBingaman. This bill is nearly identical to a bill that we worked on and \nmarked up in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the 106th \nSession of Congress.\n  The bill will enable the Park Service to acquire a private inholding \nwithin the Pecos National Historic Park's boundaries in exchange for \nthe transfer of a nearby tract of National Forest System land. The \nNational Forest parcel has been identified as surplus and available for \nexchange in the Santa Fe National Forest Land and Resource Management \nPlan and is surrounded by private lands on three sides.\n  The Pecos National Historical Park is located between the Great \nPlains and the Rio Grande Valley and that has made it the focus of the \nregion's 10,000 years of human history. The park preserves the ruins of \nthe great Pecos pueblo--a major trade center--and the ruins of two \nSpanish colonial missions dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n  The Glorieta Unit of the Park, where this exchange is located, \nprotects key sites associated with the 1862 Civil War Battle of \nGlorieta Pass, a significant event that ended the Confederate attempt \nto expand the war into the west. This unit will directly benefit from \nthe land exchange.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2623. A bill to amend section 402 of the Personal Responsibility \nand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide a 2-year \nextension of supplemental security income in fiscal years 2005 through \n2007 for refugees, asylees, and certain other humanitarian immigrants; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleagues, Senators Kohl and Lugar to introduce this important piece \nof legislation. Legislation that will ensure the United States \ngovernment does not turn its back on political asylees or refugees who \nare the most vulnerable citizens seeking safety in this great country \nof ours.\n  As many of you may know, Congress as part of Personal Responsibility \nand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) modified the SSI \nprogram to include a seven-year time limit on the receipt of benefits \nfor refugees and asylees. This policy was intended to balance the \ndesire to have people who emigrate to the United States to become \ncitizens, with an understanding that the naturalization process also \ntakes time to complete. To allow adequate time for asylees and refugees \nto become naturalized citizens Congress provided the seven-year time \nlimit before the expiration of SSI benefits.\n  Unfortunately, the naturalization process often takes longer than \nseven years because applicants are required to live in the United \nStates for a minimum of five years prior to applying for citizenship \nand the INS often takes three or more years to process the application. \nBecause of this time delay, many individuals are trapped in the system \nfaced with the loss of their SSI benefits.\n  If Congress does not act to change the law, reports show that over \nthe next four years nearly 30,000 elderly and disabled refugees and \nasylees will lose their Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits \nbecause their seven-year time limit will expire before they become \ncitizens. Many of these individuals are elderly who fled persecution or \ntorture in their home countries. They include Jews fleeing religious \npersecution in the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing the Saddam \nHussein regime, Cubans and Hmong people from the highlands of Laos who \nserved on the side of the United States military during the Vietnam \nWar. They are elderly and unable to work, and have become reliant on \ntheir SSI benefits as their primary income. To penalize them because of \ndelays encountered through the bureaucratic process seems unjust and \ninappropriate.\n  I would like to share the story of Yelena, a victim of religious \npersecution in the former Soviet Union who sought refuge in the United \nStates seven years ago and is currently living in Portland, Oregon. At \nthe age of 82, Yelena relies on SSI and other public benefits programs \nto buy food and pay her monthly bills. Yelena is now stuck in a multi-\nyear backlog waiting for her green card, the first step toward \ncitizenship. She was raised in a small village in the Soviet Union \nwhere she had little access to formal education and never learned \nEnglish. She has struggled to grasp the language since arriving in the \nUS and as a result, her seven-year anniversary arrived before she was \nable to naturalize. Yelena is now without her SSI benefits and still \nfighting to become a citizen. We must help Yelena and others like her.\n  The Administration in its fiscal year 2005 budget acknowledged the \nnecessity to correct this problem by dedicating funding in its budget \nto extend refugee eligibility for SSI beyond the seven-year limit. \nWhile I am pleased that they have taken the first step in correcting \nthis problem, I am concerned the policy does not go far enough. Data \nshows that most people will need at least an additional two years to \nnavigate and complete the naturalization process. Therefore, my \ncolleagues and I have introduced this bill, which will provide a two-\nyear extension. We believe this will provide the time necessary to \ncomplete the process.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill, and I look \nforward to working with Chairman Grassley and other members of the \nFinance Committee to secure these changes.\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President. In December, 2003, the U.S. government \nunexpectedly announced plans to resettle up to 15,000 Hmong refugees \nfrom Laos currently living in Thailand. These refugees will be reunited \nwith some 200,000 Hmong family members who were resettled here in the \nyears after the Vietnam War, some as recently as the 1990s. Many of \nthese Hmong fought with the CIA in Laos during the Vietnam War, \nproviding critical assistance to U.S. forces. After the fall of Saigon, \nthousands of Hmong fled Laos and its communist Pathet Lao government. \nThe United States remains indebted to these courageous individuals and \ntheir families.\n  While we work with the Department of Health and Human Services to \nidentify funds to help these new refugees resettle, it is extremely \nimportant that we act to help those refugees and asylees already living \nin the United States. In addition to the Hmong, America has served as a \nshelter for Jews and Baptists fleeing religious persecution in the \nformer Soviet Union; and for Iraqis and Cubans escaping tyrannical \ndictatorships. Our policy toward refugees and asylees embodies the best \nof our country--compassion, opportunity, and freedom. I am proud of the \nexample our policies set with respect to the treatment of those seeking \nrefuge.\n  But I am disappointed in our decision to allow these people to enter \nthe country and then deny them the means to live. Thousands of people \nwho fled religious and political persecution to seek freedom in the \nU.S. will now be punished by a short-sighted policy. A provision in the \n1996 welfare reform bill restricted the amount of time that elderly and \ndisabled refugees and asylees could be eligible for Supplemental \nSecurity Income (SSI) benefits. These benefits serve as a basic monthly \nincome for individuals who are 65 or older, disabled or blind. Over the \nnext 4 years, it is estimated that 40,000 refugees and political \nasylees could lose these important benefits on which they often rely.\n  The 1996 welfare law included a 7-year time limit on SSI benefits for \nlegal humanitarian immigrants. In order to avoid losing this important \nsupport, refugees and asylees must become citizens within the 7-year \nlimit. Unfortunately, this has proved impossible for far too many. The \nprocess of becoming a citizen only truly begins after a refugee has \nresided in the U.S. for 5 years as a lawful permanent resident. And \nbeyond that, there are many other barriers, such as language skills and \nprocessing and bureaucratic delays within the various agencies, which \nan immigrant must overcome before they become naturalized. Beginning in \n2003, immigrants trapped in this process--too often the most vulnerable \nelderly and families--began to lose their SSI benefits with no hope of \nrecourse.\n  This inherent flaw in the system has to be changed. That is why \nSenators Smith, Lugar and I are introducing the SSI Extension for \nDisabled and Elderly Refugees Act. This legislation extends the amount \nof time that refugees and asylees have to become citizens to nine \nyears. The legislation will retroactively restore benefits to many who \nhave already lost them, and will protect those who are scheduled to \nlose benefits in the next two years.\n  I cannot stress how important this legislation is to many in the \nState of Wisconsin. Just last month, an article in the Green Bay Press-\nGazette told of the difficulties facing 79-year-old Sia Xiong, a Hmong \nrefugee who could lose benefits in the coming months. Like many elderly \nrefugees, she doesn't know English, which poses a huge barrier in her \napplication for citizenship. Despite the assistance that has been given \nto refugees like Xiong from agencies such as Lutheran Social Services \nor Kajsiab House or the Neighborhood Law Project in Madison, the length \nof the naturalization process has proved overwhelming to too many \nrefugees.\n  Congress must take action immediately to help people like Xiong, and \nher family. In addition to the Hmong population in Wisconsin, almost \nevery State in the country is home to immigrants who will be affected \nby the limit. Our country has long been a symbol of freedom, equality \nand opportunity. Our laws should reflect that. Every day that goes by \ncould result in the loss of a refugee's support system--I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and restore the principles we \nwere put here to protect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 2624. A bill to require the United States Trade Representative to \npursue a complaint of anti-competitive practices against certain oil \nexporting countries; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nwith Senators Durbin, Levin and Reid, with Congressman DeFazio in the \nHouse, to bring fairness to the oil markets and do something to reverse \nthe recent spikes in gas prices.\n  Our legislation will force the United States Trade Representative \n(USTR) to initiate World Trade Organization (WTO) proceedings against \nOPEC nations. Under WTO rules, countries are not permitted to maintain \nexport quotas. But OPEC nations actually collude to set such quotas.\n  OPEC is an illegal cartel, plain and simple. We've allowed this \ncartel to operate for too long--it's time to put an end to it.\n  The American people are feeling the effects of the OPEC cartel every \nday at the gas pumps. Many families are already struggling with lost \njobs, stagnant wages and the rising costs of health care. High gas \nprices have only made matters worse.\n  When President Bush took office, a gallon of gas cost $1.47. Today, a \ngallon of gas averages $1.90. For someone who buys one tank of gas a \nweek, that increase costs $350 per year.\n  All this adds up. Oil imports now account for $125 billion annually, \nor one-quarter of America's trade deficit. That money could be invested \nhere at home to create American jobs, but instead we are being gouged \nby oil exporters.\n  While Americans suffer, President Bush has done nothing to bring down \ngas prices. He says he will talk to his Saudi friends in the oil \nbusiness. But talk is cheap. The American people want action. This bill \ntoday is an opportunity for action.\n  I have also released a report today, explaining the basis for a WTO \ncomplaint against OPEC.\n  In some ways, the allegations are simple and straightforward: OPEC \nmanipulates world oil markets by imposing export quotas on oil. These \nquotas keep the price of oil artificially high.\n  Without OPEC, market analysts have estimated that the free market \nprice of a barrel of oil would be around 10 to 15 dollars lower than \ntoday's price. That would make a difference in gas prices of 20 to 45 \ncents per gallon, saving American families hundreds of dollars per \nyear. There is no reason to continue to tolerate OPEC's anti-\ncompetitive behavior.\n  Collusion to put quotas on oil exports--or any exports--is illegal \nunder WTO rules. For example, the WTO has found that a treaty between \nthe United States and Japan limiting semiconductor exports violated WTO \nrules.\n  The Bush administration has been lax in dealing with OPEC. In my \nview, President Bush's ties to the Saudis and to big oil companies \nprevent him from sticking up for the American consumer.\n  Indeed, while the squeeze was being put on American consumers, oil \ncompanies and refineries reported record profits in the first quarter \nof this year for operations in the United States. Earnings for U.S. \ndomestic refining and marketing operations increased by 294 percent for \nChevron-Texaco, 165 percent for BP, 125 percent for ExxonMobil, and 44 \npercent for Conoco-Phillips over last year's levels.\n  So while OPEC and their oil company allies have seen a boom, American \nfamilies have seen a bust. In fact, for those middle-income Americans \nwho will see any benefit at all from the recent tax cuts, rising gas \nprices alone will eat up half of those cuts.\n  Since the Bush administration has failed to live up to its \nresponsibilities, it's time for the Congress to stand up for the \nAmerican people and force it to take action against OPEC.\n  I urge support of this common-sense legislation, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\n                                S. 2624\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a national demonstration project to \nimprove intervention programs for the most disadvantaged children and \nyouth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Mr. Wyden, \nto introduce the ``Friends of the Children National Demonstration Act'' \nto authorize funding for Friends of the Children.\n  Friends of the Children is a promising early intervention program \nestablished in Portland, Oregon, in 1993. The program identifies the \nmost disadvantaged children at the kindergarten or first grade level \nand matches those children with ``professional mentors'' (also known as \n``Friends''). Once matched, professional mentors work with children for \na period of up to 12 years.\n  Started over a decade ago with just three Friends serving as mentors \nto 24 children, Friends of the Children has grown to serve over 600 \nchildren in 11 communities throughout the United States. The mission of \nFriends of the Children is to help our Nation's most disadvantaged \nchildren to develop the relationships, goals, and skills necessary to \nbreak the cycles of poverty, abuse, and violence in order to become a \ncontributing member of society.\n  Extensive research has shown that the single most important factor \nthat fosters resiliency in children is having a long-term relationship \nwith a caring, supportive adult. Friends of the Children is a unique \nprogram that provides just such a relationship for disadvantaged \nchildren.\n  In 1993, Friends of the Children welcomed T.R., a first grader, into \nthe Portland program. At home, T.R. was routinely exposed to drug use, \ngang activity, and violence. Through the program, T.R. was matched with \nhis mentor, Jerrell, to help maintain a support system in T.R.'s life. \nJerrell tutors, counsels, advises and is a companion to T.R. whether it \nis discussing T.R.'s plans for the future or dealing with his family \nrelationships. Without the help of someone like Jerrell, T.R. believes \nthat he would probably have dropped out of school or joined a gang. \nNow, T.R. is giving back to his community by working for Self \nEnhancement, Inc., an organization that teaches leadership skills to \nmiddle school students. T.R. has overcome great adversity to mature \ninto a responsible young adult. T.R. aspires to pursue a career in \nbusiness and would like to run his own company one day.\n  Last week, T.R. became one of the first students to graduate from the \nFriends of the Children program. Along with his classmates, T.R. was \nidentified by the program over a decade ago. He was part of a group of \nchildren identified as the most in danger of abuse, neglect, juvenile \ndelinquency, gang and drug involvement, school failure, and teenage \npregnancy. Today, these children have grown into young adults. They \nhave positive values and show great potential to become healthy, \nproductive members of their communities.\n  ``The Friends of the Children National Demonstration Act'' will \nestablish a national demonstration project to promote learning about \nsuccessful early and sustained childhood intervention programs. This \nbill would authorize funding for Friends of the Children activities and \nlocal program operations at existing sites including ongoing \nevaluation, and dissemination of findings for the benefit of policy \nmakers and other youth programs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this bill and \nmake a commitment to improving the lives of disadvantaged children and \nyouth.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Smith, the ``Friends of the Children National \nDemonstration Act'' to authorize funding for Friends of the Children. \nThe companion of this bill is being introduced in the House today by \nCongressman Earl Blumenauer.\n  This innovative program is truly a best practice in the field of \nyouth development. Friends of the Children was started in Portland, OR, \nand was modeled on extensive research indicating that the strongest \nprotective factor for highly disadvantaged children is an on-going \nrelationship with a supportive, caring adult. Today, Friends of the \nChildren is the only program in the Nation that provides carefully \nscreened full-time professional mentors to disadvantaged youth for 12 \nyears starting in kindergarten or first grade. Friends of the \nChildren's first class of students is now graduating. These young \npeople have outperformed their peer group of disadvantaged youth in \nevery respect. They are in school, have passing grades, have not been \nincarcerated, do not abuse drugs or alcohol, and have not become \ninvolved in gang violence.\n  Let me share the story of one of these friends. In 1993, a first \ngrader named Demarcus joined the Friends of the Children-Portland \nprogram in an attempt to overcome a family history of substance abuse \nand violence. His mother was raising three children as a single parent \nand she was overwhelmed. As a participant in the Friends of the \nChildren program, Demarcus was matched with a ``Friend,'' Ruben, who \nhas been his mentor for the past eight years. Ruben and Demarcus have \ndeveloped a strong relationship through activities ranging from playing \nbasketball to having serious conversations about life and preparing for \nthe future. Ruben has helped\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\nDemarcus develop anger management skills and maturity. While many of \nDemarcus's friends and family have been incarcerated or have been \nvictims of gun violence, Demarcus is a success story. Now 17 years old, \nhe is a responsible young man who makes good choices and knows that \nactions have consequences. When he graduates from high school, he hopes \nto work toward becoming a pilot, either by joining the military or \nattending college. Friends of the Children mentors have been major \nsupporters of Demarcus and his goal to attain higher education. The \nmentors have helped him grow into the focused young adult he is today.\n  Last week in Portland, the first class of Friends of the Children, \nincluding Demarcus, graduated from the program. By all accounts these \nchildren have beaten the odds and are success stories. Twelve years ago \nthese young people were identified by their elementary schools as most \nlikely to fail. Today, they are soon-to-be high school graduates.\n  Currently, Friends of the Children serves over 600 children in 11 \ncommunities across the United States. ``The Friends of the Children \nNational Demonstration Act'' will establish a national demonstration \nproject to promote learning about successful early and sustained \nchildhood interventions. This bill would authorize funding for Friends \nof the Children activities and local program operations at existing \nsites, ongoing evaluation, and dissemination of findings for the \nbenefit of policy makers and other youth-serving programs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and \nmake a commitment to improving the lives of disadvantaged children and \nyouth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 2628. A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, \nto clarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in nondisclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the \nSpecial Counsel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Federal \nEmployee's Protection of Disclosures Act. Last year I introduced \nsimilar legislation, S. 1358, to amend employee safeguards for \ndisclosing government waste, fraud, and abuse with the support of \nSenators Grassley, Levin, Leahy, Durbin, Dayton, Pryor, Johnson, and \nLautenberg.\n  Today, I am pleased that we can introduce a strong bipartisan version \nof this legislation with the additional support of Senators Collins, \nLieberman, Fitzgerald, and Voinovich. Thanks to the work of the bill's \ncosponsors, we have developed legislation that strikes the right \nbalance between the protection of Federal whistleblowers and our \nnational security.\n  As my colleagues know, the events of September 11, 2001, have brought \nrenewed attention to the security lapses at our Nation's airports, \nnuclear facilities, borders, and law enforcement agencies. However, in \nmany cases, the current whistleblower system fails to protect those who \nwould disclose information that could ensure the safety and welfare of \nthe American people. As of May 2004, Federal whistleblowers have \nprevailed on the merits of their claims before the Federal Circuit \nCourt of Appeals only once since 1994. This record sends the wrong \nmessage. How can we expect civil servants to protect and defend the \nUnited States when we permit agencies to retaliate against them for \ndoing their job?\n  I know the Department of Justice (DOJ) has objected to previous \nlegislation concerning this problem. This comes as no surprise as the \nDepartment has an institutional conflict of interest with restoring \nwhistleblower rights as it is charged with defending agencies charged \nwith retaliating against the whistleblower. Nonetheless, I have worked \nwith my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee to address \nsome the concerns raised by the Justice Department while still \nprotecting federal employees.\n  One of the most significant changes in the bill relates to the \nprotection of employees who find their security clearances stripped as \na means of retaliation for blowing the whistle. Current law does not \npermit the whistleblower to have his or her case heard by an \nindependent adjudicator when this type of retaliation occurs.\n  Under our bill, the whistleblower would be able to bring a case \nbefore the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) on an expedited basis \nwhen the employing agency revokes, suspends, denies, or makes another \ndetermination in relation to an employee's security clearance or access \nto classified materials. However, the employing agency need only prove \nby a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the action \nagainst the employee irrespective the whistleblower's disclosure. By \nlowering the burden of proof for the employing agency from clear and \nconvincing, as is the standard with other whistleblower cases, to \npreponderance of the evidence, our legislation strikes a balance \nbetween having an open and transparent process for whistleblowers and \nthe need to make security clearance or access determinations in the \ninterests of national security.\n  The Department of Justice was also concerned with a provision in the \nprior bill, S. 1358, which granted independent litigating authority to \nthe Special Counsel. In testimony before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last November, the Department claimed that extending this \nauthority to the Special Counsel would usurp DOJ's traditional unifying \nrole as the Executive Branch's representative in court. The Department \nalso claimed that the provision would undermine a number of important \npolicy goals, including the presentation of uniform positions on \nsignificant legal issues and the objective litigation of cases by \nattorneys unaffected by concerns of a single agency that may be \ninimical to the interests of the Government as a whole.\n  However, many agencies have independent litigating authority, \nincluding the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the MSPB, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority. Moreover, interagency disputes are not unique. It is \ninappropriate for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), the agency \ncharged with protecting the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), to seek \napproval from DOJ, the agency charged with protecting agencies alleged \nto have retaliated against whistleblowers, in order to carry out its \nmission. Nonetheless, our bill would not provide the Special Counsel \nwith independent litigating authority but rather provide it with \nindependent authority to file amicus briefs with federal courts. This \nauthority will allow the Special Counsel to protect the WPA while \naddressing concerns raised by the Justice Department.\n  In addition, our compromise measure would still provide protection to \nwhistleblowers subject to retaliatory investigations, but not for \nroutine or non-discretionary investigations of the employee and codify \nthe definition of reasonable belief an employee must have in order to \ndetermine when an employee has made a protected disclosure. I am \npleased that our new bill, among other things, retains language \nrestoring congressional intent regarding the definition of a protected \ndisclosure, codifying the anti-gag provision that has been in every \nappropriations law since 1988, and establishing a more reasonable test \nfor determining government mismanagement instead of irrefragable proof. \nAccording to the Federal Circuit, in order to determine that the \nfederal government has engaged in gross mismanagement, the \nwhistleblower must have irrefragable proof, meaning proof impossible to \nrefute.\n  The bill also retains language, subject to a five-year sunset, \nproviding whistleblowers the opportunity to have their cases heard by \nfederal courts other than the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. These \nprovisions are necessary to facilitate disclosures of government \nmismanagement in order for Congress to do its job and make informed \ndecisions when carrying out its legislative, appropriation, and \noversight functions for the protection the American people.\n  Our government is responsible for services and programs that touch \nall\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\nAmericans. The Federal employees who carry out these responsibilities \non behalf of the American people must be able to communicate with \nCongress without fear of losing their jobs when reporting threats to \npublic health and safety and government mismanagement. We must have a \ncredible and functioning WPA. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan bill and ensure real protection for Federal whistleblowers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2628\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an intergovernmental grant program to \nidentify and develop homeland security information, equipment, \ncapabilities, technologies, and services to further the homeland \nsecurity needs of Federal, State, and local governments; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the United States and Israel share a \nstrong and enduring friendship. We also share the threat of terrorist \nattacks against our citizens. Yet, while terrorism within our borders \nis relatively new to us, Israelis have confronted this danger for \ndecades. Israel's long history of fighting terrorism has spurred \nIsraeli businesses, researchers and academics to develop highly \nsophisticated homeland security technologies, particularly in the \nfields of border integrity, transportation security, and first \nresponder equipment. As the United States pursues new approaches to \nprotecting our Nation, it only makes sense to look to Israel's \nextensive expertise in this area.\n  This is why I am introducing legislation with Senator Lieberman to \nestablish a program to provide funds to eligible joint ventures between \nAmerican firms and businesses in countries such as Israel that are \nalready highly focused on the homeland security issue and have \ndemonstrated the capacity for fruitful cooperation with America in the \narea of counterterrorism.\n  This program will act as a revolving fund to develop new homeland \nsecurity technologies. As these technologies are deployed and become \nprofitable, the businesses that developed them will be required to \nrepay the program for the amount of the funds. This requirement, which \nhas worked for similar existing programs, will help sustain the \navailability of funds for future funds.\n  The program will be managed by the Department of Homeland Security. \nIt will dedicate $25 million toward these joint ventures that develop, \nmanufacture, sell, or otherwise provide products and services with \napplications related to homeland security.\n  This legislation will build upon a number of other highly successful \npublic-private partnerships between businesses in the United States and \nthose located in countries such as Israel. Since its founding in 1977, \nthe Bi-National Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD) \nhas created numerous research and development partnerships between \nAmerican and Israeli businesses. The BIRD Foundation has invested $180 \nmillion in 600 projects during the past 27 years. Similar partnerships \nalso exist in the development of agricultural, defense, \ntelecommunications, and other technologies. This record demonstrates \nthe potential of a similar binational foundation in the area of \nhomeland security.\n  As recent international events have demonstrated, the fight against \nterrorism knows no borders. This legislation will enable our Nation to \ndeploy the highest quality and most innovative tools to improve our \nhomeland security.

Con. Res. 121\n\n       Whereas throughout history, physics has contributed to \n     knowledge, civilization, and culture around the world;\n       Whereas physics research has been and continues to be a \n     driving force for scientific, technological, and economic \n     development;\n       Whereas many emerging fields in science and technology, \n     such as nanoscience, information technology, and \n     biotechnology, are substantially based on, and derive many \n     tools from, fundamental discoveries in physics and physics \n     applications;\n       Whereas physics will continue to play a vital role in \n     addressing many 21st-century challenges relating to \n     sustainable development, including environmental \n     conservation, clean sources of energy, public health, and \n     security;\n       Whereas Albert Einstein is a widely recognized scientific \n     figure who contributed enormously to the development of \n     physics, beginning in 1905 with Einstein's groundbreaking \n     papers on the photoelectric effect, the size of molecules, \n     Brownian motion, and the theory of relativity that led to \n     Einstein's most famous equation, E = mc2;\n       Whereas 2005 will be the 100th anniversary of the \n     publication of those groundbreaking papers;\n       Whereas the General Assembly of the International Union of \n     Pure and Applied Physics unanimously approved the proposition \n     designating 2005 as the World Year of Physics; and\n       Whereas the Department of Energy is the leading source of \n     Federal support for academic physics research, accounting for \n     a majority of Federal funding for physics: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of the World Year of \n     Physics, as designated by the\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\n     General Assembly of the International Union of Pure and \n     Applied Physics;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the World Year of Physics as a special occasion for giving \n     impetus to--\n       (A) education and research in physics; and\n       (B) the public's understanding of physics;\n       (3) calls on the Secretary of Energy to lead and coordinate \n     Federal activities to commemorate the World Year of Physics;\n       (4) encourages the Secretary, all science-related \n     organizations, the private sector, and the media to highlight \n     and give enhanced recognition to--\n       (A) the role of physics in social, cultural, and economic \n     development; and\n       (B) the positive impact and contributions of physics to \n     society; and\n       (5) encourages the Secretary and all people involved in \n     physics education and research to take additional steps \n     (including strengthening existing and emerging fields of \n     physics research and promoting the understanding of physics) \n     to ensure that--\n       (A) support for physics continues; and\n       (B) physics studies at all levels continue to attract an \n     adequate number of students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7843-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3555.

Mr. President, we just concluded a vote and a very \ndisappointing chapter in our effort to reform the way part of our legal \nsystem works in this country.\n  We have debated for the last several days how we might change the \ncurrent system where people have been harmed by goods or services \nprovided for their use by some company and did not get what they should \nhave--they have been shortchanged or maybe even exposed to a dangerous \nproduct or harmed by it in some way--and how we might make sure they \nare made whole and that we have the opportunity to assemble that group \nof harmed people across States or across the country so they can have \ntheir day in court. We are looking for a way to make sure the companies \nthat harmed those people are held accountable and know they are going \nto face a serious financial consequence if they do something untoward \nor just wrong with respect to their products or services which they \nprovide.\n  Today we were not able to proceed to the bill and have the \nopportunity to offer amendments which are germane, pertinent to the \nbill, relevant to the bill, or those which maybe were not.\n  My colleague who is presiding has been here for a year and half or \nso. I know these are issues he has worked on a lot in those 18 months. \nThis class action reform is probably an issue on which he has spent the \nmost time.\n  As we leave here tonight with this business unfinished, I am deeply \ndisappointed. We come to the end of a chapter, not the end of the book. \nWe have to turn a page and figure out how to go forward.\n  Our system of justice is out of whack. It is out of balance. The \ntragedy of it all is we had a very good legislative product here to \ndebate and fix. The system worked the way it was supposed to. We had \nhearings, I think as many as 10, on this issue and how to fix it. The \ncommittees of jurisdiction held hearings in the House and in the \nSenate. The committees of jurisdiction had a chance to actually debate \nand vote on the bills and to amend them. They had the opportunity to \nreport those bills out. The House debated this on the floor. In the \nSenate, we had the opportunity. In the Senate, we fell one vote short \nof bringing the bill to the Senate floor last fall. We had the \nopportunity coming out of that disappointing vote to go back to make \nthe bill even better and to bring a truly bipartisan bill to the floor \nof the Senate which would be supported by a Republican majority and \nwith a good deal of Democratic support.\n  Given that 65 Members in the Senate were prepared to vote for it, to \ngo home tonight not having had a chance to actually vote for \namendments, relevant amendments and nonrelevant amendments, is very \ndisappointing. I am not going to get into assigning blame. There is \nprobably enough on both sides.\n  I said to the press in an earlier interview that this week in the \nSenate reminds me of maybe a new television reality show, a \ndysfunctional family. It is not pretty to watch or, frankly, to be a \npart of.\n  When I came here, I wanted to fix things and right wrongs. I know \nmost of us came here with that in mind. This is a wrong that needs to \nbe made right. We had a great opportunity in this bill to do that.\n  I leave here tonight bewildered, in a sense. One sure way to stymie a \nbill and stop progress on it this week was to bring the bill to the \nfloor of the Senate in a way that closed off the opportunity for the \nminority to offer some reasonable number of nongermane amendments.\n  I have said so many times to our friends on the other side of the \naisle, when you bring the bill to the Senate floor, think of it as a \nbottle of wine we are opening. We are popping the cork and letting it \nbreathe for a while. Maybe set aside a week and give us a week to \ndebate the bill itself, relevant amendments and a reasonable number of \nnongermane amendments.\n  If it becomes clear after several days or a week that our side is \nbeing dilatory, if it becomes clear our side is simply not interested \nin passing the bill, they are just playing games, those Democrats who \nsupport a bill will support an effort to close off debate and to force \na final vote on the bill.\n  For the life of me, after saying repeatedly since January that the \none way to kill the bill is to bring it to the Senate in a way that \nstymies debate and closes off amendments that might be nongermane, the \nvery first thing out of the box presented was a cloture motion and a \nmove to fill the amendment tree so our side is precluded from offering \namendments, except for those that are germane, I don't understand it.\n  In the words of a colleague on our side who is opposed to the bill, \nthe only way those who are opposed to the bill could have won was by \nbringing the bill to the Senate today, invoking cloture, and inflaming \nDemocratic opposition to the bill, united Democratic opposition to the \nbill.\n  There are at least a dozen or more on this side who very much want to \npass class action legislation this year. God knows I do, and I know \npeople on both sides have worked to get us to this point. For the life \nof me, I do not understand why we could not open that bottle of wine, \nlet it breathe for a while, debate the amendments, germane and \nnongermane. If it became clear we were wasting our time and people were \nplaying games, we could have cut it off, but do not do it right out of \nthe box.\n  I leave here bewildered and, frankly, more than a little bit \ndisappointed. I say to those folks around the country who are as \ndisappointed as I am, and others who support the bill, I am not one who \ngives up easily.\n  Some of my colleagues hear me talk about my four core values that we \nbuilt an administration on when I was Governor of Delaware and which I \nbrought with me and I try to use them here with my legislative \ninitiatives.\n  One, figure out the right thing to do and do it. I am convinced \nchanging this part of our legal system is the right thing to do.\n  The second core value is to commit to excellence in everything we do. \nBy golly, I know we can do better than the status quo with respect to \nthis aspect of our legal system.\n  My third core value is the Golden Rule: treat other people the way I \nwant to be treated. When consumers are\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nharmed, they ought to be compensated. When companies misbehave, they \nought to have to pay damages. It is that simple. The way our system \nruns today is wrong. It is wrong for consumers and, frankly, it is \nwrong for companies, in many cases. It is a wrong that needs to be \nrighted.\n  My fourth core value is don't give up. I am not one who ever gives \nup. I, for sure, am not going to give up.\n  While I go home disappointed, I will come back next week committed to \ndo whatever we can this year to pass this bill and get it signed into \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Garrett Lee Smith Memorial \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More children and young adults die from suicide each \n     year than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, \n     stroke, and chronic lung disease combined.\n       (2) Over 4,000 children and young adults tragically take \n     their lives every year, making suicide the third overall \n     cause of death between the ages of 10 and 24. According to \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suicide is the \n     third overall cause of death among college-age students.\n       (3) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention \n     and Control of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, children and young adults accounted for 15 \n     percent of all suicides completed in 2000.\n       (4) From 1952 to 1995, the rate of suicide in children and \n     young adults has tripled.\n       (5) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among young \n     adults ages 15 to 19 increased 11 percent.\n       (6) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among children \n     ages 10 to 14 increased 109 percent.\n       (7) According to the National Center of Health Statistics, \n     suicide rates among Native Americans range from 1.5 to 3 \n     times the national average for other groups, with young \n     people ages 15 to 34 making up 64 percent of all suicides.\n       (8) Congress has recognized that youth suicide is a public \n     health tragedy linked to underlying mental health problems \n     and that youth suicide early intervention and prevention \n     activities are national priorities.\n       (9) Youth suicide early intervention and prevention have \n     been listed as urgent public health priorities by the \n     President's New Freedom Commission in Mental Health (2002), \n     the Institute of Medicine's Reducing Suicide: A National \n     Imperative (2002), the National Strategy for Suicide \n     Prevention: Goals and Objectives for Action (2001), and the \n     Surgeon General's Call to Action To Prevent Suicide (1999).\n       (10) Many States have already developed comprehensive \n     Statewide youth suicide early intervention and prevention \n     strategies that seek to provide effective early intervention \n     and prevention services.\n       (11) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college \n     counseling centers revealed an increase in the number of \n     students they see with psychological problems. Furthermore, \n     the American College Health Association found that 61 percent \n     of college students reported feeling hopeless, 45 percent \n     said they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9 \n     percent felt suicidal.\n       (12) There is clear evidence of an increased incidence of \n     depression among college students. According to a survey \n     described in the Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1, \n     2002), depression among freshmen has nearly doubled (from 8.2 \n     percent to 16.3 percent). Without treatment, researchers \n     recently noted that ``depressed adolescents are at risk for \n     school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self \n     medication with drugs and alcohol, and suicide--now the third \n     leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds.''.\n       (13) Researchers who conducted the study ``Changes in \n     Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years'' (1989-\n     2001) at Kansas State University stated that ``students are \n     experiencing more stress, more anxiety, more depression than \n     they were a decade ago.'' (The Chronicle of Higher Education, \n     February 14, 2003).\n       (14) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on \n     Drug Abuse, 20 percent of full-time undergraduate college \n     students use illicit drugs.\n       (15) The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also \n     reported that 18.4 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 are \n     dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In \n     addition, the study found that ``serious mental illness is \n     highly correlated with substance dependence or abuse. Among \n     adults with serious mental illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were \n     dependent on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while the \n     rate among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3 \n     percent.''.\n       (16) A 2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center \n     Directors found that 81 percent were concerned about the \n     increasing number of students with more serious psychological \n     problems, 67 percent reported a need for more psychiatric \n     services, and 63 percent reported problems with growing \n     demand for services without an appropriate increase in \n     resources.\n       (17) The International Association of Counseling Services \n     accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per 1,000 to \n     1,500 students. According to the 2003 Gallagher's Survey of \n     Counseling Center Directors, the ratio of counselors to \n     students is as high as 1 counselor per 2,400 students at \n     institutions of higher education with more than 15,000 \n     students.\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will be in a period for \nmorning business throughout the day. There will be no rollcall votes \nduring tomorrow's session, but Senators are encouraged to come to the \nfloor to speak on the constitutional amendment regarding marriage, \nwhich we hope to consider next week.\n  A few moments ago we failed to invoke cloture on a very important \nbill, the class action bill, that we have spent the majority of this \nweek debating. As I said at the outset, I had hoped we would be able to \naddress this important bill, consider all relevant amendments, with no \ntime limit on those relevant amendments, so we could pass a bill that \nis very important to the American people, to the economy, and to the \nconcepts of equity and fairness. We were unsuccessful, in spite of our \nvery best attempt to consider all relevant amendments and take up a \nbill that 62 people in this body support.\n  The problem was that Members from both sides of the aisle insisted on \noffering or wanting to offer and debate very complicated but, most \nimportantly, unrelated amendments at this time. We set up a procedural \nprocess by which we could consider individual relevant amendments, but \na decision was made, and it played out in the cloture vote today, that \nwe would not proceed on this important bill at this juncture because \nsome people thought we would need to include a lot of nongermane \namendments. There were a lot of nonrelevant amendments that appeared.\n  I am very hopeful, because I am a strong supporter of this bill as \nwritten, that we can come to some agreement given the fact there are a \nmajority of people in this Senate who believe in this bill strongly, \nthat we can come to some agreement in terms of time to consider this \nbill with relevant amendments debated so that we can serve the\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\nAmerican people. That seems not to be now. Discussions hopefully will \ncontinue.\n\n  If we cannot do it in a reasonably short period of time and stay on \nrelevant amendments, we just simply are not going to be able to do it \nin this session. We have somewhere around 30 legislative days remaining \nand we have a range of issues, some that were brought up on the floor \ntoday, issues such as homeland security and issues concerning the \ninstitution of marriage.\n  We have the Australia trade bill that hopefully we can consider very \nquickly in the near future. We have 13 appropriations bills, spending \nbills, that we must consider. There are 12 we need to consider in some \nway in the next several weeks. Then there are a number of judges who we \nmust continue to move on. We have all of that in a period of about 30 \ndays.\n  It means that as majority leader I need to insist on reasonable, \ndisciplined, and regular order in the sense that when we go to a bill, \nwe debate that bill, those issues, consider amendments that are \nrelevant to that bill and not consider the broad range of issues that \nwe naturally have as Senators. We have to have an orderly process. The \norderly process led today, because of the insistence on these \nnongermane, nonrelevant amendments, to a point that we are not going to \nbe able to consider class action reform now.\n  So I think what we will see predominately tomorrow is debate on a \nvery important issue to the American people and to the values of the \nUnited States of America, and that is the issue of marriage. We will \nlikely see debate on that tomorrow, and that debate will continue on \nthe constitutional amendment Monday and Tuesday. I would think \nsomewhere during the middle of next week, probably Wednesday, we will \nhave a vote, the nature of which I will be talking to the Democratic \nleader over the course of tomorrow morning.\n  So we had a good debate this week. I am very disappointed in the fact \nthat the other side of the aisle--for the most part it was the other \nside of the aisle--insisted on having other amendments. I am \ndisappointed we were unable to fully address class action reform. \nHopefully, we can come back to it at some point in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/08/senate-section/article/S7868-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
