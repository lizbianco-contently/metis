Mr. President, I rise this morning to address a very \nspecific situation--a dire situation--that exists in the administration \nof justice for the people of Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan, \nthe States that make up the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I am joined this morning by other Senators from the Sixth Circuit \nand, most notably, we are joined on the Senate floor by many Members of \nthe House of Representatives, representing the four States of the Sixth \nCircuit.\n  This morning, we will be meeting with Michigan's attorney general, \nMike Cox, and several other Michigan leaders. They flew down today to \nmake their case in the Senate, encouraging us to do our job and move \nforward with the stalled Michigan nominations to the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. They will be presenting the Senate leadership with a \npetition of thousands of Michigan citizens asking the Senate to end \nthis delay on the so-called Michigan four.\n  This petition corresponds with a concurrent resolution which has been \nintroduced in the Michigan Legislature, also asking the Senate to end \nthe almost 2-year delay on the Michigan nominations.\n  The people and leaders of Michigan are not just speaking for \nthemselves; they speak for the people from all of the States concerned \nand affected by this inexcusable delay. That includes the people of \nTennessee, Kentucky, as well as Ohio.\n  That is why last week I took the rare, but not unprecedented, action \nof vowing for discharge of these four stalled nominations from the \nJudiciary Committee, because the delay of these nominations affects \nmore than the State of Michigan, and the entire Sixth Circuit \ncongressional delegation does have an interest on behalf of the people \nof the States and districts we represent.\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\n  In response to my discharge motion, my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, objected on behalf of the two Senators from Michigan on \nthe basis that the stalled Michigan nominations had not had a hearing.\n  I thought at the time it was an odd objection given that the Senators \nfrom Michigan are the ones who are obstructing such hearings from even \nbeing held. Nevertheless, I respectfully considered the objection and \nstudied the record of the Michigan nominations. This morning, I have \nsent a letter to Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nalong with Senator McConnell, who also signed and wrote this letter \nwith me, asking them to hold hearings on these nominations as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: As leaders of the majority and \n     senators who represent two of the four states that comprise \n     the Sixth Circuit, we are requesting that you hold hearings \n     on the nominations of Judges Henry W. Saad, Susan B. Neilson, \n     David W. McKeague, and Richard A. Griffin to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n       On July 7, 2003, the Majority Leader filed resolutions to \n     discharge the Judiciary Committee from consideration of these \n     nominees. These measures would allow the full Senate to \n     consider their nominations, three of which have been pending \n     for nearly two years (the fourth has been pending more than \n     one year).\n       We believe that the discharge resolutions are necessary \n     because the Michigan senators have returned negative blue \n     slips in an effort to prevent you from holding hearings on \n     these nominees. Our understanding, however, is that the \n     Michigan senators' objection to these nominees is based not \n     on any substantive concerns about their qualifications, \n     integrity, or temperament. Indeed, these four nominees are \n     held in the highest regard and enjoy solid reputations. Nor \n     is it based on a failure of the White House to properly \n     consult with the Michigan senators. In fact, it appears that \n     the Administration has been extremely solicitous of their \n     views, having engaged in extensive consultation, as that term \n     is properly understood.\n       Rather, based upon our review of the record of consultation \n     and correspondence, it appears that the Michigan Senators \n     object to consideration of these nominees for purposes \n     unrelated to their personal qualifications. Simply put, they \n     believe that two Clinton nominees from Michigan who were not \n     confirmed should be renominated by President Bush. Because \n     the White House has not taken the extraordinary step of \n     renominating these two Clinton nominees, the Michigan \n     Senators have decided to block all four of Michigan's circuit \n     court nominees (and both of its district court nominees as \n     well).\n       This is not a valid reason to hold the entire Sixth Circuit \n     hostage and inflict damage and delay on our constitutes. This \n     situation is unacceptable and simply cannot continue. The \n     Michigan senators should not be able to prevent the entire \n     Senate from acting on four outstanding nominees who would \n     fill judicial emergencies on an appellate court that is \n     operating with fully one fourth of its seats vacant.\n       There are many others, including numerous Michigan public \n     officials, who share this view. Nine members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation wrote you on February 26, 2003, \n     asking you to provide hearings for the Sixth Circuit nominees \n     from Michigan as soon as reasonably practical. On July 3, \n     2003, the Michigan Senate introduced a resolution calling for \n     the United States Senate and Michigan's U.S. Senators to act \n     to begin the confirmation hearings on Michigan's Sixth \n     Circuit nominees.\n       In response to the filing last week of the resolution to \n     discharge the Judiciary Committee from consideration of Judge \n     McKeague's nomination, Senator Durbin stated, ``. . . [T]his \n     nomination for the Sixth Circuit, and the others that will be \n     made by the majority leader, have not had the benefit of any \n     hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe that \n     [a] hearing should take place before a lifetime appointment \n     is given to any person to the Circuit Court.'' We \n     wholeheartedly agree that the Michigan nominees to the Sixth \n     Circuit deserve hearings, and accordingly request that you \n     schedule hearings for Judges Saad, Neilson, McKeague, and \n     Griffin as soon as possible.\n       On behalf of our constituents, we would appreciate your \n     immediate attention to this most urgent matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     William Frist,\n                                      U.S. Senate Majority Leader.\n     Mitch McConnell,\n                                        U.S. Senate Majority Whip.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record two letters from White House Counsel Alberto \nGonzales outlining the history of these nominations.\n  There being no objection, the material was sordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: Thank you for your letter of March 25, \n     advising the President of a letter you recently received from \n     Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow. As you note, Senators \n     Levin and Stabenow have returned blue slips objecting to all \n     five judicial nominees from Michigan pending before the \n     Committee. The Michigan Senators' letter further suggests \n     that the White House did not engage in adequate consultation \n     with them regarding these nominees. You have asked me to \n     describe the nature and extent of consultation between the \n     White House and the Michigan Senators regarding Richard \n     Griffin, David McKeague, Susan Bieke Neilson, Henry Saad and \n     Thomas Ludington. We are pleased to have the opportunity to \n     explain why we believe there has been appropriate \n     consultation.\n       Before turning to a chronological review of the record, we \n     believe a general comment is in order. Senators Levin and \n     Stabenow insisted from the outset that President Bush should \n     renominate to the Sixth Circuit two nominees of President \n     Clinton--Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis--who had not \n     received hearings or votes. The Senators argued that \n     ``elementary fairness . . . necessitates that they be \n     renominated, that hearings be held, and that they be voted up \n     or down by the Senate Judiciary Committee.'' See Levin-\n     Stabenow Letter to President Bush (April 3, 2001). In \n     response, we informed the Senators that we were in fact \n     considering Judge White and Ms. McCree Lewis, along with \n     numerous other candidates, for the Sixth Circuit, but that \n     the President would not commit to renominating them for those \n     seats. We explained that it is extraordinarily rare for a \n     President to nominate for the federal bench an individual \n     previously nominated by his predecessor, especially when the \n     predecessor is from another political party; that President \n     Bush was not responsible for the failure of Judge White and \n     Ms. McCree Lewis to attain confirmation; and that numerous \n     individuals appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the \n     federal courts of appeals saw their nominations lapse without \n     Senate action at the end of 1992, and did not have their \n     names resubmitted by President Clinton. As we summarized, \n     ``President Bush is entitled to make his own appointments for \n     these vacancies, and he may well prefer candidates other than \n     those previously chosen by President Clinton.'' See Gonzales \n     Letter to Senators Levin and Stabenow (April 10, 2001).\n       Following this initial exchange, in which the White House \n     made its position very clear, we moved forward with the \n     process of evaluating candidates for the judicial vacancies \n     in Michigan--including Judge White and Ms. McCree Lewis, who \n     we interviewed--and recommending nominees to the President. \n     Throughout this process, we repeatedly consulted with the \n     Michigan Senators, seeking their input on candidates time and \n     time again, almost literally until the eve of their \n     nominations. At no point did either Senator Levin or Senator \n     Stabenow ever articulate any specific objections to any of \n     the five nominees. Instead, the Michigan Senators \n     consistently responded to our consultations by (1) continuing \n     to ask that President Bush ``address'' the White and McCree \n     Lewis situations by renominating them, and (2) refusing to \n     provide feedback on our proposed candidates unless and \n     until we gave in to that request.\n       Specifically, our records show that, prior to the \n     nominations of the five individuals in question, the White \n     House engaged in the following noteworthy consultations with \n     the Michigan Senators.\n       April 3, 2001. The Michigan Senators write to the President \n     to announce their position: ``[E]lementary fairness to [Judge \n     White and Ms. McCree Lewis] . . . necessitates that they be \n     renominated, that hearings be held, and that they be voted up \n     or down by the Senate Judiciary committee''; and \n     ``[n]ominating others in their stead would not only be \n     inconsistent with your stated goal of bipartisanship, it \n     would compound the difficult situation we are now in relative \n     to filling the Michigan judicial vacancies on the Sixth \n     Circuit.''\n       April 10, 2001. I respond in writing as described above--\n     stating that we are considering Judge White and Ms. McCree \n     Lewis, but that President Bush is entitled to make his own \n     appointments for the Michigan vacancies.\n       May 17, 2001. At a meeting in my office, I provide the \n     Senators with the names of individuals being considered for \n     the Sixth Circuit (including Judges Saad, McKeague, and \n     Griffin) and for the vacancy on the U.S. District Court for \n     the Eastern District of Michigan (including Thomas \n     Ludington). I invite the Senators to provide their feedback \n     on those individuals. Senator Levin, however, states that he \n     will not provide any reactions until ``the larger issue'' is \n     settled.\n       May 17, 2001. Following up on my meeting with the Senators, \n     Associate Counsel Brad Berenson calls the Chiefs of Staff of \n     Senators Levin and Stabenow, again providing the\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\n     names of the candidates and soliciting the Senators' \n     reaction.\n       May 23, 2001. Mr. Berenson consults again with Senator \n     Levin's Chief of Staff regarding Judges Griffin, McKeague and \n     Sadd--making clear that no nominations are definite, and \n     again asking for reactions or feedback from the Senator. Mr. \n     Berenson also delivers the same message and invitation by \n     voice mail to Senator Stabenow's Chief of Staff.\n       June 7, 2001. Mr Berenson again calls Senator Stabenow's \n     Chief of Staff seeking the Senator's reaction to the \n     potential judicial nominees. The Chief of Staff reports that \n     Senator Stabenow does not know any of the individuals in \n     question and again urges that no action should be taken on \n     them until the White/McCree Lewis situation is addressed.\n       June 15, 2001. Mr. Berenson again calls Senator Stabenow's \n     chief of Staff--once again seeking the Senator's reaction to \n     the potential judicial nominees, and notifying the Senator \n     that Susan Bieke Neilson is under consideration for the Sixth \n     Circuit. Mr. Berenson also calls Senator Levin's Chief of \n     Staff to deliver the same message, but is told that the \n     Chief of Staff can not talk until the following Monday.\n       June 21, 2001. After leaving several telephone messages, \n     Mr. Berenson succeeds in contacting Senator Levin's Chief of \n     Staff. Again, he seeks the Senator's reaction to the \n     potential judicial nominees we had identified on May 17; he \n     also gives notice that Susan Bieke Neilson is under \n     consideration for the Sixth Circuit.\n       July 9, 2001. Mr. Berenson speaks by phone with Senator \n     Levin's Chief of Staff regarding Judge Neilson. Mr. Berenson \n     leaves a voice mail message about Judge Neilson for Senator \n     Stabenow's Chief of Staff.\n       August 8, 2001. Mr. Berenson places phone calls to both \n     Senators' Chiefs of Staff. Both are on vacation, so Mr. \n     Berenson leaves messages regarding Judge Ludington.\n       August 10, 2001. Senator Levin's Chief of Staff writes to \n     Mr. Berenson reiterating Senator Levin's original position.\n       August 14, 2001. Mr. Berenson responds to Senator Levin's \n     Chief of Staff, explaining that ``although we gave careful \n     consideration to the matter, including interviews of both \n     women, the President does not intend to nominate both these \n     women to the Sixth Circuit.'' Mr. Berenson's letter further \n     notes that ``[we] have . . . continued to keep the Senator \n     fully informed at every stage of our deliberations, providing \n     the names of individuals the President is considering for \n     appointment and repeatedly soliciting the Senator's views,'' \n     and advises that ``we would prefer to have the Senator's \n     input before the President makes nominations.''\n       August 17, 2001. I send a letter to then-Chairman Leahy \n     (with copies to the Michigan Senators as well as to you), \n     once again clearly setting out the White House's position. I \n     write that ``I have met with Senators Levin and Stabenow and \n     have listened carefully to their concerns regarding the \n     history of nominations from Michigan to the Sixth Circuit. \n     Although I understand their desire to have the President \n     renominate two of President Clinton's candidates for the \n     Court of Appeals . . . we believe it would be unfair to \n     expect the President to do so. The net result of our \n     discussions is an apparent standoff in which the two Michigan \n     Senators are attempting (inappropriately, in my view) to use \n     the threat of negative blue slips against President Bush's \n     Michigan circuit nominees to compel the President to \n     renominate Clinton nominees based upon grievances in which \n     president Bush played no part.'' I also reiterate that ``[w]e \n     remain committed to consulting closely with home-state \n     Senators to identify judicial candidates the President may \n     nominate with the support of the Senators; however, \n     meaningful, good faith consultation by the Senators cannot, \n     in my judgment, include a demand that President Bush select \n     as nominees those individuals previously selected by the \n     prior Administration.''\n       August 22, 2001. Senator Levin's Chief of Staff writes to \n     Mr. Berenson, proposing a bipartisan commission for judicial \n     nominations in Michigan.\n       August 23, 2001. Mr. Berenson responds, explaining that the \n     White House is not willing to consider a commission in \n     Michigan at this time. Mr. Berenson elaborates: ``Commissions \n     exist or are under consideration in only two or three states \n     in which history or other special circumstances clearly \n     justify such an unorthodox mechanism. None of these \n     circumstances exists in Michigan.''\n       October 9, 2001. I meet with the Michigan Senators at \n     Senator Levin's office to discuss potential solutions to the \n     Sixth Circuit impasse.\n       October 31, 2001. I speak with Senator Levin to explain why \n     the Michigan Senators' commission proposal is not acceptable, \n     and to inform the Senator of the president's intent to make \n     nominations to the Sixth Circuit seats shortly.\n       November 1, 2001. Senators Levin and Stabenow write to urge \n     me ``to reconsider [their] proposal to jointly establish a \n     bipartisan judicial nominating commission for the existing \n     Michigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.'' \n     Again, they do not provide any comments on Judges Griffin, \n     McKeague, Neilson, Saad or Ludington--and they indicate that \n     ``we could not, in good conscience, return blue slips on \n     Sixth Circuit nominees until the unfair treatment of the \n     nominations of [Judge White and Ms. McCree Lewis] is \n     addressed.''\n       November 2, 2001. I respond to the Michigan Senators, \n     respectfully declining to reconsider our decision not to \n     establish a judicial nominating commission, and reiterating \n     that we had proposed an appropriate solution to the Michigan \n     situation. My letter also gives fair warning that ``the \n     President will soon make nominations to all of the existing \n     federal judicial vacancies in Michigan,'' and invites the \n     Michigan Senators to reconsider their position.\n       Following these extensive consultations by the White House, \n     the President nominated Judges McKeague, Saad and Neilson on \n     November 8, 2001.\n       Still, our consultations as to the remaining vacancies \n     continued even after this point. I met with the Michigan \n     Senators on December 19, 2001, and again on February 7, 2002, \n     to discuss solutions to the Michigan. situation, and I called \n     them on June 20 and 24, 2002. Seeing no prospect of \n     resolution, the President nominated Judge Griffin to the \n     Sixth Circuit on June 26, 2002. Judge Ludington was nominated \n     later that year, on September 12.\n       In short, we engaged in repeated pre-nomination \n     consultations with the Michigan Senators regarding these five \n     nominees, making every reasonable effort to get the Senators' \n     feedback. We interviewed the candidates suggested by the \n     Senators--Judge White and Ms. McCree Lewis. And we proposed \n     our own reasonable solution to the matter. Notwithstanding \n     these extensive efforts by the White House, the Michigan \n     Senators steadfastly refused to provide feedback on the \n     nominees, instead insisting that the President should first \n     agree to nominate President Clinton's candidates and/or to \n     turn the process over to a commission. After several months, \n     with no sign of progress, and having received no specific \n     objections to any of the individuals in question, the \n     President proceeded with his nominations, to address the \n     acknowledged judicial emergencies on the Sixth Circuit. These \n     emergencies continue to this day, and affect not only the \n     constituents of Senators Levin and Stabenow, but also the \n     citizens of Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.\n       I believe that any reasonable observer would agree that the \n     record described above demonstrates that the White House \n     engaged in appropriate consultations with respect to the five \n     Michigan judicial nominees.\n       I trust that this letter provides the information you need \n     regarding our extensive consultation with the Michigan \n     Senators. However, I would be pleased to provide additional \n     details if necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Counsel to the President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, April 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Levin and Stabenow: I respectfully write with \n     regard to your March 19 joint letter to Chairman Hatch, which \n     accompanied your return of blue slips indicating your \n     opposition to a hearing and vote for five pending Michigan \n     nominees for federal judicial seats. Your letter explains \n     that you are objecting to these Michigan nominees--and will \n     continue to object to future Michigan nominees--in order to \n     protest the fact that two of President Clinton's judicial \n     nominees from Michigan did not receive hearings.\n       Although you have returned negative blue slips for all of \n     these nominations, you do not indicate any opposition based \n     upon qualifications to any of the five individuals in \n     question. Nor did you express any such specific opposition \n     during our pre-nomination consultations with your offices \n     regarding these individuals. (This consultation history is \n     described more fully in the attached response to any inquiry \n     from Chairman Hatch.) In our judgment, all five nominees are \n     indeed well qualified to serve on the federal bench, and \n     deserve prompt hearings and votes. I will briefly review \n     their qualifications below, before turning to your complaints \n     regarding President Clinton's nominees and, finally, \n     addressing your blue slips.\n\n\n                            i. the nominees\n\n       David McKeague, Susan Bieke Neilson, Henry Saad, Richard \n     Griffin and Thomas Ludington are well qualified for the \n     judicial seats for which they have been nominated.\n       Judge McKeague has served on the U.S. District Court for \n     the Western District of Michigan since 1991, when he was \n     unanimously confirmed by the then-Democrat-controlled Senate. \n     During his tenure as a district judge, he has on seven \n     occasions been designated to sit on a panel of the Sixth \n     Circuit. Chief Justice Rehnquist appointed Judge McKeague to \n     serve on the Judicial Conference's Committee on Defender \n     Services, where Judge McKeague chairs the funding \n     subcommittee. The Chief Justice also appointed Judge McKeague \n     to the District Judges Education Committee of the Federal \n     Judicial Center, which Judge McKeague chairs. The American \n     Bar Association (``ABA'') has given Judge McKeague, a ``Well \n     Qualified'' rating for the Sixth Circuit.\n       Judge Neilson has served on the 3rd Judicial Circuit Court \n     of Michigan since 1991. She has written numerous articles and \n     was co-editor and author of Michigan Civil Procedure, a two-\n     volume treatise on all areas of Michigan civil practice. This \n     treatise was selected by the Michigan Judicial Institute for \n     purchase on behalf of every trial judge in the\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\n     State of Michigan and received the ``Plain English Award'' \n     from the State Bar of Michigan. The ABA has unanimously rated \n     Judge Neilson ``Well-Qualified'' for the Sixth Circuit.\n       Judge Saad has served on the Michigan Court of Appeals \n     since 1994. During his 1996 retention election, he received \n     broad bipartisan support, including endorsements from the \n     Michigan Chamber of Commerce and the United Auto Workers. \n     Judge Saad is also active in the community. He has served as \n     President of the Wayne State University Law School Alumni \n     Association, Chairman of the Board of the Oakland Community \n     College Foundation, and as a Board Member on the National \n     Conference of Christians and Jews. In 1995, he received the \n     Arab-American and Chaldean Council Civic and Humanitarian \n     Award for Outstanding Dedication to Serving the Community \n     with Compassion and Understanding. The ABA has given Judge \n     Saad a ``Qualified'' rating. It also bears noting that Judge \n     Saad was nominated to the Eastern District of Michigan by \n     President George H.W. Bush a decade ago, but did not receive \n     a hearing.\n       Judge Griffin has served on the Michigan Court of Appeals \n     since 1989. He has served the bench and bar in a number of \n     volunteer capacities. He is a former member of the federal \n     judicial selection committee for the Western District of \n     Michigan, and currently serves as Chairman of the Quality \n     Review Committee for the Michigan Court of Appeals. The ABA \n     has rated Judge Griffin ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the \n     Sixth Circuit.\n       In sum, all four of the President's Sixth Circuit nominees \n     from Michigan have extensive experience on the state or \n     federal benches; all are active in their communities and in \n     the bar; all have extensive support in Michigan; and all have \n     received Well Qualified or Qualified ratings from the ABA. We \n     respectfully submit that by any traditional standard, Judges \n     McKeague, Neilson, Saad and Griffin are superbly qualified \n     candidates for the vacant seats on the Sixth Circuit--seats \n     that have been designated ``judicial emergencies'' by the \n     Judicial Conference.\n       Thomas Ludington is likewise fully qualified for the \n     district court. He has considerable experience on the state \n     bench--having served as Chief Judge of the 42nd Circuit Court \n     in Michigan since 1995--and enjoys wide support within the \n     State. And he too has received a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \n     rating from the ABA.\n\n\n                    II. the basis of your objections\n\n       In explaining your negative blue slips, you note that two \n     of President Clinton's Michigan nominees to the Sixth \n     Circuit, Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis, did \n     not receive hearings or votes.\n       We understand your position. President Bush has explained \n     that too many nominees of both President Bill Clinton and \n     President George H.W. Bush did not receive timely hearings \n     and votes. For example, two of President George H.W. Bush's \n     Sixth Circuit nominees--John Smietanka and Justin Wilson--and \n     his nominee to the Eastern District of Michigan, Judge Saad, \n     did not receive hearings or votes in the then-Democrat-\n     controlled Senate a decade ago.\n       President Bush has called on both parties to move on from \n     the cycle of blame and retribution that has plagued the \n     Senate for more than a decade. Since the 2000 campaign, the \n     President has emphasized that every judicial nominee should \n     receive a committee hearing and up or down floor vote within \n     a reasonable time, no matter who is President or which \n     party controls the Senate. On October 30, 2002, after \n     nearly two additional years of Senate delays, the \n     President advanced a plan involving all three Branches \n     that would require, among other steps, the Senate to vote \n     on nominees within 180 days of nomination. The plan would \n     ensure a generous period of time for all Senators to \n     gather information and have their voices heard and votes \n     counted. Whether the nominee is John Smietanka or Helene \n     White or Susan Bieke Neilson, whether the President is \n     President Clinton or President Bush, whether the Senate is \n     Republican- or Democrat-controlled, the President believes \n     that the procedures for fair and timely Senate \n     consideration and votes on judicial nominations should be \n     the same.\n\n\n                iii. the significance of the blue slips\n\n       Against this backdrop, let me turn to your blue slips.\n       It has been my understanding that the blue slip is not a \n     veto, but rather a device to ensure adequate pre-nomination \n     consultation with home-state Senators, such as has occurred \n     in the cases of these five nominees. We understand this to \n     have been the consistent Senate policy for at least the last \n     25 years--during the Chairmanships of Senators Kennedy, \n     Thurmond, Biden and Hatch. And in recent weeks, several other \n     Democratic Senators (including former Chairman Leahy) have \n     argued that Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno, nominees of \n     President Clinton to the Fifth Circuit, should have received \n     hearings and votes notwithstanding what the Committee deemed \n     to be inadequate consultation with home-state Senators--\n     thereby implicitly embracing the view that home-State \n     Senators should not be allowed to veto a nominee.\n       We agree strongly with the bipartisan policy maintained by \n     Senators Kennedy, Thurmond, Biden, and Hatch as Chairs of the \n     Judiciary Committee. We respectfully agree that the tradition \n     of consultation does not and should not entail a veto for \n     home-state Senators, particularly a veto wielded for \n     ideological or political purposes. Rather, the intention of \n     the Constitution and the tradition of the Senate require, in \n     our judgment, that the full Senate hold on up or down vote on \n     each judicial nominee. If the objections of home-state \n     Senators to a nominee are persuasive, those objections either \n     will deter the President from submitting the nomination in \n     the first instance or, alternatively, will convince a \n     majority of the Senate that the nomination should be \n     rejected. As Senator Kennedy stated in 1981, however, the \n     Senate has not allowed and should not allow ``individual \n     Senators [to] ban, prohibit, or bar'' consideration of a \n     nominee.\n       Once again I respectfully suggest that all Senators should \n     have their voices heard and their votes counted on the \n     nominations of Judges McKeague, Neilson, Saad, Griffin, and \n     Ludington--five individuals well qualified to serve on the \n     federal bench.\n       I remain hopeful that we can work together to fill these \n     judicial emergencies and I remain ready to meet to explore \n     options.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. After looking at the record, I have reached the conclusion \nthat the objection to these nominees having hearings is based not on \nany substantive concerns about their qualifications, or their \ntemperament, or about their integrity. Indeed, these four nominees are \nheld in the highest regard and enjoy solid reputations. Nor is it based \non a failure of the White House to properly consult with the Michigan \nSenators. In fact, it appears that the administration has been \nextremely solicitous of their views, having engaged in extensive and \ngood-faith consultation, as that term is properly understood.\n  Rather, based upon review of the record of consultation and \ncorrespondence, it appears that the Michigan Senators object to the \nconsideration of these nominees for purposes totally unrelated to their \npersonal qualifications. Simply put, they believe that two Clinton \nnominees from Michigan who were not confirmed should be renominated by \nPresident Bush. Because the White House has not taken this \nextraordinary step of renominating two of former President Clinton's \nnominees, the Michigan Senators have decided to block, to obstruct, all \nfour of Michigan's circuit court nominees. I might add, they are \nblocking the district court nominees as well.\n  I believe the reason it is important for us to shed light on this \nissue is--and I am sure the American people and my colleagues will \nagree--that this is not a valid reason to hold the people of the entire \nSixth Circuit Court hostage and inflict damage and delay on our \nconstituents.\n  The situation is simply unacceptable and cannot continue. The \nMichigan Senators, I believe, should not be able to prevent the entire \nSenate from acting on four outstanding nominees who would fill what we \nall know are officially classified as judicial emergencies on the \nappellate court that is operating with fully one-fourth of its seats \nvacant right now. These are judicial emergencies.\n  I should note that one of these nominees, Judge Henry Saad, was first \nnominated by the first President Bush and was never given a hearing. He \nhas been waiting, in effect, for over a decade. It bears noting that \nwhen he is confirmed by this Senate, he will be the first Arab American \nto serve on the Federal courts.\n  The Constitution of the United States requires that the Senate \nresponsibly and expeditiously vote on the President's nominees--``yea'' \nor ``nay''--and allow the courts to get on with their work. Instead, \nwhat is happening is that the President's nominees to the Sixth Circuit \nare being held up, and the Senate is blocked from performing its \nconstitutional duty.\n  Among the 12 U.S. Courts of Appeals, the Sixth Circuit is now dead \nlast in the timeliness of its disposition of cases.\n  District court judges within the Sixth Circuit warn us that by having \nto perform regular duty as a substitute judge on the court of appeals, \ntheir own trial dockets have slowed considerably.\n  Only a substantial commitment on the part of the senior judges of the \nSixth Circuit, district judges from the within the Sixth Circuit, and \nvisiting appellate judges from other circuits has kept the caseload \neven barely manageable. The Sixth Circuit is the third busiest court of \nappeals, and Chief\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\nJudge Boyce Martin has asked Congress to authorize a 17th judge for the \ncourt. The court would be overworked even if it had its full complement \nof 16 judges.\n  According to District Judge Robert Bell, W.D. Michigan, ``We're \nhaving to backfill with judges from other circuits, who are basically \nsubstitutes. You don't get the same sense of purpose and continuity you \nget with full-fledged court of appeals judges.'' Furthermore, ``we \ndon't have the time or the resources that the circuit court has. You \ncan't help to conclude that if we had 16 full-time judges with the full \ncomplement of staff, that each case might get more consideration . . \n.''\n  Those are very troubling words: ``Each case might get more \nconsideration.'' It is unconscionable that we would deliberately allow \nour courts to get clogged up, backlogged, and undermined because some \nin Washington wish to politicize the process. Our courts are supposed \nto be fair and impartial. They are supposed to serve both victims and \ndefendants. We are undermining the rights of our fellow citizens if we \ndo not resolve this issue.\n  It is not just judges who are seeing what is happening. United States \nattorneys in Michigan tell us that the delays caused by the vacancies \nare complicating their ability to prosecute wrongdoers, defendants are \nable to commit more crime while awaiting trial, there is less \nconsistency in the court's jurisprudence, and the United States is \neffectively being deprived of en banc review in some cases.\n  A letter signed by 31 Assistant United States Attorneys in the \nEastern District of Michigan states:\n\n       [i]n years past, it was the normal practice of the Sixth \n     Circuit that a case would be heard by the Court approximately \n     three months after all briefs were filed, and in most cases \n     an opinion would issue in about three additional months. At \n     present, due to the large number of vacancies on the Court . \n     . . it has been taking on average between twelve and eighteen \n     months longer for most appeals to be completed . . .\n\n  Moreover, they go on:\n\n       [D]elays in criminal cases hurt the government . . . [T]he \n     longer a case goes on, the more chance there is that \n     witnesses will disappear, forget, or die, documents will be \n     lost, and investigators will retire or be transferred . . . \n     In some cases, convicted criminal defendants are granted bond \n     pending appeal. The elongated appellate process therefore \n     allows defendants to remain on the street for a longer period \n     of time, possibly committing new offenses. In addition, the \n     longer delay makes retrials more difficult if the appeal \n     results in the reversal of a conviction.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       [T]he Sixth Circuit has resorted to having more district \n     judges sit by designation as panel members. This practice has \n     contributed to a slowdown of the hearing of cases in the \n     district courts, because the district judges are taken out of \n     those courtrooms. The widespread use of district judges also \n     provides for less consistency in the appellate process than \n     would obtain if full-time Circuit Judges heard most of the \n     appeals.\n\n  And they conclude:\n\n       In some cases, the small number of judges on the Court has \n     served to effectively deprive the United States of en banc \n     review . . . Achieving a unanimous vote of all of those \n     judges of the Court who were not part of the original panel \n     is, as a matter of practice, impossible, and not worth \n     seeking. However, if the Court was at full strength, an en \n     banc review could have been granted with the votes of about \n     two thirds of the active judges who were not part of the \n     original panel.\n\n  I quote their comments at length because I want to lay out in \nunambiguous terms what is happening to our justice system.\n  Justice delayed is justice denied--justice denied to everyone, \nincluding victims, defendants, and the entire community.\n  President Bush has nominated four well-qualified individuals from \nMichigan to fill these vacancies. The objections of the Michigan \nSenators are, in my view, unreasonable. The basis of their complaint is \nthat two nominees were left without hearings at the end of President \nClinton's term in 2001.\n  They ignore the fact that two nominees were also left without \nhearings at the end of President Bush's term in 1993, which means that \nPresident Clinton got to appoint the same number of judges to the Sixth \nCircuit as the number of vacancies that came open during his \nPresidency.\n  Both parties have left nominations ending at the end of Presidents' \nterms. But the effort by my Michigan colleagues to block nominations at \nthe outset of a President's term is unheard of.\n  Five of the Sixth Circuit's active judges--nearly half--were \nappointed by President Clinton.\n  Let me read from the Grand Rapids Press. It makes the point well, \nsaying:\n\n       The Constitution does not give [Sens. Levin and Stabenow] \n     co-presidential authority and certainly does not support the \n     use of the Court of Appeals to nurse a political grudge . . . \n     [Sens. Levin and Stabenow] have proposed that the president \n     let a bipartisan commission make Sixth circuit nominations or \n     that Mr. Bush renominate the two lapsed Clinton nominations. \n     Mr. Bush has shown no interest in either retreat from his \n     constitutional prerogatives. Nor should he. Movement in this \n     matter should come from Sens. Levin and Stabenow--and, \n     clearly, it should be backward.\n\n  Our courts cannot work if we do not have judges to run them. And our \ncommunities suffer when our courts do not work--victims, who never see \njustice, defendants who hang in limbo, and communities that go \nunprotected.\n  President Bush's judicial nominees deserve a simple up-or-down vote. \nThat is all that is being asked. This is one of our most important \nconstitutional duties. We cannot use the system to nurse grudges. The \nconsequences are too great. The public expects us to do our duty. I \ncall upon my fellow Senators to exercise their constitutional \nresponsibilities and free the Michigan four.\n  Mr. President, I yield the Republican time to the majority whip, the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for outlining what is \ntruly a crisis in the Sixth Judicial Circuit, the federal circuit which \nincludes Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan.\n  As this chart illustrates, of the 16 judgeships on the Sixth Circuit, \n4 seats are vacant. They are all Michigan seats. They are being held up \nby the Michigan Senators, strangely enough, as the majority leader has \noutlined, based upon some grievance that occurred in the past. But the \nproblem is not the past; it is the present. We have a judicial vacancy \ncrisis in the Sixth Circuit that affects not only the State of Michigan \nbut litigants in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio.\n  If we look at the second chart, we will see what the effect is on \nlitigants. Back in 1996, the Sixth Circuit had to handle about 364 \ncases per active judge. For 2002, it is up to 643 cases per active \njudge, an increase of 77 percent.\n  The Sixth Circuit is essentially swamped with litigation, and justice \nis being denied by being delayed. It is the slowest circuit in the \ncountry. Sixth Circuit litigants have to wait on justice 50 percent \nlonger than any other litigants in any other part of America just \nbecause they happen to be a litigant in the Sixth Judicial Circuit \nbecause of the action of the Michigan Senators in holding up all four \nof these well-qualified nominations to the Sixth Circuit. If you are so \nunfortunate as to be a litigant in the Sixth Circuit, you have to wait \n50 percent longer than the national average to have your case dealt \nwith.\n  Senatorial prerogatives are important, but my recollection is \nSenators do not get to pick circuit judges in the first place. I guess \nwe can have an argument about the blue slip policy as it relates to \ndistrict judges, but we do not get to pick circuit judges; they are a \nPresidential prerogative.\n  To simply withhold judges at the circuit level to secure nominations \nthat the election does not give you an opportunity to achieve--in other \nwords, the Republicans won the election in 2000--and, by doing that, \ndramatically disadvantage litigants not only in your own State but in \nthree other States, seems to this Senator unfair.\n  I guess the issue is what can be done about it. As the majority \nleader indicated and as I believe the senior Senator from Illinois \nindicated last week--the Senator from Illinois noted that there had not \nbeen any hearings on these nominees--my suggestion and the majority \nleader's suggestion to the chairman of the Judiciary committee, Senator \nHatch, is to have hearings on these nominees. We have sent him a letter \nrequesting that, because of the judicial emergencies in the Sixth \nCircuit, he go forward with hearings on these nominees.\n  I hope Chairman Hatch will do that and the committee will forthwith \nact\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\non these judges, send them to the floor, and let the Senate work its \nwill because we have a crisis. My people in Kentucky did not have \nanything to do with this issue, and they ought not be penalized because \nof actions in some other State in the Sixth Judicial Circuit. I hope \nSenator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will hold these \nhearings in the very near future.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do yield for a question.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Kentucky to share \nhis concern as to the effect this particular delay of the Sixth Circuit \nnominees has on the people we serve every day and how their real lives \nare being affected. I think that is what drives us in moving forward, \nrecognizing this delay is simply unacceptable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if you are a litigant from Tennessee or \nKentucky and are having to wait 50 percent longer than a litigant in \nsome other State because of the actions by the Senators from Michigan, \nit seems to me that is simply unfair. Because of some grievance that \noccurred in the past, some score being settled by holding hostage these \nlitigants from Tennessee and Kentucky who had nothing to do with this \nsituation, I think is grossly unfair.\n  One thing the majority leader has asked Senator Hatch to do that will \nhelp is have hearings, as has been suggested by the senior Senator from \nIllinois, and move forward on these nominations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. That does bring into \nfocus what we are here to do. For me, that brings into focus why, for \nus to be good stewards of the judiciary, we need to accelerate this \nprocess and move it forward. Indeed, that is what the Constitution \ncalls upon us to do.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader controls 2 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nwhip for bringing this to the attention of the Senate.\n  I am new to the Senate. This situation is very disappointing to me as \na Senator from the Sixth Circuit. I will give one example of how this \naffects people in real time and real lives in Tennessee, Kentucky, \nOhio, and Michigan. Thirty-one assistant U.S. attorneys in the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan have written a letter to Senator Levin to complain \nthat the vacancies have slowed justice, have complicated prosecutions, \nhave enabled criminals to commit more crimes while awaiting trial, have \nled to less consistency in decisions, and have deprived the United \nStates of en banc review in some cases.\n  A group of law professors, in a letter to the majority leader, stated \nthat because of the unfilled judicial vacancies, the Sixth Circuit \ntakes as long as 15 months to reach a final disposition, 5 months more \nthan the national average.\n  This is unfair to the people in our State. I hope the Judiciary \nCommittee will move swiftly to hearings and the Senate will move \nswiftly to consider, vote on, and hopefully confirm the Michigan four.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and dear friend \nfrom Maryland. She has been waiting to speak for a long time. I \nappreciate her graciousness in allowing me to speak for a moment.\n  This is a very unfortunate time in the State of Michigan. We have \ntraditionally had bipartisan cooperation on issues that affect our \nwonderful State and the people we all represent. I cannot think of a \ntime when we have had in previous Congresses Republican colleagues on \nthe House side doing press conferences and attacking the Senators. It \nis very unfortunate.\n  Let me speak first to the numbers our distinguished majority leader \njust used and other Members on the other side of the aisle. It is my \nunderstanding those numbers about backlogs were prior to the filling of \nfour vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. So we are looking at a situation \nwhere there have been four vacancies already filled. Retired judges are \nused to hear cases.\n  We do not hear about the kind of backlog and the concern about the \nlack of justice going on in the Sixth Circuit. I believe that is \nabsolutely inaccurate. What we do hear is a great concern about playing \npolitics.\n  There was an effort to hold up all the nominees to the Sixth Circuit \nunder President Clinton. Now, coming into this Senate, Senator Levin \nand I have attempted to work with the administration to have a \nbipartisan solution to stop this. That is what we have been about, not \ngoing on with partisanship, which is what is happening now. Rather than \nworking with us for a bipartisan solution, we see partisan press \nconferences. We see our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and \nunfortunately our colleagues in the House on the Republican side, \nholding press conference after press conference attacking us, rather \nthan working things out.\n  How do we work it out? Well, many States have bipartisan commissions \nto recommend nominees to the President, working with the Senators. We \nhave put forward the Wisconsin motto which has the Senators from one \nparty placing four people on a commission. The senior Republican in \nthis case, Congressman Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin, who is a part of \nthis process, nominates four. They have two people from the Wisconsin \nbar, and the heads of the law schools. It works. It has been embraced \nby the White House.\n  It is disconcerting to me to see what has been agreed to and worked \nwell in Wisconsin will not be allowed in Michigan. We know that in \nWashington State there is a commission. We know there are agreements in \nother States to work together with the Senators. But somehow in \nMichigan, instead of doing that, so our families, our workers, and our \nbusinesses can be represented and know that we will provide mainstream \njudges in a bipartisan way, we see unfortunate comments on the floor, \nwe see misinformation, we see political press conferences over and over \nagain.\n  This is how we got to this situation. It was partisanship in the last \nSenate under President Clinton, holding up the nominees. We are trying \nto change that and say let's stop this.\n  Instead of press conferences, I welcome colleagues in the Senate, as \nwell as our House Members, to join us, to sit down and develop a motto \nsuch as Wisconsin and other States, where it works in a bipartisan way, \nto be able to put forward judges to fill these vacancies.\n  It is important who is on the bench. This is not the President's \nprerogative alone, nor any individual Senator. It means we need to work \ntogether because our families are affected, our business community, \nissues of privacy, health care, business law, the environment. Many \nissues are affected, and so it matters who is on the court from \nMichigan. We simply ask that we be treated with fairness as other \nSenators in other States have been, and we will continue to work to \nthat end.\n  I yield back for my colleague from Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I claim such time for myself.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9439-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9439-S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9439]]\n                NEED OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN IRAQ\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to address the situation in \nIraq. Right now, America is bearing the primary burden in Iraq. Almost \nevery day another soldier dies--not in combat but in postwar \noccupation. Our American soldiers must not bear this burden alone. \nQuite frankly, the American taxpayer must not bear responsibility for \nthe cost of nation building alone.\n  I urge our President, President Bush, to build an international \neffort to participate in sharing the burden and the responsibility of \nbringing order out of chaos in Iraq.\n  The occupation of Iraq is something we all have to face up to. Last \nyear, when the Senate debated the Iraq war resolution, I said this: We \ndo not know whether our troops will be welcomed with flags or with land \nmines.\n  Now we know. Our troops are facing great and grave danger. They are \nfacing snipers, ambush. One soldier was shot in the back as he waited \nto buy a soda. Another was standing in line to buy DVDs, and he was \nshot in the back. This is not combat with an opposing army. These are \nmurders, these are assassinations, and we need to stand up for our \ntroops and give them the help and the backing they need.\n  We need to stand up for these troops who are so dedicated, so duty \ndriven, so wanting to do the job that America sends them to do, but \nthey should not bear this all by themselves, with a few treasured \nallies.\n  Since the President declared the end of hostilities, 82 soldiers have \ndied. Our troops in Iraq are not peacekeepers or nation builders. There \nis no peace to keep and there is no nation to build. We have to start \nfrom scratch. America's troops now are an occupying force, and they \ncontinue to face very fierce resistance in parts of Iraq. In some \nareas, it is guerilla war with house to house fighting with members of \nthe Saddam Fedayeen or other groups still loyal to Saddam Hussein \ntrying to kill them. They are trying to ambush our military convoys.\n  Our forces are seeking to establish order and security. Yet they are \nvery highly visible, whether they are guarding facilities such as power \nstations or delivering supplies or training the Iraqi police force. \nThis puts them at grave risk. American soldiers must not face this \ndanger all alone.\n  About 148,000 American soldiers are still serving in Iraq, and we \nsalute them. There are over 13,000 troops from the United Kingdom, \nAustralia, Poland, and other countries, and we thank them for being \nthere. Many Marylanders are serving there, including members of our \nNational Guard and Reserves, and I stand up for them to make sure they \nget the backup they need and they can return home from their \ndeployment.\n  America should not stand with just a coalition of the few. We need to \nhave the international force of the many. This is why we need to go to \nthe U.N. and ask for help. We need to go to NATO and get them involved, \nand we need to go to the world to help pay for the cost of doing this.\n  Occupying Iraq is not easy and it is not cheap. Rumsfeld has now \ndoubled his estimates of the cost of occupying Iraq, from $2 billion a \nmonth to $4 billion a month. The Pentagon estimates that the total cost \nwill be over $100 billion. The American taxpayers are bearing that \nresponsibility, and they will bear that responsibility for some time to \ncome. When we talk about responsibility, it should be the \nresponsibility of the world to help rebuild the power stations while we \nare trying to work to create a new power structure.\n  Last week I supported a burden sharing amendment to the State \nDepartment authorization bill. Ninety-seven Senators agreed to that. \nNot one disputed it. What did it recommend? That the President ask NATO \nto raise a military force for deployment in postwar Iraq, and to urge \nNATO allies and other nations to provide troops and police to the \ncoalition efforts in Iraq, and that the President should call on the \nUnited Nations to urge its member states to provide military forces and \ncivilian police to promote stability and security in Iraq.\n  It also said go to the U.N. to ask for resources to rebuild and \nadminister Iraq. Iraqi oil alone will not pay for this. We have to get \nthese oil wells ready.\n  When the President asked for authorization to go to war, I said that \nif it is important enough to go to war, if it is important enough to \nthe world to go to war, then the world should come with us.\n\n       We must bring the entire international community with us to \n     share responsibilities and the burden of stopping these \n     threats.\n\n  I saw the situation we are in coming. That is what I worried about, \nthat American troops would be there by themselves, with a few steadfast \nallies, and the American taxpayer would be the one facing this nation \nbuilding. That was my position then and it is still my position.\n  During the debate in the Senate, I urged the Senate to support the \nLevin amendment, which called for international legitimacy, for \ninternational cooperation, international support, including military \nand international resources, meaning real money. I spoke on the Senate \nfloor about the threat of Saddam Hussein, and I spoke about the threats \nto our troops. I said then that I firmly believed Saddam Hussein was \nduplicitous, deceptive, and dangerous and that they had grim and \ngoulish means to carry out their weapons plans. I did believe that they \ncould develop, produce, and stockpile chemical and biological weapons, \nand I did believe that they had the means for delivering them in the \nregion. Whether the information I was given in all my briefings was \nvalid or not is something to probe in another forum. We are committed \nto doing that.\n\n  Right now, we need to acknowledge Saddam threatened not only the \nUnited States, he threatened the region and he threatened the world. \nNow the region and the world have to get into this. It is not too late. \nPresident Bush should mount a new diplomatic effort, recruiting allies \nto share these burdens of occupying Iraq and to root out the remaining \nresistance. We have to go to the U.N. and NATO to get formal \nauthorization, get international help for this rebuilding. This is an \nopportunity to reach out, even to countries that opposed the war, such \nas France and Germany, and get them involved.\n  I hope we can answer this call before the Iraqi resistance fight \ngrows, before more American soldiers die, without sending more troops \ninto Iraq by getting our allies to join. If our allies join, they can \nhelp provide the troops, they can help provide the police, and they can \nhelp provide the money.\n  To our troops--regular, reserve, and their families--I say thanks. \nThanks for helping get rid of Saddam Hussein and his regime. They were \ninternational thugs. They have made tremendous sacrifices. Each and \nevery member of our military is part of this American family. We thank \nthem for their bravery, their fortitude, and their gallantry. They \nanswered the call to duty. I salute every single member of our Armed \nForces.\n  I express my condolences to all Marylanders who lost their lives and \npaid the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Rippitoe, CPL Mark Evnin, SGT \nKendall Waters Bey, PFC Juan Guadalupe, SP George Mitchell, and CPL \nJason Mileo. I honor these men and their families, all the Marylanders \nwounded, and every American soldier right now either in Baghdad or in a \nhospital recovering.\n  Our troops know we count on them. They have to count on us to get \nthem the help they need, not only with the right resources for our \nmilitary but to get more military from other nations to support them. \nThe international community was divided over whether to go to war in \nIraq. Now the world should unite in support of winning the peace our \nAmerican men and women have fought so hard to win and for which they \nhave given so many sacrifices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join with Senator Mikulski in her \ncomments expressing concern about the United States role in Iraq, the \nsafety of our troops in Iraq, and how proud we are of our troops. I \nurge the administration to do what is necessary to restore morale. The \nbest way is to do the right thing by our troops, make sure they are \nstrongly supported and, even more fundamentally, rethink our position \nin Iraq: What is our policy? What are we attempting to accomplish? Then \nencourage many more of our allies, both in the Arab world and other \nparts of the world, to join the United States.\n\n[[Page S9440]]\n\n  This is a problem that will only be resolved with more thoughtfulness \nand more direct candor about the nature of the problem and working \nclosely with our allies, both Arabs and others.\n  We should also focus a little bit more on terrorism generally rather \nthan get diverted, as we seem to be, in specific countries. It is \nextremely complex, but there is building concern in the United States \nabout United States policy in Iraq. I join those who believe we should \nfocus more on terrorism around the world. This requires the cooperation \nof a lot more countries around the world to be successful. I hope we \ncan accomplish that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9440-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the hour \nof 10 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof H.R. 2330, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2330) to sanction the ruling Burmese military \n     junta, to strengthen Burma's democratic forces and support \n     and recognize the National League of Democracy as the \n     legitimate representative of the Burmese people, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). There is 1 hour \nof debate equally divided in the usual form with no amendments to the \nbill.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Burma \nsanctions bill. This bill is the result of a collaborative effort \nbetween Senators McConnell, Grassley and myself.\n  When first introduced, the bill would have imposed sanctions without \nan opportunity for congressional review. I was concerned that Congress \nwould simply pass a bill, and then forget about Burma.\n  I think that is the wrong approach when it comes to sanctions.\n  Senator Grassley and I worked hard to ensure that Congress would have \nthe opportunity to revisit this issue every year. The House went even \nfurther, by requiring an annual vote, plus a 3-year sunset.\n  Now, make no mistake about it, the actions by the dictatorship in \nBurma are unacceptable. The arrests and treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi \nare deplorable and cannot be tolerated.\n  Yet as is so often the case when we debate the merits of \ninternational sanctions, the question is not whether to punish Burma's \nruling regime; the question is how to do so effectively.\n  We have learned through our own experiences that unilateral sanctions \nsimply don't work. They rarely destabilize the oppressive regime that \nis the target of the sanctions. Instead, they only hurt the people--\nboth in the target country and even here in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, we have also seen how, once a sanctions policy is in \nplace, it is very difficult--no matter how ineffective the policy is, \nto terminate it and find a better solution.\n  So, how do we deal with this dilemma?\n  The answer is found in a simple appeal to common sense.\n  First, we must actively seek the cooperation of our allies. \nMultilateral action is essential if the policy is to be effective. \nSecond, we must give ourselves a chance to review and revise the policy \nif it isn't working.\n  That is what this bill does with Burma. It imposes sanctions. It also \nencourages the president to work with our allies in the region to build \na collective response. And I understand our allies are considering \nsanctions.\n  This bill also requires Congress to revisit the issue every year. If \nthe policy is working, then we can renew it. But if it isn't working, \nthen we can terminate it and try a new policy. This legislation will \nkeep the dictatorship's feet to the fire. It will create regular \nincentives for them to change.\n  It is just this sort of common-sense approach that is needed with \nother U.S. sanctions, particularly against Cuba.\n  By any honest assessment, our embargo against Cuba--now in its fifth \ndecade--is a total failure. The U.S. is alone in pursuing this failed \npolicy, yet politics prevents us from reassessing it.\n  Thus, the Cuban embargo has become institutionalized. And the fight \nto end the embargo, even though ending it makes so much sense, has \nbecome a difficult, uphill battle.\n  We do not want that to happen to the Burma sanctions. We want the \npeople of Burma to enjoy true democracy and freedom. And we want to \npursue the policy that will help them achieve this. So we will try \nsanctions. But if they don't work, and if we are not joined by our \nallies in this cause, then Congress will revisit this issue in a year.\n  In the coming weeks, many Members will be pressing for action to \nreform Cuba sanctions. I hope that today's debate on Burma highlights \nthe inconsistency of our sanctions policy, and that we can apply a \ncommon-sense approach as we move forward on other sanctions issues.\n  I now would like to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Iraq Intelligence\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMontana who as always is representing issues that make an enormous \ndifference to the quality of our debates here on the Senate floor but, \nmore important, to how our world works, both here at home and abroad. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join in a growing expression of \nconcern by my colleagues and the American people about the possible \nmisrepresentation of intelligence information by the President and the \nadministration in building its case for the war in Iraq. Without a \nthorough explanation of why many of the administration's statements are \nin conflict, and have included claims unsubstantiated by the best \nintelligence, the American people, their representatives, and many of \nour would-be international partners in post-conflict Iraq, will most \ncertainly begin to lose confidence in the administration's word. \nSimply, the Nation's credibility, in my view, is at stake.\n  That credibility is vital as we approach burden-sharing efforts in \nthe reconstruction and democratization of Iraq, the projected cost of \nwhich grows each and every day.\n  There were reports again this morning that another American soldier \nlost his life in that reconstruction and democratization effort. All \ntold, in New Jersey there have been seven men and women who have lost \ntheir lives in Iraq. We are paying a serious toll, not only in terms of \nfinancial expense, as recently reported, but, most importantly, in the \nlife and blood of our brave soldiers.\n  A thorough public review is necessary, in my view, if we are to \nreestablish the United States' credibility. And once all the facts come \nto light, we need to hold those responsible accountable. Our leaders \nneed to promptly admit and correct all misstatements, exaggerations, \nand overreaching interpretations.\n  On the White House Web site, the pages that relate to the conflict of \nIraq are titled ``Denial and Deception.'' The American people can only \nhope that is not a moniker for the administration's presentation of its \ncase for the war in Iraq.\n  As we are now all well aware, in this year's State of the Union \nAddress President Bush said:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  The power of the President's allegations in those 16 short words \ncannot be overstated. The Bush administration, using legalistic \nlanguage, was leading people to embrace, at least in my view, the view \nthat Saddam Hussein had an active nuclear program. The President didn't \nsay the British were claiming anything. He didn't say they alleged \nanything. He said they ``learned'' that Saddam was attempting to buy \nuranium, implicitly accepting the charge as fact.\n  Although just 16 words long, it was a powerful statement that \nresonated in the context of debates that had gone on throughout the \nNation and the world. Only much later did we the people and the \nCongress learn this statement was based on information that our own \nintelligence agency earlier learned was false.\n\n[[Page S9441]]\n\n  Yesterday morning, Senator Levin, the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, laid out seven questions about \nclaims regarding Iraq and the uranium. Senator Levin argued these \nshould be answered in the context of a bipartisan investigation. I \nbelieve that is true, and I could not agree more.\n\n  This is not just a concern about the African uranium issue. It is \nabout whether there was a fair and full presentation to the American \npeople. But to the list of the seven questions, I would add an eighth. \nIf the information in the State of the Union Address was technically \naccurate, as administration officials have lately argued, why was it \nexcluded in Secretary Powell's 90-minute presentation before the United \nNations only 8 days later? Why was the intelligence on alleged Iraqi \nuranium purchases good enough for the State of the Union Address, a 1-\nhour speech addressing a variety of issues besides Iraq, but not good \nenough for a U.N. speech laying out the complete case against Iraq in \npainstaking detail 1 week later?\n  I would add a ninth question to Senator Levin's list. Why did we \nlearn about the misleading nature of these comments in the State of the \nUnion, not from the administration, but from the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency and the media? If there is no good explanation for the \nadministration's delay in correcting the error, it is hard to escape \nthe conclusion this was not just a series of blunders. Was it a \nstrategy for winning an argument? What was it about? Was there a \ncoverup involved? I think those questions need to be asked.\n  This is not an academic matter. At stake is nothing less than the \ncredibility of the United States, and that is important for protecting \nthe American people. That credibility gets weakened each day the \nadministration fails to provide a complete and candid explanation of \nwhat happened. Who knew? When did they know it? Why did they wait until \nnow to break the conspiracy of silence?\n  Keep in mind, political leaders around the world, not just here at \nhome, have staked their own reputations on their support of President \nBush and the United States. As a consequence, many of our closest \nallies and their elected officials are facing enormous criticism from \ntheir own citizens, and sometimes--and this is quite telling--from \ntheir own political parties. We owe it not only to the American people \nbut to all those who stood with us to be straight and to come clean \nimmediately. Otherwise, this episode will only undermine our ability to \nwin support for other critical foreign policy interests in the future, \nand they are substantial. In fact, without a clear explanation or an \nadmission of fault, we put the American people at risk facing a world \nwhere our partners question our credibility on all issues--Iran and \nSyria, North Korea.\n  The problem is especially troubling when viewed in the context of a \nbroader pattern of selective information provided by the \nadministration. Last October, for example, during the Iraqi debate--\nthis is one that is particularly troubling to me--Secretary James Kelly \nwas in Pyongyang, meeting with the North Koreans. At that meeting, a \nmeeting that occurred a full week prior to the Senate vote on the \nresolution authorizing force in Iraq, the North Koreans admitted to an \nactive nuclear program. Yet despite its importance and relevance to the \ndebate regarding Iraq and America's national security posture \ngenerally, the administration waited until after the Congress had voted \non the resolution to authorize the use of force before revealing the \ndetails of the North Korean disclosure.\n  To this Senator, that information was both relevant and timely to the \nIraqi debate. Apparently, because it might affect the tenor of the \ndebate, the information was withheld from the full Congress until after \nthe vote.\n  What are our priorities? Where were the dangers and how do we frame \nthis issue, particularly as it relates to the security of the people of \nthe United States? I ask, where is and where was the greater risk to \nthe American people?\n  As Senator Levin and others have explained, there were many other \ninstances in which the administration selectively, in some form or \nanother, misrepresented or withheld information to support their case \nfor the war in Iraq.\n  For example, the administration claimed there were linkages between \nal-Qaida and Iraq. But those claims now seem overstated or exaggerated \nand apparently were based on scant and circumstantial evidence.\n  Another widely discussed issue relates to Iraq's purchase of aluminum \ntubes, where there was considerable debate within the intelligence \ncommunity about whether the tubes were useful as part of a nuclear \nprogram.\n  When you add up these claims, it becomes clear that the \nadministration certainly was seeking to win an argument--not inform--\nand quite obviously it worked.\n  As John Adams once said, ``Facts are stubborn things; and whatever \nmay be our wishes, or inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, \nthey cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.''\n  We need to ensure that the facts come out. We should do it on a \nbipartisan basis, and we should do it immediately. The safety and \nsecurity of the American people are at stake.\n  We need to hold accountable not only those responsible for providing \nmisleading intelligence but also those responsible for preventing the \nfacts from coming out. The credibility of this President and the future \ncredibility of the United States are at stake. I hope we can deal with \nthis in an expeditious and clear manner. Hopefully, this in turn will \nset us on a course where we can share the burdens not only in Iraq but \nof protecting the American people around the globe in the days and \nyears ahead.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate is going to do something \nimportant later this morning; that is, send a message to Burma that we \ndon't intend to do business with them any longer. In addition to that, \nthis Freedom and Democracy Act, which will pass the Senate later this \nmorning and go down to the President for signature, will guarantee that \nwe have another debate in each of the next 3 years very similar to the \nMFN China issue with which we are all familiar where the issue came \nback before the Senate with an expedited procedure once a year.\n  This is not the last time we will be dealing with the Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act, and certainly it will not be the last time we deal \nwith Burma until the legitimately elected leader of that country is not \nonly out of prison but in power.\n  I thank my colleagues in both the Senate and House for acting quickly \non the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. The 418-2 vote in the \nHouse yesterday complements the 97-1 vote we had on a very similar bill \nin the Senate on June 11.\n  The message from the United States Congress to the world could not be \nmore clear--the assault on freedom in Burma will not stand.\n  With the cooperation and support of my colleagues in the Senate, the \nBurmese Freedom and Democracy Act will shortly be on its way to the \nWhite House for signature by the President.\n  When the people of Burma needed support in their struggle for \nfreedom, America acted--and acted decisively.\n  Unfortunately, there has been no change in the situation in Burma \nsince this measure was first introduced.\n  It is an outrage and a violation of human decency that democracy \nleader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other democrats continue to be held by \nthe thugs calling themselves the State Peace and Development Council \n(SPDC). Instead of giving the world access to Suu Kyi, Burmese \nstrongman General Than Shwe has dispatched his minions to regional \ncapitals on a misinformation campaign laying blame for the May 30 \nambush on Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy \n(NLD). Few should be duped by this desperate measure, and an import ban \nand other sanctions against Burma cannot come soon enough.\n  More must be done to support the struggle of freedom in Burma. It is \npast time that neighbors--especially Thailand and China--take off their \nblinders to the multitude of dangers posed by Burma to the region. We \nalready know that HIV/AIDS and drug use unravels the social and \neconomic fabric of bordering countries, and engagement with the SPDC \nserves only to further perpetuate lawlessness in Burma that\n\n[[Page S9442]]\n\nthreatens peace and stability, not just in Burma but throughout all of \nsoutheast Asia.\n  The United Nations has a role to play in creating a unified front \nagainst the regime. The Security Council should be briefed by U.N. \nSpecial Envoy Razali Ismail on the situation in Burma, and further \naction by that body should be contemplated.\n  However, words of condemnation are not enough. While I was pleased to \nmeet with Razali when he was in Washington last week, frankly, his time \nis better spent in Asia shuttling between capitals and marshaling \nsupport for the release of Suu Kyi and other democrats and for the \nrecognition of the results of the 1990 elections which have never been \nhonored. Suu Kyi and her party got 80 percent of the vote but were \nnever allowed to take power, and she has been under house arrest for \nmost of the last 3 years.\n  America's leadership is as important as it can possibly be. By \nsigning the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, President Bush will \nclearly signal that the United States stands by the Burmese people in \ntheir hour of need. Our allies should take note of the import ban and \nother measures contained in the act and immediately follow suit.\n  The only way this is going to work is on a multilateral basis. It \nworked in South Africa. Generally, I am skeptical of these kinds of \nimport bans. But there was one conspicuous example of where it worked, \nand that was in South Africa. The reason it did was because everybody \ncooperated. We are calling on the international community to isolate \nthese thugs and not do business with them.\n  Change will come in Burma only if the free world has the collective \nwill to hold the SPDC accountable for its brutality.\n  Some may continue to beat the ragged drum of engagement, but dialog \nis as dead as those the SPDC murdered on May 30. It is folly to think \nengagement will ``encourage positive changes'' within the SPDC. This \ntiger will never change its stripes. For over a decade, engagement has \nbeen tried. While the junta has made hollow promises of \n``reconciliation'' with the NLD and ethnic nationalities, general Than \nShwe has no intentions of relinquishing power on his own. He must be \npressured by the world into doing so.\n  It is not enough for envoys and diplomats to meet with Than Shwe's \nunderlings and other senior SPDC leaders in Rangoon. Than Shwe's grip \nin Burma is no less than Saddam Hussein's was in Iraq. If Japan, \nThailand, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian nations are to have an \nimpact on the situation, they must deal directly with Burma's top thug.\n  Let me be clear. Than Shwe is personally responsible for the May 30 \nmurders and subsequent injury and arrest of countless Burmese democracy \nactivists. He is responsible for the ongoing and systemic egregious \nhuman rights abuses perpetuated upon the ethnic nationalities in that \ncountry.\n  The fact that no outsider has seen Suu Kyi since Razali's brief \nmeeting in early June should be a cause for alarm.\n  We need to know exactly where she is being held and the state of her \nphysical condition. No one has time for peek-a-boo games the junta may \nbe interested in playing.\n  Suu Kyi must be immediately and unconditionally released, along with \nall other democrats whose only crime is advocating democracy and the \nrule of law.\n  With the passage of this act, our work on this issue is hardly over. \nThe people of Burma can count on America's continued support for the \nstruggle for freedom in their country. I intend to seize every \nopportunity to advance this cause both in Washington and abroad.\n  And I know that I can count on many of my colleagues to do the same. \nI particularly want to thank Senators Feinstein and McCain, who are no \nless outraged than I at the horrific abuses of the SPDC and the \ncontinued detention of Suu Kyi and other Burmese democrats. On the \nHouse side, Congressmen Lantos, King, and Hyde were equally energetic \nin responding to this crisis. Burma has no better friends than these \nfreedom-loving Americans.\n  Democracy and the rule of law will prevail in Burma. As we near this \nhistoric vote this morning, I am reminded of the Reverend Martin Luther \nKing's observation that the ``arc of the moral universe is long, but it \nbends toward justice.'' This morning, we must commit ourselves never to \ntire in the pursuit of justice in long-suffering Burma until Suu Kyi is \nfree and the struggle for freedom won.\n  Suu Kyi has kindled the flame of freedom in the hearts and minds of \nher compatriots. America must ensure that it is never extinguished.\n  Let me close by saying that the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act \nwould not have moved so swiftly through the Congress were it not for \nthe efforts of Senator Feinstein and particularly Senator McCain. \nSenators Lugar and Biden of the Foreign Relations Committee gave this \nlegislation an opportunity to move quickly. They could have insisted on \nit going to Foreign Relations. They did not. Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus had very useful suggestions to make in terms of the form \nof the final bill. And my colleague Senator Leahy also played an \nintegral part.\n  Over in the House, Congressmen Lantos, DeLay, Thomas, Hyde, and King \nwere all instrumental in securing swift passage of the act.\n  In terms of staff, I just want to mention my crew who were involved: \nBilly Piper, my chief of staff; Brian Lewis, who is my counsel on the \nSenate floor; Robert Karem; and Paul Grove, a longtime friend and \nassociate, who is the staff director of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, who has had an intense interest in this issue for a long \ntime.\n  I give special thanks and recognition to my former staffer who used \nto have Paul Groves' job, Robin Cleveland, who is now Assistant OMB \nDirector in the Bush administration, who, 10 years ago, sparked my \ninterest in this whole issue. It is hard to believe it has been 10 \nyears, but, unfortunately, not much has changed in Burma. Ten years of \nthe status quo is completely unacceptable. The Burmese people have a \nfriend in Robin Cleveland.\n  Finally, I thank those in the NGO community for their tireless \nefforts in support of Burma. There are a lot of very committed \nactivists in the United States who also travel to the area who are \nintensely interested in this issue and who will never give up until Suu \nKyi has an opportunity to be free not only of prison but free to assume \nthe power that she and her supporters earned in the free elections back \nin 1990.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator McCain wants to speak. How much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 19 minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I do want to make a few further \nobservations related to Thailand, Burma's neighbor, and their policy \ntoward Burma.\n  When Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was in Washington last \nweek, we had an opportunity to discuss the situation in Burma and Thai \npolicy toward the repressive regime. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister \nseemed to indicate that Thailand would not change its policy of \nengagement with the SPDC. I know the President brought it up with him \nas well because the President told me he brought the matter up with the \nThais as well when he met the Thai Prime Minister. If we look at \nThailand today, we can see the benefits of this policy they have been \nfollowing.\n  Drug abuse has spun wildly out of control, causing His Majesty the \nKing of Thailand to publicly comment on the threats to his beloved \ncountry from narcotics trafficking and abuse. With this abuse has come \nHIV/AIDS, crime and destitution.\n  Where do these drugs come from? Why, they come from Burma, of course.\n  Thailand today is home to countless innocent people seeking sanctuary \nfrom gross human rights violations and the denial of even the most \nbasic of freedoms. Thailand's response has been\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\nless than compassionate, with many of these men, women, and children \ndetained and deported back to their homeland, and others denied access \nto humanitarian assistance.\n  Where do the refugees have to return? Why, Burma, of course.\n  Tensions along the Thai-Burma border have periodically spilled over \ninto skirmishes between Thai soldiers and those of the SPDC. Burmese \ninvestment in armaments, including MiG aircraft purchased from Russia, \npose an immediate danger to the entire region.\n  What is the source of this instability? Burma.\n  The Thai Prime Minister should have departed the United States with a \nfirm understanding that protection of freedom in Burma was a top \npriority for both Congress and the administration.\n  Unfortunately, I do not think he got the message.\n  I understand that on July 31 and August 1 a meeting will be held in \nBangkok between Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Burma to discuss economic \ncooperation strategies. Prime Minister Shinawatra should take note of \nthe vote we are about to cast and reconsider hosting this meeting.\n  Instead of promoting economic cooperation strategies, Thailand should \nbe working to free Aung San Suu Kyi and other democrats being detained \nby the SPDC. Democrats should help democrats during times of duress.\n  I will have more to say about Thailand at a later date, but we should \nhave a right to expect more from the Thais who have been one of our \nstrongest allies in that region over the years.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator McConnell for his \nleadership on this issue, not only now as we are in an incredibly \ncritical moment in time in the history of the struggle of the Burmese \npeople for freedom, but for his longstanding advocacy in this noble \ncause and his commitment to the security and safety of one of the \nheroic figures of the 20th and 21st centuries, Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  Again, I thank him for not only motivating this body to rapid passage \nof this legislation but to his work with the other body which has \nresulted in us being able to pass it overwhelmingly today. I thank \nSenator McConnell again, and I regret to say we are a long way from \nseeing a resolution of this terrible unfolding, unending tragedy taking \nplace in Burma. I guess as a personal pique, I refuse to call it \nMuanmar, which the junta have changed the name to, and we have a lot \nmore to do. But I believe what we are doing today, because of his \nsponsorship, will send a message throughout Burma that we have not \nabandoned this heroic woman, nor have we abandoned the cause of \ndemocracy and freedom in this country of gentle people who deserve a \ngreat deal better than the group of thugs who have been oppressing them \nand repressing them for a long period of time.\n  It has been almost 7 weeks since Burma's military junta orchestrated \na savage attack on Burma's democrats and their leader Aung San Suu Kyi. \nIn response Congress acted with extraordinary speed and consensus to \nsend to the President's desk the bill before us banning imports from \nBurma. It is imperative that he sign it immediately, as I am confident \nhe will.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese people can't wait, nor should \nBurma's rulers and neighbors wait a day longer to hear the United \nStates speak with one voice in support of freedom in Burma. \nCongressional action on this bill is nearing completion, but as the \nSenator from Kentucky has said, our commitment to Burma's people will \nnot end until they are free. Our resolve will not weaken as long as the \njunta denies the Burmese people a right to live in a nation ruled by \nlaw, not fear, led by the elected leader whose appeal no amount of \nviolence can diminish and whose courage no amount of suffering can dim.\n  It is now time for Burma's leaders, especially the frontline states, \nto join the United States and Europe in rejecting half measures and \nimplementing a fundamentally new approach that looks forward to Burma's \nliberation rather than a mere moderation of an illegitimate regime's \nrule. Southeast Asia will not be stable or secure as long as the \ngenerals rule in Rangoon. Placing hope in a policy of reconciliation \nthat relies more on the junta's goodwill than on international pressure \nfor democratic change will do nothing to alter a status quo that \nupholds tyranny.\n  China, India, and Thailand directly suffer the effects of regional \ninsecurity caused by AIDS, drugs, and refugees that flow across Burma's \nborders. They also suffer the economic consequences of living next to a \nbankrupt nation whose economy is controlled largely by drug lords and a \ncorrupt military elite. While China may not be troubled by dictatorship \nin Burma, it would clearly benefit economically from having another \nAsian tiger on its borders which good government and Burma's natural \nwealth would make it.\n  Democratic India would benefit strategically and economically from a \nfellow democracy in Rangoon that could expand Indian influence in \nSoutheast Asia and serve as a significant trading partner.\n  We expect more in particular from our ally Thailand which has done \nlittle of substance to support change in Burma since the May 30 \nattacks. As far as I am concerned, business as usual won't cut it. We \nfrankly expect a democratic ally such as Thailand to do more to oppose \ndictatorship in Burma, both out of principle and because of the \ninsecurity its misrule brings to Thailand. We will be watching for \nsigns of a new policy approach in Bangkok. This will be an issue in our \nbilateral relationship.\n\n  We welcome Japan's announcement of suspending new assistance to Burma \nas a result of the junta's crackdown. But Tokyo's existing aid programs \nsend a mixed signal to the democrats who were so heartened by popular \nprotests on their behalf in the streets of Tokyo. We would welcome the \nGovernment of Japan's reassessment of its entire policy toward Burma.\n  All of us appreciated ASEAN's joint statement calling for Aung San \nSuu Kyi's early release at the Phnom Penh summit, breaking with the \ngroup's history of noninterference in each other's affairs. But friends \nof ASEAN want to see it take concrete steps to prove its relevance to \nsecurity and stability in Southeast Asia.\n  I remind my colleagues that when ASEAN admitted Burma into ASEAN, it \nwas with the promise and commitment that things would improve in Burma. \nNo one can argue that there has been anything but retrogression and an \nincrease in brutality and, of course, the latest outrage in the capture \nand mistreatment of their freely elected leader.\n  Events in Burma are testing ASEAN as never before. Burma's crisis \nimpacts every nation in the region, from AIDS, drugs, and refugees to \npolitical and economic instability. Those of us who want ASEAN to \nsucceed expect it to play a leadership role in its own backyard and to \ndeliver on its promises in 1997 that membership would change Burma. \nSome of us weren't convinced then and we are not convinced today. Burma \nwill soon be preparing to assume ASEAN's presidency in 2006. What kind \nof an image does ASEAN have with Burma as its president? ASEAN's \ncredibility can't withstand the presidency of a rogue regime that is \nunreconstructed and brutal, which has the blood of its people on its \nhands and imprisons their elected leader. As long as Burma festers, \nASEAN looks either incapacitated, weak, or irrelevant.\n  As long as Aung San Suu Kyi remains in prison and the Burmese people \nlive in fear, convinced Burma's neighbors are complicit in their \nsuffering, the problem of Burma will be an issue in America's bilateral \nrelations with nations across Asia. It is time for Burma to command the \nattention of the U.N. Security Council. Burma's misrule is clearly of \ninternational importance. The council has not even formally been \nbriefed by Ambassador Razali Ismail since his visit over a\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\nmonth ago to Rangoon as the Secretary General's personal \nrepresentative. The United States should demand that the Security \nCouncil take up this issue.\n  As the United States, the EU, and even ASEAN have acknowledged, Burma \nis an international problem. The council would be remiss to ignore it, \nand even a council debate would command the attention of the generals. \nIt might also command some attention in Beijing, Bangkok, Tokyo, and \nother capitals with the power to make a difference. It is past time for \nthe United States and our allies to press this issue.\n  I am proud that Congress, with passage of this legislation, is \nspeaking with one voice in support of Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese \npeople. The generals must know we won't let up the pressure until Burma \nis free. The United States stands with the Burmese people in their \nstruggle for the freedom that is their birthright and which the \ngenerals have stolen from them. We will do everything in our power to \nhelp them take back their country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four editorials be \nprinted in the Record. Two are from the Washington Post, one from the \nWall Street Journal, and the final one a comment by Jack Straw, the \nforeign minister of Great Britain.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 14, 2003]\n\n                         Stop Stalling on Burma\n\n       U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to meet with \n     President Bush at the White House today. Ahead of time, U.N. \n     officials said they expected the two men to discuss Liberia, \n     the Middle East and other matters. We trust that among those \n     other matters will be a subject about which both leaders have \n     claimed to be highly concerned: the crackdown on democracy \n     activists in Burma. The leader of that Southeast Asian \n     nation's democracy movement--the rightful leader of the \n     country, in fact--remains in captivity, and neither Mr. Bush \n     nor Mr. Annan has rallied to her defense as strenuously as \n     one would expect.\n       It's been a month since Secretary of State Colin L. Powell \n     promised prompt action to penalize the generals he referred \n     to as ``the thugs who run the Burmese government.'' The time \n     had come, he said in an op-ed article in the Wall Street \n     Journal, to freeze their financial assets and ban remittances \n     to Burma. But the administration has taken no such steps. \n     It's been six weeks since the junta sent 3,000 vigilantes, \n     armed with wooden bats and sharpened iron rods, to beat and \n     stab Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters as they traveled with her \n     in the hinterland. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, \n     apparently escaped injury but was taken into custody and, \n     except for one brief interview with a U.N. envoy, has not \n     been heard from since. The Senate shortly thereafter approved \n     a measure banning imports from Burma, where the generals \n     control most companies, but the bill has yet to emerge from \n     the House. It's scheduled for action this week; the House \n     should vote and the president should sign the bill quickly \n     into law.\n       And the United Nations? You might think the Security \n     Council would have swung into action to demand freedom for \n     one of the world's most courageous leaders and for her \n     colleagues and to address the threat to regional stability \n     posed by the increasingly erratic junta. After all, there is \n     no dispute as to her legitimacy; the party she leads \n     overwhelmingly won an election in 1990 but has never been \n     permitted to take its rightful place in government. So far, \n     however, the chief U.N. response has been the election of \n     Burma--or Myanmar, as the generals call it--to the vice \n     presidency of the General Assembly for the session that \n     begins in September.\n       For many years now, the United Nations and the United \n     States have supported dialogue between Aung San Suu Kyi and \n     the nation's junta leading toward peaceful democratization. \n     She has consistently endorsed such a nonviolent process, even \n     during many years of house arrest. With their murderous \n     attack of May 30 and subsequent incarceration of her, Burma's \n     leaders have shown contempt for the idea, and so far they \n     have paid little price. The president and the secretary \n     general could begin to change that equation today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 22, 2003]\n\n                              Where She Is\n\n       Since Government-sponsored goons attacked Burmese democracy \n     leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters on a provincial \n     road May 30, the Nobel Peace laureate has been in confinement \n     and virtually cut off from the world. In editorials earlier \n     this month urging that Aung San Suu Kyi be freed we asked, \n     ``Where is she?'' Now we know--and the answer could hardly be \n     more discouraging. According to the British Foreign Office, \n     the corrupt generals who rule Burma moved her from a \n     ``guesthouse,'' where she had been held ostensibly for her \n     own protection, to the notorious Insein Prison, a colonial-\n     era monstrosity where old dog kennels have been converted to \n     torture cells. The disclosure of the move came on Aung San \n     Suu Kyi's 58th birthday--a nice touch, and well in keeping \n     with the usual mode of operation of Burma's ruling thugs, who \n     a few years back refused to allow Aung San Suu Kyi's husband \n     to visit her even when he was dying of cancer.\n       Usual methods, yes, but other governments can no longer \n     respond with their usual apathy. Burma is a beautiful, \n     resource-rich nation of 50 million people, strategically \n     located at the crossroads of India, China and Southeast Asia. \n     Its largely Buddhist population, once among the best-educated \n     in Asia, has fallen into poverty after a half-century of \n     military misrule. Thirteen years ago the generals, misreading \n     their subjects as dictators so often do, permitted an \n     election--and Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for \n     Democracy won more than four out of five parliamentary seats, \n     even through she was under house arrest at the time. The \n     generals nullified the election and kept the NLD leader under \n     house arrest for most of the succeeding decade. They put \n     hundreds of would-be parliamentarians and other NLD activists \n     in prison. They continued to run the economy into the ground, \n     while Burma's drug trade flourished and the generals enriched \n     themselves corruptly.\n       Last year, under international pressure, the dictators \n     released Aung San Suu Kyi and promised a dialogue leading \n     toward democracy. But once again her popularity--freedom's \n     popularity--seems to have surprised them. They cracked down \n     more brutally than before, settled back to see whether the \n     world cared--and so far seem to have seen little reaction \n     that might worry them. On June 11 the Senate, led by Mitch \n     McConnell (R-Ky.), voted 97 to 1 to cut off imports from \n     Burma, which would deal a blow to the generals, who control \n     most of the economy. A companion House bill seemed to be \n     making progress late last week. The White House and Secretary \n     of State Colin L. Powell have issued some tough statements.\n       But actions of real consequence? So far, none. Southeast \n     Asian foreign ministers, meeting last week in Cambodia with \n     Mr. Powell, agreed to send a delegation to Burma no later \n     than October. October? While one of the world's most \n     courageous political leaders languishes in one of its most \n     infamous jails? Where are Kofi Annan and the U.N. Security \n     Council? Where are the executive orders that President Bush \n     could issue today? ``If the international community has the \n     political will to stand for freedom in Burma, change can come \n     to that beleaguered country,'' Mr. McConnell said last week. \n     He's right. Inside Insein Prison, and throughout the larger \n     prison that Burma has become, a lot rides on that ``if.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 12, 2003]\n\n             It's Time To Turn the Tables on Burma's Thugs\n\n                          (By Colin L. Powell)\n\n       Washington.--United Nations Special Envoy Razali Ismail has \n     just visited Burma and was able to bring us news that Aung \n     San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the leader of a \n     peaceful democratic party known as the National League for \n     Democracy, is well and unharmed. The thoughts and prayers of \n     free people everywhere have been with her these past two \n     weeks. Our fears for her current state of health are now \n     somewhat lessened. On May 30, her motorcade was attacked by \n     thugs, and then the thugs who run the Burmese government \n     placed her under ``protective custody.'' We can take comfort \n     in the fact that she is well. Unfortunately, the larger \n     process that Ambassador Razali and Aung San Suu Kyi have been \n     pursuing--to restore democracy in Burma--is failing despite \n     their goodwill and sincere efforts. It is time to reassess \n     our policy toward a military dictatorship that has repeatedly \n     attacked democracy and jailed its heroes.\n       There is little doubt on the facts. Aung San Suu Kyi's \n     party won an election in 1990 and since then has been denied \n     its place in Burmese politics. Her party has continued to \n     pursue a peaceful path, despite personal hardships and \n     lengthy periods of house arrest or imprisonment for her and \n     her followers. Hundreds of her supporters remain in prison, \n     despite some initial releases and promises by the junta to \n     release more. The party's offices have been closed and their \n     supporters persecuted. Ambassador Razali has pursued every \n     possible opening and worked earnestly to help Burma make a \n     peaceful transition to democracy. Despite initial statements \n     last year, the junta--which shamelessly calls itself the \n     State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)--has now refused \n     his efforts and betrayed its own promises.\n       At the end of last month, this rejection manifested itself \n     in violence. After the May 30 attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's \n     convoy, we sent U.S. Embassy officers to the scene to gather \n     information. They reported back that the attack was planned \n     in advance. A series of trucks followed her convoy to a \n     remote location, blocked it and then unloaded thugs to swarm \n     with fury over the cars of democracy supporters. The \n     attackers were brutal and organized; the victims were \n     peaceful and defenseless. The explanation by the Burmese \n     military junta of what happened doesn't hold water. The SPDC \n     has not made a credible report of how many people were killed \n     and injured. It was clear to our embassy officers that the \n     members of the junta were responsible for directing and \n     producing this staged riot.\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\n       We have called for a full accounting of what happened that \n     day. We have called for Aung Sun Suu Kyi to be released from \n     confinement of any kind. We have called for the release of \n     the other leaders of the National League for Democracy who \n     were jailed by the SPDC before and after the attack. We have \n     called for the offices of the National League for Democracy \n     to be allowed to reopen. We are in touch with other \n     governments who are concerned about the fate of democracy's \n     leader and the fate of democracy in Burma to encourage them, \n     too, to pressure the SPDC.\n       The Bush administration agrees with members of Congress, \n     including Sen. Mitch McConnell, who has been a leading \n     advocate of democracy in Burma, that the time has come to \n     turn up the pressure on the SPDC.\n       Here's what we've done so far. The State Department has \n     already extended our visa restrictions to include all \n     officials of an organization related to the junta--the Union \n     Solidarity and Development Association--and the managers of \n     state-run enterprises so that they and their families can be \n     banned as well.\n       The United States already uses our voice and our vote \n     against loans to Burma from the World Bank and other \n     international financial institutions. The State Department \n     reports honestly and frankly on crimes of the SPDC in our \n     reports on Human Rights, Trafficking in Persons, Drugs, and \n     International Religious Freedom. In all these areas, the \n     junta gets a failing grade. We also speak out frequently and \n     strongly in favor of the National League for Democracy, and \n     against the SPDC. I will press the case in Cambodia next week \n     when I meet with the leaders of Southeast Asia, despite their \n     traditional reticence to confront a member and neighbor of \n     their association, known as Asean.\n       Mr. McConnell has introduced the Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act in the Senate; Reps. Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos \n     have introduced a similar bill in the House. We support the \n     goals and intent of the bills and are working with the \n     sponsors on an appropriate set of new steps. Those who follow \n     this issue will know that our support for legislation is in \n     fact a change in the position of this administration and \n     previous ones as well. Simply put, the attack on Ms. Suu \n     Kyi's convoy and the utter failure of the junta to accept \n     efforts at peaceful change cannot be the last word on the \n     matter. The junta that oppresses democracy inside Burma must \n     find that its actions will not be allowed to stand.\n       There are a number of measures that should now be taken, \n     many of them in the proposed legislation. It's time to freeze \n     the financial assets of the SPDC. It's time to ban \n     remittances to Burma so that the SPDC cannot benefit from the \n     foreign exchange. With legislation, we can, and should, place \n     restrictions on travel-related transactions that benefit the \n     SPDC and its supporters. We also should further limit \n     commerce with Burma that enriches the junta's generals. Of \n     course, we would need to ensure consistency with our World \n     Trade Organization and other international obligations. Any \n     legislation will need to be carefully crafted to take into \n     account our WTO obligations and the president's need for \n     waiver authority, but we should act now.\n       By attacking Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters, the \n     Burmese junta has finally and definitively rejected the \n     efforts of the outside world to bring Burma back into the \n     international community. Indeed, their refusal of the work of \n     Ambassador Razali and of the rights of Aung San Suu Kyi, and \n     her supporters could not be clearer. Our response must be \n     equally clear if the thugs who now rule Burma are to \n     understand that their failure to restore democracy will only \n     bring more and more pressures against them and their \n     supporters.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Financial Times, June 25, 2003]\n\n             Burmese Military Brutality Cannot Be Tolerated\n\n                            (By Jack Straw)\n\n       Last week was Aung San Suu Kyi's 58th birthday. What should \n     have been a day of quiet celebration with family and friends \n     for the Nobel Peace Prize winner was instead spent in \n     detention in a jail outside Rangoon.\n       The Burmese regime's claims that she is in ``protective \n     custody'' after her supporters clashed with opponents on May \n     30 lacks credibility. We know from witnesses' accounts that \n     thugs, armed and hired by the regime, ambushed Ms Suu Kyi and \n     her supporters in a premeditated attack. Dozens of civilians \n     were killed and injured, scores were arrested, many more are \n     still in hiding. The regime has closed the offices of Ms Suu \n     Kyi's National League for Democracy and detained party \n     leaders and workers across the country.\n       Ms Suu Kyi herself was taken away by the military \n     authorities. For some time, nobody knew where she was being \n     held, or in what conditions. Last Thursday, the Foreign \n     Office revealed that she was being kept in a two-room hut at \n     the notorious Insein jail just outside Rangoon.\n       We understand that Ms Suu Kyi is being held under the most \n     draconian legislation that the military authorities have at \n     their disposal--Section 10(a) of the 1975 State Protection \n     Law. This allows for her detention, without access to family \n     or lawyers, for up to five years--with no prospect of appeal.\n       She has been isolated from her supporters, both inside \n     Burma and beyond. Attempts by others, including Mike O'Brien, \n     a Foreign Office minister, to get in touch with Ms Suu Kyi \n     have been frustrated by the regime. She remains cut off and \n     locked up. This is wholly unacceptable.\n       Far from Ms Suu Kyi's being in ``protective custody'', the \n     only people being ``protected'' by her detention are those in \n     the military regime itself. They hope that by keeping her--\n     and the democratic movement--incarcerated they can cling on \n     to power. The military government, which attempts to run \n     Burma through fear and intimidation, is not only brutal but \n     also corrupt and incompetent. A once prosperous country is \n     being run into the ground. Poverty is rife and diseases \n     such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/Aids are spreading.\n       In stark contrast to the Burmese military junta, and to \n     their enduring fury, Ms Suu Kyi commands the support and \n     respect of the Burmese people. Ever since her party won an \n     election in 1990, the regime has harassed and intimidated Ms \n     Suu Kyi and her supporters. She has already suffered long \n     spells of house arrest and imprisonment.\n       Hundreds of her supporters are also in prison, many without \n     trial. Others have been blackmailed or intimidated into \n     giving up politics. But whenever and wherever she travels, \n     ordinary people still turn out in their thousands to see and \n     hear her. For them she is a marker of hope for a better \n     future.\n       The UK, together with our partners in the European Union, \n     the US and other members of the international community, are \n     pressing the regime to begin a process of national \n     reconciliation and democracy. Burma's neighbors too, \n     especially its fellow members of the Association of South \n     East Asian Nations, have been dismayed by the detention of Ms \n     Suu Kyi and have called publicly for her release.\n       We welcome this international consensus. Regrettably, the \n     Burmese regime shows a cynical and blatant disregard for the \n     views of others. It responds only to direct pressure. The EU \n     has therefore decided to increase sanctions against Burma.\n       We have already applied an arms embargo and a ban on the \n     sale of any items that could be used for torture or \n     repression, on defense links and non-humanitarian aid. High-\n     level contacts are also prohibited. We have already \n     introduced an assets freeze and the EU has suspended Burma's \n     trading privileges. The US has taken similar steps.\n       We have now agreed to take these measures further. Our ban \n     on Burmese ministers visiting the EU will be extended to \n     include senior managers of state-run enterprises and \n     officials from organizations linked to the government. \n     Further pressure will follow unless the regime moves rapidly \n     to restore civilian rule and democracy.\n       The hopes and aspirations of the Burmese people cannot be \n     frustrated. The spirit and justness of the democracy movement \n     cannot be contained by violence or prison cells. We call on \n     the friends of Burma, in Asia and around the world, to \n     redouble their efforts to help Ms Suu Kyi and the people of \n     Burma move toward national reconciliation, respect for human \n     rights and the democracy they so richly deserve.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Washington Post editorial of July 14 \nsays:\n\n       It's been a month since Secretary of State Colin L. Powell \n     promised prompt action to penalize the generals he referred \n     to as ``the thugs who run the Burmese government.'' The time \n     had come, he said in an op-ed article in the Wall Street \n     Journal, to freeze their financial assets and ban remittances \n     into Burma. But the administration has taken no such steps. \n     It's been six weeks since the junta sent 3,000 vigilantes \n     armed with wooden bats and sharpened iron rods, to beat and \n     stab Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters as they traveled with her \n     in the hinterland. [She] apparently escaped injury but was \n     taken into custody and, except for one brief interview with a \n     U.N. envoy, has not been heard from since.\n       And the United Nations? You might think the Security \n     Council would have swung into action to demand freedom for \n     one of the world's most courageous leaders and for her \n     colleagues and to address the threat to regional stability \n     posed by the increasingly erratic junta. After all, there is \n     no dispute as to her legitimacy; the party she leads \n     overwhelmingly won an election in 1990 but has never been \n     permitted to take its rightful place in government. So far, \n     however, the chief U.S. response has been the election of \n     Burma--or Myanmar, as the generals call it--to the presidency \n     of the General Assembly for the session that begins in \n     September.\n\n  The Washington Post June 22, last year:\n\n       But actions of real consequences? So far, none. Southeast \n     Asian foreign ministers, meeting last week in Cambodia with \n     Mr. Powell, agreed to send a delegation to Burma no later \n     than October. October? While one of the world's most \n     courageous political leaders languishes in one of its most \n     infamous jails? Where are Kofi Annan and the U.N. Security \n     Council? Where are the executive orders that President Bush \n     could issue today?\n\n  I appreciate very much, and I referred to, Secretary Colin Powell's \narticle that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on June 12 and, on \nJune 25, Jack Straw's article--the Foreign Secretary, as we all know, \nof our close friend and ally, England. He wrote:\n\n       Last week was Aung San Suu Kyi's 58th birthday. What should \n     have been a day of\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\n     quiet celebration with family and friends for the Nobel Peace \n     Prize winner was instead spent in detention in a jail outside \n     Rangoon. . . .\n       Far from Ms. Suu Kyi's being in ``protective custody,'' the \n     only people being ``protected'' by her detention are those in \n     the military regime itself.

For them, she is a marker of hope for a better \n     future.\n\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       The hopes and aspirations of the Burmese people cannot be \n     frustrated. The spirit and justness of the democracy movement \n     cannot be contained by violence or prison cells. We call on \n     the friends of Burma, in Asia and around the world, to \n     redouble their efforts to help Ms. Suu Kyi and the people of \n     Burma move toward national reconciliation, respect for human \n     rights, and democracy they so richly deserve.\n\n  Mr. President, we need the Security Council to debate this issue. Our \nAmbassador and our Secretary of State should call for that debate. Our \nadministration, following the passage of this legislation, should \nimmediately implement Executive orders that can further put \nrestrictions on our relations with this gang of thugs in Burma.\n  Finally, there are probably people who may be viewing this action by \nCongress today and the comments the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, and I are making and saying: You know, Burma is a small \ncountry, far away. It is rise or fall. Its type of government has very \nlittle impact on the United States economically, culturally, \npolitically, or militarily.\n  But I argue that that is not the case, particularly when we look at \nthe flow of drugs and many other things that are happening in this \ncountry.\n  Why is it that these Senators are not talking about Iraq? Americans \nare dying--one a day--there. There is an unfolding scandal, or mini-\nscandal, about who knew what and when and why, and there is a great \npoliticization of that. North Korea has threatened to develop nuclear \nweapons. Iraq apparently is doing that. Why isn't the Senate devoting \ntheir attention to larger issues that far more vastly affect the U.S. \nnational security?\n  The answer is simple: This democracy movement in Burma is what \nAmerica is all about. Over 200 years ago, in a very small country, a \nvery small movement for independence--which was given very little \nchance--took place in this country. If it had not been for the help of \nother countries--particularly France--the United States may have \nachieved its independence over time, but certainly not in the way that \nwe did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for the majority debate has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at the risk of redundancy, what is \nhappening in Burma is what the United States is all about--our defense \nof freedom and democracy, even if it doesn't affect our national \ninterest. That is what makes America different.\n  I argue that this administration, this Congress, and the American \npeople will reconfirm their commitment to their freedom, democracy, and \nto one of the great heroic figures in history, and that is Madam Aung \nSan Suu Kyi, who has the profound respect, appreciation, affection, and \nadmiration of all who have encountered her and many who have not.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator leaves, I thank him for his \npassionate and insightful comments about the situation in Burma. No one \nhas said it better. I also share his view that the U.N. ought to take \nup this matter. I wish to mention to my friend from Arizona that, in \ndiscussion with the special envoy, Mr. Razali, last week, he showed \nvery little enthusiasm. The reason is that China might veto it.\n  I wonder if the Senator shares my view that I don't care whether \nChina would take such an action, this needs to be discussed before the \nSecurity Council, debated among the most important countries in the \nworld. Let the Chinese in public rationalize such an action if they are \ninclined to do so. I wonder if my friend shares my view on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yes, I think if it is China's view that \nthe Security Council should not take up an issue of basic fundamental \nhuman rights and democracy and wish to veto it, that is their right as \nmembers of the U.N. Security Council. But the fact is, that does not \nrelieve the United States of our obligation to bring it up.\n  One other aspect. Since we have met with Mr. Razali on a number of \noccasions, up until our last meeting with the special envoy of the \nU.N., Mr. Razali, he was generally upbeat that things would get better \nin Burma, that some of the restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi would be \nrelaxed, and that we should take this moderate approach. In fact, there \nwas even little criticism of the inclusion of Burma in ASEAN because \nthat would bring them into the fold. Now they are facing the \nembarrassing prospect of, 2 years from now, Burma taking over the \nchairmanship of ASEAN itself. That is remarkable.\n  So it was very interesting to me that Mr. Razali, for all intents and \npurposes--from my impression of our conversation--has basically given \nup on the policy of sort of appeasement, bringing along the junta so \nthey would become more democratic, et cetera. In fact, I think his \nstatements, authenticated by events, indicate that that policy has been \nan abject failure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is absolutely \ncorrect. This policy of engagement has been a total failure. That is \npart of what our bill is about today. It is to not only establish a \nleadership role for the United States but to lead the world in moving \nin a different direction.\n  The Senator from Kansas is here, and he also had a chance to meet \nwith Mr. Razali and has made an important contribution to this debate. \nI believe we have enough time to accommodate not only Senator Brownback \nbut Senator Leahy as well.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have an inquiry. How much time is \navailable on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11 minutes 9 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will not speak long. The Senator from \nKentucky has covered this very well, as well as the Senator from \nArizona. I think it is important that the Senate take up this \nresolution. It is an important time to do this and it is an important \ncause.\n  There are two narrow issues I would like to comment on briefly \nregarding the situation of the neighboring country of Thailand.\n  Thailand has been a strong ally of the United States for some period \nof time and has worked closely with us on a number of issues in which \nwe have a strong interest in the region. Yet on this issue of Burma, \nThailand has not been constructive. As a matter of fact, it has put \nforward a number of really quite negative comments.\n  The current Thai Prime Minister most distressedly has begun an \nassault on Burmese exiles living as refugees on the Thai-Burma border, \nwhich leads me to the next category on which I think we need to be \npressing.\n  I have been to the Thai-Burma border. The exiles, because of the \nBurmese Government, have fled to the Thai border and are in refugee \ncamps. They are subjected to all sorts of horrific conditions--living \nconditions that are not appropriate, sanitation conditions that are not \nappropriate, and then they are being trafficked, as people move \nthrough, trying to take young women and children into the sex trade \nthat flourishes in Thailand and other places, but particularly in \nThailand.\n  We have seen a rapid slave trade, trafficking in persons. Sex \ntrafficking is taking place because of the Burmese Government and what \nthey are doing,\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\nand the complicity of the Thai Government of not dealing with this \nsituation on the border, of not condemning those in the Burmese \nGovernment who are causing problems.\n  I rise in support of the bill introduced by the Senator from \nKentucky. What is happening in Burma is an extraordinary situation. It \nis having huge human consequences in the region with people fleeing \nfrom the Burmese Government and who then are being trafficked, and we \nare not getting the help and support we need from a number of \ncountries, particularly Thailand. This seems to be propping up the \nBurmese regime. This is something about which we should be very clear \nto our allies cannot continue.\n  I rise in strong support of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003. I urge its unanimous passage and world condemnation of what is \ntaking place by the Government of Burma.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may briefly say before the Senator \nfrom Kansas leaves, I thank him for having a hearing on the Burma \nsituation and for being exceedingly involved and knowledgeable about \nthis issue. I am sure he shares my view that this is going to be a long \nstruggle. We are going to be dealing with this issue, unfortunately, \nnext year when this certification process kicks in and we are back to \nreviewing the Burmese Government. I hope I am wrong. I hope by this \ntime next year Aung San Suu Kyi is not only out of jail but in power. I \nwould not bet on it.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for his important contributions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 2330, the Burma Sanctions bill.\n  It is a travesty that today, 55 years after the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights and only weeks after fighting a war to liberate 24 \nmillion Iraqis, we watch the military junta in Rangoon violently and \nruthlessly suppress the rights of the Burmese people.\n  The bill before us, like S. 1182, will send a strong message to the \nthugs running Burma that the U.S. Congress will not tolerate their \nabrogation of the rule of law.\n  The international community needs to follow suit. This is especially \ntrue with regard to Burma's neighbors--the countries of the ASEAN \ngroup--and the Security Council of the United Nations.\n  I would like to call attention to a July 14 Washington Post editorial \nthat very clearly states the need for a unified, international approach \nto confronting the military junta in Burma. The editorial asserts that \nthe United Nations must do more to push Burma toward reform and \ndemocratization. And it draws attention to the sorry fact that Burma \nhas been elected to provide the vice president of the United Nation's \nGeneral Assembly for the session beginning in September 2003.\n  It is appalling that one of the world's most oppressive regimes has \nbeen chosen by its neighbors for a leadership role at the United \nNations. This selection serves only to undermine the credibility of the \nUnited Nations and the General Assembly.\n  I support H.R. 2330 because I am a strong advocate for human rights \nand democratic governance in Southeast Asia and around the world. I \ncall on my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  I also call on administration officials to raise the military junta's \nsuppression of human and political rights--including the illegal arrest \nof opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and at least 17 officials of her \nparty on May 30 when they meet with their ASEAN nation counterparts.\n  Finally, I urge the international community to stand up to the \nBurmese dictatorship. We must remain steadfast in our resolve to \nrestore the freedom of the Burmese people. We need to send a message to \nthese thugs that their brutal reign of oppression and terror does not \ngo unnoticed and will not last.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the House \nof Representatives for passing the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003 and to urge the Senate to take swift action on the House bill to \nget it to the President's desk.\n  The 418-to-2 House vote to ban all imports from Burma is an important \nstatement to support for human rights, the rule of law, and democracy \nin Burma.\n  Over 6 weeks have passed since Aung San Suu Kyi and several of her \nNational League for Democracy colleagues came under attack by \nparamilitary thugs and were subsequently detained by the ruling \nmilitary junta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC.\n  Since then, with the exception of a brief visit by the U.N. Special \nEnvoy to Burma, Razali Ismail, Suu Kyi has been held incommunicado \nreportedly in the notorious Insein Prison.\n  The events of May 30 clearly indicate that the military junta has no \nintention of adhering to its commitment to engage the NLD in a \nsubstantive dialogue on political reform and national reconciliation.\n  Prompt Senate action will put the U.S. Congress firmly on record in \nsupport of Suu Kyi's immediate release and the legitimate democratic \naspirations of the Burmese people as expressed by the 1990 \nparliamentary elections, decisively won by the NLD.\n  The only difference in the House bill as opposed to the Senate bill \npassed last month--a 3-year sunset on the sanctions--is acceptable, if \nnot ideal.\n  Now, I call on the international community, in particular ASEAN and \nthe United Nations, to follow Congress's lead and take action to bring \npressure to bear on the SPDC.\n  A united effort is critical for sanctions to be most effective. The \nregime must know that the world speaks with one voice and its days are \nnumbered.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the House bill so that the President \ncan sign it into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while both the Senator from Kansas and the \nSenator from Kentucky are on the floor, I want to take a minute to \npraise them for their outstanding statements. I strongly support the \nBurmese Freedom and Democracy Act that Senator McConnell, Senator \nFeinstein, and others have introduced and sheparded through the Senate \nearlier this year.\n  I have lost count of the number of times my good friend from Kentucky \nhas come to the Chamber to send an important message to the very brutal \nand very corrupt regime in Burma. Senator McConnell's message has been: \nYour conduct is outrageous. It should not be allowed to stand. Aung San \nSuu Kyi is the democratically elected leader of Burma, and she and her \nfellow opposition leaders must be immediately released.\n  The Senator from Kentucky and those who join with him are absolutely \nright. Our country, the greatest democracy history has ever known, must \nstand for democratic principles around the world. This legislation \nhelps the United States do just that.\n  Since the McConnell-Feinstein legislation was introduced--and passed \nby the Senate 93 to 1, something we do not see too often around here--\nit has helped send a clear signal to the administration, ASEAN members, \nand the international community that we need to increase the pressure \non the illegitimate regime in Burma.\n  We have seen some good first steps taken by the State Department, \nincluding a ban on remittances, expansion of visa restrictions, and a \nstrong statement by Deputy Secretary Armitage on Friday.\n  But, U.S. action can only go so far. There has to be active pressure \nfrom Burma's neighbors in Southeast Asia. I single out Thailand, Japan, \nand China. These nations have to disavow what we all know has been a \nfailed policy of engagement.\n  In many cases, engagement can be a good thing. In many cases, \nengagement can help resolve difficult international issues. This is not \none of those times.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to see some postive developments have \noccured on this issue in Asia. The ASEAN nations have taken the \nunprecedented step of expressing concern with the situation in Burma. \nThe Japanese have suspended some forms of aid to the regime.\n  But that is not enough. Other leaders in the region have to make \nunequivocal statements saying what we in the United States Senate are \nsaying: Aung San Suu Kyi is the democratically elected leader of Burma \nand the military junta has to release her and her followers.\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\n  The world needs to do more. The U.N. has to become more involved. The \nSecurity Council should be briefed by U.N. Special Envoy Razali Ismail \non the situation in Burma and Security Council action should be \nseriously considered.\n  My purpose in speaking, obviously, is to support this legislation. \nHowever, I wanted to take a moment to praise the deep and personal \neffort by the Senator from Kentucky on Burma. He has shown courage, \nbut, perhaps more importantly, he has demonstrated tremendous \npersistence in keeping our attention focused on Burma. Sometimes we \nforget some of what we say is heard and has an impact in other parts of \nthe world. In some cases, it may not be make it back to our own States, \nbut it is heard in the parts of the world where is makes a big \ndifference. This is one of those times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nhis kind comments on the Burma bill and appreciated his forceful \nadvocacy of passage.\n  In terms of the parliamentary situation, is there time left on the \nBurma bill on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am prepared to yield back the time that remains on \nthis side if the Senator from Vermont would do the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will do the same. Should we ask for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Do we need to ask for the yeas and nays on the Burma \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be appropriate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is there is a 30-minute \ntimeframe on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me indicate I have just been sitting \nwith my colleagues, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, discussing this \namendment. I want to discuss just for a moment why I have offered this \namendment and then indicate that I think we have a responsibility here \nin the Congress to try to understand how much these operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and other areas of the world cost us and how we plan to \npay for them.\n  Before I do that, let me say the chairman of this subcommittee and \nthe ranking member, two Members for whom I have the highest regard--and \nI happen to serve on this subcommittee--have distinguished military \nrecords. The ranking member has the Medal of Honor. The chairman flew \nover the hump in China during the Second World War. He has a very \ndistinguished record. I very much appreciate working with them. They \nhave done an extraordinary job with the piece of legislation brought to \nthe floor of the Senate to fund our defense needs.\n  I visited Afghanistan during the past year or so. I have not visited \nIraq. But I happen to think what we have done, with the wonderful men \nand women who wear America's uniform, is kick the Taliban out of \nAfghanistan and free the people of Afghanistan. What we have done is to \ndrive underground--at this point--Saddam Hussein and liberate the \npeople of Iraq. It has been done by very brave, courageous, and \nwonderful young men and women, and with equipment which is funded by \nthis subcommittee.\n  I know my colleagues likely have done what I have done. They have \nvisited the site where they are producing a little airplane called the \nPredator. It is not much bigger than a little Piper Cub. It flies at \nabout the same speed. It is a little airplane without a pilot which \nsits up there for nearly a day and flies around the battlefield and \nwith a sensor can give you a vision of exactly what is on the \nbattlefield, and you have someone sitting in Florida watching a \ntelevision monitor seeing what is on the battlefield in Afghanistan or \nIraq. It is really breathtaking technology which is being used.\n  The Predator is low tech. The Global Hawk does the same at multiples \nof altitude. The Global Hawk is also an unmanned aerial vehicle that \nhas been used extensively in both theaters.\n  Those are the kinds of new technologies that are really quite \nremarkable--the technologies that are funded by this subcommittee.\n  In addition to the technology, weapons, and air assets and ground \nassets, the soldiers themselves are quite extraordinary. I appointed a \nyoung man to the United States Naval Academy, Jason Frye, from Hazen, \nND. Jason Frye was recently at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. In fact, \nSenator Inouye called Jason on Friday. He is a young marine who was in \nIraq. He had part of his arm blown off by a rocket-launched grenade. \nWhen I went to visit him at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, he was worried \nabout his unit. He wanted to be back with his unit. He wondered how his \nunit was doing in Iraq. This young man had a battlefield injury. They \nhad to use the cord from the radio in his Humvee to wrap around his arm \nas a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. He got medical attention at a \nfield hospital in Iraq.\n  What a remarkable young man. He is a symbol of all the young men and \nwomen who answered the call and have done their duty. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with them. Our hearts go out to those who have been injured \nand killed, and to their families.\n  This piece of legislation is extraordinary. It was introduced by two \nremarkable legislators. I am pleased to be a part of the subcommittee \nthat supports our national defense needs and supports the men and women \nwho serve this country.\n  The amendment which I have offered says there is kind of an illusion \ngoing on with respect to the cost of what we are doing in defense. It \nis not a deliberate illusion by anyone. It is this:\n  We are spending about $3.9 billion a month in Iraq at the moment--\nalmost $4 billion. We are spending nearly $1 billion at the moment in \nAfghanistan. Those are the costs of the ongoing activities in both \ncountries. Both of these activities are very important.\n  If we are spending about $5 billion a month--an annualized rate of \nabout $60 billion--the question is, How will all of that be funded? \nSome of it is funded in this legislation. The salaries of the soldiers \nwho would be stationed at Fort Sill, or Fort Lewis, or some other post, \nwe would be paying those salaries anyway. Now they are in Iraq. They \nare being paid in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\n  The question is, What are the extra costs in the $5 billion a month \nwe are spending to be in these two theaters, Afghanistan and Iraq?\n  The answer is, we don't know. The President likely doesn't know. The \nOMB and the DOD do not know. But the Pentagon's chief financial officer \nsaid last week they have a ``pretty good sense'' of what is going on on \nthe ground for next year. Obviously, they have some planning. My \nexpectation is we will have substantial numbers of troops on the ground \nin Iraq for some long while. It is not unlikely that we could see more \ntroops going to Afghanistan at some point. If they have a good sense of \nwhat is going on on the ground, we ought to plan for that.\n  I respect the fact that some would say we don't know what this is \ngoing to cost next year. We know the answer is not zero. My only \nconcern, as I indicated to the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, is I don't want us to be in a situation where each spring \nwe have to produce larger and larger supplemental appropriations bills. \nI would prefer we do some planning. It is certainly true, as the \nchairman pointed out, that we have been doing this for a long time, but \nnot in the theaters of Bosnia, Kosovo, and others. I understand that. \nBut these are larger numbers. We have not been confronted with $4 \nbillion a month, and then another $1 billion on top of it, or $5 \nbillion a month. We have never done this. We have never done this at a \ntime when the front pages of the newspapers say we have a Federal \nbudget deficit of $450 billion. It is a different time. We face \ndifferent circumstances.\n  My point is we know what the answer for the cost of these operations \nnext year is not. It is not zero. It is something. The question is, \nWhat? If the comptroller at the Pentagon has a pretty good sense of \nwhat is going to be on the ground in the next fiscal year, I would \nprefer we get a sense of what that is and try to plan for that and \nestimate that in our regular appropriations bill.\n  I understand the difficulty. I understand why in previous years we \nhave always said, Well, let us just wait; we will see what the Pentagon \nspends on it. We will add it up and replace it in a supplemental \nappropriations request. I think this is a different set of \ncircumstances.\n\n  I know there is disagreement in the Chamber. I think we are going to \nbe in Iraq for some long while. We have been in Agfhanistan for some \nwhile now. The troop strength has been drawn down. But I think there \nare some storm clouds over Afghanistan. I worry a great deal about what \nthe needs are going to be there and how to solidify and maintain what \nwe have achieved in Afghanistan.\n  My own feeling is we would be better served at this point as we try \nto produce a final piece of legislation on Defense appropriations if we \nwould have a supplemental amendment that says here is what we think we \nwill need in the coming fiscal year for these operations.\n  Again, if the comptroller at the Pentagon has a pretty good sense of \nwhat is going to be on the ground, they very likely have documents that \ntell them, at least, and perhaps us, what they think they will need. Is \nit accurate? I do not know. But again, I know zero is not the starting \npoint.\n  Having said that, I offered an amendment that asked the President to \nsend us in 2 weeks a budget amendment giving us the information the \nPentagon apparently has in terms of having a ``pretty good idea'' of \nwhat is going to be on the ground for the next fiscal year and tell us \nwhat those costs will be above that which already exists.\n  The chairman makes a point that money previously appropriated in a \nsupplemental is available--a $60-plus billion supplemental, $30-plus \nbillion of which was to replace money taken from previous accounts.\n  If there is money available, how much above that will be required for \nexpenditure, and do the comptroller at the Pentagon and others know \nwhat their estimate might be of what our costs will be in the coming \nfiscal year? That is what my amendment is requesting.\n  I have visited with the chairman and ranking member about my \namendment. I wanted to make the comment that I, on a general basis, \nbelieve this bill is an extraordinarily good bill. The work of the \nchairman and ranking member is, in my judgment, some of the best work \nin the Senate. I am proud to be a member of the subcommittee. I believe \nwe ought to find a way to do this differently with respect to major \ntheaters of operations in the annual spring request with respect to \nvery large and larger supplementals each year.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I strongly oppose Senator Dorgan's \namendment. The Secretary of Defense has testified that the cost for \nthis last month was $3.9 billion in Iraq and $900 million in \nAfghanistan. As was stated, we provided, in a supplemental, $62.6 \nbillion in late April. By the time it was available, it was May. And \n$30-plus billion, as the Senator said, went to pay costs that had \nalready been incurred in moving our forces to Iraq.\n  But the Senator's proposal would instruct the President to submit a \nfiscal year 2004 budget amendment for the cost of the war in Iraq. \nCongress has not and should not instruct the President to submit such \nan amendment. As a matter of fact, Congress should not instruct the \nPresident to request funds now for future contingency military \noperations. We have opposed that concept in the past. We have not done \nit, and we should not start now.\n  We only need to review the recent history of financing military \ncontingencies to know this would be a dangerous precedent. Just take \ninto account that the number of times the Congress has directed a \nPresident, any President, to submit a budget to pay for future \noperations is zero. We did not do it in Desert Storm. We did not do it \nin Somalia. We did not do it in Haiti. We did not do it in Bosnia. We \ndid not do it in Kosovo. We did not do it in Afghanistan. And we should \nnot do it now. The reason is clear: because to try to estimate \ncontingency costs in the future would lead us to creating contingency \nfunds, which could be spent in any way the Department wants them.\n  Any submission would be inaccurate because the operational situation \ncould change repeatedly during any time in the future. The Department \ndoes not know how much it might need for Iraq. They do not know what \naccounts they might need it in. That depends on the strategy that \nevolves as we deal with the situation in Iraq.\n  I personally believe the costs in Iraq are coming down. Slowly but \nsurely, they are coming down. The amendment would force the \nadministration to request a large, unspecified fund from which they \nwould transfer money to pay for whatever contingency developed. We \ndenied that. We denied that this year. The administration made such a \nrequest and we said no, we will not do that. That would only reduce \ncongressional oversight and would give the Department of Defense a \nblank check.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service to look at this matter and \ntell us how we budgeted for wars in the past. I quote from the CRS \nreport:\n\n       Presidents have not requested and Congress has not provided \n     funding for wars in advance [never]. Rather, administrations \n     have requested . . . and Congress has subsequently \n     appropriated money to meet specific, documented budget \n     requirements.\n\n  That is what the O account is for. Presidents use the O account. \nWe subsequently get their requests to add money and replace it in the \naccounts from which they have taken it. They show us what they have \nspent it for, and we go ahead and budget after the amounts have been \ndetermined.\n  In keeping with longstanding practice, the Department did supply us, \nin the President's submission, a peacetime budget for fiscal year 2004. \nThat is for the ongoing baseline programs of the Department of Defense. \nIt is not a wartime budget. As operational requirements change, we will \nsee such a budget. Funding war costs separately, and in a supplemental, \nif necessary, makes the costs visible to Congress and ensures we do not \ndistort the baseline funding.\n\n  We believe the Department will be able to define what the costs are \nwhen they determine what they are going to do. As they spend their \nmoney, they will come to us with fully explained, well justified, \nreasons for their expenditures of the moneys they have, and we will \nreplace those moneys.\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\n  I do oppose Senator Dorgan's amendment. If he is going to present it \nas it is currently before us, I will move to table it.\n  Again, let me say, as I did yesterday, Congressman Young and I did \nmeet with the President about the problem of the total amount of money \nin this bill for defense and other matters, and we took $3 billion out \nof the President's 2004 request. His budget request has been reduced by \nCongress, and this amendment would require him to submit us a \nsupplemental now to pay for costs for Iraq.\n  We have already agreed, in effect, that the money the President has \nnow, the Department of Defense has now, should fund the requirements of \nIraq until we determine what permanent relationships there will be \nthere. Hopefully, that will be done by early next year, and we will \nknow. As these account amounts decline--and I believe they will--they \nshould not average more than $2 billion a month, in my opinion, for \nthis calendar year. If that is the case, there will be money left in \nthe supplemental that has already been passed and adopted by the \nCongress and accepted by the President.\n  I believe we should follow the tradition of appropriations and handle \nmoney for defense based upon a firm understanding of what the costs \nare, not upon predictions of what the costing will be when we are at \nwar. We deal with a prediction budget in the overall concept of 2004. \nEvery year we get the President's prediction of how much money needs to \nbe spent and will be spent in the coming fiscal year, and based on that \nprediction we provide money.\n  Wartime expenses have always been treated differently. No President \nhas asked for money in advance, no President has ever received money in \nadvance for a wartime budget. They have had concepts, like the \nsupplemental we passed for 2003 to carry through in terms of the 2003 \nactions which will carry into 2004. And we will get a supplemental for \n2004 when the time comes, if that is necessary.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, listening to my chairman reminded me of \nmy days of youth. During World War II, when I was a young man, I had \nthe high honor of serving as platoon leader of 40 men. It was a small \npart of the war. But if someone had come up to me, say, my colonel, and \nsaid: How many men will you lose in the next 30 days? How many rounds \nof ammo will you use during the next 12 months? How many grenades will \nyou explode during the next 12 months?--my answer would have had to \nhave been: I don't know. There is no way of knowing how many men I will \nlose in this battle or the next battle. I have no idea how many rounds \nwe will fire or how many grenades we will throw. We will do our best to \nmaintain our force.\n  But to require any commander to come forth with even a good guess as \nto what one can anticipate--who in his right mind could have predicted \nwhat Midway would turn out to be like or the battle of Guadalcanal? No \none had any idea. We had contingency plans as to how we should cope \nwith the enemy if it came from the northern slope or the southern \nslope, but as for the outcome, we went into a battle once that lasted 5 \ndays and we thought we would come through with minimal casualties. In \nthose 5 days, we incurred 800 casualties in my little regiment, 300 \ndead--in a battle we thought we could resolve in 3 days. But we had no \nidea the opposing forces were three times our size.\n  I realize my colleagues are very eager to know what the costs of this \nwar will be. Senator Stevens and I would like to know that also because \nwe are in charge of bringing forth to this body our recommendations on \nwhat to spend. Frankly, we have no way of knowing. We can make a \ncalculated guess. We tried to do that the last time, and we did not \nsucceed. So we have called upon the administration to do their best. \nAnd when the time comes they need supplemental appropriations, we will \nconsider that, and we will inspect and just look over every account. \nKeep in mind, if it is going to be a calculated guess, we have no way \nof conducting oversight. So I hope my colleagues will be a bit more \npatient with us.\n  I realize that it may pay political dividends in some cases. But in \nthis case we are dealing with the lives of men and women. I hope that \nin dealing with the lives of men and women, we will make certain that \nwe conduct the affair in the best way possible.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we find much to agree about, as a matter \nof fact. We do not fund wartime budgets in advance because we don't \nknow what a war will cost. There is no disagreement on that score. We \ndo not have a wartime budget, and we do not have an appropriations bill \nin front of us that deals with the cost of war. We agree with that.\n  In fact, all of us know the President indicated the war in Iraq was \nover. We understand at this point we have had some difficulty restoring \norder completely and there is some violence occurring in Iraq, but most \nof our troops in Iraq are not fighting. Most of the troops in Iraq are \nengaged in some kind of peacekeeping and restoration of order.\n  The point I was trying to make is this: This country always supports \nits troops and does so very aggressively, and no one will question \nwhether that is the case. This subcommittee does that and does it \naggressively. If we find in Iraq and Afghanistan--two theaters in which \nwe have been engaged for some while--that troop strength in those areas \nremains about the same level as it has been and we are spending about \n$5 billion a month, my understanding is somewhere near the end of this \nyear we will be about out of money, and we will be taking money from \nother accounts.\n  So there will be 9 months left in the next fiscal year. If they \ncontinue to spend money at that level, we are talking about $40 or $50 \nbillion. The chairman says he expects that not to happen. I hope it \ndoes not happen. I hope we are not confronted with that choice.\n  My point is, if the Pentagon at this point understands some notion \nabout what kind of troop strength they intend to have for some long \nwhile in Iraq or Afghanistan, then we should understand how we prepare \nand plan for paying for it.\n  We now face a very large Federal budget deficit. Frankly, we don't \nhave a choice in dealing with these issues. We must pay the bill. We \ncan't commit our sons and daughters to a war, send them overseas, \nwhether they are restoring order or keeping peace or actually war \nfighting, we can't do that and say: We will not provide everything you \nneed to be successful. That is what this subcommittee has always done \nunder the leadership of the chairman and ranking member.\n  It is important for us to understand that we have a $450 billion \nestimated budget shortfall. It is growing by leaps and bounds. The \npoint I am trying to make is that we are likely to face much larger \nexpenditures in the coming 12 months to meet our military needs, and \nthey do not exist in this bill.\n  The chairman has explained properly that in the past we have never \nrequired it to be a part of this bill. He indicates it is because we \ndon't fund wars in advance. I say that we are not at this point in an \nactive war in Afghanistan or Iraq. The war is over. The columns of \nhumvees and tanks and mechanized vehicles moving into Iraq have \nstopped. Now there is a different circumstance. It is heartwrenching \nsome mornings to hear of the attacks on American troops. But most of \nwhat is happening in Iraq is the restoration of order and the \npeacekeeping. It seems to me that if we are going to be there for some \nwhile, it makes sense for us to evaluate what the Pentagon thinks. They \nare finding documents and they are talking about them. What will that \ncost? And then ask the President to submit that to us along with his \nvision of how we deal with that, how we pay for it.\n  My colleague indicated we would have to fund it. Look, this is part \nof a broad set of priorities. Yes, this has to be funded but how? What \nare the consequences of it and how and where does it come from?\n  My point is not to cause angst to the chairman and the ranking \nmember. If we are going to be involved in longer term theater \noperations that are not wartime operations but require the commitment \nof troops--140,000 troops\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nin Iraq perhaps, 20,000, 25,000 troops in Afghanistan, and that may \nincrease--if we are going to require the placement of troops in these \ntheaters for some longer period of time, if we have longer anticipated \ncosts, we ought to figure out what those are and put them in the \nregular appropriations bill. That is the point I am making. We just \nhave a disagreement about that.\n  To me, it is just about where we find ourselves in fiscal policy, \nwhat the requirements are with respect to military policy, and whether \nwe can find a way to more orderly anticipate the future costs that we \nalmost certainly know, and the Pentagon has some notion, and trying to \nrespond to those and deal with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is beautiful, the way my colleague \nfrom Hawaii remembers things that happened in his own life and puts in \nperspective what we are dealing with. I hope the Senate listens because \nthe problem that the Senator from Hawaii had as a platoon leader is \nexactly the problem the Commander in Chief has right now: How much are \nthey going to spend and where are they going to spend the money.\n  The Senator from North Dakota wants us to tell the President, submit \na budget to tell us how money will be spent, and we don't know what the \nplan is because the contingencies are so great.\n  Let me mention to you what we have just come through. We originally \nintended to send part of our forces into Iraq through Turkey. When we \nfound out we had a difficulty there because of the change in \nadministration in Turkey, we had to take those troops out, send them \nback through the canal and then come back up through the Persian Gulf \ninto Kuwait.\n  Could we have anticipated those costs? Could the President have \nsubmitted us a budget for that operation? Absolutely not.\n  One of my tasks is to handle the appropriations bills and try to \nassist in handling the funding for our executive branch and all \nbranches of the Government. But one thing continues to bother me about \nthe emphasis on the current deficit. It is big. It is going to get \nbigger. Do you know why? Our whole economy is getting bigger.\n  When I first came to Washington, I had a mortgage of about $45,000. I \nsort of choked about that. My God, how could I do that? Our income at \nthe time was $30,000 a year. I thought, this is a pretty tough thing \nbut we had to have a house for our family of seven. Now our mortgage is \n10 times that. Do you know why? My income has expanded.\n  The same thing has happened to our Nation. Our overall gross domestic \nproduct is so large that $450 billion, $500 billion is not as great as \nthe deficit was at least 3 years of the Clinton administration. \nPercentage-wise we have to start thinking about what the debt is and \nhow it relates to overall economic activity. I hope one of the joint \neconomic committees will come forth and explain this deficit to us. It \nis bad. I don't like high deficits. I don't like to owe a mortgage \neither.\n  I hope the Senate will concentrate on what we are spending and not \nwhat the size of the deficit is right now. We want to hold down \nexpenses. I think the best way to hold down expenses is to follow the \nprecedent we have followed in every war to date.\n  I am reading a book right now about the revolutionary period and how \nWashington tried to get the Continental Congress to give him money. He \nwas forced to spend money and then have them help him pay for it. We \nborrowed money around the world, particularly from France in those \ndays.\n  You talk about a deficit; my God what the Continental States must \nhave had in terms of a deficit. Somehow or other, the country survived \nbased upon faith and trust in the system.\n  The system we have followed so far is that we do not fund wars in \nadvance. I hope the Senate will defeat this amendment.\n  Does the Senator have any further time?\n  What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time on the other side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Under the previous order, that vote will occur later, \nand the order of the stacked votes will be determined by the leaders; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order has already been determined. This \namendment is first.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1268\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, is now recognized to offer an amendment on which \nthere shall be 40 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Specter, Daschle, Byrd, Leahy, Levin, \nRockefeller, Corzine, Durbin, and Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Specter, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Carper, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1268.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on the individuals being detained by the \n             United States Government as enemy combatants)\n\n       Insert after section 8123 the following:\n       Sec. 8124. (a) Report on Individuals Detained as Enemy \n     Combatants by United States Government.--Not later than 90 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a report on the individuals being \n     detained by the United States Government as enemy combatants.\n       (b) Elements.--Except as provided in subsection (c), the \n     report under subsection (a) shall set forth the following:\n       (1) The name and nationality of each individual being \n     detained by the United States Government as an enemy \n     combatant.\n       (2) With respect to each such individual--\n       (A) a statement whether the United States Government \n     intends to charge, repatriate, or release such individual; or\n       (B) if a determination has not been made whether to charge, \n     repatriate, or release such individual, a description of the \n     procedures (including the schedule) to be employed by the \n     United States Government to determine whether to charge, \n     repatriate, or release such individual.\n       (3) With respect to each such individual who the United \n     States Government intends to charge, the schedule for the \n     filing of the charges and the trial of such individual.\n       (c) Classification of Certain Individuals.--(1) If the \n     Secretary determines that the inclusion of an individual in \n     the report under subsection (a) would harm the national \n     security of the United States, the Secretary may include such \n     individual in a classified annex.\n       (2) Determinations under paragraph (1) shall be made on a \n     case-by-case basis.\n       (3) If the Secretary determines to omit one or more \n     individuals from the unclassified form of the report, the \n     Secretary shall include in the report an explanation of the \n     omission of the individual or individuals.\n       (d) Form.--The report under subsection (a) shall, to the \n     maximum extent practicable, be submitted in unclassified \n     form, but may include a classified annex.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--\n       (A) the Committees on Armed Services and the Judiciary and \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committees on Armed Services and the Judiciary and \n     the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (2) The term ``enemy combatant'' means--\n       (A) an individual held under the authority of the Military \n     Order of November 13, 2001 (Volume 66, No. 222, pages 57833-\n     57836 of the Federal Register); or\n       (B) an individual designated as an enemy combatant and held \n     under other legal authority.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I came to the floor two days ago to \nexpress my concern about the administration's detention policies with \nrespect to three different categories of\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\nindividuals, and this is particularly in the period since 9/11.\n  One of those groups I spoke about was immigrants. There, of course, \nthe concern has been underscored by the report done by the inspector \ngeneral in the Department of Justice pointing out the abuses that have \nbeen engaged in by both the Department of Justice and the FBI with \nregard to immigrants after the 9/11 tragedy.\n  Another group I spoke about were material witnesses. There have been \nseveral abuses there. In some cases, I think the FBI has acknowledged \nthat. I think, again, we have a serious issue there of adequate \nattention to civil liberties and human rights.\n  The third group I spoke about is the group designated by the \nDepartment of Defense and the President as so-called enemy combatants. \nThat is a group my amendment deals with today.\n  The amendment is very straightforward with regard to these \nindividuals. It requires a report. It says to the Department of \nDefense, the Secretary of Defense, give the appropriate committees of \nthe Congress a report within 90 days of the time this law becomes \neffective. The report shall indicate who these people are that the \nadministration has designated as enemy combatants, and it shall tell us \nwhat plans the Department has with regard to charging these individuals \nwith crimes, with regard to trying them for those crimes, and if there \nis an intention to repatriate some of these individuals to particular \ncountries, to please advise us of that, but tell us something about who \nthese individuals are and what you intend to do with them. That is the \nthrust of the amendment.\n  There is a proviso in the amendment that says if there is a national \nsecurity problem that the Department or the Secretary of Defense sees \nin giving us any of this information, of course, that doesn't need to \nbe included in the unclassified version of the report. That could be \nkept in a separate, classified annex and assigned whatever \nclassification the Secretary determines is appropriate.\n  The administration is holding 3 individuals today--that I am aware \nof--in the United States as enemy combatants and is holding close to \n700 at our military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In all cases, these \nindividuals are being called incommunicado. They are given no access to \ncounsel and no opportunity for judicial review as yet.\n  Let me say what I think should be obvious to everybody, and that is \nthat I am not advocating that these individuals be released. What I am \nsaying is that we should afford them the right to be charged with a \ncrime. Tell us what action they have taken that justifies their \nincarceration, and set up some opportunity for them to be tried for \nthose actions. Many of these enemy combatants have been in custody by \nour Government for well over 18 months--in some cases over 20 months.\n  President Bush announced recently--in the last 2 weeks--that 6 of the \n700 or so of these enemy combatants will be tried by a military \ntribunal. As far as I know, there has been no indication yet as to what \nthey will be tried for. There is no indication yet, or designation, or \nappointment of a military tribunal or commission to do the trying of \nthese individuals. There has been no date set for these trials. But the \nPresident has said that 6 of the 680 or 700 individuals are eligible--I \nbelieve that is the phrase used by the Department of Defense and the \nWhite House--to be tried by military tribunals.\n\n  There are serious questions about how those tribunals will function, \nand I am sure there will be many debates about that. Even more serious \nis a question relating to those who remain in jail, who have not--as \nyet at least--been given any indication of charges, any indication of \nwhen trials might be conducted in relation to them.\n  The obvious question we need to be asking--we in the Congress--since \nwe have an oversight responsibility over the administration, the \nexecutive branch, is, Where does the Government or this administration \nintend to go with regard to these individuals?\n  So far, the administration takes the position that once the President \nsays someone is an enemy combatant, they can keep them incarcerated, \npresumably until the war on terrorism is over. But the President has \nsaid--and I think he is probably right--this war on terrorism is of \nindefinite duration; it is not a war that we can see the end of--at \nleast not in the near future. It appears to be the President's view and \nthe administration's view that these individuals can be kept as \nprisoners from now on, without the administration having an obligation \nto say who they are, without the administration having an obligation to \ncharge them with a crime, without the administration having any \nobligation to afford them a hearing.\n  The administration takes the view that they do not come under the \nGeneva Convention, but evidently they come under none of the other \nprocedural requirements that we have always thought applied in our \nsystem either.\n  In my view, this is not a tenable position. It is not consistent with \nthe commitment to liberty and the rule of law on which this country was \nfounded. We demand that other governments show greater respect for \nhuman rights than this, and we should be demanding better from our own \nGovernment as well.\n  The amendment is very straightforward and very modest, in my view. It \nsimply says that the Secretary of Defense shall provide us with a \nreport on the status of these detainees--provide that to the relevant \ncommittees of the Congress. Under the amendment, the report should \ninclude the name and nationality of the individuals involved, a \nstatement as to whether our Government intends to charge them with some \noffense, or intends to repatriate them, or intends to release them--\nwhatever action we intend to engage in.\n  There is nothing in the amendment that biases what is done with these \nindividuals in any way. In the case of the individuals for whom such a \ndetermination has not been made, we ask for a description of the \nprocess the Department of Defense is intending to follow and the \ntimeline for actually making a decision regarding these individuals.\n  Madam President, I believe strongly that we have an obligation to \nrequire some accountability with regard to this set of individuals.\n  We have made provision in the amendment, as I said before, so that \nthe Secretary can withhold any information from any report he deems to \nbe information necessary to withhold for national security reasons.\n  The administration, in my view, needs to take some action and needs \nto advise the Congress on what it is doing with these people. If the \nindividuals have committed crimes, let's see them charged with crimes. \nIf they have not committed crimes, let's see them repatriated. Let's \nsee some action taken. We in Congress need to understand what that \naction is. That is the thrust of the amendment. I hope it will receive \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  I appreciate Senator Specter cosponsoring the amendment, as well as \nthe other Members I mentioned. I believe there is at least one other \nMember who wishes to speak in behalf of the amendment. So I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman, has an amendment which would require the Department of \nDefense to share with the relevant congressional committees information \nabout those who are being held as enemy combatants. I am pleased to \ncosponsor this amendment.\n  The amendment safeguards any national security concerns by \nauthorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide this information in \nclassified form where national security requires it. It is a cautious \namendment. It does not force the administration to change the way it \ndesignates or treats enemy combatants, but merely secures the ability \nof Congress to carry out the oversight that our laws, our Constitution, \nour traditions, and our practice require us to do.\n  Although the cases involving enemy combatants detained within the \nU.S. have been well publicized, we know very little about those who are \nbeing detained in Guantanamo Bay. Because they are held outside U.S. \nterritory, the courts have found they do not have the power to review \ntheir detention. I do not doubt some of these detainees are dangerous \nindividuals who wish the United States harm, but doubts have been \nraised on behalf of some of these detainees, and I think the Congress \nshould have the information necessary to make judgments about this \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\n  I hope this amendment will be adopted. It will make the Department of \nDefense to make decisions more quickly as to whether to charge many of \nthe individuals it is currently holding. No one advocates haste that \nwill compromise ongoing intelligence gathering or hurt our national \nsecurity, but at the same time, the United States cannot be in the \nposition of indefinitely detaining individuals without charging them \nwith any wrongdoing. That is inconsistent with United States traditions \nand will continue to cause us difficulty in our relations with the \nnations of citizens who are being held, ranging from Pakistan to Great \nBritain. It also puts us in a difficult situation when we tell other \ncountries not to do what we are doing.\n  Indeed, according to the New York Times, the President's decision to \ncertify two British nationals for trial before a military tribunal \ncreated friction between our two nations, as Prime Minister Blair \narrives to address a joint meeting of Congress tomorrow.\n  Let me be clear, this amendment does not require any enemy combatant \nto be charged, let alone released, but it does ask the Secretary of \nDefense to explain where the investigatory process stands in the case \nof each detainee.\n  Finally, I hope this amendment will encourage the administration to \nmake decisions about what charges he intends to bring, if any, against \nJose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi, U.S. citizens currently being held \nindefinitely without charge in the United States. Their detentions have \nraised grave legal questions, and it is deeply discomforting to see in \nthis case American citizens held indefinitely, in a legal twilight \nzone, without access to counsel or those protections to which we \nbelieve U.S. citizens are generally entitled, and also those \nprotections that we preach to the rest of the world we uphold and we \nask them to uphold when one of our citizens is being detained in their \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, soon after the war in Afghanistan \nstarted, I joined with others to go with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \nto Guantanamo Bay to assure ourselves that the Department of Defense is \ncomplying and will comply with provisions of the Geneva Convention with \nregard to the treatment of prisoners who are held at Guantanamo Bay and \nother places arising from that war.\n  It is my understanding the individuals who are detained are those who \nhave participated in the battles in Afghanistan against our soldiers, \nand those who are, at the request of the Department of Justice, held \nfor suspected terrorist activities in the United States in the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  The Department of Defense does not have control over these personnel. \nI believe they are really under the jurisdiction of the Department of \nJustice. I do not intend to make any kind of point of order based on \nlegislation. I think we should just face this directly.\n  I think the concept of Senator Bingaman's amendment is directly \ncontrary to what we should be doing with regard to activities of people \nwho have conducted themselves as enemies of the United States in war \nand those who are involved in the terrorist activities as part of the \nterrorist war against the United States.\n  Placing a requirement that we disclose and give a schedule as \nrequired by this Bingaman amendment is totally contrary to the best \ninterests of the United States. It would place an unwarranted pressure \non the administration to decide on charging and prosecuting enemy \ncombatants prior to completion of intelligence and law enforcement \nanalysis.\n  These people in Guantanamo Bay were held incommunicado from one \nanother. One of the reasons was the concept of the knowledge of who \nelse was detained might deter one of these people from giving us the \ninformation we needed to find the leaders in the war on terrorism \nagainst the United States.\n  The process of investigation is a very long and tedious one. These \npeople use different languages. We found they are using names and \ndeclaring they are from countries that are totally untrue. The real \nproblem is how to deal with these people in a way to end the war in \nAfghanistan and to end the war on terrorism.\n  It is the executive branch's authority and responsibility to conduct \nthe global war on terrorism. It is the executive branch's \nresponsibility to conduct the war in Afghanistan. For Congress to \nimpose a restriction on the activities that are consistent with \nprecedent and consistent with the manner in which similar people have \nbeen detained over the years when we have been involved in war, such as \nWorld War II, and the Germans came to our shores and the spies who were \nintercepted throughout the world--they were held in the combatant \nstatus. These people are in combatant status and, as such, their \ntreatment is subject to the Geneva Convention.\n  Only this basic law would impose conditions upon the right of the \nadministration and the Departments of the executive branch to fully \nexploit the intelligence and investigative capabilities of the \ndetention in a combatant status in order to deal with these two \nterrible scourges we face right now.\n  Unfortunately, the war in Afghanistan seems to be taking unfortunate \nturns lately, and I hope we can meet that situation. We meet it through \ninformation that we gather from some of these people. I am reliably \ninformed that some of these people, in the way they have been treated, \nhave divulged information to us that has led to the capture and \ndetention of others in a similar capacity as having been enemies of the \nUnited States.\n  In short, I think it would be highly inadvisable to adopt the \nBingaman amendment, and it would have a negative impact on both the war \non terrorism and the conduct of wartime operations in Afghanistan.\n  There are cases pending in the courts now that this amendment, I \nunderstand, would terminate because there are people who, through civil \nrights cases, filed to determine the court's opinion as to the ``combat \nstatus'' designation, and I do not think we should take action now as a \nCongress to interrupt that process.\n  Madam President, does Senator Inouye wish to comment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the committee has been advised, No. 1, \nthat the procedure and process employed in Guantanamo and other places \nof detention meet the requirements set forth by the Geneva Convention.\n  No. 2, the matter is being represented by counsel and presently in \ncourt. As our chairman indicated, it would not be appropriate for this \ncommittee to be intervening while a court case is pending.\n  No. 3, I think we should keep in mind that this is not a war. This is \nan experience that this Nation has not had in its past history. This is \na war on terrorism. It is not the uniformed enemy to which we are \nalways accustomed where we know who their commanders are, we know where \nthey are coming from, they wear a different type of uniform. In this \nwar, we have no idea who the terrorists are. It could be this young \nlady here, for all I know.\n  Having said that, if we follow provisions of this amendment and the \nDefense Department and the Department of Justice are required to give \nout the names, the rank, the charges, et cetera, and to give an \nindication as to when one can expect this prisoner to be released, I \nthink we may be working right into the hands of the organization we are \ntrying to combat: al-Qaida.\n  If I were in charge of the al-Qaida operations, I would like to know \nwhat is happening to those below me. And if I new Mr. One is coming out \nnext August or Mr. Two is coming out in September, I can make plans \naccordingly.\n  As I pointed out, this is a war that none of us have experienced in \nthe past. The chairman and I could speak of World War II and the Hump, \nthe Japanese, the Germans, the camps and such.\n  On this matter, we have never experienced anything like this. So I \nhope as long as Guantanamo is open to inspection--and the chairman and \nI have gone there. It has been always open to Members of Congress if \nthey wish to go there for themselves to look over the conditions, to \ntaste their food, and in fact talk to them to see if they are being \ntortured, as some would suggest. I think my colleagues will find that \nas Americans we have treated our detainees in an humane fashion.\n  Now, no one would want to be detained even for an hour, but in this\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nwartime condition and terrorist condition I think there is a necessity. \nWe have done our duty in a way that Americans need not be embarrassed \nand ashamed. So I hope my colleagues will not look favorably upon this \namendment and wait for another day.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam President, I will respond to a few of the points my colleagues \nfrom Alaska and Hawaii made. First, I will say what this amendment does \nnot do. There is nothing in this amendment that restricts what action \nthe Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, or any other \nagency of the Government is permitted to take with regard to these \nenemy combatants. This is an amendment that asks for a report. It does \nnot say certain action has to be taken with regard to these \nindividuals. It says tell us the status.\n  Second, there is nothing in this amendment that affects court cases. \nIf there are court cases related to any of these enemy combatants, then \nit is perfectly appropriate for the Justice Department to indicate who \nthe person is or which individuals are involved and say they are \nsubject to pending litigation, if that is the case. But the reality is, \nif one is designated an enemy combatant, they are taken out of the \ncourt system. That designation takes one out of the court system and \nputs them in the custody of the military. It is the position of our \nmilitary that from that point on, one has no right to a hearing, no \nright to be charged, is an enemy combatant, and accordingly they will \ndeal with them as they choose.\n  The Senator from Alaska says this is something that is probably in \nthe jurisdiction of the Department of Justice. I think that sort of \nmakes my case. These people are in nowhere land. They are in limbo.\n  There is an article that came out in the morning paper in my home \nState in Albuquerque where there was a little report on the speech I \ngave 2 days ago talking about this problem, and I will read a sentence \nfrom that report: White House spokesman Taylor Gross referred questions \nabout Bingaman's speech and proposed amendment to the Justice and \nDefense Departments. A Justice Department spokeswoman referred \nquestions to the Defense Department. A spokesman for the Defense \nDepartment declined to comment.\n\n  The reality is, we are allowing the administration to put these \npeople in a category and then take the position that no rights apply to \nthese individuals. There is no obligation on the Department of Justice \nto follow procedures with regard to these individuals. There is no \nobligation on the Department of Defense.\n  There is nothing in my amendment that questions the treatment of \nthese individuals. Others have questioned the treatment of these \nindividuals. I have not questioned the treatment of these individuals \nin Guantanamo. There is nothing in the amendment that questions the \ntreatment of these individuals.\n  Also, the point my good friend from Hawaii has made, that this would \ngive al-Qaida or some other terrorist organization information that \ncould be useful to them about when individuals might be released, \nfirst, we have a proviso that anything the Department of Defense \ndetermines might be contrary to national security, they should keep it \nclassified. They can give it any level of classification they want to \ngive it. If they want to say it is code level classification, they can \ndo that, whatever classification they think is appropriate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I ask the \nSenator from New Mexico--he has made the point it is still up to the \nadministration to decide which names and identities will remain \nclassified and not publicly disclosed. If there is any concern about \nnational security and the threat of terrorism, as I understand this \namendment, the Senator makes a clear exception so the administration \nhas the last word in terms of this disclosure; is that not true?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to that question, let me \nsay that is exactly right. We have gone out of our way to make it clear \nthe Departments can keep secret, can keep code classification, whatever \nclassification level the Department decides is appropriate, any \ninformation they think is vital to our national security. So we are \nsaying, as to the information that is not of that type, tell us what \ncan be told about who these people are and what the intent is as far as \nwhat to do with them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from New Mexico, through the Chair, if \nhe would yield for one additional question. Is it not true historically \nthat when we are in the midst of a national security challenge or \ncrisis, and questions of civil liberties arise, that many times we do \nnot want to face them head on; that it is not until later in history \nthat we look back and say we should have asked harder questions, \nquestions about the suspension of civil liberties in wartime, questions \nabout internment camps, questions about policies that we followed?\n  If I understand what the Senator is seeking in this amendment, it is \nto say at this point in time what we are asking for is a disclosure of \nthose people who have been detained and arrested and are in special \nstatus, whose rights at least may be compromised because of our concern \nabout national security; and that disclosure is all that this amendment \nis about, giving the administration the last word and determination as \nto which names might be held back and not disclosed because of security \nconcerns.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to that follow-on \nquestion, that is exactly correct. The Senator from Illinois is exactly \nright in pointing out that in what we are trying to do, we are not--\nthis is not an amendment I am offering 6 weeks after the 9/11 tragedy. \nThis is an amendment I am offering 20 months or more after the 9/11 \ntragedy. We know that many of these individuals have been there well \nover a year and a half. It is time that we in Congress exercise our \noversight responsibility and say: Who are they? What are they intending \nto be charged with? I do not anticipate that these are individuals we \nare going to some day say we have decided to release. I assume that we \nhave them there for good reason, and that we are going to prosecute \nthem and that we are going to find them guilty. That is my assumption, \nassuming the system works as it is intended to work.\n  So my thought is, let's get some idea of where we are going so that \nwe begin to build in some accountability and begin to recognize what we \nhistorically have recognized, and that is that there are certain legal \nprotections that apply if one is jailed by the United States \nGovernment. There are certain legal rights that we will be afforded.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from New Mexico if--I do not know how \nmuch time he has remaining, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask the Senator from New Mexico this question: \nWhat is at issue in his amendment, if I am not mistaken, is whether we \nare going to afford any form of due process to these detainees. Is it \nnot also true that we have to look beyond these detainees to how we as \nAmericans would be treated in other countries, whether we are \nestablishing a standard which we could live by?\n  In other words, I am asking the Senator from New Mexico if we believe \nthat we can detain individuals, without disclosure of who they are, and \nthe circumstances of their detention, does that not invite the same \nconduct against Americans or service men and women overseas and give \nthe United States little or no room to complain?\n  I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he is not asking for us to stand \nup for some basic elements of due process which we would ask to be \nafforded to Americans in similar situations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to the question, I think the Senator from \nIllinois makes a very good point. If we are going to proclaim our \ncommitment to liberty and to freedom as we always have, and as I \ncertainly want to be able to do, and if we are going to insist that \nU.S. citizens, when they are captured\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\nin overseas incidents, whether they be military or civilian, that they \nbe given some reasonable treatment through the court systems of those \ncountries, then we have to have some adherence to reasonable legal \nprocess for these individuals that we have incarcerated. That is all I \nam asking. Tell us what we are going to do. If they come back and say \nwe are not going to do anything, then we can see whether a follow-on \namendment or follow-on action is appropriate.\n\n  This amendment simply says, give us a report. Tell us the status of \nthese individuals; tell us your plans with regard to these individuals; \nor give us some idea whether or not you are going to charge them. If \nyou are going to charge them with something, tell us what you might \ncharge them with. If you decide to make that decision later on, tell us \nwhen you might decide to make that decision.\n  It is the most modest of amendments. I hope very much it will be \nsupported by my colleagues on a bipartisan basis.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 53 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I retain that and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, for the information of the Senate, the \nIntelligence Committee has access to information about enemy combatants \nwho are being detained, including names the Red Cross is fully engaged \nwith in the continuing meaningful access to detainees.\n  This Congress was briefed about the creation of the military \ntribunals and the handling of detainees. The tribunals were created by \nExecutive order. That was published in the Federal Register. It has \nbeen a matter of public record for some time.\n  Any detainees brought before military tribunals have full access to \nmilitary and, at their request, civilian counsel. We are talking now \nabout the requirement to publish, to release these names. By the way, \nthey have been released, in effect, in classified form, but with the \nintervention of our Intelligence Committee, which is the oversight \ncommittee for this body in regard to information such as this.\n  I cannot believe we would be faced on an appropriations bill with a \nmatter of this kind. It does not get into money, but it does deal with \nsomething the Department of Defense has connection with. It is relevant \nand therefore we must deal with it.\n  However, the broad release of the names of these individuals, even in \nclassified form, could compromise our ability to access information \nwhich could prevent more terrorist attacks, could prevent more attacks \non our military in Afghanistan. This is a military problem in that \nsense. That is why the Department of Defense is involved. It is the \nDepartment of Justice's sense in terms of deciding how they are \nprosecuted. If they are prosecuted in civilian courts is another \nmatter. Then they would be fully accounted for in the public sector. If \nthe prosecutor in the tribunals--the tribunals themselves can be \nclosed, if that is the decision. The person would still have the right \nto counsel and a right to be tried before the tribunal, but we would \nnot necessarily have public access to that trial because of the \ninformation involved.\n  If people want to go to Guantanamo and know who is there, go there. \nWe went there. I don't understand why we should take this action now.\n  By the way, the Senator is not quite correct; it not only says the \nnames and the nationality but also whether they are to be charged, \nrepatriated, a statement of what procedure is going to be followed to \ndetermine whether they are charged or repatriated. That is intelligence \ninformation. And with respect to such individuals in the United States, \nintention to charge, a schedule for the filing of the charge and the \ndate for the trial. If it is a military tribunal, it could well be \nclassified. To require the determination now of what would be done--it \nis true there is an exclusion here; the Secretary can omit. But if he \nomitted one or more individuals, then he would include in the report an \nexplanation of the mission of the individual or individuals. It could \ninclude a classified index. If it could include a classified index, why \nshould it be published? We do not publish a classified index.\n\n  The term ``enemy combatant'' means an individual held under the \nauthority of military order of November 13, 2001, as published in the \nFederal Register, or an individual designated as an enemy combatant and \nheld under other legal authorities. In both instances, they have \nquality access to courts that protect their rights. Other people are \npursuing those cases.\n  The interrogation process of people like this is ongoing and very \ntimely. It does not lend itself to detailed plans, firm dates, and firm \nschedules. We saw some of that when we were in Guantanamo, but the \ninterrogation efforts in many ways require somehow to get through to an \nindividual who has lied to us about who the person is, where they are \nfrom, and refused to give any data at all concerning their own \nbackground. They were captured under wartime conditions.\n  This amendment is an attempt to poke Congress' nose under a tent, \nthat we belong only if we are in an unclassified area. That is what the \nIntelligence Committee has already done. I am reliably informed the \nIntelligence Committee has access to information about these enemy \ncombatants in detention, including their names. If they started \nreleasing the names of these individuals, even in classified form, it \ncould compromise sources and methods of their acquisition and \ncompromise the possibility of gaining information on them that might \nprevent further terrorist activities.\n  If the Senator wishes further time, I will be glad to not yield back \nmy time but I intend to yield back the time and move to table.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the courtesy. I will use my remaining 50 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, first of all, if the Secretary of \nDefense believes the release of any of these names compromises our \nnational security, he is given full reign to keep that information \nclassified at any level of classification he decides is appropriate. So \nwe are not in any way interfering with national security.\n  In my view, it is not appropriate for us to say, look, if you want to \ncheck on them, get on a plane and go down to Guantanamo. We and the \nAmerican people need to be persuaded there is some adequate due process \nand legal process being followed.\n  Regarding the idea of these military tribunals, there have been no \ntribunals established. The President said 6 individuals out of the \nnearly 700 are eligible to be considered or to be tried by military \ntribunals. There are no military tribunals established.\n  I urge support for the amendment and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Before that, I ask unanimous consent that the second and third votes \nin this stack of three votes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the remainder of my time, I move to table \nthe Senator's amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The first vote will be on tabling the Dorgan amendment; \nthe second vote will be on the Bingaman amendment; and the third vote \nwill be on Burma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1264\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes evenly divided prior to a vote on the motion to table the \nDorgan amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There are 2 minutes equally divided before a vote on \neach amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since Senator Dorgan is not here, I will claim 1 minute. \nI ask unanimous consent I be recognized for 1 minute to close this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As cosponsor of this amendment, what we are setting out \nto do is to ask the administration for the\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\ncosts of the Iraqi war. That is not included in this Defense bill. We \nare living on money appropriated in the supplemental appropriation that \nwe know will run out before the next fiscal year ends, so we are \nleveraging from one supplemental appropriation to the next.\n  This war, in fact, is costing in the realm of $4 billion a month and \nthe Afghanistan war another $1 billion a month. We are asking the \nPresident to disclose the cost of this war, to give us an idea for the \nAmerican taxpayers and for Congress of the financial responsibility we \nhave undertaken.\n  I support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we fund peacetime budgets in advance. \nCongress has never agreed to fund wartime expenses in advance. Instead, \nwe have always, in every instance, as stated by the Congressional \nResearch Service, funded them after those costs have been incurred and \nwith the President's request for the payment. Presidents take the money \nfrom existing funds and we replace those funds, rather than having \nbudgets determined in advance.\n  As the Senator from Hawaii so vividly pointed out, it is impossible \nto know what the costs will be in fighting a war in advance. That is \nwhat this amendment urges, and that is why I moved to table that, and I \nurge the support of the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, there \nare now 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to \ntable the Bingaman amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment \nwhich just requires a report from the Secretary of Defense on those \npeople we are incarcerating under the status of ``enemy combatant'' and \nwhat our intentions are with regard to charging them or making a \ndecision on charging them.\n  We have a proviso in there that if the release of any of this \ninformation will jeopardize national security, the Secretary can \nwithhold that and put it in a classified annex and give it any level of \nclassification the Secretary determines is appropriate.\n  So it seems to me essential that the Congress exercise some oversight \nof this process. If we are going to be a nation that stands for liberty \nand freedom and legal process, then we ought to ensure that everyone \nwho has been taken into custody in our country be afforded some legal \nprotection. There are no military tribunals that have been established. \nThe problem is not resolved. We should ask for this report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, these people are being held consistent \nwith the Geneva Convention. The Intelligence Committee of the Senate \nhas access to names and information concerning those who are detained.\n  The Red Cross is fully engaged and has meaningful access to the \ndetainees. We need to have the interrogation process continue so that \nwe can see if we can get information from these people that might lead \nto us having the ability to prevent further terrorist attacks against \nthe United States.\n  They are enemy combatants. There is fully published, in the Federal \nRegister, the procedure under which they will be handled. This \namendment, as a matter of law, forces the disclosure and a plan of when \nthey are to be released. It is contrary to the best interests of \nnational security, in my opinion. I made a motion to table and I urge \nits support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question now occurs on agreeing to the motion to table amendment \nNo. 1268.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . IN RECOGNITION OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE'S \n                   CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND \n                   EXPRESSING STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE SENATE'S \n                   PREVIOUS BIPARTISAN VOTE TO PROVIDE THESE \n                   FORCES ACCESS TO TRICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forces in the U.S. National Guard and Reserve have made \n     and continue to make essential and effective contributions to \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom and other ongoing military \n     operations;\n       (2) More than 200,000 reserve personnel from the Army, \n     Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are currently \n     serving their nation on active status;\n       (3) Our dependence on the National Guard and Reserve has \n     increased dramatically over the course of the past decade. \n     Annual duty days have grown from about 1 million in the late \n     1980s to more than 12 million in every year since 1996;\n       (4) While our dependence on the reserves has increased in \n     the post-Cold War era, their basic pay and benefits structure \n     has remained largely unchanged;\n       (5) Offering TRICARE to reservists for an affordable \n     monthly premium enhances our national security by improving \n     their medical readiness when called to duty, streamlining and \n     accelerating the mobilization process, and enhancing our \n     military's ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel \n     to reserve duty;\n       (6) The Congressional Budget Office, the official, non-\n     partisan scorekeeper of all congressional legislation, has \n     estimated the cost of this proposal at just over one-tenth of \n     one percent of the Administration's FY2004 defense budget \n     request;\n       (7) On May 20, 2003, a strong majority of Senate Democrats \n     and Republicans joined together and voted 85-10 for an \n     amendment to the FY2004 Defense Authorization bill to provide \n     reserve personnel and their families access to TRICARE \n     regardless of their current deployment status; and\n       (8) The Appropriations Committee indicated in its report \n     accompanying the FY2004 Defense Appropriations bill that it \n     supports this proposal.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) The National Guard and Reserve play a critical and \n     increasingly demanding role in protecting our national \n     security, and\n       (2) The Senate supports the Appropriations Committee \n     position as articulated in the report accompanying the FY2004 \n     Defense Appropriations bill and affirms its support for \n     providing Guard and Reserve personnel access to TRICARE.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have received word of four more \nreservists killed in Iraq and Kuwait over the past week. They are the \n18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st reservists who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and numerous others have been \nwounded.\n  Four other reservists have died this year in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  Their deaths offer a stark reminder of how our military functions \ntoday. A National Guard or Reserve member is more likely to serve on \nactive duty than at any other time in our nation's history. In fact, \nreservists have been called to support every military operation since \nOperation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, whether it was peacekeeping in \nthe Balkans, defending our Nation's airspace after the September 11th \nattacks, or neutralizing the Baathist regime in Iraq.\n  These troops work hard to stay prepared for the time when their \nNation calls, and they are eager to prove themselves when summoned to \nactive duty. Nonetheless, we have been demanding more and more of them, \nand it's time that we as a Nation considered what we can give back.\n  For that reason, a bipartisan group of us introduced legislation \nearlier this year to allow reservists to pay a premium and receive \ncoverage from TRICARE, the military health program. I joined with the \nSenator, from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, Senator Clinton, Senator \nLeahy and Senator DeWine, to press for inclusion of a similar proposal \nin the Fiscal Year 2004 Defense Authorization bill. The outcome was a \nstrong, bipartisan vote, 85-10, in favor of allowing reservists to buy \ninto TRICARE.\n  Today, we are asking the Senate to underscore our resolve to move \nforward on this issue. We are asking our fellow Senators to join in \naffirming the importance of the reserves to our national security and \nthe necessity of a new TRICARE benefit to keep this force intact and \nimprove its readiness.\n  Some have argued that we would diminish the value of active-duty \nservice by providing the same health benefit to part-time soldiers. In \nfact, we are requiring reservists to pay for a benefit that comes at no \ncharge to active-duty troops and their families.\n  Other have said we would be undermining recruiting and retention and\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\nquality of life programs. This argument fails the laugh test, as any \nGuard and Reserve recruiting officer will tell you.\n  Still others say this is too costly. But when we rely so heavily on \nthe Guard and Reserve to protect our national security, I question \nwhether we can afford not to provide this benefit. CBO says the price \ntag would come to just over one-tenth of one percent of the President's \nproposed Fiscal Year 2004 defense budget. In return, we will take a \nmajor step toward ensuring the integrity of this force, by improving \nits medical readiness when called to active duty, by streamlining and \naccelerating the mobilization process, and by enhancing our military's \nability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to reserve duty.\n  Today, 40 percent of our reservists between the ages of 19-35--and \nthat represents a pretty broad spectrum of reservists on active duty \ntoday--are uninsured. It is in our national security interest to make \nsure they have health insurance and do not have to go for long periods \nof time without being able to see a doctor or provide for the most \nbasic health needs of themselves or their families.\n  Today, more than 200,000 reservists are on active duty, having left \nbehind families, careers, and their everyday lives to serve their \nNation. Some may never come home. Our military relies on this force to \nprotect our borders, our national interest, and our people.\n  I think it is important once again the Senate go on record and send \nas clear a message as we can that we are not going to rest and we are \nnot going to quit until they have the access they deserve to the health \ncare program they so badly need.\n  At this time, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I would like to speak, if possible.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wouldn't be calling for the vote at this point. I am \njust asking for the yeas and nays and for a vote later on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Madam President, I thank Senator \nDaschle for the great help he has been and for his partnership on this \npiece of legislation. I associate myself with his remarks about the \nTRICARE program being extended to family members of the Guard and \nReserve.\n  During the last Desert Shield-Desert Storm conflict, I was in the Air \nNational Guard unit that was called up to active duty. Planes, pilots, \nand crews went over and did a magnificent job. I was in a support role \nas a military lawyer. I was called to active duty--along with doctors \nand other folks--to take care of families who were left behind by \nproviding legal services.\n  When a family member is deployed in the Guard and Reserve, more \nlikely than not the military pay will be smaller than the civilian pay. \nThe Soldiers and Sailors Civil Leave Act allows a renegotiation of \nloans and a restructuring of debt so the military pay can cover family \nexpenses. You are not successful all the time. I spent hours \nnegotiating new loans, house payments, and car payments so the military \npay would cover the family expenses. But one thing that we haven't \naddressed is health care.\n  As Senator Daschle indicated, there are many members without health \ncare. But for those who have health care, once they are activated, the \nphysician network that your family is used to is replaced by the \nmilitary.\n  In the case of our unit--Swamp Fox Unit in the South Carolina Air \nNational Guard that I served in from 1991 to the present--they have \nbeen deployed six times. That is not unusual. You have families \nbouncing from one health care network to the other.\n  We are trying to make sure that continuity of health care is \navailable to Guard and Reserve families by allowing them, in addition \nto their membership in the Guard and Reserve, access to the TRICARE \nmilitary health care system when they are in their civilian capacity as \nwell as when they are activated. So when they are activated, there is \nno major upheaval in their lives when it comes to health care. They \nwill have a safety net.\n  You can't be everything to everybody. But they are having to pay a \npremium that is fair to them, helps reduce the cost of the bill similar \nto what retirees pay.\n  It is important to me to put this on the table, and do it in a way so \nwe can afford it. I think the premium helps offset the cost.\n  I am here to report that I have talked with the administration and \nthe Pentagon which have concerns about implementing this program now \nbecause we haven't budgeted for it in this budget cycle. We are going \nto compromise on the Defense authorization bill and initiate a study of \nthe best way to provide TRICARE coverage to Guard and Reserve members \nin terms of cost, affordability, and availability. We will have that \nstudy. Next year, Senator Daschle and all of the others who have worked \nwith us have my solemn promise we are going to go after the money \nnecessary to fund this program.\n  The proposal we are speaking about today has a statement in it that \nthey are willing to help fund this if we can find the money. This \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution is important in the sense that we are \nletting our Guard and Reserve families know we haven't forgotten about \nthem and that we are trying to do this in an affordable and efficient \nway by studying it for a year. But help is going to be on the way.\n  The recruiting and retention problems that we suffer in the Guard and \nReserve we haven't yet begun to understand. You have some Guard and \nReserve units that are indispensable to the war-fighting machine that \nwe have created and which is so effective. Their employers have \nsuffered greatly because they are gone from their work stations in the \ncivilian community a lot. Employers have been paying the difference \nbetween the military pay and the civilian pay in many instances.\n  We are going to work in a bipartisan fashion to have a tax credit. \nThe retirement age is 60. On active duty, you can retire after 20 years \nof service. As a Guard or Reserve member, I am 5 years away. I have to \nget 5 good years somehow so I can get my retirement. I am not worried \nabout me. But we have a proposal that for every 2 years you stay on to \nhelp your country, we will allow you to retire early. That is not part \nof the package we are talking about in TRICARE but it will be part of a \npackage to upgrade Guard and Reserve benefits. The total cost for all \nthree--health care, reduced retirement, and tax credits--is in the $15 \nbillion range over 5 years. That is a lot of money. But I agree with \nSenator Daschle, we can't afford not to do it.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to look at this closely and support this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution so we can sit down with the \nadministration next year in good faith--they have been very good about \ndealing with this issue in a responsible way this year--and come up \nwith the money and get a commitment from the administration, the \nPentagon, the House, and the Senate to fund this program.\n  If we improve the benefit package, not only are we doing what we \nshould do to help our Guard and Reserve families, which they will \nappreciate, but we will have a better chance of retaining these great \nAmericans because we are asking so much of them. It is time for us to \ndeliver a better benefit package because they have really delivered for \nthis country.\n  I appreciate working with Senator Daschle, and the administration has \nbeen very good to work with. This time next year I hope we can take the \nfloor and tell the Reserve and Guard families of this country that they \nhave a benefit package that shows how much we respect and care for \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his great effort on this amendment and for his \ngenerous words. He speaks from experience--first, as a member of the \nGuard but then also as a member of the Armed Services Committee. I \nappreciate the work he has done in getting us to a point where we have \na commitment from the administration that they will work with us. I \nhope we don't have to wait a year. But I recognize reality. I believe \nit is important to get a commitment regardless of how long it takes.\n  The message we want to send today with this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is that there is strong bipartisan\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\nsupport for the concept that we ought to be able to allow the Guard and \nReserve to access TRICARE as soon as possible so that in the very \nsituation the Senator from South Carolina has noted--this recognition \nthat they may be called to active duty not once but several times as \nthey go in and out of their role as active guardsmen--they have the \ntime to transition with the coverage and the peace of mind required as \nthey commit themselves once again to their country.\n  I hope we can get a strong bipartisan vote. I hope we recognize that, \nwhile this is not inexpensive, we estimate that one-tenth of 1 percent \nof the overall cost of the defense budget is a price worth paying for \nthe commitment and the message that we send about our recognition of \nthe important role the Guard and Reserve play today as they serve in \nIraq and around the world.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle-\nGraham amendment. This amendment expresses the strong sense of Congress \nthat members of the Guard and Reserve should be made eligible for the \nTRICARE health insurance program.\n  I am the co-chair of the Senate's National Guard Caucus, and I have \nwatched closely as over 200,000 members of the Guard and the Reserves \nhave been called to duty for the war in Iraq. Our reservists have \ndistinguished themselves in every respect, underscoring that our \nNation's defense rests--as it has been since our founding--on our \ncitizen soldiers.\n  We have a responsibility to ensure that this force is as effective as \npossible. Yet a recent GAO report indicated that almost 20 percent of \nour reserves do not have access to adequate health insurance. This \nmeans that we are deploying men and women to fight when they are not as \nhealthy as possible.\n  This resolution makes the strong statement in support of a cost-share \nprogram that ensures that reservists and their families have coverage. \nIt puts the body's weight behind the strong report language in this \nbill and follows on the Senate's 85 to 10 vote during our consideration \nof the Defense authorization bill in favor of this innovative cost-\nshare program.\n  The defense conferees are currently reviewing this provision, based \non legislation I crafted along with Senators DeWine, Daschle, and \nSmith, and a strong vote today would send a signal that a final bill \nshould include health insurance eligibility.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote again to support this effort.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1271\n\n        (Purpose: To require reports on U.S. Operations in Iraq)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have been working on an amendment that \nI trust would get support from both sides of the aisle, and I would \nlike, at this time, to send this amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that the previous amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1271.\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . REPORTS ON IRAQ\n\n       Not less than once every 30 days, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit a report to the congressional defense \n     committees, the House International Relations Committee, and \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee that contains the \n     following information:\n       (a) Total and monthly costs of U.S. operations in Iraq,\n       (b) Number of U.S. military personnel serving in Iraq and \n     the immediate region.\n       (c) Total and monthly contributions made by foreign \n     governments and international organizations in support of \n     U.S. operations in Iraq.\n       (d) Number of foreign military personnel serving in support \n     of U.S. operations in Iraq,\n       (e) Defense articles and services offered by foreign \n     governments and international organizations in support of \n     U.S. operations in Iraq,\n       (f) Total number of U.S. casualties as a result of U.S. \n     operations in Iraq by date and cause,\n       (g) All contracts in excess of $10 million entered into by \n     the U.S. government for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President. And I am glad the \nclerk was able to read this amendment because I think it is a very \nstraightforward amendment, not one of those that is convoluted.\n  Essentially, my amendment is an assurance that the American people \nwill receive the full and accurate costs relating to the operations in \nIraq; will know more about the monthly costs therein; will know more \nabout the contribution of our coalition of the willing and other \nnations that may come in, both in terms of their support of military \npersonnel and their monetary support, and other support; and also will \nhave detailed reports on the casualties.\n  This is a very important amendment because, quite frankly, as a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee myself, we do not have the \ninformation we need. I am going to attempt to prove that as I go \nthrough my points.\n  Basically, the amendment would require that each month--every 30 \ndays--the Secretary of Defense send a report to the congressional \ncommittees with specific information. You have heard that information \nread by the clerk, so I will not go into that until my summary.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Landrieu and \nMurray be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, last August, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, on which I serve, began a series of hearings on \nU.S. policy toward Iraq, hearings that began under the leadership of \nSenator Biden, and have continued with our current chairman, Senator \nLugar.\n  From the very first hearing, my position on this issue was very \nclear. I felt if our policy toward Iraq was going to be successful, it \nshould be done in conjunction with our allies and in coordination with \ninternational institutions, such as NATO and the United Nations.\n  Why did I feel that way? Because I felt that the burden of this \nsituation should be shared by the world. Surely, the world has \nsomething at stake if there is stability in Iraq, and that burden ought \nto be shared.\n  The fact is, for many different reasons--and I am not going to rehash \nthem--the burden has not been shared. And this situation is very \ndifferent than the first Persian Gulf war, where George Herbert Walker \nBush built a very broad international coalition to share the burdens of \nwar.\n  All we have to do is look at the cost. That is one example. The \nestimated cost of the first gulf war was $61 billion total. The \noperation was financed by more than $53 billion pledged by countries \naround the world, and some of that came in the form of in-kind services \nthat also counted toward the estimate. So our allies picked up roughly \n85 percent of the cost of the first gulf war. Our allies also provided \na quarter of the military force on the ground.\n  How different is this current situation? We have 146,000 troops in \nIraq, and they are dying every day. I have come to the floor to \neulogize those who have died who had any connection to California. Let \nme say, since President Bush declared an end to major hostilities on \nMay 1, 15 of those who were either from California or based in \nCalifornia have been killed. In the total of all those killed, 56 have \nbeen from California or based in California. This war is touching the \npeople of my State very deeply.\n  So here are 146,000 troops from our country in Iraq, and the British, \nour top ally, have 12,000 troops. They certainly have been our deepest \nfriends in this particular situation. They have 12,000 troops. We have \n146,000. Poland and Australia have a small number of troops. All these \ntroops are greatly appreciated. But you cannot come close to the type \nof international coalition that we had in the first Persian Gulf war \nor, more important, what we need to have today so that the burden does \nnot fall so hard on our families.\n  Last night, I heard a report on CNN about a little child that would \njust break your heart. He was there with his mom. You never can script \na child. This little boy said: I was supposed to\n\n[[Page S9460]]\n\nhave my daddy home, and this is the second time, but the President \nchanged his mind again.\n  Clearly, the President doesn't want to see little kids crying for \ntheir parents. No one does. But what it means is we need to \ninternationalize the troops in the field so we do not have to carry \nthis burden. We also need rules and regulations so we keep to our word \nabout the length of the terms served over there, and that is an issue \nthat will come back again. We had a vote on that yesterday.\n  For a moment I rise to talk about the money. In a hearing on July 9 \nbefore the Armed Services Committee, Secretary of Defense, Donald \nRumsfeld, was unable to recall the monthly cost of U.S. operations in \nIraq. The committee actually had to go into a recess so the Secretary \ncould get the information.\n  This is unacceptable. I have the transcript from that hearing. I am \ngoing to read from it.\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       Mr. Secretary, what is the current monthly spend rate to \n     support our ongoing military operations in Iraq?\n\n  Mr. Rumsfeld:\n\n       I'll have to get you that for the record.\n       It's a combination of appropriating funds, as you know, \n     sir, know better than any, plus the expenditures of funds \n     taking place from Iraqi frozen assets, from Iraqi siezed \n     assets and from U.N.-Iraqi assets under the oil-for-food \n     program. And I can certainly have Dr. Zakheim come up and \n     provide a very precise answer as to what's currently being \n     spent.\n\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       Do you recall a figure? Can you give us an estimate? I've \n     heard the figure of $1.5 billion a month.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       I would not want to venture a guess and be wrong, sir.\n\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       Well, somebody ought to know.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       Well, they do know. We'll be happy to brief you on that.\n       Well, I'd like to know now.\n       Well, we'd have to adjourn . . .\n       Well, OK.\n\n  Madam President, how do you come before the Armed Services Committee \nwithout an estimate of the cost? I don't quite understand it.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld says these expenditures are in a variety of \ncategories, et cetera.\n  This is what Senator Byrd said:\n\n       I understand that, Mr. Chairman, but I've been around here \n     going on 51 years and I'm on the Appropriations Committee, \n     and we want to fund our military and meet the need. But there \n     must be some figure, some amount that we can cite as an \n     amount that we're spending monthly in Afghanistan and the \n     same with respect to Iraq.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       I'm sure there is, and we'll get it for you.\n\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       Very well. That'll be another figure we hope to have when \n     we return, Mr. Chairman, I would hope.\n\n  And Secretary Rumsfeld says:\n\n       In that case not likely. That fast?\n\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       Well, you like to have figures fast when it comes to \n     appropriating money.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       That's for sure.\n\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       I would [like to] know, on behalf of the Appropriations \n     Committee and the Congress, how much we're spending.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       We'll try and get it for you.\n\n  Then Senator Byrd says:\n\n       Well, anyhow, so much for that . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print these conversations in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       BYRD: Mr. Secretary, what is the currently month spend rate \n     to support our ongoing military operations in Iraq?\n       RUMSFELD: I'll have to get you that for the record.\n       It's a combination of appropriated funds, as you, sir, know \n     better than any, plus the expenditures of funds that are \n     taking place from Iraqi frozen assets, from Iraqi seized \n     assets and from U.N.-Iraqi assets under the oil-for-food \n     program. And I can certainly have Dr. Zakheim come up and \n     provide a very precise answer as to what's currently being \n     spent.\n       BYRD: Do you recall a figure? Can you give us an estimate? \n     I've heard the figure of $1.5 billion a month.\n       RUMSFELD: I would not want to venture a guess and be wrong, \n     sir.\n       BYRD: Well, somebody ought to know.\n       RUMSFELD: Well, they do know. We'll be happy to brief you \n     on it.\n       BYRD: Well, I'd like to know now.\n       RUMSFELD: Well, we'd have to adjourn and I'd have to get on \n     the phone with Dov Zakheim.\n       BYRD: Well, OK.\n       We'll be back, won't we, Mr. Chairman?\n       WARNER: Yes, we will, Senator.\n       BYRD: And along with that, how much are we spending a month \n     to support U.S. military forces in Iraq?\n       RUMSFELD: The expenditures for Iraq are in a variety of \n     categories. You might include the salaries of the people that \n     are serving there; those salaries would be paid whether \n     they're serving there or they're back in Germany or back in \n     the United States.\n       It might include funds, as I indicated, that are coming \n     from other sources. It might include funds for reconstitution \n     that are currently being spent, but we're spending on \n     rebuilding stocks of bombs, for example, and weapons that \n     were used during the conflict.\n       So it is not a question that can be posed and then answered \n     with a single number. I wish I were able to do that, but if \n     fall into a variety of different baskets under our \n     appropriated funds.\n       BYRD: I understand that, Mr. Chairman. But I've been around \n     here going on 51 years and I'm on the Appropriations \n     Committee, and we want to fund our military certainly and \n     meet the need. But there must be some figure, some amount \n     that we can cite as an amount that we're spending monthly in \n     Afghanistan and the same with respect to Iraq.\n       RUMSFELD: I'm sure there is, and we'll get it for you.\n       BYRD: Very well. That'll be another figure we hope to have \n     that when we return, Mr. Chairman, I would hope.\n       RUMSFELD: In that case not likely. That fast?\n       BYRD: Well, you like to have figures fast when it comes to \n     appropriating money.\n       RUMSFELD: That's for sure.\n       BYRD: I would know, on behalf of the Appropriations \n     Committee on the Congress, how much we're spending.\n       RUMSFELD: We'll try and get it for you.\n       BYRD: I hear and I read that it's something like $3 billion \n     to $3.5 billion a month to support U.S. military forces in \n     Iraq. And where are these figures coming from that we read \n     about, and that we in the Appropriations Committee are told \n     from time to time?\n       Well, anyhow, so much for that . . .\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. If anything that happens in the Senate means anything at \nall, if we are not just spinning our wheels when we have committee \nhearings, we ought to learn what to do when things are not going right. \nI suggest things are not going right when a man as intelligent as \nSecretary Rumsfeld cannot answer a simple question like what it is \ncosting us every single month.\n  We have found out from the Department of Defense Comptroller that the \ncost of U.S. operations in Iraq has cost $48 billion thus far. The cost \nper month is $4 billion, not what Senator Byrd thought, 1.3 or 1.4; it \nis $4 billion. And given that we are going to be in Iraq for years, not \nmonths, according to everyone, how does the administration propose we \npay for this, given the tax cuts they have created, deficits as far as \nthe eye can see, and the international community has pledged only $1.7 \nbillion so far, and it is costing us $4 billion a month?\n  Sometimes it is hard for my constituents--to understand these \ndollars. What I have done today in a handmade chart--forgive me, it is \nnot the most beautiful-looking chart, but I think it says it all--is \nask, how do we know exactly what $45 billion a year is that we are now \ncurrently spending on Iraq? I thought I would take a look at selected \nissues that we care about in the Senate in a bipartisan way and tell \nthe people of this country, as well as remind my colleagues what we are \nspending on these things compared to $45 billion a year in Iraq.\n  We spend on the Drug Enforcement Agency--that is the agency that does \neverything to get the bad guys who are trying to push drugs on our \nchildren and interdicting drugs at the border--in a year, $1.6 billion. \nWe are spending $45 billion in Iraq, and we still have people waiting \nin line to get treatment on demand for their drug habit. We can't take \nthem. We don't have enough money. But we are spending $45 billion in \nIraq.\n  On higher education, across party lines, we have worked so hard to \nmake sure we have enough money for education. Let's look at higher \neducation--the kinds of grants and loans we give out to deserving \nmiddle-class families so that their kids can get a college education. \nWe spend $23.4 billion on higher education in a year. We are spending \n$45 billion a year in Iraq.\n  Afterschool programs: I have a special feeling for those because I \nwrote\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\nthe law. Senator Ensign, on the other side of the aisle, and I teamed \nup on that one. We are spending $1 billion a year on afterschool \nprograms, and we have thousands and thousands and thousands of children \non waiting lists whom we cannot accommodate because we don't have the \nmoney. But we are spending $45 billion a year in Iraq, and that is \nbefore the major reconstruction starts.\n  We are all talking about Head Start. The President has a plan to give \nit back to the States. I oppose that fiercely. This is a program that \nworks for poor families. Be that as it may, whether it is a block grant \nor a Federal program, we are spending $6.7 billion a year on Head \nStart. Millions of children are waiting to get in. We are spending $45 \nbillion a year on Iraq.\n  Highways: There isn't one Senator in this body who would say their \nState doesn't need highway funding. We are spending $31.8 billion a \nyear on highways. By the way, that comes from the gas tax our citizens \npay. That is less than we are spending for a year in Iraq.\n  NIH, the National Institutes of Health: Again, there is no one I have \never met whose family or friends have not been touched by cancer, \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, or heart disease. The bottom line is that we \nare spending $27.1 billion a year to find cures for these diseases. And \nwe are spending $45 billion a year in Iraq.\n  Veterans' health: These are people who have served this Nation \nproudly. We have made a commitment to take care of them. We are going \nto have a whole lot more veterans coming back from this war. We want to \nmeet our commitments. How much do we spend a year on veterans' health? \nWe spend $23.9 billion on all of the veterans' health. We are spending \n$45 billion a year in Iraq.\n  The Transportation Security Agency: I sit on the Commerce Committee, \nwe know what we have to do to make sure our public is protected from \nthese terrorists who are still in our country. There are declassified \nreports that say there are tens of thousands in our country. Will they \nstrike again? We are doing everything to make sure the President has \nthe resources he needs. But, bottom line, what are we spending on the \nTSA to protect the flying public? It is $5.2 billion.\n  There is a lot more we have to do, such as retrofit airplanes so if \nthere is a shoulder-fired missile a terrorist gets hold of and shoots \nthat at a plane, there will be a missile defense system through the \ntechnology that is on our military planes. We want them on civilian \naircraft. This is a bipartisan issue. We don't have enough money for \nthat. But we are spending $45 billion a year in Iraq.\n  Coast Guard: Again, they are out there protecting us from drugs that \nare being smuggled, from human cargo that is being smuggled, and \nlooking out for terrorists. That costs $6.1 billion a year.\n  The EPA enforces our laws for clean air, clean water, safe drinking \nwater, and Superfund sites. They are terribly underfunded. The \nSuperfund sites that were to be cleaned up under this administration \nwere cut in half. We don't have the money. As a matter of fact, the \n``polluters pay'' is falling on taxpayers, and yet $8.1 billion is all \nwe are spending, compared to $45 billion in Iraq.\n\n  My last example is the Superfund Program. If anybody has a Superfund \nsite in their State, they know these are highly polluted sites that \nneed to be cleaned up so that there can be economic development on \nthose sites and so that our children and all of our people can be \nprotected from these poisons. That is $1.3 billion, and we are spending \n$45 billion a year in Iraq.\n  Why did I go through this? Because sometimes people's eyes glaze over \nwhen they hear numbers. Mine tend to do that. We have to put this into \nperspective. We are spending $4 billion a month. Secretary Rumsfeld \neventually came up with those numbers later. So we know that is a fact. \nThat is what we are spending. That is $45 billion a year, and we don't \ncome close to spending that on the priorities of the American people. \nWe don't even come close.\n  So why is my amendment important? Because it is going to tell the \nAmerican people how their taxpayer dollars are being spent in Iraq and \nhow much of a contribution our allies, our friends, are making. It is \nalso going to tell us the details of when people get wounded or \nkilled--how did it happen and why did it happen? We need that \ninformation. We need it on behalf of the American people. That is for \nsure.\n  In closing, again, this is a very straightforward amendment. It is \nwritten in plain English. It is very clear.\n  I will close my statement by reading the amendment one more time. I \ncannot imagine why my friends on the other side would object to this. I \nhope they don't object. The fact is, the American people deserve to \nknow what is happening to their tax dollars. They don't have to have a \nsituation where someone comes up and Senator Byrd asks a question--\nregardless of who it is on either side of the aisle--and says, gee, I \ndon't know. That is not acceptable.\n  Here is how the amendment reads:\n\n       Not less than once every 30 days, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit a report to the Congressional Defense Committee, \n     the House International Relations Committee, the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee that contains the following \n     information:\n       (a) Total and monthly costs of U.S. operations in Iraq;\n       (b) Number of U.S. military personnel serving in Iraq and \n     the immediate region;\n       (c) Total and monthly contributions made by foreign \n     governments and international organizations in support of \n     U.S. operations in Iraq;\n       (d) Number of foreign military personnel serving in support \n     of U.S. operations in Iraq;\n       (e) Defense articles and services offered by foreign \n     governments and international organizations in support of \n     U.S. operations in Iraq;\n       (f) Total number of U.S. casualties as a result of U.S. \n     operations in Iraq by date and cause;\n       (g) All contracts in excess of $10 million entered into by \n     the U.S. Government for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n\n  On this last one, as someone who has fought hard to end that sole \nsource contract to Halliburton, I am very worried that this could \nrepeat itself. That sole source contract was worth many billions--at \nleast $7 billion or $8 billion. It didn't go out for bid. It was going \nto go forward and we stopped it. I thank Senator Warner for teaming up \nwith me to stop it.\n  On August 14, we are supposed to get the follow-on contract. I hope \nthat will happen. I am counting on it. Let us not be sanguine about \nthis whole military procurement situation. I served on the Armed \nServices Committee for many years on the House side. You turn your back \none minute and there is another contract; it didn't go out for a bid, \nit is costing a fortune, and you wind up with $7,000 coffee pots on \nairplanes. I have been there and I have seen that. So all contracts in \nexcess of $10 million entered into by the U.S. Government for the \nreconstruction of Iraq--we will know about that, I say to colleagues.\n  So I think if the Senate has some regard for its own power, its own \nrole in this entire matter, then the Senate will go on record and \nsupport this very simple amendment, just asking for information on a \nmonthly basis so we can stay ahead of the curve.\n  With that, Madam President, I finish my statement. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this amendment is redundant and \nunnecessary. It, in effect, requires a report to committees of Congress \nevery 30 days by the administration on operations in Iraq.\n  The supplemental that the Congress passed in April just before the \nEaster recess providing fiscal year 2003 funds for the Iraqi operations \nrequired that many reports be submitted to committees of Congress. As a \nmatter of fact, within 5 days of the transfer of funds from the Iraqi \nFreedom account, a report is sent to the Appropriations and Defense \nCommittees of the House and Senate advising the Congress of how these \nfunds are going to be spent.\n  No such reporting has been required of recent operations elsewhere in \nthe world. For example, during the Clinton administration, no such \nreports were required for operations in Somalia or Bosnia or Haiti. Nor \nwere they required during the operations in Afghanistan or Kosovo.\n  This report duplicates information the Department of Defense is \nalready routinely providing through congressional hearings and \nbriefings for Members of Congress and press organizations, news \norganizations that have access to the regular briefings at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The reports on the cost of Iraq and the number of personnel serving \nin the\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\nregion are widely available. We all know that representatives of news \norganizations are all over Iraq gathering information, making reports \nevery day on television through their news organizations back to the \nUnited States and around the world. There are no secrets.\n  There were members of the press involved and personally present \nduring all of the military operations and, to a great extent, \nAmbassador Bremer and General Abizaid still make information available \nto those representatives of news organizations who are seeking \ninformation about what is going on in Iraq. We all have access that is \nunparalleled and truly unlimited.\n\n  The Senator complains that this should be required as a matter of \nstatute, that we ought to have an enactment of law that makes the \nadministration provide these reports. But if we look at the \nsupplemental the Congress adopted just before the Easter recess, that \nhas already been done. This is redundant. It is unnecessary.\n  The Senator read from her amendment to tell us exactly what is in it. \nWe have already provided for reports, and I am going to read it so \neverybody will know what we have already ordered the administration to \ndo by law:\n\n       Not later than 45 days after date of enactment of this Act, \n     the President shall submit to the Committees on \n     Appropriations a report on the United States strategy \n     regarding activities related to post-conflict security, \n     humanitarian assistance, governance, and reconstruction in \n     Iraq that are undertaken as a result of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom. The report shall include the following:\n       (1) The distribution of duties and responsibilities \n     regarding such activities among agencies of the United States \n     Government, including the Department of State, the United \n     States Agency for International Development, and the \n     Department of Defense (to be provided within 30 days within \n     enactment of this Act)\n       (2) A detailed plan describing the roles and \n     responsibilities of foreign governments and international \n     organizations, including the United Nations, in carrying out \n     activities related to post-conflict security, humanitarian \n     assistance, governance, and reconstruction in Iraq.\n       (3) A strategy for coordinating such activities among the \n     United States Government, foreign governments and \n     international organizations, including the United Nations.\n       (4) An initial estimate of the costs expected to be \n     associated with such activities.\n       (5) A strategy for distributing the responsibility for \n     paying costs associated with reconstruction activities in \n     Iraq among the United States, foreign governments, and \n     international organizations, including the United Nations, \n     and an estimate of the revenue expected to be generated by \n     Iraqi oil production that could be used to pay such costs.\n       (b) Subsequent Reports.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter \n     until September 30, 2004, the President shall submit to the \n     Committees on Appropriations a report that contains:\n       (1) A list of significant United States Government-funded \n     activities related to reconstruction in Iraq that, during the \n     90-day period ending 15 days prior to the date the report is \n     submitted to the Committees on Appropriations--\n       (A) were initiated; or\n       (B) were completed.\n       (2) A list of the significant activities related to \n     reconstruction in Iraq that the President anticipates \n     initiating during the 90-day period beginning on the date the \n     report is submitted to the Committees on Appropriations, \n     including:\n       (A) Cost estimates for carrying out the \nproposed activities.\n\n       (B) The source of the funds that will be used to pay such \n     costs.\n       (C) Updated strategies, if changes are proposed regarding \n     matters included in the reports required under subsection \n     (a).\n       (4) An updated list of the financial pledges and \n     contributions made by foreign governments or international \n     organizations to fund activities related to humanitarian, \n     governance, and reconstruction assistance in Iraq.\n\n  Madam President, we would be hard pressed to require anything further \nthat the Congress ought to know about the expenditure of funds in \ncarrying out the operations of the activities described in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  This bill we are considering enacting now in the Senate applies to \nappropriations that will be available beginning in the next fiscal \nyear, fiscal year 2004. Reports are required by law now. They will \ncontinue to be required and be available to Members of Congress on \nwhatever committee one serves--the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nDefense Committees, the Appropriations Committees, and any others.\n  We can read every day about the witnesses who are called before the \nCongress and questions are asked about what is going on in Iraq. We are \nentitled to that information. So it is not that I rise to oppose this \namendment because we are not entitled to the information the Senator \nsuggests we ought to have, but that we already have it and it is \nalready required to be given to the Congress routinely, and it is made \navailable under provisions of law that have already been enacted. \nTherefore, if you hired all the accountants and bookkeepers who would \nbe required to fill in all the forms and submit all the documents that \nSenator Boxer requires, I suggest we should consider renaming her \namendment. It should be the Bookkeepers and Accountants Civil Relief \nAct of 2003. That is my suggestion.\n  I hope the Senate will table the amendment, and it will be the \nintention of this Senator, when everybody has had an opportunity to \ntalk about the amendment who wants to talk about the amendment, to move \nto table the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is a sad day when one Senator will \nrename an amendment of another Senator who simply wants to know what it \nis costing my taxpayers every single day.\n  If the Senator is right and this has already been done, he did not \ncomplain about it then. He did not stand up and say: We want this \nreport, but, gee, we should not have it because it is too much work.\n  The bottom line is, I have seen the report to which the Senator \nrefers. It is nine pages, and it is estimates. It is not costs \nincurred. I have asked as recently as today to find out the \ncontribution of other countries, and I have asked it of people in very \nhigh-up positions, and they do not have the answer.\n  Senator Cochran talks about the news: The news knows this; just turn \non CNN, they know it. That is not what I was sent here to do, watch \nCNN. I do not want to give up my power of the purse to CNN or to Fox \nNews or to MSNBC. He talked a long time about the press. If I wanted to \nbe a reporter, I would have stayed a reporter. I was a reporter for a \nwhile. But people sent me here to get the facts and figures.\n  If the Senator believes it is a waste of time and it is a matter of \nbookkeeping to find out the total monthly cost of United States \noperations in Iraq so I can stand up at a townhall meeting and tell the \npeople what it costs--if he thinks that is a waste of time, then I am \nconfused. Why are we here? Why are we bothering?\n  Why are we bothering? If he thinks it is a waste of time to find out \nhow many U.S. personnel are serving in the region, then I am very \nconfused. There was a Presidential candidate who was asked that \nquestion, and he said between 100,000 and 200,000. He was right, but he \nwas chastised. Why did he not know it was 146,000?\n  So perhaps the Senator believes it is not important to know in any \ngiven month how many people are serving in Iraq. I think it is, \nbecause, guess what, they are my constituents. I have lost 50 of them. \nSo I would like to know who is over there.\n  I also would like to know, when one of our Americans dies, the \ncircumstances surrounding that. I want to know what the coalition of \nthe willing is actually doing, not what the Senator talks about, \nestimates.\n  See, he is talking about a report that talks about estimates. I am \ntalking about what actually has occurred, and what costs have been \nincurred. The Senator never mentioned the fact that I am going after \nthese contracts. Maybe that is because he does not want to go after \nthem. The fact is we see a contract let to Halliburton, a sole-source \nnoncompetitive bid. What does it cost? It could have cost $9 billion \nexcept some of us found out about it, and happily Senator Warner agreed \nwith me and we came together, and this is supposed to be ended. But it \ncould happen tomorrow.\n  So I would call the Senator's position, since he has now \ncharacterized my position, the stonewall position. I could throw around \ncharged words, too. I could call his words the cover-up-the-true-costs \nposition. That was not my intent. I do not stand here, after a Senator \nis sincere, to try and demean what they do. I do not think that is \nright.\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\nBut since it was done to me, I say people who do not support this are \nnot interested in knowing the truth, are not interested in getting the \nfacts, are trying to hide something from the American people.\n  Now maybe the Senator feels $45 billion a year is a little bit of \nmoney. I do not know where he comes from. Maybe that is a little bit of \nmoney. Where I come from, that is a lot. We spend $1.6 billion in all \non drug enforcement in this country. We are spending $45 billion, \nroughly, but the Senator feels we do not have to have some report that \nbasically tells us how it is being spent. He calls it redundant when it \nis not at all redundant, because it is not about estimates, which is \nthe report he is talking about, but it is about actual costs incurred.\n  One thing I thought we could come together on in this Senate is the \npeople's right to know how their money is being spent, and the people's \nright to know, if troops are lost, what are the conditions, why did it \nhappen, and the people's right to know who is sharing the burden of \nthese costs.\n  I have spoken to families who have heard from their loved ones that \nour people over there are more scared now than they were during the hot \nwar, where they performed so brilliantly. I am hearing the words \n``sitting ducks'' used now. It is not a happy situation. We have to \nwork to bring down the burden on our troops, and the financial burden \non our people, and we could do that with leadership. At least the \nSenate ought to know the true costs, not the estimated costs. What I am \ntalking about is accountability, and anyone can stand up and say it is \nredundant, but the fact is it is far from redundant because I saw the \nreport my friend talks about and it has nothing to do with this. It is \nabout estimates and projections. This is about reality.\n  So I hope that notwithstanding the opposition I have heard today, \nwhich I think frankly is couched in a way which was not fair, that my \ncolleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to table the Boxer amendment and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask consent that at 3:15 today, the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Boxer amendment No. 1271, \nto be immediately followed by a vote in relation to the Daschle \namendment No. 1269, with no second-degree amendments in order to either \namendment prior to the votes; provided further that there be 2 minutes \nfor debate equally divided in the usual form between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to indicate to the Senate \nhow long that vote took.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It took 23 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have to take credit on this one, I say \nto my friend. I asked that it not be completed until I completed a \nconference that I had conducted.\n  Mr. REID. I only say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, this is not a complaint to the Senator from Alaska. This \ncomplaint is to the fact that these votes take so long and are so \nunnecessary. We waste so much time. We have a significant number of \npeople on this side who want to offer amendments. There are some on the \nother side. We waste hours waiting for stragglers to come in on votes. \nIf people are not here, let them not vote. We are wasting time. I hope \nwe can speed up the votes.\n  Mr. President, unless the Senator from Alaska has some other matter \nthat he wants to tend to, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy \nbe allowed to offer the next amendment. Senator Kennedy has agreed--and \nthe other side has seen the amendment--to 30 minutes on his side. We \nwould agree to an hour evenly divided on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making that unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1273\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1273.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on the United States strategy for \n                        reconstruction in Iraq)\n\n       On page 120, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress \n     an unclassified report (with a classified annex, if \n     necessary) on the United States strategy regarding activities \n     related to post-conflict security, humanitarian assistance, \n     governance, and reconstruction in Iraq that are undertaken as \n     a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The report shall include \n     the following:\n       (1) A schedule for the President to seek NATO \n     participation, as an organization of many nations, in ongoing \n     operations in Iraq.\n       (2) A schedule for the President to seek and obtain the \n     approval of a resolution of the United Nations Security \n     Council authorizing a multinational civil and security force \n     (including substantial participation by armed forces of NATO \n     member countries under unified command and control) to \n     guarantee the stability, democratization, and reconstruction \n     of Iraq.\n       (3) An estimate of the number of Armed Forces personnel \n     that are needed in Iraq to guarantee the stability and \n     reconstruction of Iraq, separately stated for each of the \n     Armed Forces and, within each of the Armed Forces, for each \n     of the components.\n       (4) An estimate of the number of personnel of armed forces \n     of foreign countries that are needed in Iraq to guarantee the \n     stability and reconstruction of Iraq.\n       (5) A statement and justification from the President for \n     his actions in seeking or failing to seek NATO participation \n     or a UN Security Council resolution.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I modify the request made a few minutes ago \nto indicate that there would be no second-degree amendments prior to \nthe vote on or in relation to the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to share this \namendment with the manager of the bill. I believe the floor manager is \nfamiliar with it.\n  The amendment is now at the desk. I welcome the opportunity to \naddress the Senate on the substance of the amendment. I supported the \nBoxer amendment that we just voted on, which failed to carry. She was \nseeking important information on the Iraqi operation. I believe the \nAmerican people deserve this information. But they also deserve a plan.\n  My amendment requires the administration to report information on \nthat plan. This amendment asks the President to submit a report to the \nCongress within 30 days of enactment on the efforts to internationalize \nour operations in Iraq. The report would provide a timetable for the \nPresident to seek NATO participation as an institution in the ongoing \noperations in Iraq. It would provide a timetable for the President to \nseek and obtain the approval of a resolution of the United Nations \nSecurity Council authorizing a multinational security force, including \nsubstantial participation by the Armed Forces of NATO member countries, \nto guarantee the stability and reconstruction of a democratic Iraq.\n  The report would include an estimate of the number of American Armed \nForces personnel needed in Iraq to guarantee the stability and \nreconstruction of Iraq, and an estimate of the number of personnel from \nforeign countries that the administration believes are necessary to \naccomplish that goal.\n  Finally, if the administration chooses not to go to NATO or the U.N., \nthe report would require an explanation of the rationale.\n  Last week, by a vote of 97 to 0, the Senate approved a resolution \nencouraging the President to consider requesting the involvement of \nNATO and the U.N. in Iraq. This amendment builds on that action by \nseeking a plan and timetable for doing just that.\n\n  The administration has had plenty of time to consider this. For the \nsake of the soldiers in Baghdad, it is time to act. Supporters and \nopponents of the war alike are enormously proud of the way our troops \nperformed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The speed and success of their \nmission in toppling Saddam Hussein demonstrated the extraordinary \nability of our Nation's Armed Forces. It is no accident that so few of \nour forces paid the ultimate price during the 3 tumultuous weeks this \ntook.\n  It was a foregone conclusion that we would win the war, but the all-\nimportant challenge now is to win the peace. In fact, we are at serious \nrisk of losing it. Each day now, as the guerrilla war goes on, our \ntroops and their families are paying the price. Our clear national \ninterests in the emergence of a peaceful, stable, and democratic Iraq \nis being undermined.\n  Since May 1, when President Bush announced on the aircraft carrier \nthat major combat operations in Iraq had ended, 82 more American troops \nhave died. For the men and women of our Armed Forces who are dodging \nbullets in the streets and alleys of Baghdad, and other parts of Iraq, \nthe battle is far from over. President Bush says to the attackers, \n``bring 'em on,'' but how do you console a family by telling them their \nson or daughter is a casualty of the postwar period?\n  The debate may go on many months, or even years, about our \nintelligence failures before the war began. The failures of \nintelligence were bad enough, but the real failure of intelligence was \nour failure to understand Iraq. There is no question that long before \nthe war began, the serious issue was raised about the danger of winning \nthe war and losing the peace. In fact, it was one of the principal \narguments against going to war.\n  Based on our past experience in Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, and \nAfghanistan, we knew the postwar rebuilding of Iraq would be difficult. \nThese are not new issues. Rather than learning from the past experience \nin these previous conflicts, the administration rushed ahead, and the \nresult has been chaos for the Iraqi people and continuing mortal danger \nto our troops--all because we insisted on doing it unilaterally, \nwithout the support of the two international organizations that could \nhave made all the difference in winning the peace.\n  Sadly, we quickly went from liberators to occupiers in a few short \nweeks. Cynicism and anger against America are rife. Many Iraqis believe \nwe are unwilling, not just unable, to restore basic services. They are \nlosing faith and trust in our promise of a reconstructed, stable, \npeaceful future, and they fear that Saddam may still be alive. Under \nfire from guerillas who are determined to see America fail, our \nsoldiers are now performing police\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\nfunctions for which they have had little training. We are straining \ntheir endurance, and they want to know how long they will have to stay \nin Iraq. Even President Bush is now saying rebuilding Iraq will be a \nmassive and long-term undertaking.\n  What we need most now is to share at least some of the burden with \nthe international community. Our troops are now sent overseas for \nlonger tours of duty than ever. Because we rely on their skill and the \nskill to meet commitments on a global scale, more than 150,000 troops \nare in Iraq, and many have been deployed in the region for close to a \nyear. Half of our Army divisions are in Iraq or Afghanistan. Of the 33 \nArmy combat brigades, 18 are in Iraq. The strain is also great for \ncitizens serving in the Guard and Reserves because we depend upon them \nwith greater frequency, ever since we reduced our forces after the cold \nwar.\n  It is difficult to continue to put patriotic reservists through the \ndeployment grinder year after year and expect them to hold up \nindefinitely. It is also difficult to sustain the cost of such \nmissions. We are now spending $3.9 billion a month in Iraq, and with \nthe ongoing costs of the war on terrorism, our operations in \nAfghanistan, and our potential new responsibility around the globe in \nplaces such as west Africa, let alone Iran and North Korea, we are \ncreating an unsustainable financial burden at a time of exploding \nbudget deficits, soaring demands for homeland security, and mounting \nneeds for health care, education, and other domestic priorities.\n  As a nation with honor, responsibility, and the vision of a better \nworld, America cannot invade and then cut and run from Iraq, but we \nalso cannot afford the continuing costs in dollars or in blood of \ncontinuing to go it alone. If our national security is at stake, we \nwill spare no cost.\n  The alternative is so obvious. Working with the international \ncommunity, we can develop and implement an effective strategy to reduce \nthe burden and risk to our soldiers, stabilize Iraq, and deliver on the \npromise of a better future for its people.\n  Whatever our divisions before the war, the challenge is very \ndifferent now. There is every chance we can secure broad international \nsupport and participation in the stabilization and reconstruction of \nIraq. All we may have to do is ask because so much is clearly at stake \nfor the rest of the world.\n  At issue is the stability and the future of the entire highly \nvolatile Middle East. No one would be immune from the dangers that a \nresentful and disorganized Iraq presents for its nation and neighbors \neverywhere. If we diversify the faces of the security force, it is far \nless likely that Iraqis will see us as the enemy, oppressor, and \noccupier. We want the 25 million citizens of Iraq to see the armed \nstrangers in their country as friends and partners in their pursuit of \nfreedom. We want the new governing council appointed last Sunday to \nsucceed.\n  We need to bring regional forces into Iraq, especially Muslims. \nCountries such as Jordan, Pakistan, and Egypt could transform this \nmission with both their diversity and their expertise. The United Arab \nEmirates have contributed to the effort in Kosovo. Morocco, Albania, \nand Turkey have worked with us in Bosnia. Many nations have well-\ntrained police. Reaching out to other countries and bringing them into \nthe postwar process is the surest path to a stable Iraq.\n  But most other nations are unlikely to send troops to serve what is \nperceived as an American occupation. India turned us down earlier this \nweek. Other nations will be far more likely to do their part if the \ninternational mission is approved by the United Nations or organized by \nNATO. Instead of asking our Armed Forces to carry out a mission they \nare not trained for, and to do it alone, we need to rely on the \nexpertise and the resources of the international community. The United \nNations has assumed that responsibility in other countries in the past, \nand it is one of the major reasons the U.N. was created. Necessity is \nthe mother of invention.\n  In the case of Iraq, President Bush obviously had to modify his \nstrong opposition to nation building. The challenge now is to move \nbeyond unilateral nation building. The new Iraqi council announced on \nSunday is a step in the right direction, but it will be much more \neffective if the United Nations has a major presence in overseeing it.\n  Those who join a United States-dominated, government-run council run \nthe high risk of being dismissed by the Iraqis as American puppets. As \nlong as America alone is calling the tune, Iraqi moderates may remain \nin the background or even oppose us.\n  Our interests in the emergence of a true democracy in Iraq are best \nfulfilled by involving the world community, and especially other Arab \nnations, as part of helping the Iraqis themselves shape a new Iraq. \nOnly then would a new Iraq government be viewed as legitimate by the \nIraqi people. The U.N. has a modest role now through its mandate \nfor humanitarian issues, but it has only an advisory role in the civil \nadministration of Iraq. That has to change. The U.N. should have a \nformal role in overseeing the establishment of a political process. The \nU.N., rather than the United States, should preside over the evolution \nof a new Iraqi government. Doing so will win international legitimacy \nand indispensable international support for this challenge, minimizing \nthe danger that Iraqis will keep regarding their new government as a \npuppet of ours.\n\n  With Arab-speaking spokesmen, the U.N. could also convey a different \nimage and a different message to the people of that country, a sense of \nreassurance that an overwhelming American occupation never can.\n  NATO, as an institution, should clearly be in Iraq as well. Military \nexperts believe it will take at least 200,000 troops to stabilize Iraq. \nOur goal should be to include NATO and some of its 2 million-member \npool of armed forces in military operations as soon as possible. \nAmerica will provide a majority of troops, but over time the overall \nnumber of forces would decrease.\n  As in Kosovo and Bosnia, we should ask the United Nations Security \nCouncil to authorize NATO to organize an international security force \nto demilitarize and stabilize Iraq. To do so does not mean the United \nStates should or must relinquish all military control. On the contrary, \nwe would have a significant role in the NATO force and could continue \nto have a defining role in Iraq.\n  An American commander was in charge of American troops in Bosnia, and \nthe head of NATO forces in Europe is and always has been an American.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Secretary Rumsfeld told the Armed Services Committee \nlast week that except for the area around Baghdad, most of Iraq is \nalready secure. If that is so, then why not reduce the burden on our \nmilitary and allow this large area of Iraq, which needs police officers \nas well as combat troops, to be turned over as soon as possible to the \nUnited Nations-approved and NATO-led force? Why not allow American and \ncoalition forces to secure the area around Baghdad and allow other \nnations to provide security for the rest of Iraq?\n  We all know that as long as Iraq continues to dominate our attention, \nwe cannot give other aspects of the war against terrorism the clear \nfocus they deserve. It is not just what happens in Iraq itself, as \nimportant as that issue is, but the continuing urgency of the ongoing \nfight against terrorism that should persuade us to seek allies in an \ninternational plan for a peaceful Iraq. Otherwise, we run the grave \nrisk of exposing our Nation to more terrorist attacks.\n  We won the war in Iraq, as we knew we would, but if our present \npolicy continues, we may lose the peace. We must rise to the challenge \nof international cooperation. Saddam may no longer be in power, but the \npeople of Iraq will not truly be liberated until they live in a secure \ncountry. The war will not be over until the fighting stops on the \nground, democracy takes hold, and the people of Iraq are able to govern \nthemselves.\n  My amendment asks the administration to make a major, genuine effort \nto enlist the official support of NATO and the United Nations for our \nforces in Iraq. I urge the Senate to affirm it.\n  Mr. President, I will take a few moments to review the amendment. It \nis two pages. It says:\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the President shall submit to Congress an unclassified \n     report (with\n\n[[Page S9466]]\n\n     a classified annex, if necessary) on the United States \n     strategy regarding activities related to post-conflict \n     security, humanitarian assistance, governance, and \n     reconstruction in Iraq that are undertaken as a result of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom. The report shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) A schedule for the President to seek NATO \n     participation, as an organization of many nations, in ongoing \n     operations in Iraq.\n       (2) A schedule for the President to seek and obtain \n     approval of a resolution of the United Nations Security \n     Council authorizing a multinational civil and security force \n     (including substantial participation by armed forces of NATO \n     member countries under unified command and control) to \n     guarantee the stability, democratization, and reconstruction \n     of Iraq.\n       (3) An estimate of the number of Armed Forces personnel \n     that are needed in Iraq to guarantee the stability and \n     reconstruction of Iraq, separately stated for each of the \n     Armed Forces and, within each of the Armed Forces, for each \n     of the components.\n       (4) An Estimate of the number of personnel of armed forces \n     of foreign countries that are needed in Iraq to guarantee the \n     stability and reconstruction of Iraq.\n       (5) A statement and justification from the President for \n     his actions in seeking or failing to seek NATO participation \n     or a U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\n  Basically, what this amendment is saying is, let us hear from the \nPresident on what the plan is for postwar Iraq.\n  Let the Senate hear from the President his response to what was the \n97 to 0 vote in the Senate Chamber last week that asked him to consider \ngoing to the United Nations, going to NATO, and reporting back to the \nCongress so the American people will have knowledge and understanding \nof exactly what the plans for the future of Iraq would be.\n  I hope as we were able to gather a virtually unanimous vote in the \nSenate last week on the previous resolution, we could gather support in \nthe Senate on this resolution.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Did the Senator modify his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not been modified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The amendment I sent to the desk did not need a \nmodification. I provided for the Senator paragraph 5.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is that the subparagraph 5?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. That was the modification. Rather than sending the \nmodification to the desk, I sent a completely new amendment and I \nbelieve my staff shared it with the Senator. The only difference was \nthese four lines:\n\n       A statement and justification from the President for his \n     actions in seeking or failing to seek NATO participation or a \n     U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\n  So the purpose of the last paragraph is that if the President decides \nhe is not going to follow this, that he will send back to the Congress \nand to the Senate a report stating to the American people the reasons \nand the justification for not doing so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I consider the Senator from Massachusetts a great \npersonal friend and I hope he takes no umbrage at what I am going to \nsay. I have been here now 35 years. I certainly was not here during \nSenator Kennedy's brother's administration, but I was alert and part of \nthe national constituency at the time and admired very much what \nPresident Kennedy did in terms of handling foreign policy, and \nparticularly the Cuban crisis.\n  I read this and I see an amendment that tells the President to report \nto Congress on what he intends to do in the future in terms of \nnegotiations, to give us a schedule of the strategy he and Ambassador \nBremer will follow almost on a daily basis. I wonder what would have \nhappened to President Kennedy in the Cuban crisis had that been the \ndemand of Congress, to tell us in advance what they were going to do \nabout the possibility that those missiles from Russia might come to \nCuba. I really cannot believe the Senate has gone so far that they want \nto handle the President's daily schedule and have it in advance.\n  The President of the United States is the President of the United \nStates. I really cannot believe anyone would vote for this amendment, \nand I hope the Senator will reconsider his language.\n  This last section says the President should give a statement and \njustification for his actions in seeking or in failing to seek an \nagreement for NATO to participate, or a U.N. Security Council \nresolution. That is required by the Senator's amendment. First, it \ntells him to seek it and then it tells him to follow up on almost a \ndaily basis through this continuum now of handling the Iraq crisis. \nThis is worse than the amendment we considered before, which would ask \nthe President to predict how many mortars, how many missiles, how many \nwhatever are going to be needed in the future, what is the plan for the \nfuture contingencies that might occur in Iraq. This is saying the \nPresident should give us a schedule that the President is going to use \nto seek to obtain approval of a resolution for the United Nations \nSecurity Council, including participation by armed forces of NATO and \nmember countries.\n  As a matter of fact, we have already delegated that authority to \nSACEUR and to the ambassador to NATO. They have a daily proposition. I \ndo not imagine they themselves even give the President a daily schedule \nof what they are going to do in the future with regard to NATO. \nCertainly to ask Mr. Bremer and the President's representatives to tell \nus what is their schedule now and in the future in dealing with other \ncountries, when are they going to ask for U.N. participation, NATO \nparticipation, how are they going to do it, and will they please tell \nus, if they do not do it, why they did not do it, and if they failed, \nwhy they failed--my God, Senator, I really believe we should seriously \nconsider what we are doing. This expects the President to seek and \nobtain. No, it does not expect. It directs him: The President shall \nseek and shall obtain.\n  The Presidency is a separate, independent portion of this great \ndemocracy. We have some checks and balances on it, that is true, and \nthey are pretty strong, but we do not have the power to tell the \nCommander in Chief what to do. We do not have the power over foreign \naffairs. He does. If he wants to make an agreement, he has to submit a \ntreaty, and he has to submit it to us for our advice and consent, but \nhe still has the power to make them. We cannot tell him what to do. \nThis tells him what to do. It not only tells him what to do, it tells \nhim to succeed and, if he fails, to tell us why he failed.\n\n  Now, I do not know, maybe I am too much of an old trial lawyer. I get \nexcited about some things, and I hope the jury is listening. I was \npretty successful as a trial lawyer, as a matter of fact, because \njurors listen if you get their attention. I hope I am getting the \nattention of the Senate, no matter where it is, because this amendment \ngoes far too far:\n\n       Shall submit to the Congress an unclassified report (with a \n     classified annex, if necessary) on the United States strategy \n     regarding activities to the post-conflict security, \n     humanitarian assistance, governance, and reconstruction in \n     Iraq that are undertaken as a result of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom.\n\n  Then it gives five separate categories of things that are done in the \nfuture. It is not a report of what has happened in the past. To demand \nit of the President and say the President shall submit a report to us \non anything I think overlooks the concept of checks and balances.\n  We can ask the President to do something by a bill, and he can veto \nit. He is surely not going to veto this bill, although if I were \nPresident, if that came to me I would veto it because it does not \nrepresent the distinction I understand to exist under the Constitution \nin terms of the three great branches of this democracy.\n  Now, to have the President give us an estimate of the number of Armed \nForces personnel that are needed in Iraq to guarantee the stability and \nreconstruction of Iraq, separately stated for each of the Armed Forces \nand, within each of the Armed Forces, for each of the components, \npredict again--predict the future, predict the contingencies, predict \nwhether Turkey is going to participate, predict who else is going to \nparticipate, predict who will not participate, my God, do we want the \nPresident to publish that, that so far this nation has not agreed, so \nfar that nation has not agreed?\n  We were privileged to listen to the Secretary of State today in a \nclassified session upstairs give his opinion of what might be possible, \nbut to ask even the Secretary of State to give us a plan and publish it \nfor what he intended to do to try to achieve a goal that is a goal of \nall branches of our Government,\n\n[[Page S9467]]\n\nand that is terminate our affair in Iraq as soon as possible and \nsuccessfully, I think it would be highly improper. I do not think he \nwould submit it.\n  I take umbrage at the fact that this amendment tells the President \nwhat to do, and tells him to tell us how he is going to do it, in \nadvance of even knowing what the circumstances are that he has to plan \nfor.\n  We do not know how long we are going to be in a security situation in \nIraq. I have told the Senate, and certainly I think most people know, I \ngot a little upset when they would not let part of our committee into \nBaghdad. Other parts of the United States forces and executive branch \nare in Baghdad, and I pointed out to them that with other Senators I \nwent in and out of Vietnam several times on helicopters that were shot \nat, but we went throughout Vietnam to see and report back to the Senate \nwhat was occurring. I thought we had that right to go into Iraq and \nreport back what was occurring, but I was convinced later that--and we \nnow know that there is a serious security threat there because of the \nsnipers who are there, because of those people who are still so allied \nwith the Baath party and Saddam Hussein that they are willing to \nliterally commit suicide to cause us problems. That is not a new \nphenomenon if we look at what has been happening between Palestine and \nIsrael for so many years, but we did not expect it there. I confess \nthat was really a shock to me to hear about that, when our people were \nthere to protect those who have been given their freedom, that some of \ntheir countrymen are willing to continue to kill us because we are \nprotecting their own countrymen. This concept now is getting to the \npoint of really being a difficult problem.\n  I think the Senate has a right to participate in these plans and to \nhave hearings when the time comes and ask these people to come up and \ntestify before us about what the plans are. Those plans undoubtedly \nwould require expenditures of some Federal funds. I expect them to come \nbefore our committee and tell us they have requirements and then set \nforth the nature and extent of those requirements.\n\n  I certainly do not expect this committee to send a demand to the \nexecutive branch, particularly the President himself, to tell us now \nwhat they are going to do in the future and to predict now what the \ncontingencies are in the future that have to be met or to have a \nstatement and justification for the President for his actions in \nseeking or failing to seek NATO participation or a U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution. That is something the Constitution gives the power \nof the President to do. We are going to demand he give us a statement \nof justification for not taking action? I don't think that is within \nour province. Not at all.\n  I hope the Senate is listening. I hope the jury will agree with me \nand we will not approve this amendment.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 82 American soldiers have been shot since \nthe President of the United States landed on the Abraham Lincoln and \neffectively said this war is over. There is no postwar policy. It is a \nbankrupt policy.\n  We attended the hearings with General Garner regarding postwar Iraq \npolicy. He lasted 21 days and was fired. Now we have new personnel in \nIraq, operating out of the palace in Iraq. We have American servicemen \nwho are in a shooting gallery over there; and the Senator from Alaska \nis rejecting our request for the President of the United States to tell \nus what our policy is?\n  We do not have a postwar policy for development in Iraq. We have \nfailed intelligence. One day they are saying the army is going to \ndefect and join us; the next day they fire the army, the next day they \nare trying to rehire them. One day they say they will recruit the \npolice and the next day they say they are thugs and will have nothing \nto do with them. They don't have a policy.\n  For the Senator from Alaska to stand here and say he is indignant \nbecause the American people want to hear what the policy is surprises \nme just as much as I surprised him. The American people want to know \nhow long their sons and daughters are going to be shot at in Iraq. What \nis the policy?\n  A week ago we had 97 Members of the Senate, including the Senator \nfrom Alaska, urging the President of the United States to consider \ngoing to the United Nations and to consider, as well, using NATO. The \nSenator from Alaska supported that.\n  What this amendment is saying is, tell us if you are going to go to \nthe United Nations, tell us if you are going to include NATO. And if \nyou are not going to, come back and tell the American people why not.\n\n  We had a President who said we were going to use NATO in Bosnia. It \nworked, and we reduced the number of Americans who were killed. We had \na President say we were going to use NATO in Kosovo. It worked, and we \nreduced the number of Americans killed. We had a President who said we \nwould bring in U.N. forces in East Timor. We did and reduced the \ndangers to America. There are many who believe that is a viable option. \nMaybe the Senator from Alaska does not, but there are a lot of people \nand a lot of parents who do.\n  I say to the Senator from Alaska, the American people are entitled to \nknow the policy of this administration. To hear such rejection to find \nout the policy is amazing.\n  This is supposedly an open government. We would think the President \nwould want to share his thinking in order to galvanize support. No \nPresident can lead a country in time of war unless he galvanizes the \nsupport of the American people.\n  We ought to know what the policy is. If this is not the policy, tell \nus what it is--not behind closed doors but in open session. Tell us \nwhat it is. We did not hear it at the Armed Services Committee last \nweek from the Secretary of Defense and we did not hear it today, \nevidently--unless a few selected Senators heard it in a closed session.\n  What is wrong with requesting the President of the United States to \ntell the American people where we are going to be in 30 days in Iraq \nwhen our American servicemen are being shot and killed every day. I am \nsorry that irks or bothers the Senator from Alaska but parents of \nAmerican service men and women would like to know. The American people \nwant to know. We are entitled to that kind of information. If he does \nnot want to go that particular route, come back and tell us what he \ndoes want to do.\n  This is a makeup policy over in Iraq. One person heading it up today \nand he is gone tomorrow. We have people deciding they will do one thing \ntoday and they change it tomorrow. In the meantime, one thing is \nconsistent: the killing of American servicemen who are doing tasks they \nwere not trained for and they should not be doing in that country.\n  Many believe it would be worthwhile to bring other troops in and \nshare the responsibility and burden of securing Iraq. Maybe the Senator \nrejects that. There are people within the administration who want to go \nit alone. If that is the position, the posture of this President, let's \nhear it out and have a debate on it.\n  One day it is, no, we do not want to go it alone; we want to use the \nUnited Nations and NATO but we really do not want to request them. \nSecretary General Robertson of NATO has indicated that the United \nStates has not made a direct appeal to him in order to galvanize NATO \nas an institution to provide security. Sure, some of the countries have \nbeen asked, but the Secretary General of the United Nations says the \nUnited States has not asked the United Nations in a formal way to try \nto take over some of the responsibilities. Maybe there is good reason \nfor it. But the American people are entitled to know what the reasons \nare.\n  This amendment is to try to find out that information. We do have a \nresponsibility in foreign policy in terms of making war, the war \npowers, as well as in approving treaties.\n  This Senate, the people's Senate, has a responsibility in foreign \npolicy. The American people are entitled to know the thinking of this \nadministration as their sons and daughters are getting shot every day. \nI am sorry if 30 days is too long a time. But we know what is going to \nhappen. There will be 30 more Americans killed during that period of \ntime. We are entitled to know.\n  With all respect--and I have great affection for the Senator from \nAlaska--I\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\nam as troubled by his reaction as he is troubled by this amendment.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 19 minutes and the \nSenator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I postulate, if this power exists to do what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts wants to do, we might not have been in Vietnam. I \nhad a conversation with a former Senator who disagreed with President \nJohnson and wished he had some way of deterring him from his course.\n  I remind the Senator of the power of the President:\n\n       The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and \n     Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several \n     States, when called into the actual Service of the United \n     States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the \n     principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon \n     any subject relating to the Duties of their respective \n     Offices. . . .\n\n  Nothing in this Constitution gives the Congress the right to ask for \nthat. In fact, to the contrary, there is a specific power for the \nPresident. In section 3 of article II it says:\n\n       He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information \n     of the State of the Union, and recommend to their \n     Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and \n     expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both \n     Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement \n     between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may \n     adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; . . .\n\n  There is nothing in this Constitution that gives us the power to tell \nthe President of the United States what to do--not at all. The \nseparation of powers is one of the most distinct advantages of this \ndemocracy. It is the longest living government on the face of the Earth \ntoday because it is a government of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people, but it has a Constitution. That Constitution we all swear \nto uphold and defend. Part of that Constitution is the separation of \npowers concept. We do not have the power to dictate to the President of \nthe United States. We can send him a bill and ask him to do something, \nand he can veto it if he wishes, but we cannot, in my judgment, tell \nhim to do anything.\n  We cannot command him to plan in advance; to tell us what he is going \nto do; to tell us what is the plan of action for an area that is still \nso unstable that people are being killed. I regret that as much as the \nSenator from Massachusetts. We all do. There is no question about that.\n  There seems to be building up a feeling here that somehow or another \nwe are wrong to be in Iraq; we are wrong to stay in Iraq. Yesterday, I \nhad in my office a young man from the 101st Airborne who had served in \nIraq. I asked him, What do you think about being there?\n  He said: Senator, I am proud I went there, and I want to tell you I \nam proud of what we are doing there.\n  He said: I never thought I would live to see the day we would see the \nresults of a person like Hitler. I saw those graves. I saw the way they \nhad been treated by that dictator. We were right to be there and we are \nright to be there.\n  I believe he would go back there today if we asked him.\n  The problem is not the presence of our people over there in danger. \nThe problem is people questioning our right to keep them in danger \nwithout some plan in advance that would absolutely protect them from \ndanger. I think we have the best system of defense in the world. I know \nwe have the best military in the world. We have the best systems \navailable to them in the world. We have the best sensors. But it is \nstill possible to fool all of this technology and have a person come in \nand kill one of them.\n  As a matter of fact, it is possible to come and kill one of us. We \ncan't tell them to give us a plan how to protect us, as a matter of \nfact. We don't have a plan to protect ourselves, as a matter of fact.\n  We live in a democracy. The democracy is that we elect people to \ncarry out the duties under this book, the Constitution of the United \nStates. I say this amendment violates the spirit and the meaning and \nintent of the Constitution of the United States. It is not our right to \ntell the President to give us a statement of justification for his \nactions in seeking or failing to seek an agreement in terms of foreign \npolicy.\n  I do believe that we have a right, again, to schedule hearings, to \nask them to come up and give us their opinions, as we did today with \nthe Secretary of State--off the record, however, on a classified basis \nbecause of the nature of it. I believe we have an absolute right to ask \nhim to give us details of the money he asks us for. And he will ask us \nfor money, I am certain. But to go this far, to say that not later than \n30 days from the enactment of this bill the President shall submit to \nthe Congress this report, a schedule, to seek approval of the United \nNations authorizing multinational force; an estimate of the number of \nforces we are going to have there to guarantee reconstruction for each \ncomponent; an estimate of the number of personnel, armed forces of \nforeign countries that are needed to guarantee the stability and \nreconstruction--all of this--a schedule for the President to seek \nparticipation as an organization of many nations in NATO, ongoing \noperations in Iraq--I couldn't prepare that schedule. I couldn't \nprepare a schedule of my actions for the next week if I tried. And I \ndon't see how the President can prepare a schedule of his actions on a \nmatter so deep and so intricate as trying to determine how we should \ncomplete our actions in Iraq.\n\n  If I remember right, in October we passed a resolution the President \nsigned giving him authority to do what he is doing. That resolution \ndidn't say, and as you do, give us your plan of action in advance; \ndefine for us your strategy in advance; give us the number of people \nyou are going to deploy; tell us how you are going to get foreign \ntroops to come at us; go to the U.N.; go to the NATO.\n  We knew better than that. We responded to his request to get our \napproval of his intent to use his power as Commander in Chief to try to \nrestore freedom to Iraq. I am proud of this President and what he did. \nI intend to defend him as much as I can and assist him as much as I can \nin achieving what the Congress asked him to achieve, and I do not \nbelieve he should be put in a straitjacket to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will not take the time.\n  Mr. President, American service men and women are dying every day. \nThis amendment does not require the President to go to the United \nNations. It does not require him to go to NATO. All we are trying to \nfind out is what his policy is. If he does not want to go to the United \nNations, if he does not want to ask NATO to come in there and get \nadditional help and assistance and troops that might provide some \nrelief for ours--just tell us. Just tell us. He ought to be able to \ntell us, give us the answers very quickly.\n  All we are asking for is to know the policy. I think parents are \nentitled to know whether this President will go to ask for additional \nkinds of military force in terms of NATO--in Muslim countries, other \ncountries that will be interested in helping and assisting the \nAmericans secure Iraq. I think the American people are entitled to know \nwhether we will follow the other measures that have been taken that \nhave been successful in Kosovo and in Bosnia and also in East Timor.\n  If the President doesn't want to do it, fine, but just tell us. \nAmerican servicemen are dying over there. We are entitled to know what \nthe President is going to do.\n  But we do not have an answer now. We do not have an answer except \nmore of the same. And this postwar policy is adrift. It is bankrupt. It \nis nonexistent. It is being made up on the back of an envelope every \nsingle day, and American service men and women are dying. That is what \nthis amendment addresses.\n  Finally, the Senator from Alaska, as I understand it, voted on this \nresolution last week, where the Senate included in the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that the President should consider requesting \nformally and expeditiously that NATO raise a force for deployment. The \nSenator supported that sense of the Senate that the President should \nconsider calling on the United Nations.\n\n[[Page S9469]]\n\n  This was passed last week. All we are saying is, if you are not going \nto do it, tell us you are not going to do it, and tell us within the \n30-day period. If you are going to do it, let us know that as well.\n  I think the American people are entitled to know what our policy is \nbecause I don't believe they do know, today.\n  I reserve my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 12 minutes; the \nSenator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I sense the Senator from Massachusetts \nwants to place the responsibility for those who are in harm's way, who \ndo lose their lives, who do, as we say, make the ultimate sacrifice for \ndemocracy; and he wants to have a plan in advance.\n  It is true I voted for that resolution. It was precatory. It was a \nsense of the Senate saying to the President of the United States we \nthink he ought to get as many people in there to help as possible. We \nthink we ought to get the U.N. involved. We think we ought to use NATO \nforces to the extent we think we can. We think we ought to get a \nburden-sharing arrangement in Iraq because it is in the best interests \nof the whole world that we have eliminated Saddam Hussein. It is in the \nbest interests of the world that peace be restored in Iraq. I firmly \nbelieve that.\n  We passed a resolution that told the President to use all necessary \nmeans to achieve the objectives we outlined. He asked for our approval \nof his intention to deploy our forces to take down the Saddam Hussein \nregime.\n  I absolutely agree. I voted for the resolution. It had nothing to do \nwith asking the President to make the statements and to give us within \n30 days a statement of justification for his actions in seeking or \nfailing to seek NATO participation or a United Nations Security Council \nresolution: Thirty days; tell us now; and, if you haven't done it in 30 \ndays, you failed. How is that consistent with the Constitution?\n  If we want to sort of assess blame for the deaths that are occurring \nin Iraq or Afghanistan, as far as that is concerned, we all share the \nblame. We are Americans who asked young people to volunteer. We didn't \nconscript them. Every single one over there--God bless them--is a \nvolunteer. I think we are the only nation in the world today that has a \ntotally volunteer military. We asked them to join. We asked them and \ntold them what their duties would be. Their duty is to obey the \ncommands of the Commander in Chief and to support the Constitution of \nthe United States. Again, God bless them; that is what they are doing \nvery well. I almost puddle up thinking about the young people who die \nbecause of the request of this Congress and the President's compliance \nwith that request.\n  How we get out of this in terms of satisfying the demands of people \nwho want a daily plan for what we are going to do tomorrow: We were \nprivileged to see part of the plan that dealt with the embarkation of \nour forces going to Iraq. As I said here before, part of that plan was \nto go through Turkey. If that plan had been published about going \nthrough Turkey, and had it been discussed here, and had Turkey changed \nits mind, then the question would be, What was your contingency plan? \nWould we have published a contingency plan? We have contingency plans \nright now in case there are people who come back into Iraq who want to \nreally restore war there.\n\n  The Senator says the President said the war was over. We all thought \nit was. Today, the military forces who are there in uniform are there \nbecause we don't have a civilian component capable of maintaining \nsecurity in an atmosphere such as Iraq.\n  I just visited with some of the people who came back from there. They \nsay it is sort of a scary place. There are places where you can drive \ndown the road just like you would drive from here to Chicago. There are \nother places where you wouldn't cross the street. Our job is to \nmaintain forces there to protect people who have to cross the street. \nUntil our job is done, the President will keep our people there. Until \nthat happens, and until he makes the decision to bring them back, I \nwill vote for the money to support them. I will give them the authority \nand whatever he needs to protect them. And I will ask the Congress to \nmake certain that we understand we will get further requests for money \nfor Iraq. That is for sure. How much, I couldn't tell you.\n  Again, back to my great friend from Hawaii who made the statement \nabout his time as platoon leader and how he would not have known how \nmany grenades would be used in the next week. How does the President \nknow how many forces he is going to have to use next week to protect \nthose who are there? I understand that some of them are coming home. I \nsaw a young man in my office who told me about his experience there.\n  But I don't think we are in a position yet where we can demand an \nestimate of the personnel of the Armed Forces in foreign countries and \nwho are needed in Iraq and for reconstruction. That even implies that \nthe forces would be used to reconstruct Iraq. I don't think they are \ngoing to use military people to reconstruct Iraq. I think we will have \nthe council that has just been nominated put forth an Iraqi government \nthat will seek support to use their own income from their oil and start \nbringing about an economic system that is based upon supply and demand \nand have reward for every individual for their contribution to their \nsociety. I expect to see a really vibrant economy and a vibrant \ndemocracy in Iraq before I leave this world because of what we are \ndoing now.\n  Again, I urge Members of the Senate to support the Constitution. \nDon't get in the position where we try to dominate the executive branch \nby requiring a schedule in a bill which he cannot veto because of the \ncircumstances which exist today. He cannot do that.\n  We must protect this bill against any threat of veto. Certainly there \nwould be a threat of a veto. If I were President of the United States, \nI would certainly veto a bill that had that direction to me.\n  I urge Members to vote to table the amendment. I will do so when the \nSenator is finished with his time.\n  I yield such time to the Senator from Hawaii as he might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, it was not my intention to participate \nin this debate.\n  As it is well known in this Chamber, I was one of the few who voted \nagainst the resolution to grant the President of the United States \nauthority to carry out the strike. So my views are rather well known \nhere.\n  But on matters that are being discussed today, in war it is almost \nimpossible to predict what will happen tomorrow. As I indicated \nearlier, as a young lieutenant in charge of 40 men, if someone should \nhave asked me how many men I thought I would lose today in battle, my \nresponse would be that I hope none. But who can predict that?\n  Like many of my colleagues here, I have seen too many men killed. I \nhave sensed the anger of war, and I have tasted the hatred involved.\n  I say these things not to criticize my dear friend. In fact, I \ncommend him for bringing these matters up for discussion. But one in \nwar cannot make predictions, much as you want to.\n  Equally as important, in the world of diplomacy--and in this case \npointed out very astutely by my chairman, the Senator from Alaska--the \nPresident of the United States is in charge of the foreign policy of \nthis Nation. In the world of diplomacy, when one sits down with another \ndiplomat, one doesn't tell the world, I am going to tell that person \nthat I want this or I want that or I am going to do this if you do not \ndo that. It is just not done that way. Most of the conversations \nbetween heads of state are in private. That is the way it should be. We \nare not here to embarrass the head of state of some country by telling \nthe Senate that, in my discussions with prime minister such-and-such, \nhe said this and he is reneging now. That is not the way it is done.\n  Equally as important, whatever disclosures our Commander in Chief \nmakes, they impinge upon the future of the men on the front line. I \nwould not want any sort of activity that would place our men and women \nin jeopardy. I think if we force the President of the United States to \ndo what is required in this resolution, we may be placing our men and \nwomen in jeopardy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I understand there are 2 minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page S9470]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is important to know what this is \nand what this is not. We are not asking for war plans. We are talking \nabout how we are going to win the peace.\n  We have a policy which is adrift in Iraq today. Americans are getting \nshot every single day. We are not asking for secret conversations \nbetween heads of state. All we are trying to do is ask the President of \nthe United States, as we did a week ago, to consider going to the \nUnited Nations. We asked him to consider going to NATO. Now we are \nasking him: If you are going to NATO, tell us; and if you are not going \nto NATO to try to get relief for our military, tell us.\n  This is about the postwar period, not a secret plan about whether we \nare going through Turkey or how many bombers we are going to have or \nhow many ships. We are talking about the plan for the postwar period \nand where Americans are getting shot every single day.\n  The policy is adrift. We are asking the President to clarify for the \nAmerican people what his policy is. I think the American people are \nentitled to it.\n  I am prepared to yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the law we passed authorizing the \nPresident to proceed requires reports to the Congress:\n\n       The President shall, at least once every 60 days, submit to \n     the Congress a report on matters relevant to this joint \n     resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the exercise \n     of authority granted in section 3 and the status of planning \n     for efforts that are expected to be required after--\n\n  ``after''--\n\n     such actions are completed. . . .\n\n  That is in the resolution we voted for. That is the authorization for \nuse of force.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Paul \nBremer, the President's representative, our representative, in Iraq, \nwhich was an op-ed piece he provided to the New York Times, dated July \n13, 2003, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. In it, Ambassador Bremer states:\n\n       In all this, the coalition is working closely with Iraqis \n     who will eventually be responsible for their country's well-\n     being. For our three priorities--security, politics and the \n     economy--the strategy provides for the successful transition \n     to a stable and reformed Iraq. This does not mean that the \n     road ahead is without danger. The combination of a broken \n     infrastructure and acts of sabotage could mean a rough \n     summer. We will suffer casualties, as the bitter-enders \n     resort to violence. We are also braced for an increase in \n     terrorism by non-Iraqis, but no one should doubt our \n     determination to use our power in the face of violent acts.\n       Once our work is over, the reward will be great: a free, \n     democratic and independent Iraq that stands not as a threat \n     to its neighbors or the world, but as a beacon of freedom and \n     justice.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 13, 2003]\n\n             The Road Ahead in Iraq--and How To Navigate It\n\n                        (By L. Paul Bremer III)\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq.--Americans can be proud of the role their \n     fighting men and women played in freeing Iraq of Saddam \n     Hussein and his cronies. The people of Iraq are now on the \n     road to political and economic independence.\n       The first official step in this political transition at the \n     national level occurs today, with the convening of the Iraqi \n     Governing Council. This is the latest sign of progress. For \n     the first time in decades, Iraqis are truly free. More than \n     150 newspapers have been started since liberation. All major \n     cities and 85 percent of towns now have a municipal council \n     where Iraqis are increasingly taking responsibility for \n     management of local matters like health care, water and \n     electricity.\n       Iraqis are speaking out and demonstrating with a vigor \n     borne of 35 years of imposed silence. This is not yet a full \n     democracy, but freedom is on the march, from north to south. \n     Sadly, this progress is despised by a narrow band of \n     opponents. A small minority of bitter-enders--members of the \n     former regime's instruments of repression--oppose such \n     freedom. They are joined by foreign terrorists, extreme \n     Islamists influenced by Iran and bands of criminals. These \n     people do not pose a strategic threat to America or to a \n     democratic Iraq. They enjoy no support since their only \n     vision is to reimpose the dictatorship hated by Iraqis. Our \n     military will hunt them down and, as President Bush said, \n     ``They will face ruin, just as surely as the regime they once \n     served.''\n       These shadowy figures are killing brave Iraqis working with \n     us, attacking soldiers and civilians, and trying to sabotage \n     the fragile infrastructure. The attacks have drawn concern \n     worldwide. My coalition colleagues and Iraqi friends have \n     noticed that the attacks are often aimed at successes in the \n     renewal of this nation. A week ago, an American soldier was \n     mixing with students at Baghdad University, which reopened on \n     May 17. Their presence was testimony to the educational \n     progress that is blossoming here (public schools have also \n     reopened). But our enemies fear enlightenment, so one of them \n     killed the soldier.\n       The day before, 250 Iraqi police recruits graduated, the \n     latest success in re-staffing law enforcement. Tens of \n     thousands of Iraqi policemen are now on duty. But the enemies \n     of freedom correctly felt threatened by the cooperation and \n     professionalism the day represented, so they set off a bomb \n     that killed seven new officers. Before the war, women had to \n     travel miles for propane. Now, local councils are \n     establishing distribution centers that make the gas readily \n     available to households. On June 18, one American soldier was \n     killed while guarding a center. The June 24th explosion at an \n     oil refinery in Barwanah is another example of political \n     sabotage on Iraq's energy supply.\n       With these attacks on Iraq's new successes, citizens of \n     coalition nations ask how long we will remain in Iraq--and \n     some Iraqis may doubt our ability to improve their lives. As \n     President Bush has made clear, we are committed to \n     establishing the conditions for security, prosperity and \n     democracy. America has no designs on Iraq and its wealth. We \n     will finish our job here and stay not one day longer than \n     necessary.\n       We have a plan to support the establishment of this \n     government of, by and for Iraqis. After months of \n     consultations with Iraqis, we have take the first step in \n     establishing an interim administration. Today, the Governing \n     Council of Iraq will meet. It represents all the strands from \n     Iraq's complicated social structure--Shiites, Sunnis, Arabs, \n     Kurds, men and women, Christians and Turkmens. The council \n     will immediately exercise real political power, appointing \n     interim ministers and working with the coalition on policy \n     and budgets.\n       At the same time, the council will establish procedures to \n     write Iraq's new constitution. Once it is ratified by the \n     people, elections can be held and a sovereign Iraqi \n     government will come into being. So the question of how long \n     the coalition will stay in Iraq depends in part on how \n     quickly the Iraqi people can write and approve a \n     constitution.\n       The coalition recognizes the urgency of marrying economic \n     well-being to political freedom. For 35 years, the country's \n     assets were misappropriated or stolen. We are pouring \n     resources into re-establishing basic services and creating \n     jobs. Our economic reform plan will entail a major shift of \n     capital from the value-destroying state sector to private \n     firms. We are also creating a social safety net for any \n     resulting disruptions. And we believe that a method should be \n     found to assure that every citizen benefits from Iraq's oil \n     wealth. One possibility would be to pay social benefits from \n     a trust financed by oil revenues. Another could be to pay an \n     annual cash dividend directly to each citizen from that \n     trust.\n       In all this, the coalition is working closely with Iraqis \n     who will eventually be responsible for their country's well-\n     being. For our three priorities--security, politics and the \n     economy--the strategy provides for the successful transition \n     to a stable and reformed Iraq. This does not mean that the \n     road ahead is without danger. The combination of a broken \n     infrastructure and acts of sabotage could mean a rough \n     summer. We will suffer casualties, as the bitter-enders \n     resort to violence. We are also braced for an increase in \n     terrorism by non-Iraqis, but no one should doubt our \n     determination to use our power in the face of violent acts.\n       Once our work is over, the reward will be great: a free, \n     democratic and independent Iraq that stands not as a threat \n     to its neighbors or the world, but as a beacon of freedom and \n     justice.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to table the Senator's amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Corzine can go first.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is agreeable. I state to the Senate that Senator \nCorzine will offer an amendment and then Senator McCain will offer an \namendment. We will vote on those two amendments. Hopefully, we will \nstart at 7 o'clock on those two amendments.\n  I want to tell the Senate, I have been negotiating with my great \nfriend, our great leader--can I call you the great leader?--about the \nprocess. Senator Frist has agreed that I can state, if we can finish \nthis bill tomorrow night, there will not be any votes on Friday. The \nSenate will be in session. And on Monday we will be in session but \nthere will be no votes. It will be our intention to call up and start \nstatements and even consider amendments, if Senators wish to raise \nthem, on homeland security on Monday, but no votes. That is conditioned \nupon us finishing this bill before we go home tomorrow night. I know a \nlot of people want to make plans to travel west. You can leave in the \nmorning or late at night where I live.\n  As a practical matter, I urge Senators to cooperate with us and find \nways to raise their amendments. We will be pleased to stay in session \ntonight and have amendments offered and have them voted on at a time to \nbe determined tomorrow. We are going to try to do our best to continue \nthrough tomorrow. We do have a Joint Meeting of Congress for the leader \nof Britain tomorrow. That will interrupt this process a little bit. But \nwe will continue after that tomorrow and finish if Members will \ncooperate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Daschle and all the \nDemocrats, we recognize that it is a heavy push to do this tomorrow. We \nare going to do everything we can to meet this schedule. We have people \non our side who also have things to do the next day. We will do \neverything we can.\n  The Senator from Alaska is absolutely right, the Blair meeting, as \nimportant as that is, is going to slow us down. We have made great \nprogress today. We will do the best we can.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We can turn this into a little prayer meeting. So others \nmight follow the example, I yield to the Senator who wishes to state he \nwill not raise an amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I was considering offering an \namendment regarding Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico because of punitive \naction that was taken in the House bill requiring the shutting down of \nRoosevelt Roads within 6 months, simply as a punitive measure over the \nfact that some of the leaders in the House did not like the fact that \nthe Puerto Rican people took a position that they did not want training \nat Viegues Island. Instead, it ought to be done in a deliberative and \nprofessional process, just like any other military base, through the \nnormal BRAC process.\n  The resident commissioner or the delegate from Puerto Rico has \nrequested that I not offer the amendment. He feels very confident that \nhe will be able to prevail in conference. So at his request, I will not \noffer the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have about 1 hour 15 minutes under the \nsuggested schedule of the Senator from Alaska. That will mean the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, will have 45 minutes. He wanted 45 \nminutes himself. I wonder if he will take a half hour plus 15 minutes \nfor the Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I shall take care of myself, Madam President.\n  Mr. REID. We need to have some time agreement if Senator Corzine is \ngoing to be followed by Senator McCain. We cannot leave Senator McCain \nwith no time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator McCain assured me he would cooperate with our \nschedule, knowing the event Senator Inouye and I will attend tonight at \n7:30 honoring World War II veterans. We will come back to continue the \nbill after that ceremony.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Reed has been most cooperative. \nFollowing those two votes, he wishes to speak on the bill. He would \nlike to speak for up to half an hour after the completion of the two \nvotes that have been mentioned by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Because Senator McCain has allowed Senator Corzine to go first, I \nwish to make sure Senator McCain has time left to debate his amendment. \nIt is my understanding that the two Senators who are going to speak on \nthis will use no more than a half hour between them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair. Will the Chair inform me as I \napproach the 20-minute mark?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will put that in the form of a unanimous \nconsent request that we have Senator Corzine, then we have Senator \nMcCain, and that there be no second-degree amendments prior to a vote \non or in relation to both those amendments, and that Senator Jack Reed \nbe recognized following those votes to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1275\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1275.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n[[Page S9472]]\n\n   TITLE ______.--NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF \n                      INTELLIGENCE RELATED TO IRAQ\n\n     SEC. 101.

This amendment is premised on a strong view that \nintelligence and its honest analysis are vital tools in our war on \nterrorism. To protect the American people, our intelligence must not be \nshaped to win an argument, but must be used to inform.\n  This amendment calls for a bipartisan commission to study the use of \nintelligence related to Iraq. The commission would examine several key \nissues, including intelligence related to the following questions:\n  Whether Iraq possessed chemical, biological and/or nuclear weapons;\n  Whether Iraq had links to Al-Qaida, and;\n  Whether Iraq attempted to acquire uranium in Africa.\n  Earlier today I joined in a growing expression of concern by my \ncolleagues and the American people about the representation of \nintelligence information by the President and the administration in \nbuilding its case for the war in Iraq. Without a thorough explanation \nof why many of the administration's statements are in conflict, and \nhave included claims unsubstantiated by the best intelligence, the \nAmerican people, their representatives, and many of our would-be \ninternational partners in post-conflict Iraq, will most certainly begin \nto lose confidence in the administration's intelligence analysis, if \nnot their word. Simply put, the Nation's credibility, in my view, is at \nstake.\n  This credibility is important for the security of the American people \nwho have and continue to bear an enormously high cost, a heavy burden, \nin both life and treasure, with regard to our presence in Iraq. I know \nin my home State of New Jersey there have been seven soldiers who have \nbeen lost since the beginning of the conflict. It is something that \nimpacts people's daily lives.\n  We stand with our troops. We stand with the mission they are trying \nto do, to bring about democracy, but we do have a right, and they have \na right to have credibility with regard to the intelligence that is \npresented.\n  There have been a lot of accusations and allegations circulating in \nrecent days. Some may be trying to politicize this debate. This \namendment is an attempt to ensure that this debate does not become a \npolitical one, and that we focus in a bipartisan way on getting to the \nfacts.\n  In my view, in order to preserve the public credibility of the United \nStates, we need a thorough public review, one that is above politics, \none with conclusions that will be regarded as credible and definitive, \nnot only in the U.S. but around the world.\n  As we are now all well aware, in this year's State of the Union \nAddress President Bush said:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  The power of the President's allegations in those 16 short words \ncannot be overstated. The Bush administration, using legalistic \nlanguage, was leading people to embrace, at least in the opinion of \nmany, the view that Saddam Hussein had an active nuclear program. The \nPresident did not say the British were claiming anything. He did not \nsay they alleged anything. He said they ``learned'' that Saddam was \nattempting to buy uranium, implicitly accepting the charge as fact.\n  Although just 16 words long, it was a powerful statement that \nresonated in the context of debates that had gone on throughout the \nNation and the world for nearly 5 months, in every public forum, the \nfloor of the Senate, the halls of the United Nations, and across the \nairwaves. Only after many months did we the people and the Congress \nlearn this statement was based on information that our own intelligence \nagency earlier learned was false. In fact, the administration's own \nspokesperson said the statement was inappropriate for the State of the \nUnion address. And the Director of Central Intelligence has stated \nthat: These 16 words should never have been included in the text \nwritten for the President.\n  Yesterday morning, Senator Levin, the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, raised several areas of particular \nconcern, including: the aluminum tubes; the Iraq-al-Qaida connection; \nwhether Iraq reconstituted nuclear weapons; whether Iraq possesses \nchemical and biological weapons; allegations of mobile biological \nwarfare labs.\n  Furthermore, Senator Levin laid out seven questions about claims \nspecifically regarding Iraq and the uranium. He argued that these \nshould be answered in the context of a bipartisan investigation. I \nbelieve that is true, and I could not agree more.\n  This is not just a concern about the African uranium issue. It is \nabout whether there was a fair and full presentation to the American \npeople. But to that list of questions, I would add several others.\n  For example, if the information in the State of the Union Address was \n``technically accurate,'' as administration officials have lately \nargued, why was it excluded in Secretary Powell's 90-minute \npresentation before the United Nations only 8 days later?\n  Also, why did we learn about the misleading nature of these comments, \nnot from the administration, but from the International Atomic Energy \nAgency and the media?\n  This is not an academic matter. At stake is nothing less than the \ncredibility of the United States, and that credibility is important for \nprotecting the American people. That credibility gets weakened each day \nwe fail to have a full accounting of the facts about what happened, \nfacts such as who knew that certain information was false? When did \nthey know it? Why was it expunged from one administration speech but \nnot another? And why are we just learning about much of this now?\n\n  Keep in mind, political leaders around the world, not just here at \nhome, have staked their own reputations on their support of President \nBush and the United States. As a consequence, many of our closest \nallies and their elected officials are facing enormous criticism from \ntheir own citizens, and sometimes--and this is quite telling--from \ntheir own political parties. We owe it not only to the American people \nbut to all those who stood with us to be straight and to come clean \nimmediately; otherwise, this episode will only undermine our ability to \nwin support for other critical foreign policy interests in the future, \nand they are substantial. In fact, without a clear explanation, we put \nthe American people at risk facing a world\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\nwhere our partners question our credibility on many interconnected \nconcerns: Korea, Iran, Syria, and the road map to peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  We need to understand whether this is part of a broader pattern of \nselective release of information or just a series of unfortunate \nsnafus. Last October, for example, during the Iraq debate, Secretary \nJames Kelly was in Pyongyang, meeting with the North Koreans. At that \nmeeting, a meeting that occurred a full week prior to the Senate vote \non the resolution authorizing force in Iraq, the North Koreans admitted \nto an active nuclear program. Yet despite its importance and relevance \nto the debate regarding Iraq and America's national security posture \ngenerally, administration officials waited until after the Congress had \nvoted on the resolution--6 days, by the way--to authorize the use of \nforce before revealing the details of the North Korean disclosure.\n  To this Senator, that information was both relevant and timely to the \nIraq debate. Was this information withheld because it might affect the \ntenor of the debate, or might impact the Congress's view of the Iraqi \nthreat, or the relative view of the Iraq threat?\n  As Senator Levin and others have explained, there may have been other \ninstances in which the administration selectively, in some form or \nanother, misrepresented or withheld information to support their case \nfor the war in Iraq.\n  For example, the administration claimed there were linkages between \nal-Qaida and Iraq. But many now believe those claims were overstated or \nexaggerated, and based on scant and circumstantial evidence.\n  Another widely discussed issue relates to Iraq's purchase of aluminum \ntubes, where there was considerable debate within the intelligence \ncommunity about whether the tubes were intended for use as part of a \nnuclear program.\n  When these claims are added up, many people have concluded that the \nadministration may have been seeking to win an argument--not inform the \nAmerican public. And we need to know the truth. We need to be informed \nto make good decisions, to set priorities, to go forward, to protect \nthe American people. The American people deserve to be informed \naccurately.\n  The commission I am proposing would be completely bipartisan. It \nwould neither supplant nor interfere with ongoing Congressional reviews \nregarding the collection and analysis of intelligence related to Iraq.\n  So, again, I hope we can support this proposal. We need to ensure \nthat the facts come out. We should do it on a bipartisan basis, and we \nshould do it immediately. The safety and security of the American \npeople are at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to support the Corzine \namendment. I think this is an incredibly important amendment to this \nimportant bill. In doing so, once again, as I have done before on this \nfloor, I commend our service men and women who have served us so well \nin Iraq, as well as around the world.\n  We join in our pride and gratitude for their courage and their \nservice.\n  However, I must rise today to express my deep concern about \nrevelation after revelation of the fragile nature of the facts \npresented to the American public and the world about the reasons we had \nto preemptively, unilaterally attack Iraq.\n  Those misleading words in the President's State of the Union Address \nthis past January have brought into question the credibility of our \nGovernment. This is extremely serious. It hurts our country because \nIraq is not the only threat to our Nation, as the Senator from New \nJersey indicated. We continue to be threatened by terrorists in \nemerging nuclear countries such as Iran and North Korea. In order to \nwin the war on terrorism and ultimately disarm Iran and North Korea, we \nare going to have to work with NATO and other allies to protect \nAmerican citizens.\n  Unfortunately, the misleading statements about Iraq attempting to \npurchase uranium from Niger will make building such coalitions even \nmore difficult. This means our homeland will be less safe and our \nAmerican citizens less secure. This is a deep concern of mine. I wish \nthe misleading statements about Iraq and Niger were the only statements \nin question that the President and his administration have made to the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, there have been others.\n  First, let's go through what transpired with the statements on Iraq \nand Niger. Before the State of the Union referencing Iraqi purchases of \nuranium from Africa, the administration, at the direction of the CIA, \ntook out a nearly identical line in a speech the President gave in \nCincinnati last October justifying the use of force in Iraq. Then, the \nAfrican uranium purchase was back in the State of the Union Address, \nalthough we were told now this was a mistake by the CIA director George \nTenet. Then, the African reference was dropped from Secretary of State \nPowell's presentation on Iraqi weapons capabilities to the United \nNations just 8 days later. Then, Saddam's nuclear weapons came back \nwith certainty when Vice President Cheney appeared on Meet the Press in \nMarch and said, ``We believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear \nweapons.''\n  This was one of the main assertions used that took us to war, and I \nbelieve the American people have a right to know which is it. If it was \ngood intelligence, why the constant change of mind? Either Iraq had \nnuclear weapons or it didn't. If it was bad intelligence, who kept \npushing to use it in the administration speeches and interviews? We \nneed to know the answers to these questions. It is important for the \ncredibility of our country and for the trust of the American people in \nour Government.\n  It does not end there. We heard much about specially-made aluminum \ntubes that could be used to build centrifuges to create weapons-grade \nuranium. In the same State of the Union where he referenced uranium \npurchases from Africa, President Bush also said: Our intelligence \nsources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength \naluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.\n  But, in fact, an unclassified intelligence assessment back in October \nstated some intelligence specialists ``believe that those tubes are \nprobably intended for conventional weapons programs.''\n  Last February, Secretary of State Colin Powell told the U.N. Security \nCouncil that ``we all know there are differences of opinion,'' and that \n``there is controversy about what these tubes are for.''\n\n  However, the International Atomic Energy Agency, after conducting its \nown study, concluded the uranium tubes were not for uranium enrichment.\n  Which is it? Enough time has gone by; we should have and are entitled \nto answers. We are entitled to the truth. Most importantly, the \nAmerican people are entitled to the truth. Although we now have more \nthan 140,000 troops in Iraq, we have not yet found chemical or \nbiological weapons or even the plants needed to make them. We have not \nfound evidence of al-Qaida training camps, although in the runup to the \nwar the administration not only said they were there in Iraq but that \nthey knew precise locations.\n  Again, this administration has taken us into a new age, an age where \nwe claim the right to unilaterally, preemptively strike another nation \nbecause we believe our national survival is at stake. In such a world, \nthe intelligence used as proof for striking first has to be \nunassailable, has to be totally credible, or the American people and \nour allies will be deeply suspicious of any future claims.\n  The claims led to decisions to put American men and women in harm's \nway and in too many instances have led to the loss of life. We need to \nfind out the truth behind the various claims and questions, legitimate \nquestions that have arisen, questions that have been asked by \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, questions that have taken us \ninto the deserts of Iraq and put our men and women in harm's way.\n  The only way we can get to the bottom of this is to set up an \nindependent commission to get the facts, a bipartisan commission, a way \nto objectively look at what happened so it does not happen again.\n  There is nothing more serious than a potential nuclear threat to our \npeople. If there was ever a need for an independent commission, it is \nnow. We now\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\nface potential nuclear threats from Iran, from North Korea. We could \nface more in the future. American families and our American troops \ndeserve answers to the questions that have been raised. We all deserve \nanswers. We all deserve the truth.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in support developing this independent \ncommission. I believe nothing less than the credibility of our country \nis at stake. I hope we all join in supporting the Corzine amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise for a couple of minutes to \ncompliment the distinguished Senator from Michigan for her very \neloquent statement and for the leadership of the Senator from New \nJersey, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Both Members have \nmade their points very ably. I am grateful to both of them for their \nleadership in this effort.\n  The real question is, How do we assert the facts in the most logical \nand the most bipartisan manner? As we have seen on so many other \noccasions, the only way to ensure that is done with a public review of \nthe information provided and all of the facts available to us is \nthrough this independent approach. The Intelligence Committee has done \nan outstanding job. I commend them for their session, even this \nafternoon as we speak, looking into the facts as they are presented \nfrom those within the intelligence community.\n  As Senator Rockefeller has noted on several occasions, they are \nconstrained by their own understandable jurisdictional review and do \nnot have the capacity to go beyond that jurisdictional review when \nissues involving other branches of the Government, other agencies of \nthe executive branch, and certainly the White House itself, are \ninvolved.\n  So this affords an opportunity to do the right thing, to give the \nAmerican people the confidence they need that we understand now what \nthe facts are, what the story is, and how we can ensure as we make \nthese judgments we are doing so with the very best policy and goals in \nmind.\n  I think this is a very worthy amendment. I think it ought to pass on \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. I am hopeful we can do that this \nevening, and I am grateful to those who have committed to this \namendment, and especially for the leadership of Senators Stabenow and \nCorzine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise also in support of Senator \nCorzine's amendment. Yesterday was a very grim day in Minnesota. We had \nthe funeral service of the first Minnesotan to be killed in Iraq this \nyear in the line of duty, PVT Edward James Herrgott. It is a grim \nreminder that 63 days after the President declared the hostilities \nalmost over in Iraq, this young man lost his life on July 3, standing \nout in front, guarding the Baghdad Museum, the site where some of my \ncolleagues and I had swept by, well protected, just 2 days before. He \nwas killed, murdered by a sniper's bullet. At the age of 20, his life \nand all of its promise was snuffed out.\n  We learned last week from the Secretary of Defense that, in his \njudgment, the military presence, some major component of which will \nhave to be from the United States--hopefully much less will be, when we \ndo as we must, which is to internationalize the continued development \nand hopefully economic recovery in Iraq--but as long as there is going \nto be a presence there, United States troops are going to be a big part \nof that, and it is almost unavoidable under the circumstances, \nespecially as they exist today, the number of men and women who have \nlost their lives since May 1--which stands now at 79--will only \nincrease.\n  So, as Americans are faced, again and again, with a member of the \nfamily, a friend, an acquaintance, or just through the media a fellow \ncitizen of that State, again and again they are going to be confronted \nwith this question of, what are we doing in Iraq? What is the game plan \nto extricate our troops after achieving the success the military had so \ndramatically, remarkably in the 3 weeks it took from entering the \ncountry to sweeping into Baghdad with an incredible display of \ntechnology, the training, and most of all the dedication of those men \nand women who have really redefined the words ``courage'' and \n``patriotism'' for this Senator.\n  They continue to labor there under the most extreme conditions, 115-\ndegree temperatures, all the other difficulties that are manifest \nthere, not to mention the life-threatening danger that so many of them \nare under day and night.\n  Given all that, I think it is imperative for our national security \nthat we understand that we--all of us collectively in the Congress and \nthe President, this administration--made what is the most momentous \ndecision that can be made by this body and the administration, the \ndecision whether or not to go to war--in this case, to initiate a war \nagainst another sovereign nation. To know that decision was made on \naccurate information from our intelligence operations, to me, is \nessential to our national security in the days and years ahead.\n  It is also essential to our democracy to know the information we are \ngetting from our leaders is truthful, accurate, to the best of their \nknowledge. There are enough questions that have been raised that must \nbe answered, and they must be answered with the truth and with the \nfacts as that can be determined objectively and dispassionately to be.\n  I regret that the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which I am a \nmember, is not going to be undertaking the bipartisan investigation \ninto these issues as its counterpart, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, has agreed to do. I think there has to be that kind of \nwillingness on both sides of the aisle to seek the truth. I cannot \nunderstand why anybody would not want to find the truth and present it \nto the Members of this body and, even more importantly, to the American \npeople. But that is a decision that evidently has been reached.\n  In the absence of that, I think this independent commission is \nessential. We owe it to ourselves. We owe it to the Private Herrgotts \nwhose lives have been sacrificed in this endeavor. We owe it to the \nfuture men and women who will be over in Iraq, in future engagements, \nif necessary. We owe it, ultimately, to our country, our democracy, and \nto ourselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1270\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1270.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for certain programs, projects, \n                            and activities)\n\n       On page 120, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may \n     be obligated or expended for any of the following programs, \n     projects, and activities:\n       (1) The canola oil fuel cell initiative.\n       (2) Shakespeare in America military communities.\n       (3) Control of brown tree snakes.\n       (4) The Academy for Closing and Avoiding Achievement Gaps.\n       (5) Hangar renovation at the former Griffis Air Force Base, \n     New York.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment strikes funds for the \ncanola oil fuel cell initiative, Shakespeare in American military \ncommunities project, control of brown tree snakes, hangar renovation at \nthe former Griffiss Air Force Base, and the Academy for Closing and \nAvoiding Achievement Gaps.\n  First, I would like to address the Senate concerning the 2004 Defense \nAppropriations Act. With each and every appropriations act, I come down \nto the floor of the Senate to point out many of the special interests \nand pet projects Members add to the legislation each year. Today I have \nthe opportunity to speak on H.R. 2658, the Defense Appropriations Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2004.\n  I remind my colleagues, the responsibilities of authorizers and \nappropriators are supposed to be distinct. The\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\nrole of the Senate Armed Services Committee is to establish policy and \nfunding levels and to oversee the Department of Defense and its \nprograms. The role of the Appropriations Committee is to allocate \nfunding based on policies provided by authorization bills.\n  The appropriators' function today, as we all know, has expanded \ndramatically and the Appropriations Committee now engages in \nsignificant policy decisionmaking and micromanaging, clearly usurping \nthe role of the authorizing committees.\n  The chairman of the Rules Committee was kind enough, a week or so \nago, to have a hearing on a proposal I have to change the rules so that \na point of order can be more easily lodged against an unauthorized \nappropriation. I will not bore my colleagues with further details \nbecause I have already introduced the rule and explained it.\n  But during that hearing, chaired by my friend from Mississippi, \nSenator Lott, there was discussion of the process. This situation, this \nimbroglio in which we find ourselves, is not entirely the fault of the \nappropriators. I know it sounds strange for me to make that statement, \nbut the fact is that there are holds on bills which are authorizing, \nwhich are done anonymously in many cases, and prevent the authorizing \naspect of the process to be carried out, thereby forcing the \nappropriators to act in a policy fashion. Many times these holds are \npermanent and, really, there are some occasions where the Senators \nthemselves do not know that those holds have been imposed.\n  Additionally, there is the process that, unfortunately, results that \nmany programs and important agencies of Government even are not \nreauthorized. The Federal Communications Commission, which falls under \nthe responsibility of the committee I chair, has not been reauthorized \nsince 1993. So then it is understandable why the appropriators would \nact in such fashion.\n  I preface my remarks with the full acknowledgment that the system \nitself has broken down to a great degree.\n  As I came to this floor before and pointed out, the process of \nearmarking and outrageous appropriating has increased in a dramatic but \nreasonable fashion when you consider that any evil unchecked is going \nto rise.\n  According to information compiled by the Congressional Research \nService, which examined earmarks for fiscal years 1994-2002, the total \nnumber of earmarks has grown from 4,126 in fiscal year 1994 to 10,540 \nin 2002--an increase of over 150 percent. The level of funding has \nrisen from $26.8 billion in 1994 to $44.6 billion in fiscal year 2002, \nan increase of over 66 percent.\n  We are talking about real money.\n  We now see on the front page of the Washington Post this morning that \nthe budget deficit may surpass $450 billion.\n  I might remind my colleagues that there is a little chart on the \nother side.\n  In 2000, we had a surplus of $236 billion; $127 billion in 2001; a \ndeficit of $157 billion in 2002; and, in 2003 it is estimated to be \n$450 billion.\n  My dear friends, if you believe it is only going to be $450 billion, \nI have some land in the Arizona desert I would like to sell you.\n  This does not take into account, as recently admitted by the \nSecretary of Defense, $4 billion a month just for our operations in \nIraq, which I support.\n  My point is we can't afford to do this anymore. We can't afford to \ncontinue to spend money like drunken sailors. I never knew a sailor, \ndrunk or sober, who had the imagination to spend hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars on the Shakespeare in American Military Communities Project--$1 \nmillion. Shakespeare in America Communities Project? Come on. Out of \nthe Defense appropriations bill?\n  The hangar renovation at the former Griffiss Air Force Base--the \nGriffiss Air Force Base in Rome, NY, was closed in 1995. It has been \nreopened to civilian flight operations. In 1999, the airbase hosted \nWoodstock. Yet we are going to spend money to renovate the hangar \nthere. We are going to spend $2 million. On a closed Air Force base we \nare going to spend $2 million. Meanwhile, we still have men and women, \nwives and husbands and family members who are fighting in Iraq on food \nstamps.\n  I don't know what the Canola Oil Fuel Cell Initiative is. Canola is \ngrown in the Western United States and Canada. Forty percent of each \nseed can be produced into canola oil. Prices for canola oil have \ndropped, I am sorry to say. But we are spending money for a Canola Oil \nFuel Cell Initiative.\n  What does that have to do with defense?\n  Let me just add an additional comment. The very highly respected, I \nbelieve, Concord Coalition came up with a study in the last couple of \ndays which is excoriating in its comments. I think it is right on the \nmark.\n  The Concord Coalition Report on Fiscal Responsibility:\n\n          Deficits, Deception and Denial Rate a Failing Grade\n\n       The first six months of the 108th Congress were the most \n     fiscally irresponsible in recent memory. The crux of the \n     program was the schizophrenic pursuit of small government tax \n     policies and big government spending initiatives. Following \n     the lead of the Bush administration, Congress made no attempt \n     to reconcile the cost of new tax cuts on spending initiatives \n     within the framework of a realistic long-term balanced budget \n     plan. Instead, policymakers took a deteriorating budget \n     outlook and made it worse. To add insult to injury, Congress \n     used deceptive accounting gimmicks that would land a \n     corporate CEO in jail. It is hard to say which is worse, the \n     sunset gimmick used to hide the cost of an unaffordable tax \n     cut, the doughnut hole gimmick used to hide the cost of an \n     unaffordable, new Medicare entitlement, the shell games used \n     to hide the appropriations of the disingenuous budget \n     resolution that led to such in the first place. Then there \n     was denial. Policymakers simply closed their eyes to the \n     inevitable cost of reforming the alternative minimum tax and \n     the growing cost of the war against terrorism at home and \n     abroad.\n\n  I commend the Concord Coalition report to my colleagues which gives a \ngrade of a D and an F.\n  You know what we are doing. We are heading for a train wreck. \nEverybody knows it. I don't know whatever happened to the old lockbox. \nDo you remember the old lockbox where we were going to take everybody's \nmoney for Social Security and put it in a lockbox so it couldn't be \ntouched? You know what we are doing with the lockbox. It is simply \nbecause we are paying the retirement benefits of people who are \nretired. Those who are working have no money in accounts bearing their \nnames. It is unfortunate.\n  The summer blockbuster is not showing on your local movie screen but \nrather on the floor of the Senate. I am alarmed about a large green \nmonster, and it is not the ``Incredible Hulk.'' I am talking about the \nexploding national deficit, and it should make the blood boil. We are \nnow learning that the irresponsible tax cut and spending binge in \nWashington is resulting in this huge deficit. Even ``The Terminator'' \ncan't stop the river of red ink that is endangering our fiscal future. \nIt is like the ``Pirates of the Caribbean'' stealing our children's and \nour grandchildren's financial future.\n  I thought that was pretty well written.\n  I recognize the failure. I want to tell my colleagues that I \nrecognize that the failure of the authorizing committees to pass \nauthorizing legislation contributes to the broken system.\n  I want to work together with the appropriators to try to solve this \nissue because often the appropriators have no choice but to fund \nunauthorized programs and take it upon themselves to make policy \ndeterminations.\n  The fiscal year 2002 Defense Appropriations Act not only contained \n$3.7 billion in pork but also the dubious Boeing tanker lease. The \nconference report for the fiscal year 2002 Defense appropriations bill \ncontained $8.1 billion in pork. The Senate version included $5.2 \nbillion. This year's bill contains well over $4 billion. This number is \nless than last year's Senate version of the legislation.\n\n  This is real money.\n  The projects that appear in the Defense appropriations Member-add-ons \nare items requested by Senators and not included in the President's \nbudget request. They do not appear on the Joint Chiefs unfunded \npriority list. They are not authorized in the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  This criteria is used by many organizations. And it has been useful \nin ferreting out programs of questionable merit and determining the \nrelative priority of projects requested by Members for parochial \nreasons.\n  The fact remains that in the years I have created these lists no \noffsets have been provided for any project.\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\n  At a time when some of our soldiers and sailors still receive food \nstamps and live in inadequate housing, we find a way to provide over $4 \nbillion in unnecessary spending through the Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  For example, the Joint Chiefs provided a list of critical \nrequirements above what was provided for in the President's budget \nrequest. That list totaled nearly $18 billion for fiscal year 2004. We \nshould provide additional funding for defense for items and programs \nwhich the Joint Chiefs need, and we need to set that as a priority.\n  I point out once again that the bases in Alaska stand to benefit a \ngreat deal in this legislation. Alaskan bases alone will receive $214 \nmillion in unrequested spending for improvements, renovations, and \nupgrades.\n  Looking back at my career in the Navy, I wish I had been so fortunate \nas to be stationed in Alaska.\n  Some of the more egregious examples of pork in this year's \nlegislation include, as I mentioned, $1 million for Shakespeare in \nAmerican Military Communities.\n  What is wrong with Ernest Hemingway? I wonder why Shakespeare was the \ngreatest writer in the English language. But there may be a difference \nof opinion as to who the greatest writers in the English language were. \nWhy not Chekhov or Ibsen?\n  Forty-nine million dollars for the Maui Space Surveillance System. \nArizona is home to an observatory. But we are going to earmark $49 \nmillion to Maui while there are many observatories in the United States \nthat offer many of these same benefits.\n  Two million dollars for miniature autonomous vehicles.\n  There is $5 million for the bug-to-drug program. It is not often I \nbother the distinguished chairman but perhaps he can tell me what the \nbug-to-drug program is. There is an appropriation of $5 million for the \nbug-to-drug program. While he is looking it up, I will continue.\n  There is $1.5 million to educate the 21st Century Information \nOperations Workforce, $2.5 million for the Hawaii Undersea Vehicle Test \nand Training Environment.\n  I mentioned there is $2.5 million for the canola oil fuel cell \ninitiative. I would think the only canola oil the Department of Defense \nshould be investing in should be used for salad dressing for our \ntroops, not inventing batteries.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be interested in the bug-to-drug program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The so-called bug-to-drug program has an official name. \nThe official name is the Engineered Pathogen Identification Program. \nIts goal is to identify and protect soldiers from both unknown and \ngenetically engineered pathogens, such as anthrax, plague, and Ebola. \nCurrently, there are no pathogen vaccines. It would take 7 to 15 years \nto develop one.\n  This program is an attempt to shorten the time from drug development \nto its release for use as some type of an antigen to these pathogens \nwhich are very dangerous to our service men and women worldwide.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman for that explanation. It makes it \nmuch more clear. I appreciate that.\n  There are a number of them. One of them that is interesting is $9 \nmillion for SensorNet. SensorNet is developed by a company in Modesto, \nCA. They obviously make hardware and software because that is in their \nadvertisement. In researching this earmark on the Web site, I found \nthis 10- to 15-percent-off coupon on the Internet.\n  Now, I would ask my colleagues, if they are going to give average \nAmericans 10 to 15 percent off, and we are going to give them $9 \nmillion, could they give us 10 to 15 percent off? Maybe we could save \nover $1 million. They are giving everybody else 10 to 15 percent off. \nMaybe they could give us 10 to 15 percent off as well.\n  This is the advertisement:\n\n                     10-15% 0ff--Order Now and Save\n\n       At AccuLab Products Group, we understand the difficulties \n     of integrating science applications into the classroom. \n     That's why we developed the SensorNet Science Program--the \n     friendliest system on the market! Its ease of operation and \n     flexibility offers the user wide ranges of applications \n     without requiring a degree in computer technology. Our \n     precalibrated, precision engineered probes offer the accuracy \n     and reliability needed to perform in the toughest of \n     situations and are backed by a 1 year guarantee.\n\n  So they are going to give 10 to 15 percent off. I would hope we could \nnegotiate 10 to 15 percent off on our appropriation to them.\n  The hangar renovation at the former Griffiss Air Force Base, New \nYork, the site of Woodstock 1999. Perhaps unintentional damage was done \nduring Woodstock that requires that hangar to be renovated.\n  Of course, we are back to the old smart truck for the auto industry, \nand $12 million for the 21st century truck. It would be fun to drive \none, I am sure.\n  Here is an interesting one: $4 million for the Ernest Gallo Clinic & \nResearch Center. I love a fine wine as much as the next guy, I think, \nbut do we need to fund Ernest Gallo or his research center with defense \ndollars?\n  Here is another: $8 million for the New England manufacturing supply \nchain. This is above and beyond the $6 million earmarked for them in \nlast year's legislation. There is $9 million for the medical free \nelectron laser, $1 billion for the brown tree snakes.\n  The Senator from Hawaii and I had a discussion about this item and \nthe following items. The brown tree snake may be a serious threat to \nthe Island of Hawaii. The question remains--and the Senator from Hawaii \nhas never satisfactorily answered, at least not to my satisfaction--why \nthis money has to come out of defense, why the brown tree snake should \nnot be addressed by the Department of the Interior or the appropriate \nbranch of Government. Why do we have to take it out of the hides of the \nmen and women in the military to fight the brown tree snake? Shouldn't \nit come out of the appropriate agency of Government?\n  We have $150 million for breast cancer research, $85 million for \nprostate cancer research, $50 million for the Peer-Reviewed Medical \nResearch Program, $24 million for the Hawaii Federal Health Care \nNetwork, $3 million for tribal colleges-science lab and computer \nequipment, $3 million for Pacific Island health care referral, $1.5 \nmillion for neurogenetic research and computational genomics--this is \non top of $650,000 included in this year's omnibus appropriations.\n  These are all worthy causes. The cause of breast cancer research is \nworthy. The $85 million for prostate cancer research, it has no place \nin the Defense bill. When we are spending $3.9 billion a day just to \ntake care of our operations in Iraq, we cannot take much needed defense \ndollars and put it for other programs that are not related to defense.\n  So I want to talk about one other area that is of concern, and that \nis the potential impact on readiness because of our restrictive trade \npolicies with our allies.\n  From a philosophical point of view, I oppose these types of \nprotectionist policies. I believe free trade is an important element in \nimproving relations among all nations and is certainly essential to \neconomic growth. From a practical standpoint, ``buy America'' \nrestrictions could seriously impair our ability to compete freely in \ninternational markets.\n  I would like to point out something else to my colleagues. We impose \nthese ``buy America'' provisions while we buy from our allies and \nfriends overseas a much smaller amount than they buy from us. If we \nkeep restricting the ability of our Government to buy products that are \nmade in other countries, sooner or later those countries will \nstop buying equipment, military equipment and others, that are built in \nthe United States unless there is a compelling national security \ninterest.\n\n  ``Buy America'' provisions include these items: anchor chains, \ncarbon, alloy, or armor steel plate, ball and roller bearings, \ncomputers, diesel engines, and propellers.\n  There is a seafood waiver as a provision in this legislation in which \nwe dictate we can buy only American seafood. I wonder if there is a 3-\nmile limit or a 10-mile limit or a 100-mile limit. Or does it have to \nbe just caught by Americans, the same fish but caught by Americans, not \nby somebody else?\n  Why does the Department of Defense need to protect the American \nseafood industry? Why is the entire industry singled out for \nprotection? Why not protect the American dairy product industry? Why \naren't they covered?\n  Believe it or not, I do not enjoy coming to the floor on this issue. \nBut I\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\nwould argue--I would argue strenuously--that with a budget deficit--and \nit is in the headlines of every major newspaper in America: $455 \nbillion--we cannot afford to spend additional billions on unneeded and \nunwanted projects.\n  There are many projects on this list that I will submit for the \nRecord which are very badly needed and are legitimate but it is hard to \nknow the difference when all we know is it appears in an appropriations \nbill. All of a sudden it just appears.\n  Was there a hearing on the issue of allowing the Department of \nDefense to only buy American seafood? That is a pretty significant \nmeasure that only American seafood can be purchased by the Department \nof Defense. Was there ever a hearing on it? Was there ever any \ndiscussion or debate on it? No. It shows up in this appropriations \nbill.\n  Do we really have to not allow other countries to sell us things as \nsimple as anchor chains? What are we protecting? Could we save money by \nbuying somebody else's anchor chain and spend that money, perhaps, on \nupgrading the lives of the men and women in the military?\n  In case you haven't heard, my friends, we have a problem in the \nmilitary today, and it is keeping people in the Reserves and the Guard, \nand it is keeping people on active duty. I think if you watch \ntelevision tonight you will see interviews with a number of men and \nwomen serving in the military who have just been told they will be \nextended for another 6 months on duty in Iraq because there are not \nsufficient troops to replace them.\n  So instead of perhaps expanding the size of the military to meet \nthese new requirements, we are going to spend $1 million on the canola \noil fuel cell initiative, brown tree snakes, the Shakespeare in \nAmerican Military Communities project, and an Academy for Closing and \nAvoiding Achievement Gaps. The Academy for Closing and Avoiding \nAchievement Gaps is a grant to the Timbuktu Academy located in Baton \nRouge, LA to conduct research on academic achievement gaps between \nstudents of varying socioeconomic backgrounds. It sounds like a very \nworthy cause to me. But why again should this come out of defense \ndollars?\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. The amendment I \nproposed will eliminate the canola oil fuel cell initiative, the \nShakespeare in American Military Communities project, the brown tree \nsnake funding program, hangar renovation at the former Griffiss Air \nForce Base, and the Academy For Closing and Avoiding Achievement Gaps.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Galleries will refrain.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we had a time agreement and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and the Senator from Arizona have spoken. I will make a \nfew brief remarks and yield to my colleague. Then it is my intention to \nmove to table these two amendments. Let me state why.\n  First in regard to Senator McCain's amendment, I state this \nsincerely, I think Senator McCain provides a very useful function for \nthis Congress and this Senate with regard to the process we are \ninvolved in, the appropriation of money from the Treasury, spending the \npeople's money. I am very sincere. We have checked every one of the \namendments we have agreed to by unanimous consent with the Senator's \nstaff before getting that agreement. That is a process we didn't use \nbefore. At times they make comments that lead us to change the \namendments. And the Senator has, through this process, picked out some \nhe would like to take out of the bill or put in the bill before we pull \nit out of committee. Let me comment on a couple of those.\n  The Senator mentioned the brown tree snakes. We have provided $1 \nmillion for control of these snakes. That primarily is to continue a \nvery successful program so far that has been carried out on military \nplanes to Hawaii from Guam. These snakes are carried inadvertently on \nmilitary planes to Hawaii from Guam. The snakes are endemic to Guam and \ncome on the military planes at Anderson Air Force base in Guam and then \ngo into Hawaii. We hope we can prevent it. It will have an enormously \nadverse impact on the agriculture sector of the economy. But it is a \nmilitary function. It is trying to eradicate or control these brown \nsnakes where they come from, as they have been a menace to Hawaii \nbecause of their ability to crawl on to military planes as they come \nto Hawaii from Guam.\n\n  I commend the Senator for raising the question, but clearly we have \nexamined it. It is an ongoing program.\n  The canola oil fuel cell initiative is an existing program between \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of Interior. It is funded \nin this bill for $2.5 million. Both Departments put money into it. This \nproject will extract and convert technologies, transforming agriculture \nmaterials into bio-based fuel. Specifically, it is the rapeseed-based \nbiodiesel fuel, and the underlying goal is to convert bio-based fuel \ninto a hydrogen-rich gas stream to use with fuel cells and micro \nturbines and other power generation systems. It does have a legitimate \ndefense interest, and it is a program for the Department of the Army, \nprimarily in research and development.\n  Shakespeare in American Military Communities is a very interesting \nprogram. This is being done in conjunction with the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. It is a partnership with the Department of Defense. The \ngoal is to bring the arts to military personnel and their families as \nthey are brought to other communities and high schools throughout the \ncountry. The proposal for this year is to perform ``Macbeth'' on 16 \nmilitary bases in conjunction with educational programs. This is one of \nthe programs the military is very pleased that we are trying to make \navailable to them to improve the cultural activities on military bases, \nparticularly for young children. We are looking into the prospect of \ntaking some of these cultural programs overseas to meet the needs of \nthe people stationed there. We have under consideration Fort Huachuca \nand Davis Monthan Air Force Bases. I know them both very well.\n  Further, the Senator raised the question of the Griffiss hangar \nrenovation. This is part of a hangar that is used for the ongoing work \nand research of the Air Force research laboratory in Rome, NY. Damage \nto the hangar increases the heating, utility, and other fixed costs of \nthe laboratory facility to its detriment. It is a renovation of a \nformer Air Force base, but it is used by the Air Force research \nlaboratory.\n  I regret to say I disagree with my good friend. I do note that what \nhe is doing is trying to make certain we know what we are doing. On \nthis amendment, I am sad to say I disagree with him, and I will move to \ntable it in just a moment.\n  With regard to the amendment offered by Senator Corzine, I have a \nproblem, a decided problem with this. There is an ongoing investigation \nor series of hearings--I don't know whether you want to call it an \ninvestigation yet--of the items covered by this proposed amendment, \ncreating a national commission on the development and use of \nintelligence related to Iraq.\n  Iraq is still ongoing. To create a commission now to look into Iraq \nprimarily based upon the problem related to the President's statement \nin his State of the Union Message--which, by the way, was true, but not \nreally totally accurate in terms of the interpretation people gave to \nit--in order to start the campaign of 2004, at a time when we have men \nand women in uniform over there now, their commanders, Ambassador \nBremer, all of the people who participated in the process of this \nintelligence activity, including the CIA and the National Security \nAgency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, all of them will be \ninvolved in hearings before the commission. They are already in \nhearings before the House and the Senate, and they have unknown \ninvolvement in the internal investigation also going on in the \nDepartment.\n\n  As I said previously, almost all of us heard the Secretary of State, \nmy great friend Colin Powell, tell us about his involvement and how \nthis train of circumstances developed with regard to how that statement \nwas in the President's State of the Union Message. We all know \nPresidents don't write their own State of the Union Message. They \nreview drafts, and they rely on their\n\n[[Page S9479]]\n\nsubordinates to see that they are absolutely accurate. In the process, \na statement was inserted that could be interpreted in a way that could \nmislead people.\n  Already the Director of the CIA has admitted his system made a \nmistake. He has taken responsibility, as he should, for something that \nshould have been taken out by the CIA reviewer. It was not. It was \ntaken out of a previous statement at another time. No question was \nraised about its being taken out. In this instance, it was not taken \nout and Director Tenet said it should have been taken out. He takes the \nresponsibility himself because of the failure of his Agency, just as I \nmake a policy when any member of my staff makes a mistake, I treat it \nas my mistake. George Tenet didn't make the mistake. The process in the \nCIA made the mistake. The President didn't make a mistake. In the \nprocess of preparing that statement, there was a mistake made.\n  I am tired of making a mountain out of a molehill on this one. I am \nparticularly disturbed with the fact that people want to create another \ncommission. This is not a time for a commission like the commissions we \nhave known in the past. This is not Watergate. That is the impression. \nThis is not a Watergate. It is not even a ``truth gate.''\n  The President read a speech that was prepared for him. We all clapped \nat it, and we all approved of it. It was one part of it, one tiny part \nof it that should have been taken out in the process of review.\n  Now to create a commission primarily for that and all the rest of the \ngarbage in this thing--pardon my French--all the statements in here as \nto what is going to be investigated with regard to the possession of \nmobile laboratories, with regard to an attempt to procure aluminum \ntubes--it wasn't an attempt; they were procured. But the concept of \nwhether or not Iraq possessed delivery systems for weapons of mass \ndestruction--we had 17 resolutions of the United Nations that were not \ncomplied with. Why were they passing 17 resolutions if there was \nnothing to investigate?\n  But the main thing, why should we create a commission now to look \ninto something that is ongoing? Once this is all tied down and we have \nour people home and Mr. Bremer is residing in the U.S., and the people \ninvolved in all of the intelligence activities that led to the \nstatement are in the United States again, we can have some form of \ncommission to review it. This Senator would not oppose that.\n  But this is an ongoing operation, and this is an attempt to smear the \nPresident of the United States. I shall not permit that if I can \npossibly avoid it.\n  As I understand it, there is no further time agreement. I have the \nfloor. I intend to keep the floor until I make a motion to table this \namendment.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will ask my colleague from Alaska a \nquestion. I will preface it by saying I do appreciate the cooperation \nthat has been displayed while addressing this bill. I tell my friend \nfrom Alaska also that it has been very helpful for us to have the \ninformation and to be able to look at these amendments as they have \ncome up. I hope next year we will see Hemingway, Faulkner, F. Scott \nFitzgerald, and others of my favorite authors included in this program.\n  I also ask the Senator, concerning the Corzine amendment, isn't it \ntrue that the Senate Armed Services Committee is holding, and will be \nholding, hearings concerning the entire conflict, including friendly \nfire casualties, including the enormous success, including the issue of \nweapons of mass destruction; and those will be held openly and in a \nsystematic manner, which Senator Warner and Senator Levin have been \nworking on in a bipartisan manner? Didn't the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee hold a closed hearing today, and will he not \nhold a public hearing next week? Aren't we going through an orderly \nprocess of hearings concerning the conduct of the war?\n  The American people, of course, want to know about the friendly fire \ntragedy, and they also want to know how we did so well, how our \nequipment performed in such a magnificent fashion. It was one of the \nmost rapid military victories in history.\n  Isn't it true that we are going through an orderly process of \nhearings concerning this conflict, in a very appropriate manner? If at \nsuch time those hearings are not satisfactory to the American people, \nor they don't cover enough information, or something like that, \nwouldn't sometime later be more appropriate to say a commission should \nbe appointed rather than at the time when the appropriate committees, \nas far as I can tell, are carrying out their responsibilities and \nreviewing the conduct of the war and the oversight policies dictating \nour military? Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is absolutely correct. What is more, Senator \nInouye and I went to the CIA and we talked to the Director, and he \ninformed us that he sent a stack of material this high to the committee \nalready for its review. It is going to take some time to review all \nthat. It is ongoing. This would have us appoint a commission to review \nthe same thing that we are already investigating in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee and that the House is investigating. I presume \nthe Armed Services Committee has some jurisdiction on this matter, \nalso. The Foreign Relations Committee has jurisdiction.\n  Why should we appoint a commission to do what we should do--to do our \nwork, particularly when it is not on a timely basis? As the Senator \nfrom Arizona stated in his question to me, the time may come when the \npublic will question the results of our activities as Members of \nCongress. If they do, then the right thing for us to do--or the time \nmay come when they develop such a conflict within Congress that it \ncannot be resolved, and that would be an appropriate time to perhaps \nlook at a commission outside of the Congress. But right now is not the \ntime.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I \nknow we have been having these hearings and the oversight hearings. We \nare conducting the investigations. I wonder if the chairman is aware of \nthe fact that I believe the Office of the Inspector General of the CIA \nis conducting an investigation. I believe the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Panel had jurisdiction. Is it correct that the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, is \nconducting an inquiry?\n  At my count, at least five different investigations are going on. I \nwonder if that number is accurate, and does the chairman think that a \nsixth, which would not start until later on, would add anything?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the question is relevant because the \npurpose of this commission is to support ongoing congressional reviews \nregarding the collection and analysis of intelligence data. We have not \ndone it yet. We don't need any support that I know of. The support base \nis the executive branch and in the media to examine the report and the \nrole of policymakers relating to Iraq and Iraqi freedom. That is not \nover yet.\n  Again, there is a timeliness to commissions. But more than that, \nthere is the ongoing impact coming into this Senator's soul that we are \nstarting a campaign of 2004. It is too early to do that, when we have \nmen and women overseas in uniform trying to defend themselves and carry \nout the orders of the Commander in Chief. It is not timely to do this, \nand I do object to it.\n  Mr. President, I don't often do this. I am really going to be a \nlittle bit brash--you could not imagine I would do that, I am sure. \nDoes the Senator from Nevada wish to ask a question?\n  Mr. REID. No. I was hoping we could vote on Corzine first and McCain \nsecond.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was going to make that order. I am pleased that the \nSenator said that.\n  Mr. President, in order that the Senator from Hawaii and I can go to \nan appointment we have involving World War II veterans, I will take it \nupon myself to move to table the Corzine amendment and to ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that \nit be in order to move to table the McCain amendment, and for that \npurpose I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection. Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, \nfollowing these two amendments, there will be a period for routine \nmorning business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the votes there be a period \nfor routine morning business, and that the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed, make a statement.\n  Mr. REID. He wants to speak on the bill. After that, we will go into \nmorning business.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Reed will be making a statement \non the bill. Following his statement, I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be a period for routine morning business until the Senator from \nHawaii and I have returned from our event, which will be, I believe, \nabout 8:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only question I ask is this: We would \nlove to have you back here, but I don't think there is need to come \nback tonight. We have a schedule set up for the morning.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have not done that. We need to have the time to do \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Alaska wants to be here to do that, \nthat is fine, but otherwise, valiant staff will take care of it and \nwhoever is closing. We will see you back. That is fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in explanation, it is my intent to come \nback. The Senator from Hawaii will not have to come back. We want to \nenter into a unanimous consent agreement for the order of amendments. \nThere will be two amendments. At 10 o'clock Senator Byrd will offer an \namendment. I believe we will have an order for the Senate to come in \nsometime just prior to 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Nine o'clock is fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not going to make that order yet. That is the \nunderstanding I have, that we will come in around 9 o'clock and \nconsider two amendments, and Senator Byrd is to offer his amendment at \n10 o'clock.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The yeas and nays have been \nordered on these requests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1275. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2004 \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  First, I would like to congratulate Chairman Stevens and Senator \nInouye on an appropriations bill that has widespread, bipartisan \nsupport. It is never an easy job to bring this bill to the floor and, \nas usual, they have done an excellent job.\n  One of the most important aspects of this bill is the commitment that \nthe Senate is making to improve the lives of the service men and women \nwho protect us every day.\n  The bill provides a well-earned, average military pay raise of 4.15 \npercent and funds an increase in the basic allowance for housing to \nreduce our service members' average out-of-pocket expenses from 7.5 \npercent to 3.5 percent.\n  That being said, one of the most important aspects of this bill is \nits commitment to transformation.\n  Now, we have heard this word being used during the last few years in \nconversations relating to defense matters. So what does it mean?\n  Simply put, ``transformation'' is about changing the way our Nation's \nmilitary operates, through the utilization and development of \ninnovative tactics based upon new technologies and, of course, our most \nimportant resource--the hard work and training of our service members.\n  Transformation could be seen in the recent conflict in Iraq. Here, \ninstead of\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\na long, sustained air campaign, our forces were able to achieve a \ntactical surprise using precision weapons that destroyed our \nadversaries' ability to react to our initiatives.\n  As I have mentioned before, transformation could also be seen during \nwar when information was gathered from a variety of sensors, whether on \nthe ground or in the air, and that information was transmitted very \nquickly to commanders who could then exploit the weakness of our enemy. \nIt was a remarkable operation and it reflects the high level of \ncompetence and expertise of our Nation's service men and women.\n  The appropriations bill continues this revolution by funding such \nprograms as the development and procurement of such new systems as the \nDD(X) destroyer, the littoral combat ship, C-17 air transport, V-22 \ntilt-rotor and the Army's future combat system.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Appropriations Committee has \nrecommended funding for the procurement of 22 F/A-22 Raptors.\n  This program lies at the heart of transformation. The F/A-22's \nsupercruise engines allow for extended supersonic flight. This is a \nmagnitude longer than its afterburning predecessors such as the F-15. \nThe aircraft's stealth characteristics will allow it to penetrate even \nthe most advanced air defense systems while internally carrying GPS-\nguided munitions. This will allow the F/A-22 to clear the skies of \nenemy aircraft while nearly simultaneously attacking both fixed and \nmobile targets, such as surface-to-air missile sites. I hope that the \nauthorizing committee will join the Appropriations Committee in \nrecommending the procurement of 22 of these vital aircraft.\n  I would also like to highlight a program that I support, the Full \nSpectrum Active Close-in Layered Shield, or ``FCLAS'', which is a \nrevolutionary new technology promising to enhance dramatically the \nsurvivability of existing and future mechanized and wheeled combat \nvehicles without the normally accompanying weight gain. FCLAS has the \npotential to save many American lives and it is an important step for \nthe committee to fund this system.\n  FCLAS works by using radar to detect an incoming kinetic energy \nweapon, antitank missile or rocket-propelled grenade. Once the incoming \nobject is identified, FCLAS fires an explosive projectile to destroy \nthe threat at a safe distance from the vehicle.\n  Such a system is currently under development in Russia, Canada and \nFrance. However, those systems, unlike FCLAS, have a fatal flaw. Their \nradar systems are placed in a prominent position and can be easily \ndisabled with a single rifle shot.\n  In contrast, each FCLAS defensive explosive projectile has an \nindividual radar system. FCLAS is placed around the protected vehicle \nin a device similar to a smoke grenade launcher. That means if the \nradar is damaged in one projectile the rest of the vehicle's active \nprotection is unaffected. It also provides the same level of protection \nfrom every side and angle of the vehicle. The system is remarkably \nlight and has drawn considerable interest by those designing the Army's \nObjective Force.\n  Currently, officials at the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, \nDevelopment and Research Center are testing FCLAS and by all accounts \nthey are very pleased with the system's initial results. The Marine \nCorps and Special Operations Command have also expressed strong \ninterest in adapting this system for use in both land vehicles, such as \nthe advanced amphibious assault vehicle and even aircraft.\n  In closing, again, let me express my commendations to the chairman, \nthe ranking Democratic member, all of the members of the committee, and \ntheir capable staffs, for their work on this bill. It will be of great \nservice in the support of our Nation's service men and women.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcern that the fiscal year 2004 Department of Defense appropriations \nbill contains no additional funds for military operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. This is simply unacceptable and raises serious \nconcerns about the administration's long-term intentions in both \ncountries.\n  Given the commitments of the men and women of our Armed Forces all \nover the world and the risks they face in defense of our freedoms and \nnational security, I am committed to providing the tools they need to \nperform their jobs at the highest level. It is surprising and \ntroubling, then, that two of the most significant and critical \ndeployment of U.S. troops in years--Afghanistan and Iraq--do not \nreceive funding in the fiscal year 2004 Defense appropriations bill.\n  Clearly, these are not emergency situations that have only recently \ncome to our attention. These are ongoing military operations that will \nmost likely require a substantive American presence for years to come.\n  One hundred forty-five thousand U.S. troops are currently serving in \nIraq facing almost daily attacks from guerilla forces. Eighty-one \nAmericans have died since the President declared an end to major combat \noperations on May 1, 2003.\n  In Afghanistan, 8,500 U.S. troops are searching for remnants of al-\nQaida and the Taliban and trying to stabilize the interim government of \nHamid Karzai. Just yesterday, more than a year and a half after the \nfall of the Taliban, a U.S. Special forces convoy came under attack by \nunknown gunmen using small arms and explosive devices.\n  Americans are putting their lives on the line in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand we cannot find any funds for them in this bill.\n  These operations are certainly not cheap.\n  During testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last \nweek, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated that the U.S. has \nspent nearly $4 billion a month in Iraq since January and is spending \nan additional $700 million a month in Afghanistan. He continued that he \ndid not know if the figures for Iraq would go up or down in the next \nfiscal year or how much the administration intends to propose to \nCongress for military operations in Iraq.\n  Surely the Defense Department, in fact, has some idea about the funds \nit needs for Afghanistan and Iraq--and those commitments should be \nreflected in this bill.\n  Silence on this matter causes me great concern that our troops will \nserve far longer than we are being told and the cost will be far \ngreater than we have been led to believe.\n  I urge the administration to level with the American people and this \nCongress about the costs of our engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe fiscal year 2004 Department of Defense appropriations bill is \nexactly the appropriate mechanism to do just that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes the Defense appropriations bill on Thursday, Senator \nHarkin be recognized to speak for up to 25 minutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the next order of Democratic \nfirst-degree amendments be the following, and further that if a \nRepublican amendment is offered it be interspersed between the \namendments mentioned: Dodd, Byrd, Wyden, Durbin, Biden, Byrd, Kennedy, \nByrd, and Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there will be no further rollcall votes \ntonight. I understand that under the order Senator Reed is to be \nrecognized for up to 30 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that following \nhis remarks my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, be recognized to \nspeak as if in morning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, under the agreement entered earlier, we \nhave a lengthy lineup of Senators who intend to offer amendments to the \nDefense appropriations bill, as I just outlined. We will be voting \nthroughout the day tomorrow and into the evening in order to complete \nthis measure tomorrow afternoon or evening.\n\n  I have had a number of discussions with the chairman of the \ncommittee. As he announced a few hours ago, if the Senate completes \naction on this bill, and if the Senate can begin consideration of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill on Monday, the Senate will not be \nvoting on Friday.\n  I will have more to say tomorrow on the schedule for this week and \nnext week, after we have made further progress on the pending \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleagues. We continue to make good progress. I think it \nis\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\nclear if we finish tomorrow night, there being no votes Friday--and \nMonday is a no-vote day--we will be able to continue on Homeland \nSecurity early Monday during the course of the day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, just a few days ago I had the privilege of \ntraveling, with Senator Warner and Senator Levin, and other colleagues, \nto Iraq. I wish to comment upon my observations of that trip in the \ncontext of this Defense appropriations bill.\n  After the most stunning victory in the annals of military history, \nthe fighting and dying in Iraq goes on. The war is not over. It has \nchanged its character. Conventional warfare of major formations against \nmajor formations has yielded to hit-and-run attacks against our troops. \nWe are in a tenuous moment where the momentum of the battle has shifted \nfrom our coalition forces and may shift dramatically to opposition \nforces in Iraq.\n  We are being opposed by groups of Baathist diehards, Islamic \nfundamentalists, and criminals. Although this resistance, until \nrecently, appeared to be uncoordinated and spasmodic, there are strong \nsigns emerging that organizations are beginning to coalesce and we are \nfacing a much more serious threat.\n  Just today, in Iraq, a manned portable air defense missile was fired \nat an American aircraft over Baghdad International Airport, signaling a \nmajor escalation of the capabilities of our opponents and the ability \nof these opponents to interfere with our occupation forces in a \nsignificant way.\n  Another American soldier died. The mayor of an Iraqi city was gunned \ndown. Indeed, today General Abizaid indicated that we are facing a \nclassical guerrilla-type war situation. And I must say, General Abizaid \nis a person I had the privilege of serving with 30 years ago in the \n82nd Airborne Division. There is not a more talented and dedicated and \ndecent officer in our Army or our military force. His expertise and \nknowledge make him the most capable person we could have there. So his \nconclusion, I think, is one that should resonate through these halls.\n\n  Now, if one of these groups--Baathists or fundamentalists, radicals, \nor criminals--becomes more coherent in their efforts--and it seems, \nbased on today's events, they are becoming more coherent--then the \ndanger to our force will rise.\n  Let me suggest this is a startling revelation today. It was difficult \nto bear the sight of American troops being hit with RPGs, rocket-\npropelled grenades, but to have the capability and the cunning to \nlaunch a missile against an aircraft in Baghdad should send shivers \ndown our spine, not just with respect to Baghdad but throughout the \nworld.\n  One of the issues which I am sure they are desperately trying to \ndetermine today is: How many of these manned portable missiles are \nthere in Iraq? I do not know for a fact, but I would suggest there are \nhundreds, if not thousands.\n  While we were visiting the northern area of Iraq under the control of \nthe 4th Infantry Division, General Odierno, the commander, indicated \nthey had identified and were securing almost 3,000 ammo dumps, \nincluding small arms, all the way up to medium-range missiles with \nabout a 100-kilometer range. This country is chock-full of RPGs and \nother weapons. The other question is: If they are in Iraq today, have \nsome of these manned pads exfiltrated out of the country into very \ndubious hands? We face a serious issue.\n  Now, if all of these elements are able to come together with a common \npurpose--the Baathists and the criminal elements and the radical \nfundamentalists--we have a very serious challenge. And, most important, \nif any one or all of these groups can tap into an innate nationalism \namong the Iraqi people, if they can translate their disappointment \nabout their economic position today, their dashed expectations of what \nliberation would mean, then we have a great challenge to our occupation \nof Iraq.\n  To dismiss these forces as inconsequential or without support, I \nthink, is a serious mistake. What they may lack in popular support and \nskill--although, again, their demonstrated performance increases each \nday--they can make up in desperation and fanaticism. There are remnants \nof Saddam Hussein's regime. The disgruntled Baathists have no place to \ngo, and they know it. For them, it will be a fight to the death.\n  In Chris Hedges' brilliant polemic about the corrosive effects of \nwar, entitled ``War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning,'' he described a \nvisit to an Iraqi prison in Northern Iraq that was liberated at the end \nof the gulf war. In his words:\n\n       When it was attacked in 1991 by Kurdish fighters and \n     enraged civilians, 300 Iraqi secret policemen and guards, \n     including the warden, held out for three days. None of the \n     defenders survived. And after the battle, a triumphant \n     fighter expressed the wishes of many. In his words:\n       We wanted them all to come back to life . . . so that we \n     could kill them again.\n\n  This is the nature of the struggle and the combatants in Iraq. There \nare thousands of former secret police and Fedayeen, not just the 52 \ncards in the famous deck. We can expect fierce and persistent \nresistance from most if not all.\n\n  It is no surprise, then, that our military commanders assume that the \nsituation in Iraq will get worse before it gets better. We should be \nprepared for continued casualties on a frequent basis. Indeed, we \nshould be prepared for heavy casualties on given days.\n  Again, this is absolutely consistent with General Abizaid's \nconclusion that we are in a classic guerrilla war struggle today.\n  The most obvious objective of opposition forces is to inflict \nsufficient casualties on our troops so that support within the United \nStates for a continued presence within Iraq will erode and evaporate. \nAs such, our immediate response must be to communicate to the American \npeople that the road ahead will be difficult. We are likely to sustain \nconstant casualties, and we must commit significant resources to the \nstruggle to rebuild Iraq.\n  That is why the absence of appropriations in this bill for our effort \nin Iraq is unfortunate. The administration has not requested funds so \nthis absence is not the fault of the committee. It represents a very \ndeliberate policy of the administration to avoid declaring to the \nAmerican public, in an explicit fashion, the true course of our \noperations in Iraq.\n  We all anticipate that the administration will make a supplemental \nrequest early next year and argue that the funds are critically needed \nto cover costs that have already been incurred. But the American people \ndeserve something better. They should know these costs now.\n  Having decided to use military force to eliminate the regime of \nSaddam Hussein, we cannot walk away from the difficulties of pacifying \nand rebuilding Iraq. We may come to seriously question the commitment \nwe have undertaken, but to walk away at this point from the challenge \nwould deal a serious blow to our prestige and power in the \ninternational community. To ensure that we stay the course, it is \nessential the American people know the costs, and the cost of our \npassage.\n  Our efforts in Iraq ultimately depend on the attitudes of the Iraqi \npeople. They will be the final judges of our policies and our continued \npresence. At present, the long and terrifying shadow of Saddam Hussein \ncontinues to bedevil them. Many of our military officers and our \ncivilian administrators attribute the noncommittal attitude of the \nIraqis to the continuing uncertainty of Saddam's fate. There is much \ntruth to this assertion. But we should be careful not to see the \ncapture or death of Saddam as the ``silver bullet'' that will transform \nour presence in Iraq.\n  The Iraqi people seem to be withholding their enthusiastic \nendorsement for our efforts not just to await the fate of Saddam, but \nto be assured that the coalition can deliver at least the same degree \nof economic security they enjoyed under Saddam and, hopefully, much \nmore.\n  It strikes me that the Iraqi people are not simply motivated by a \nresidual fear of Saddam. They have grown up in a system that provided \nmeager sustenance in exchange for utter subservience, a subservience \nthat was enforced by ruthless terror. It will take more than Saddam's \ndemise to erase this pervasive authoritarian culture. It will take many \nyears and significant improvements in every phase of Iraqi life.\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\n  The most pressing demand in Iraq today is to provide a secure \nenvironment for our forces and for the Iraqi people. That challenge is \ninextricably linked and bound up with the economic revitalization of \nIraq. Coalition forces are occupying a country whose economy has \ncollapsed. Iraq under Saddam was a country in which everyone directly \nor indirectly worked for the regime. And now the regime is gone. \nPerhaps the single greatest long-term danger to our efforts is the huge \nnumber of unemployed. Unless we can rapidly put these people to work, \nthey will be vulnerable to the overtures of those who wish us ill. We \nare in effect in a sprint to revive the Iraqi economy before the Iraqi \npeople decide that freedom is not worth the uncertainty of a \ndysfunctional economy, and they become susceptible to the overtures of \nthose who want to eject us from Iraq.\n  Another pressing demand is to create a legitimate Iraqi Government \nacceptable to the Iraqi people. We have begun to take the first steps \nin that process by the selection of a governing council. This council \nwill exercise defined powers such as the appointment of Iraqi \nministers. All of their actions, however, are ultimately subject to the \nveto of Ambassador Bremer. The council was selected to reflect the \nethnic, religious, and demographic realities of Iraq. That was a \npositive and appropriate step. This council will participate in the \nselection of a larger conclave that will draft a constitution for Iraq.\n  All of these efforts are leading up to putting, as so many people \nhave said, an Iraqi face on the Government of Iraq. We all realize that \nthe longer we appear to be running the show, the more likely it is that \nopposition to our presence will grow.\n  At this juncture, we have avoided ceding authority to any one faction \nin Iraq. We are for the moment holding the various factions at bay. But \nthis balancing act will become more and more difficult as we approach \nthe time when real power is transferred to a real executive. At that \npoint, the traditional rivalries of Sunni and Shia and Kurd will emerge \nand emerge with some force.\n  One aspect of the new governing council that I find troubling is the \nattention and influence given to exiled leaders. According to a report \nin the New York Times:\n\n       . . . significantly, the new interim government will be \n     dominated by the Iraqi exile leaders and Kurdish chieftains \n     who carried out the long campaign to remove Saddam Hussein \n     from power.\n\n  Given the presence of Kurds in northern Iraq and their obvious \npower--they have their own army; they control their own territory--it \nis not surprising that they would have a major role. But giving such a \nsignificant role to the exiles seems likely to be more controversial \nthan constructive.\n  The best known of these exiles is Ahmed Chalabi. Chalabi has long \nresided outside of Iraq. In 1992, he was convicted in absentia by a \nJordanian court for embezzlement and bank fraud. He was sentenced to 22 \nyears in prison. It is not surprising that reaction to Chalabi and the \nexiles is not entirely favorable.\n\n  Hassan Zahrawi, a 23-year-old student at Baghdad's Mustansariya \nUniversity, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying:\n\n       We are the people who suffered. . . . They are thieves. \n     They do not know anything about the suffering of the Iraqi \n     people.\n\n  This certainly is not a scientific sampling. You could perhaps find \npeople who would endorse Mr. Chalabi. But I think we are taking a risk \nby inserting, insinuating exiles in a dominant place in this governing \ncouncil. I think that will strike a chord in Iraq and not a favorable \nchord as people who have suffered, who have very little, see these \npeople who have just arrived dominating the political process. It could \nbe a severe miscalculation.\n  Let me suggest another potential miscalculation. I read with great \ninterest Ambassador Bremer's op-ed piece in the New York Times. One \nquote struck me:\n\n       Our economic reform plan will entail a major shift of \n     capital from the value-destroying state sector to private \n     firms.\n\n  No one could disagree with that logic. But I think we have to be very \ncareful that we do not replicate the experience we have seen in Russia, \nfor example, where the winners of this transition of capital from the \nstate to the private market were the insiders, the people with the \nconnections, the people who were able to influence the government. We \nhave made serious mistakes in our occupation planning. I hope we don't \ncompound those mistakes by creating a government that has no legitimacy \nreally and that serves simply as a conduit to enrich those who are \nparticipating in that government.\n  All of these concerns resonate throughout a country with distinction \nand disparate regional characteristics. On our trip, we visited Basra \nin the south, Baghdad in the center of the country, and Kirkuk in the \nnorth. The southern portion is predominantly Shia. They are engaged in \na very careful balancing act between Iranian influences and their \ndesires to participate in a secular government but certainly \nparticipate so that their religious culture is recognized. They are the \nlargest population group in Iraq. We have been working with them. In \nthe south my impression is that they are still weighing all of their \noptions, and we have to be extremely careful.\n  In the north there is a significant population diversity, Kurds, \nTurkmen, Assyrians, Arabs. They are much more comfortable with our role \nthere. They have seen the example of several years of a virtually \nautonomous region the Kurds established after the 1991 war.\n  The most stable regions at the moment seem to be the north and the \nsouth, although there are incidents of violence in all parts of Iraq.\n  But the key point, the most dangerous place is Baghdad. There in the \nsuburbs leading to the west towards Falluja and up towards the north, \ntoward Tikrit, the ancient home of Saddam and his tribal relatives, \nthat is where the action is, that is where our soldiers are, frankly, \nbeing killed.\n  Our biggest concern at the moment is intelligence. Frankly, we did \nnot expect this type of operation, and we are rapidly and diligently \ntrying to understand who is attacking us, where they are getting their \nweapons and money and their support and supplies. Are their foreign \ninfluences? How many foreign fighters have come into Baghdad? We are in \na race to find out about them before they do us even more grievous \nharm.\n\n  There is, of course, the issue of how many troops we should have in \nIraq. I have heard reports that General Abizaid will recommend force \nstrength in-country of about 160,000 soldiers and sailors, marines, all \nof our Armed Forces participating in one way or the other. That is a \nfunction of how much we know. My sense is that if we don't know who the \nenemy is, if we have uncertain threats from multiple directions, then \nwe will err on the side of more troops rather than fewer. This \nsituation could go on for a very long time.\n  There are those who have said we have gotten ourselves into another \nVietnam. No, we haven't. That was a different time, a different place, \na different situation. We don't have a rural insurgency as we did in \nVietnam. We don't have a country that is a proxy for international \npolitics being supported and encouraged by a significant infusion of \nforeign resources, wealth, and guidance. But we very well might have \nour own version of Belfast or the Intifada, urban guerrilla warfare in \nwhich there is insignificant foreign support at the moment but, as I \nindicated before, more than enough people who are determined to attack \nus and to hurt us.\n  As we traveled around in Iraq, we talked about the issue of weapons \nof mass destruction. Just one point: I assumed in my deliberations that \nthe Iraqi regime would have chemical and biological weapons, but I \nassumed that they did not pose an immediate threat to the United \nStates. Therefore, I did not vote to authorize the unilateral use of \nforce. We have been surprised. But now what I sense is happening is \nthat the search for weapons which so many declared were absolutely \nthere and were so critical in their decision to mount a unilateral \nmilitary attack, now that has been transformed into a search for a \nprogram. I wouldn't be surprised that in the months ahead, based upon \nanalysis of documents, that some type of program emerges.\n  But with each passing day, it seems less and less likely that we will \nfind a militarily significant concentration of chemical or biological \nweapons. I thought there was no credence to the\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\nclaims by the President and others that there was an ongoing nuclear \nprogram in Iraq at the time, and I think that will be borne out.\n  Now, all of this leads me to several conclusions. One is particularly \npertinent to this appropriation. Our Army and our marines--particularly \nour Army--are stretched thin, taut. They won't break because they are \nmagnificent soldiers. They are under extraordinary pressure.\n  Let me suggest where our Army is. We have 370,800 soldiers in 120 \ncountries, not just Iraq. In Iraq itself, we have the 3rd Infantry \nDivision. These are the troops who led the fight into Baghdad. They \nhave been told they are going home; they have been told they are \nstaying. Once again, decisions have been reversed because of the \nsituation. They are good soldiers. They will do their job, but \ncertainly this is not the way to have a good plan, to rotate and move \nsoldiers throughout the world.\n  The 4th Infantry Division is in the north. The 101st Airborne \nDivision is in the north in Mosul. The 1st Armored Division has \nelements in the country. The 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted a \nparachute assault in the first days, and they are in Kirkuk. The 2nd \nBrigade of the 82nd Airborne is there. The 2nd and 3rd Light Cavalry \nRegiments are there. There are about 134,000 soldiers, together with \n44,000-plus soldiers in Kuwait for supporting operations. In \nAfghanistan, we will have, by the end of summer, two brigades of the \n10th Mountain Division. In the Balkans, we have the 34th National Guard \nDivision from Kansas. In Kosovo, we have elements of the 1st Infantry \nDivision, which will be replaced shortly by the Pennsylvania 28th \nNational Guard Division. In the United States, we have soldiers \ndeployed in counterdrug and other operations. Our Reserve elements are \nthe 1st Cavalry Division, 1st Infantry Division Brigade, and we have \nnew Stryker battalions or brigades up in Fort Lewis, and one in Alaska.\n  This is an extraordinary deployment of American forces. Included in \nthe total are a significant number of National Guardsmen. These \nNational Guardsmen and Reserve are one part of our great Army--one \nwhole unified element.\n  I have left for last Korea. We have 37,000 soldiers there from the \n2nd Infantry Division. I was shocked when I read yesterday of Secretary \nWilliam Perry's conclusion that we are in a serious crisis with North \nKorea. Over the last few months, the administration has been trying \ndiplomatically. But Secretary Perry, who is probably the most \nknowledgeable and experienced with respect to North Korea, is now \nconvinced that we might have missed our opportunity for diplomacy to \nwork.\n  One of the factors that goes into our strategy is whether we can \ncomplement our diplomacy with real military force. There is not much \nleft to do that. Those 37,000 soldiers from the 2nd Infantry Division \nare not the kind of combat power you need to stare down the North \nKoreans if there is a serious breach of the current situation. But we \nare stretched thin. We cannot pull forces out of Iraq. We would \njeopardize the mission there. We cannot pull them out of Afghanistan. \nWe would jeopardize that mission. We have to consider what is most \nimportant for the Army, and we have to make decisions. Those decisions \nhave to come to us quickly from the Department of Defense. What will we \ndo?\n  This bill should have considered and included those types of \nrecommendations--not our ideas, but the proposals of the Department of \nDefense and the administration, and there is scant detail with respect \nto Iraq and potential conflict with Korea. I hope diplomacy will work. \nBut we have discovered that diplomacy without credible and \ncomplementary military forces is not as effective. This is a situation \nwhere we are stretched and we have an ongoing classic guerrilla war in \nIraq, we have a situation in Afghanistan that is unstable, and we have \na potential crisis in Korea. We need recommendations from the \nDepartment of Defense about where we are going to get soldiers to take \nthese missions. I had hoped this bill would include such information. \nIt doesn't.\n  Certainly, I am going to support the legislation, but I hope these \nquestions are answered very quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9484-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9484-S9486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STEEL TARIFFS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, President Bush is working very hard to \nget this economy moving again. I have strongly supported his jobs \ngrowth and tax cut plans. I believe his hard work and those plans are \npaying off. But in one case I want to respectfully suggest that the \nPresident consider making a midcourse correction. That case is the sad \nstory of steel tariffs. It is a story of an honest effort by our \nPresident to save jobs that has backfired.\n  The backfire could not be coming at a worse time. As our economy \nrecovers--and I believe that it is--the last thing our country needs is \na wave of plant closings in the auto and auto parts industry. But that \nis exactly what will happen if the steel tariffs continue. The tariffs \nhave become a job killer in the United States and a jobs growth program \nfor Korea, Japan, Germany, and other countries that produce quality \nauto parts.\n  In March 2002, the Bush administration imposed tariffs of up to 30 \npercent on 10 different categories of steel imported from Europe, Asia, \nand South America. The tariffs may have saved a few steel-producing \njobs for the time being. But since their institution in March 2002, the \nsteel tariffs have already destroyed nearly as many jobs in the steel-\nconsuming companies of America as exist in the entire domestic steel-\nproducing industry.\n  Some auto parts plants in my State of Tennessee are already closing \nbecause of the higher cost of steel imposed by the tariffs. On top of \nthat, last Friday the World Trade Organization ruled that these U.S. \nSteel tariffs are illegal and in violation of global trade rules. The \nEuropean Union has already announced that it intends, therefore, to \nimpose $2.2 billion in retaliatory sanctions on American imports sold \nin Europe, ranging from footwear to fruits and vegetables. And that \nwould destroy still another batch of American jobs.\n  If these steel tariffs continue through the years 2004 and 2005, as \nscheduled, there will be a wave of plant closings across Tennessee and \nother steel-consuming States, especially among auto parts suppliers. \nIronically, many of the steel-producing jobs themselves will also \ndisappear for two reasons: One, when the tariffs eventually end, the \nprotected and inefficient steel mills will find they are unable to \ncompete in the world marketplace. And second, the demand in this \ncountry for this kind of steel will have dropped because automakers and \nauto parts suppliers will be buying parts overseas instead of buying \nU.S. steel to make parts in the U.S.A.\n\n  Fortunately, the President has an opportunity in September to review \nthe decision that he made in March 2002 to impose steel tariffs. I \nrespectfully urge him to chalk this one up to experience, to \nacknowledge that this exercise proves once again that protective \ntariffs are self-defeating and usually boomerang and to finally end the \ntariffs. Ending the tariffs would allow America's steel-consuming auto \nparts manufacturers and other American manufacturers a fair chance to \nmake their products in the U.S.A. instead of overseas.\n  I began to first notice the effects of the new tariffs during my \ncampaign for the Senate during 2002. Tennessee is home to at least 900 \nauto parts suppliers employing almost 100,000 people. Let me describe \njust how important these jobs are to us Tennesseans.\n  Before the auto industry came to Tennessee in 1980, we were the third \npoorest State. Only Mississippi and Arkansas were below us in family \nincomes. Our average family incomes were 80 percent of the national \naverage family income. Then Nissan came to Tennessee. Then Saturn came \nto Tennessee. Then BMW and Toyota and other automobile plants put their \nassembly plants in other parts of the South and the Southeast.\n  These automakers wanted just-in-time quality auto parts suppliers \nclose by. So to attract them, Tennessee built the best four-lane \nhighway system in the United States. As a result, and as a result of \nour central location, over the last 20 years, the number of auto parts \nsuppliers in our State has grown phenomenally, from a couple dozen to \nat least 900. These auto parts suppliers became the greatest \ncontributors to a new prosperity in our State.\n\n[[Page S9485]]\n\n  During the 1980s, Tennessee became the fastest growing State in \nfamily incomes. Our incomes by 1990 became 100 percent of the national \naverage family income--from 80 percent in 1980 to 100 percent by 1990. \nDuring this time, of course, we were losing many other jobs, especially \nin the textile industry, but the textile jobs were being replaced by \nnew higher paying jobs in the auto industry, and these auto parts \nplants usually came to smaller communities, to Shelby, to Rogersville, \nto Lexington, and to dozens and dozens of smaller Tennessee \ncommunities, usually adding 100, 200, 300 $30,000- to $50,000-a-year \njobs with good benefits. And because labor costs of these auto \nsuppliers are low--typically 15 to 25 percent of the cost in an auto \nsupplier's budget is labor cost these higher wages are not enough of \nthe whole total to justify having to move the plant overseas.\n  At a time when our greatest challenge seemed to be how do we keep our \nmanufacturing jobs from moving to China or to Mexico or to Southeast \nAsia, the auto parts suppliers in Tennessee seemed like a godsend. They \nwere good jobs that seemed likely to stay--stay, that is, unless some \nunexpected new costs forced the auto plants and suppliers to look \noutside the United States for a more competitive environment.\n  Enter the steel tariff. The President's decision in March 2002 boils \ndown to this: It slapped a tariff of up to 30 percent on 10 different \ncategories of imported steel. For Tennessee, most of it affected hot \nand cold rolled steel, the kind that is used to make cars and trucks in \nour country. Here is the irony. At the time of the tariff in March \n2002, many auto parts suppliers in America were buying only about \n5 percent of their steel overseas. In other words, of about $5.4 \nbillion the U.S. auto industry purchased in 2002 of steel, only about \n$270 million came from overseas. But as soon as this tariff was placed \non the 5 percent that came from overseas, domestic steel producers in \nthis country raised their prices on the 95 percent of steel that was \nbeing produced in the United States, and suddenly auto parts suppliers \nand other steel-consuming businesses were paying up to 30 percent more \nfor all their steel. In some cases, even more than that because of \nshortages.\n\n  In addition, steel companies broke their contracts in order to charge \nhigher prices to auto parts suppliers. The auto parts suppliers then \nturned to their customers, the big automobile companies, and tried to \npass along these price increases. The answer from the auto companies \nwas: Sorry, we are cutting costs; we are not increasing them. So \nbecause the auto suppliers could not raise prices to cover increased \ncosts, they suffered losses, and they began to lay off employees. In a \nfew instances, entire plants closed.\n  Both the automakers and the auto parts suppliers began to consider \nthe next logical step: looking offshore in another country for a place \nto build parts where steel is cheaper and is pegged at the global \nmarket price, not an artificial price as it is here.\n  Most small American manufacturers live on the edge. They are \nconstantly under pressure to cut costs, and if costs cannot be cut, \nthey cut a job or two. And if cutting a job or two does not do it, the \nonly option is to move all the jobs overseas where costs are lower. It \nis that or go out of business.\n  Let us think what will happen during 2004 if the tariffs continue. It \nis very predictable, and it is this: Auto parts suppliers will move \nfrom Tennessee, from Wisconsin, from West Virginia, from Minnesota, \nfrom steel-consuming States, particularly auto parts suppliers. They \nwill move to Mexico, to Korea, to Japan, and to Germany. There are many \nsuch countries capable of making quality auto parts where steel is at \nglobal market prices.\n  Since the United States tariffs do not apply to auto parts, only to \nthe steel material, the auto parts suppliers will do only what they can \ndo: Make the parts in Japan and ship them to the Nissan plant in \nTennessee at a much lower cost than what they can make in Tennessee \nusing United States steel.\n  This means small manufacturing plant after small manufacturing plant \nin small American town after small American town in State after State \nin 2004 will be closing their doors and shipping those good paying jobs \nwith benefits to Korea, to Germany, to China, and to Japan. These same \njobs that more than any other factor helped my State of Tennessee \nbecome prosperous will be gone, and I am afraid it will be hard to get \nthem back.\n  Let me say just a word about steel-consuming jobs, like auto \nsuppliers, versus steel-producing jobs, like steel plants. This tariff \nis a good-faith effort by the administration to save jobs in U.S. steel \nmills. There are more than 200,000 of these steel-producing jobs \nnationwide.\n  Here is the backfire. According to a study by Dr. Joseph Francois and \nLaura Baughman, almost 200,000 Americans in steel-consuming industries \nhave lost their jobs in the last year since the imposition of the steel \ntariffs.\n  So when one considers the huge number of jobs in the steel-consuming \nsectors of American business, especially the auto industry, compared \nwith a relatively small number of steel-producing jobs, I am afraid \nwhat happened last year is only a fraction of the job losses that will \noccur during 2004 and 2005.\n  Tennessee, for example, has only 3,396 steel-producing jobs, but \nTennessee has 100 times that many steel-consuming jobs, 328,000, and \n95,000 of those jobs are those auto-related jobs, those $30,000 to \n$50,000 jobs with good benefits that are in the small towns of \nTennessee.\n  This is not just a Tennessee story, Mr. President. The United States \nhas 12.8 million steel-consuming jobs, 2.1 million of which are auto \nrelated. The United States has only 226,000 steel-producing jobs.\n  I have selected at random a dozen other States and compared the \nnumber of steel-consuming jobs versus the number of steel-producing \njobs. I will run through just a few of them.\n  Ohio has 770,000 steel-consuming jobs. Those are the auto parts \nsuppliers. Ohio has over 38,000 steel-producing jobs; Florida, over \n470,000 steel-consuming jobs. Florida has only a little over 1,500 \nsteel-producing jobs. Even Pennsylvania, 72,300 jobs are auto related; \n553,315 jobs are steel consuming like the autoparts suppliers. Only \n35,730 are steel-producing jobs. Michigan, nearly 800,000 are steel \nconsuming, 11,744 steel producing. West Virginia, 8,800 are auto \nrelated, 57,932 steel consuming, only 6,718 steel producing. Same in \nNew Mexico. Same in Iowa.\n\n  Here is an interesting one. Minnesota has 248,047 steel-consuming \njobs; 36,550 of those are autoparts suppliers. Minnesota has only 1,087 \nsteel-producing jobs. The same in Wisconsin, Washington, Oregon, and in \nmany other States.\n  In conclusion, let me say a word and give two or three specific \nexamples of how the steel tariff has affected my State, Tennessee, \nduring the last year. Tennessee ranks fourth in production of cars and \ntrucks in the United States. It has nearly 100,000 employees in the \nautomobile industry. It is the seventh largest State employed by the \nauto industry and a growing number of indirect and direct jobs in this \nsector.\n  According to the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, more than \n70 percent of the employment of the auto industry comes from auto-parts \nsuppliers. One example of how a steel-consuming company has been \naffected by the tariffs is Arvin Meritor. Arvin Meritor is a leading \nautomotive supplier. It sells to the passenger car and commercial truck \nand trailer markets, as well as their related aftermarkets.\n  Arvin Meritor currently has six facilities in Tennessee in Loudon, \nMorristown, two in Pulaski, one in Brentwood, and one in Columbia. It \nemploys 1,500 people. In 2002, Arvin Meritor purchased more than 1 \nmillion tons of steel globally. More than 95 percent of that steel \nconsumed by Arvin Meritor in the United States during 2002 came from \nNorth American steel mills. Now, Arvin Meritor has faced a number of \ncritical challenges since the inception of the tariffs.\n  In terms of pricing, Administration officials advised the company \nonly to expect a 4 to 6 percent increase in the cost of steel in the \nUnited States after the tariffs, but their experience was far worse. \nThey found that cold-rolled steel prices from one of the company's U.S. \nsteel suppliers rose by as much as 25 percent after April 1, 2002, just \na few weeks after the steel tariffs were imposed, as compared to before \nthe imposition of the tariffs. The current price is 13 percent higher.\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\n  Galvanized steel prices from one of Arvin Meritor's U.S. steel \nsources increased as much as 40 percent after April 1 of last year as \ncompared to before the imposition of the tariffs, and the current price \nis 28 percent higher.\n  Once, Arvin Meritor had seven facilities in my State, but earlier \nthis year, Arvin Meritor announced the closing of its 317-employee \nGordonsville, TN, facility which produces doors, seats, and sunroofs. \nThese are the $30,000, $40,000, and $50,000-a-year good jobs with \nbenefits gone from Gordonsville, TN. This closure and the related \nreduction of Arvin Meritor's employment levels at its Pulaski, TN, \nfacility, which produces aftermarket parts, they have cut down by 100 \njobs. Both those incidents were due to the increased cost of the \ncompany's business units attributed in large part to steel tariffs.\n  A second example, the Dana Corporation, is one of the world's largest \nsuppliers of axles, driveshafts, frames, brakes, chassis, et cetera. \nThe company employs approximately 60,000 people worldwide. On April 1, \n2002, Dana employed 3,000 people in facilities in Tennessee. Dana is \none of the largest single purchasers of domestic steel in the U.S. with \nmore than 95 percent of its total steel requirements purchased from \nU.S. steel producers.\n\n  Due to its product line, steel is Dana's largest single cost. As in \nthe case of many auto suppliers in Tennessee and across this country, \nsteel represents a large part of the overall production costs of \nautomotive components. So after March 2002, Dana experienced steep \nprice increases on domestic steel ranging from 20 to 50 percent. \nCoupled with delivery delays and supply restriction, in other words, \nshortages, the tariffs have forced Dana to begin seriously evaluating a \nnumber of steps to limit its exposure to problems arising from steel \ntariffs.\n  Among these steps is the use of offshore facilities to produce \nintermediate and finished products, as well as the active procurement \nof steel from exempt countries such as Mexico and Canada.\n  Now, if the goal is to save American jobs, how does it help to cause \nDana, a large auto supplier, to move its facilities offshore--those are \nnot Tennessee jobs--and to buy steel overseas? Those are not Tennessee \nsteel producers.\n  A last example, Dura Automotive Systems, has five facilities in \nTennessee, Gordonsville, Greenbrier, Lawrenceburg, Milan, and \nPikeville. Dura employs 1,765 individuals in my State. It is the \nworld's largest independent designer and manufacturer of driver control \nsystems and a leading supplier of seating control systems, engineered \nassemblies, and structural door modules.\n  Dura is a leading supplier of door and window systems. Dura is an \nAmerican company that used to purchase 100 percent of its steel from \nU.S. steel sources, once again, a prominent supporter of this Nation's \ndomestic steel industry. Dura experienced a loss of $10 million in 2002 \ndue to the higher steel prices, mainly for hot- and cold-rolled \nstripped steel, and was forced to increase its steel purchases from the \nspot market which is even more costly.\n  In addition, Dura's lead time for deliveries of steel from domestic \nsources, sources in this country, increased from 10 or 12 weeks to 18 \nor 20 weeks, adversely affecting just in time the manufacturing process \nand imposing significant additional costs on Dura.\n  American automobile companies and companies from all over the world \nthat make automobiles in this country do not want delays in their \nautoparts. They want them the same day they order them, and if the \ntariff produces delays, that is just as costly as tariff price \nincreases. Overall, the prices for Dura's required steel have increased \nby an average of 30 percent since March of last year. The result, Dura \nis currently considering a number of strategic alternatives such as \nmoving production overseas and sourcing its steel from offshore \nsources.\n  That is very bad news to Tennesseans in Gordonsville, Greenbrier, \nLawrenceburg, Milan, and Pikeville; 1,765 families who have these good \njobs.\n  Our President, George Bush, is working hard to improve this economy. \nI am his strong supporter. I believe he is on the right track. I \nbelieve his jobs growth plan is working. I want him to succeed. I \nbelieve the economy is beginning to recover, and the last thing we need \nis any new cost on a major segment of American manufacturers that slows \nthis economy's growth down.\n  I fear if the steel tariffs stay on as scheduled that we will see \nwave after wave of plant closings in the automobile industry across \nthis State, in Tennessee, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West \nVirginia, New Mexico, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Washington, \nand we do not want to see that. So I respectfully hope as the President \ncomes to September and sees this opportunity, he will say: I did my \nbest. I made a good-faith effort to help save those steel-producing \njobs. It has not worked. It has backfired. It is the wrong policy, and \nthe best thing I can do for the American worker is to end the steel \ntariffs.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9486-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, Montana has been proud to send many of our \nyoung men and women over to serve in the Gulf these past few months. As \ntheir stories come back to us, we see more clearly the personal side of \nthis war. We see the bravery, the commitment, and the courage of these \nmen and women. Our Armed Forces remain engaged in a complicated, \ndifficult effort, and they continue to carry out their mission with the \ntype of professionalism and compassion that you could expect only from \nthe most dedicated and finely trained individuals.\n  As I have done before, I would like to take the time this morning to \nacknowledge a few of the many Montanans we have serving in the Gulf \nregion. It is important that we let them know just how proud of them we \nare.\n  I have recently received news that Marine Cpl Chad M. Taylor, of \nKalispell, MT, has been awarded the Purple Heart. Chad was wounded last \nmonth while serving somewhere between the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and \nTikrit. He was riding in an amphibious personnel carrier when it was \nhit by two rocket-propelled grenades. He has sustained shrapnel wounds \nin his legs, and he told his folks it would probably take ``a couple of \nsurgeries'' to put him right.\n  Chad has not been the only member of his family serving over in the \nGulf--his twin brother Bobby is also a marine. The brothers joined up \nthe same day, almost 4 years ago now. Before Chad's injury, both of \nthem were stationed for a time in Baghdad, camping in separate Saddam \npalaces a few blocks apart. We hear they have seen each other fairly \nregularly, and once, passing in the steets of Baghdad, were able to \nexchange a high-five.\n  The boys' father says it is some relief to know that Chad is now \nsafe, though wounded, but with Bobby still in the field, he remains \n``on pins and needles.'' We are all praying for Chad's quick recovery \nand Bobby's safe return. Hopefully, it will not be too long before this \nstrong family can be back together again, celebrating the service and \nsuccess of their wonderful boys.\n  LCpl Mike Tobey is also among those who have been wounded in Iraq. \nMike's legs were broken in multiple places when a shell struck his \ntroop carrier during the fighting in Baghdad. How's this for bravery \nand commitment? When interviewed by reporters he said, ``I'd give \nanything to be back with the squad right now.''\n  Mike's mother Julie lives in Whitefish, MT, and Mike's bravery has \nreally brought the human side of this war into the lives of local \nresidents. Mike has in fact become quite a local media sensation, \nindicating just how deeply support for our troops runs in Montana.\n  Maj Patricia Camel Kelly of Ronan, MT, is currently serving as a \nsurgical nurse in the 86th Combat Area Hospital in Iraq. She is working \nat an Enemy\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\nPrisoner of War camp, an experience she says will make her more \nconfident as a family nurse practitioner when she returns to civilian \nlife.\n  Major Kelly was previously a community health nurse with the Indian \nHealth Service in St. Ignatius, and has a masters in community health \nnursing from Tulane University. She entered the Army in 1987, when her \nson Richard was a junior in high school, and while I am sure she is \ncorrect when she says she is still adding to her skills, it is hard for \nme to try to picture something this woman couldn't handle.\n  Major Kelly was one of the first tribal members to graduate from the \nMontana State University School of Nursing and is now one of many \nNative Americans serving overseas. She is of Pend Oreille descent and a \nmember of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. Her mother Alice \nCamel is a tribal elder.\n  After Major Kelly returns from Iraq, she plans to serve out the \nremainder of her time in the Army in Fort Lewis, WAF, and then move \nback home to the Flathead Indian Reservation. Her husband Isaac Kelly a \nretired Army master sergeant and her son Richard Janssen are among \nthose eagerly awaiting her safe return.\n  Native Americans are probably serving in the highest percentage of \nany population in the country. Certainly there is strong evidence of \nthis patriotic commitment to service in Montana. A good example is the \nRocky Boy Tribe, which has 30 members on active military duty, despite \na population of less than 3,000. Among those serving in the Gulf from \nRocky Boy are two sisters, Crystal and Tashina Russette, both in the \nNavy, and Jason Torivio serving aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln.\n  Army CPL Angela Duran, mother of two small children and sister to a \nveteran of the first Gulf war, has now also been deployed. Her mother \nLinda will care for her two sons, ages 3 and 5, while she is away.\n  Ninety-one members of the Blackfeet Reservation are serving in the \nArmed Forces currently, with roughly 40 of them deployed for the Iraq \nwar. Among those representing the Blackfeet Nation in the Gulf are PFC \nCarl Logan Kipp, part of the Army's Psychological Operations, and PFC \nIvan Redhorn, recently deployed to the Gulf. Abe Birdrattler is serving \nin the Army's 3rd Division as a medic. Two of the Tucker boys, Brian, \nof the 101st Airborne, and his older brother Ronald, an Army \nspecialist, and PFC Aretha Bullplume are also among those serving from \nthe reservation.\n  These tribes have a strong history of community support for their \nmembers of the military, and they have been continuing that tradition \nwith letters to their soldiers and care for their families. It feels \ngood to know that when these troops come home, they will be receiving \nthe kind of honor and respect from their community that all our troops \ndeserve.\n  PO3 Travis Woodward of Superior, MT, has been serving aboard the \nU.S.S. Valley Forge and lending his expertise to an Australian ship as \npart of a cooperative coalition effort. Prior to this conflict, he has \nbeen part of a boarding team searching for drugs aboard foreign ships \nand enforcing United States sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  Travis's time in the Navy is coming to an end this June, when he will \nbe able to return to his wife and son back home in Montana. It will be \na pleasure to see him rejoin his family and the Superior community.\n  PFC Frank Valenti is serving near Baghdad in the Transportation \nDivision of the Army's 3rd Cavalry Division. He seems to be posterboy \nof what the Army can do to transform the life of a young man. From the \ndescription his mother gives, it seems Frank wasn't up to much after \nhigh school, kind of a sleep late, party hard kind of guy, and then he \ndecided to turn his life around.\n  Joining the Army has really allowed him to start making something of \nhimself. He married his longtime sweetheart and is serving his country \nand accomplishing things he can be proud of for the rest of his life. \nIt is night and day from a few years ago for him, and it shows you a \nlittle bit about what kind of an institution our military is and what \nit means to become part of something larger than yourself, what it \nmeans to serve your country as Frank is doing.\n  Frank's brother Nathan Valenti is an Army pharmacy specialist serving \nin Germany, and I know their mother is very proud of both her boys, as \nshe has every right to be. We are proud of them too.\n  Army CPT David Michael Gercken is a veteran of Operations Desert \nShield and Desert Storm of the first Iraq conflict and is now serving \nin Iraq again. He is the father of three children, with a fourth child \ndue July 1, when David will still be in Iraq.\n  David was raised in Great Falls and went on to attend college and met \nhis wife at the University of Montana in Missoula. David is a Montanan \nthrough and through, and just before his deployment he sent me this \nstatement via his parents. I would like to share it with you:\n\n       Montanans have always shown a pioneering spirit and a \n     dedication to democratic principles and the defense of \n     freedom. As an Army officer I am very proud to take that same \n     spirit with me when I deploy next week with the 1st Armored \n     Division. GO GRIZ!!!!\n\n  A father, a veteran, and a proud, dedicated protector of this country \nand our values.\n  SSG Neil Bohne of Frenchtown, MT, joined the Air Force in 1998 and \nwas deployed in Turkey in 1999 as part of Operation Northern Watch, \nwhich patrolled the no-fly zone in northern Iraq prior to this \nconflict, and later helped set up the first ever Coalition Life Support \nShop in the former Soviet Union. He is now deployed to the 379th \nExpeditionary Wing in Iraq. His letters home have been reprinted in the \nMissoulian, and he has developed quite a local following. We know the \nsupport of hometown folks is very important to him, as it is to all our \ntroops out their putting their lives on the line so far from home. We \nwant to make sure he knows how proud we are of the job he and the rest \nof our forces have done and are continuing to do as they work to secure \nthe peace and protect the freedoms we hold so dear.\n  LT Paul Tripp of the U.S. Navy is another man with a large hometown \nfollowing. Paul's grandfather, Clarence, moved to Missoula from \nMinnesota with all nine of this brothers and sisters in the 1940s. The \nTripp family has been a large and wonderful part of the community ever \nsince.\n  Lieutenant Tripp has been serving the war effort as a code-breaker \nstationed in Saudi Arabia. He holds two master's degrees, in human \nresources and business management, and is considering pursuing a \ndoctoral degree after he retires from the service. It is no surprise \nthat a man this committed to education would have a tendency to make \ninsightful comments, and I still return to a few lines from e-mail that \nwere printed in the Missoulian, I guess about a month ago now. I would \nlike to share his words with you all because I feel he really is able \nto articulate that which so many of us feel:\n\n       As I travel and talk to people around this region, I want \n     you to know how absolutely swelled up with gratitude and \n     pride you should be to call yourselves Americans. There are \n     men and women from every corner of our country serving you. \n     There are women who have left their children, married couples \n     who are at different bases serving at the same time, men who \n     are single fathers that have left their children, and every \n     variation in between.\n       People are sleeping on cots, showering in trailers and \n     walking in the sand \\1/4\\ mile to go to the bathroom--all in \n     the name of freedom. We have such adaptable unselfish willing \n     citizens over here that at times I am speechless from \n     humility.\n\n  Nickolas Kyle Neilan is currently serving aboard the USS Alonzo, a \nguided missile Aegis cruiser. Nickolas is a Big Fork and Missoula \nnative who has remained in touch with his home even while nine time \nzones away, reading the Missoulian online and corresponding with folks \nback home via e-mail. His service has been filled with long stretches \nat sea without a chance to dock and escape the confines of the ship, \nbut like so many other of our servicemen and women, he bears these \nhardships calmly, simply doing his job and doing it well. He is the \nkind of young person we Montanans are proud to call one of our own.\n  Another Montanan serving at sea, PO3 Benjamin Taylor, is home now. He \nand Jason Torivio from Rocky Boy, whom I mentioned earlier, and Joe \nKeller of Harlowton serve aboard the USS\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\nAbraham Lincoln, part of a battle group that, until this past Friday, \nhad been at sea longer than any other carrier group now on duty. They \ndocked in San Diego briefly and are now on their way back to their \nhomeport in Everett, WA. Joe Keller was able to debark in San Diego and \nfly home to Billings/Logan Airport, where he was met by his wife and \ntwo children and other family members.\n  Benjamin Taylor is a graduate of Sentinel High School and the \nUniversity of Montana--he and his family have long been a strong part \nof the Missoula community, and I understand a large Missoula contingent \nwas planning to make the trip to meet the ship dockside.\n  As the sailors aboard the Lincoln are arriving home, other Montanans \nare just arriving in Iraq, ready to pick up the task of security and \nrebuilding, now that the task of toppling Saddam's regime is done. Many \nof these newly deployed soldiers are members of the Army Reserves who \nhave been called up to active duty for this conflict. The 495th \nTransportation Battalion from Kalispell, MT, just shipped out a couple \nweeks ago, and the 889th Transportation Battalion, also primarily of \nKalispell, shipped out last week. The task before them is complex and \ndifficult. It will test their training and their character, but we know \nthey are up to the job. They have our confidence, and they are in our \nprayers.\n  Reservists are those who train on weekends a couple weeks a year, \nremaining ready for duty while still holding down civilian jobs and \noften raising families. When reservists are called up, they are asked \nto leave those jobs and families, to drop everything and heed the call \nto duty. Their employers are also asked to contribute, by granting \nflexibility to accommodate their training schedule, and of course to \naccommodate their sudden departure in time of conflict. The 125th \nOrdnance Battalion from Billings, MT. has contacted me with a short \nlist of soldiers they feel are deserving of special recognition for \nserving in this special capacity. I hope hearing their stories gives \nyou an idea of what kind of sacrifices so many of our reservists are \ngladly making in this conflict--the members of the 495th, and the \n889th, and members from other companies around the State.\n  SGT Stacy F. Wright of Billings is enroute to Iraq to serve as a \nlegal NCO. She has served as an active-duty member of the military \nbefore, but this time is leaving behind her husband, two children, a \nranch, and a job as an administrative assistant in the Internal Revenue \nService in order to serve her country.\n  SGT JJ Hutzenbeiler of Billings is now serving in Uzbekistan as a \nsupply NCO, leaving behind his wife and job as a loan officer at 1st \nInterstate Bank.\n  SPEC Jesse C. Ryan is a student at Montana State University in \nBozeman and was called up to serve in Iraq as a chemical Specialist.\n  SGT Jack E. Walker of Billings is enroute to Iraq as a motor \nsergeant. Jack has also served active duty before, but now must part \nwith his wife, two children and small farm to do so.\n  SSGT Norman Richey, also experienced as an active-duty soldier, is \nenroute to New Mexico as a supply NCO. He leaves behind a job as a \ncorrectional officer for the New Mexico Department of Corrections.\n  SGT Chris Alamond is serving in Iraq as a communications NCO, having \nbeen called away from his wife and job as a mail handler for the U.S. \nPostal Service.\n  CAPT Nadine Elmore of Ekalaka left behind her husband and job with \nMontana State Human Resources to serve as a finance officer in Kuwait.\n  LTC Robert E. Brekke of Bozeman is now a provost marshall in Kuwait. \nWhen he is home, he serves as the owner/manager of Mountain Motor \nSupply.\n  LTC Teresa Otto is serving in Iraq and Kuwait as an \nanesthesiologist--the same job she has temporarily left at St. Vincent \nHospital.\n  MSG Timothy Stavnes is serving in an undisclosed location as a \nspecial operations intelligence chief. Master Sergeant Stavnes has \nserved as a traditional active duty soldier and been called up to \nactive duty from the Reserves several times before. When he is in \nBillings, he is the assistant fire chief for the city, serving his \ncommunity when not serving his country.\n  I would like to conclude my talk this morning by mentioning a \nMontanan serving overseas who is not a soldier, sailor, airman, or \nmarine. Maggie Bigelow of Columbia Falls is serving in Germany as the \nfinancial manager of the enlisted club at Ramstein Airforce Base. She \nis also the saving grace of wounded Montanans like Chad Taylor and Mike \nTobey, who have been flown to Ramstein for treatment. As one of those \nsoldiers' mother's put it, she is an angel without wings. She has been \nkeeping our boys in touch with their families, bringing them pizza, \ngifts, and most importantly, her smile and company. When one of our \nMontana servicemen is hurt and a long way from home, it is unbelievably \nreassuring to know she is there at his bedside, looking after him.\n  Maggie's father served as a marine in Vietnam, and her mother is a \nlongtime member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars auxiliary. Her sister \nBrooke Brennan is serving in Kuwait as a staff sergeant in the Air \nForce. Maggie has grown up in a family dedicated to service, and the \nsize of her heart is an inspiration to us all.\n  I hope hearing a little bit about these people helps folks understand \nthe depth of commitment we have from our armed services--what they are \nwilling to do in service of their country. It is not easy to drop \neverything and go out and serve when your country needs you, but these \nmen and women do just that, whenever they are needed. I, for one, am \nincredibly grateful for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as our Nation's military continues its \nefforts to stabilize Iraq, we are reminded of the courage and valor \nthat our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines embody each day as they \ncarry out their duties. When I visited Iraq a few weeks ago, I \nexperienced firsthand the difficult conditions under which they are \nperforming their duties so capably.\n  Today, America is relying on the citizen-soldiers of the National \nGuard more than ever. In the past year, over thirteen hundred men and \nwomen from the Michigan National Guard have been mobilized to serve \naround the world. Among them were the men and women of the 110th \nFighter Wing stationed at W.K. Kellogg Field in Battle Creek, Michigan. \nSince receiving A-10 aircraft in 1990, the men and women of the 110th \nFighter Wing have literally been traversing the globe, seeing action in \nBosnia, Kosovo, Operation Southern Watch in Iraq, and in Southwest \nAsia. It was while serving as part of Operation Allied Force in Kosovo \nthat the 110th Fighter Wing teamed with sister A-10 units from the \nMassachusetts and Idaho Air National Guards to form the ``killer \nbees.''\n  Tomorrow, one of the members of the 110th Fighter Wing, Major James \n``Chocks'' Ewald, will be visiting our Nation's capitol. Major Ewald \nembodies the commitment of the men and women in the National Guard. A \npilot for United Airlines until he was furloughed following the \nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Major Ewald is a retired Air \nForce pilot who leaves his wife and three young children in suburban \nChicago one weekend a month to train with his National Guard unit in \nBattle Creek, Michigan.\n  Major Ewald piloted an A-10 Warthog that was shot down while \nproviding combat air support to ground units approaching Baghdad during \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. It was truly a relief when we learned that \neven though Major Ewald had to abandon his aircraft, he was picked up \nin a matter of minutes by U.S. Army personnel who saw him hiding in the \nreeds along the banks of the Euphrates River.\n  As the Army unit approached, Major Ewald thought that Iraqi forces \nwere nearing. However, when the soldiers called out to him, saying \n``Hey, pilot dude, we see you over there,'' he quickly concluded two \nthings: first, his hiding place was not the best, and second, \nfortunately ``dude'' is probably not Saddam's Republican Guard calling \nfor you.\n  This anecdote underscores the heroism of our Nation's military. A-10 \npilots like Major Ewald put their lives on the line in support of our \nground troops, and those troops in turn came to his aid when shot down. \nIn an era when the term ``hero'' is used with increasing frequency, the \nactions of Major Ewald and his rescuers truly deserve the label of \nhero.\n  Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to our men and women in uniform \nfor\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\ntheir professionalism, patriotism and willingness to ensure our \nNation's security. I know colleagues join me in welcoming Major James \nEwald, and thanking him for his service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9489-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Elkhart, \nIN. On November 17, 1999, Sasezley Richardson, a 19-year-old black \nteenager was shot dead as he strolled back from a local mall with \ndiapers for a friend's baby. The two men that shot Richardson said they \nshot the young man solely because of his race. The victim was black and \nthe perpetrators of the crime were white. One of the shaven-headed \nsuspects told police he was a member of the violent, white supremacist \nAryan Brotherhood, while the other reportedly said he wanted to kill a \nblack person in order to get in the group.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9489-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9489-S9490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      2003 FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address this year's Federal \nbudget deficit, which is now expected to exceed $450 billion. This will \nbe the largest Federal deficit on record.\n  This is a staggering $680 billion increase from the $236 billion \nbudget surplus the Federal Government ran 3 years ago.\n  And who knows how much the true deficit may in fact be if, a few \nmonths from now, the projection increases again due to the ongoing \ncosts of rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan. Reconstruction costs are now \nrunning $4.8 billion per month, or $58 billion annually, which is well \nabove what we have budgeted.\n  According to the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that \nadvocates for balanced budgets, ``The first six months of the 108th \nCongress were the most fiscally irresponsible in recent memory.''\n  The members of this Chamber and the American public should know the \nsimple truth: putting our economy back on track is even more difficult \nin the face of deficits of this magnitude.\n  And next year, the on-budget deficit will likely top $600 billion.\n  In my 10-year career in the Senate, there has never been a greater \nneed for fiscal discipline than there is now. The then-record $290 \nbillion deficit we faced in 1992 required some very tough choices to be \nmade but the choices that lie ahead will be even harder.\n  It is incumbent on the President and the House and Senate leadership \nto prepare the country for those choices. Instead, the President and \nthe Republican leadership in Congress have cut taxes with abandon while \nincreasing spending at a rate faster than at any point during the past \n10 years.\n  Discretionary spending increased by 13.1 percent between 2002 and \n2001, and is expected to increase by 9.7 percent this year over 2002 \nlevels. Much of that spending has been necessary to fight the war on \nterror, recover from the attacks of September 11, and improve our \nhomeland security.\n  Nevertheless, such spending cannot be sustained if tax revenues \nplummet due to ill-timed tax cuts and a weakened economy. In fact, the \nFederal Government has now reached a point at which it could eliminate \nall nondefense discretionary spending and still not close the Federal \nbudget deficit.\n  That would mean eliminating all Federal spending on roads, schools, \nlaw enforcement, disease research, and the environment, among thousands \nof other programs.\n  This structural imbalance between Federal revenues and outlays \nthreatens to send us into a spiral of increasing debt and rapidly \naccelerating interest costs. As the Federal debt increases and public \nsaving decreases, long-term interest rates will inevitably be pushed \nhigher.\n  That not only increases the amount that the Federal Government must \npay to finance its obligations but also raises the cost of putting a \nmortgage on your home or financing a new car purchase. A conservative \nestimate puts the increase in long-term interest rates due to the \nbudget deficit at 0.4 percent.\n  An increase of that magnitude would add $800 per year to the cost of \na $200,000 home mortgage, or more than the majority of American \ntaxpayers will receive from the President's latest tax cut.\n  Yet what is perhaps more threatening is the negative economic impact \nof these growing deficits.\n  The hard truth is that even robust economic growth will not bring the \nbudget back into balance. When preparing deficit projections, the CBO \nassumes average real GDP growth of 3.3 percent between now and 2008, \nwhich is well in excess of the 1.5 to 2 percent average growth of the \npast 3 years.\n  Such moderately strong growth would still leave us with more than $2 \ntrillion in cumulative deficits over the next decade. And this does \ntake into account the true cost of the tax cuts without the sunsets and \nother budgetary gimmicks, which is likely to add $1.8 trillion to those \ndeficits if all existing tax cuts were extended.\n  These fiscal problems are not intractable, but they require \nbipartisan cooperation and real fiscal discipline, both of which have \nbeen in short supply of late.\n  One unfortunate consequence of the administration's approach to the \nrecent tax cut has been a growing partisan divide between Democrats and \nRepublicans on fiscal policy.\n  That stands in sharp contrast to the atmosphere when I entered the \nSenate in 1992. At that time a group of moderate Senators from both \nparties joined forces to rein in spending and hold the line on new tax \ncuts.\n  Those efforts came to fruition in 1998, when the first Federal budget \nsurplus since the Johnson administration was recorded. Budget surpluses \ncontinued for an additional 2 years, coinciding with a period of robust \neconomic growth.\n  During the 108th Congress, I have worked to rekindle that spirit of \nbipartisanship because I fear for the consequences of maintaining our \ncurrent course.\n  This past January, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator \nChafee to freeze further cuts to the top income tax rates, a move which \nwould save over $150 billion over 10 years if enacted today.\n  During debate on the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution, I \ncosponsored an alternate budget resolution with Senators Carper, \nChafee, and Lincoln. That alternate resolution would have brought the \nbudget back into balance 4 years earlier than the resolution which \npassed the Senate, and was revenue-neutral over the 10-year budget \nwindow.\n  And yesterday I introduced legislation to upgrade our country's \ntransportation and water infrastructure. Credit for this bill is due to \nCongressman Oberstar in the House, and I am pleased to introduce the \nSenate companion bill. This bill would create more than 2 million new \njobs, at less than a tenth the cost of the latest tax cut.\n  Moreover, the $34 billion cost of my bill is fully offset by closing \nEnron-related tax shelters, putting an end to corporate expatriation \nand extending customs user fees.\n  This type of targeted, revenue-neutral stimulus promises to create \nmore jobs than the President's tax cut, without digging us deeper into \ndebt, and is precisely the sort of fiscally responsible approach to \njump-starting the economy that we need.\n  Just as the budget surpluses of the late 1990s had a positive ripple \neffect of increasing the feeling of economic certainty and security in \nthis country, the current budget deficit is having a negative ripple \neffect and is contributing to the near-freeze on hiring and capital \ninvestment we are currently experiencing.\n  We must break this cycle with bipartisan leadership or we will face \nan even greater crisis in the years ahead. We cannot afford to burden \nfuture generations with the debt resulting from our\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\nfiscal mismanagement, and we cannot afford to defer tough choices to \nfuture leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9490-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT AND THE FCC\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof S. J. Res. 17, the resolution of disapproval introduced yesterday by \nSenator Dorgan and a bipartisan group of Senators who are very \nconcerned about the media ownership rules issued recently by the \nFederal Communications Commission. When the FCC issued those rules, it \nignored the public. It ignored hundreds of thousands of public \ncomments, and it ignored the calls of elected representatives for more \ncareful consideration of these issues that are crucial to the future of \ninformation and entertainment in our country.\n  Over the past several weeks, many Senators have been doing what the \nFCC failed to do: listening to the American people. What we have heard \nis not applause for the new rules but great disappointment, and even \nanger. The American people are outraged by these new media ownership \nrules. They do not want new media ownership rules that legitimize \neliminating local community voices in exchange for homogenization and \nuniformity. They do not want fewer and fewer choices, and less and less \nlocal control.\n  Those of us who support this disapproval resolution under the \nCongressional Review Act want to right the wrong done by the FCC. We \nbelieve that the people, not powerful media conglomerates, ultimately \nown the airwaves. The will of the people must be reflected in the rules \nthat govern media ownership in this country. The strong public support \nfor this resolution is demonstrated by the fact that there are already \n35 Senators, from both sides of the aisle, who have signed a petition \nto bring this matter to the floor, as the CRA contemplates. It is now \nclear that we will have a vote on this matter in the Senate in the next \nfew months. That is good news for the public.\n  The FCC's rules threaten to undermine the diversity of voices in the \ntelevision and newspaper industries, just as diversity in the radio \nindustry has been diminished. In a marketplace limited by only these \nnew rules, our major media outlets will begin to look and act like \nradio, with absentee owners, standardized programming, and less local \nnews and community involvement.\n  Thanks to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which loosened the \nownership rules for radio, we have seen the future of media \nconsolidation, and we know that it offers a lot more to big media \ncompanies than it does to consumers. In some cases, it can be downright \ndangerous. The five giant media conglomerates that already dominate the \nairwaves will expand their reach and further stifle localism and \ndiversity.\n  By invoking the Congressional Review Act, Congress can wipe out these \nnew rules altogether, and the FCC will have to go back and redraft \nthem. We plan to make it clear that the new draft should include some \nof the positive proposals contained in the recent media bill sponsored \nby Senator Ted Stevens that passed out of the Commerce Committee. The \nCRA specifically contemplated that agencies may have to redo \nregulations required by court or congressional mandate. If this \ndisapproval resolution is passed by the House and the Senate, the \npreexisting rules will again be in effect until the FCC goes back to \nthe drawing board and promulgates new regulations that are not \nsubstantially similar to the rules that Congress has disapproved.\n  In promulgating these new rules, the FCC ignored its primary \nresponsibility--to serve the public interest. But fortunately, the FCC \ndoesn't have the final word here. The people do. It is our duty in the \nCongress to listen to the people and give voice to their concerns. By \npassing the resolution of disapproval, we will do just that. I want to \nthank the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, for his leadership and \nthe other Senators from both sides of the aisle who are working on \nthis. This is an important effort and I believe we will be successful \nin taking this action on behalf of the public interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9490-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PESTICIDE HARMONIZATION\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of S. \n1406, which is pesticide harmonization legislation. I join my \ncolleague, Senator Dorgan, as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation. I would like to commend Senator Dorgan and his staff, the \nMontana Grain Growers, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and \nour Montana Department of Agriculture for their willingness to work out \nthe gritty details of this bill. It has been a long and laborious \nnegotiation process, but I believe we have come up with legislation \nthat is better for the farmers of this country.\n  In my home State of Montana and many other Western and Midwestern \nStates, we have faced a number of trade disputes between Canada and the \nUnited States. One of the most glaring discrepancies deals with \npesticides. Chemicals that are sold for one price just across the \nborder in Canada are sold at a considerably higher cost to American \nproducers. Why does this happen you may ask? The EPA places strong \nregulations on chemicals used in the United States and therefore, the \nchemical companies believe they should hike up the prices to pay for \ntheir trouble.\n  The chemicals sold in Canada and the United States, in most cases, \nhave the exact same chemical makeup. The same company manufactures them \nbut often gives them a different name and nearly always prices the \nAmerican chemicals higher. The crops harvested at a lower production \ncost in Canada are now competing with American products. I am a strong \nbeliever in fair trade, but for free trade to actually occur, this \nproblem must be addressed.\n  Currently, American farmers are facing a serious economic recession. \nGrain prices are the lowest they have been in a number of years and \nthere does not appear to be a light at the end of the tunnel. \nAdditionally, much of the West is looking at yet another year of \ndrought. Also, fertilizer costs are skyrocketing with the ever-rising \ncost of natural gas. To top it all off, they are also being forced to \npay twice as much for nearly the same chemicals as their foreign \nneighbors.\n  This bill would eliminate current obstacles and even the playing \nfield for our farmers. The bill operates under a similar concept as the \nprevious bills introduced, but many of the details have changed. The \npesticide harmonization bill that is currently introduced, S. 332, had \nthe States, not EPA, in charge of pesticide registrations. This new \nversion has EPA in charge of the process. This eliminated some of the \nconcerns of States, whose budgets would not allow these much-needed \nregistrations to be completed. It also protects confidentiality of \ningredients in the chemicals.\n  Our farmers and ranchers have been paying too much for their \npesticides and chemicals for too long. From my years as a football \nreferee, I learned everyone needs to follow the same rules to play the \ngame. We need to make sure Canadian farmers and U.S. farmers are \nplaying under the same rules. I believe this bill makes that happen. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on this crucial issue to \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9490-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9490-S9491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THANKING THE NATIONAL MARINE ENGINEERS' BENEFICIAL ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Throughout his celebrated 100 \nyears, he has been a model of altruistic service to his community, the \nCommonwealth of Virginia and America.\n  A Virginia native, Mr. Miller was born in Lynchburg on July 26, 1903. \nHe attended college at the Virginia Military Institute from August 1920 \nto June 1924, and while enrolled, Mr. Miller was awarded some of the \nhighest accolades the school has for students. As an alumnus, he has \nserved VMI tirelessly in roles including President of its Board of \nVisitors, founder of the Miller Basketball Scholarship Program, and \nChairman of the VMI Flying Squadron, just to name a few. His service \nhas won him the school's Spirit Award, Distinguished Service Award, as \nwell as the position of Senior Living Alumnus and the distinction of \n``Mr. VMI.''\n  Mr. Miller's record of exemplary service extends also to the \ncommunity of Culpeper, VA, where he has been a resident for more than \n70 years and has deservedly earned the distinguished title of ``Mr. \nCulpeper.'' Over those years, he has been a member of the Culpeper Town \nCouncil, Vice Mayor of Culpeper, founder and President of the Culpeper \nHost Lion's Club, Chairman of the Board of Culpeper Memorial Hospital \nand President of Culpeper National Bank. In recognition of his work, he \nhas been honored as Outstanding Citizen of the Year in Culpeper, as \nwell as with the Culpeper Colonel Award from the Board of Supervisors \nand the Good Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. In addition to \nhis work in Culpeper, Mr. Miller has worked in significant positions \nthroughout the Commonwealth, including a stint as Director of the \nFederal Reserve Bank in Richmond.\n  Mr. Miller is an example of many of the traits that we as Americans \nhonor: service, dedication, and hard work, among others.

SHEARER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute to one of Kentucky's \nfinest educators. Dr. Charles L. Shearer has served as president of \nTransylvania University for over 20 years and he has helped shape it \ninto the fine liberal arts institution it is today.\n  Upon Dr. Shearer's inception as Transylvania University's president \n20 years ago, he brought with him a doctorate in economics and teaching \nexperience. Charles also spent 4 years as the university's vice \npresident of finance where he successfully eliminated Transylvania's \ndeficits. Although campus enrollment was low then, Dr. Shearer helped \nTransylvania rebound from 605 in 1983 to a record 1,109 during the fall \nof 2002.\n  Achieving the highest quality of education in the classroom possible \nhas been a top priority throughout Dr. Shearer's tenure as president. \nThe top 25 students in each class are awarded the William T. Young \nScholarship. The Bingham, Jones and Kenan programs encourage retainment \nand recruitment of faculty by awarding bonuses to deserving teachers.\n  Dr. Shearer's leadership helped raise the endowment from $4.1 million \nin 1983 to $110 million today. While funds peaked at $129.3 million in \n1998, the school has been able to make the necessary improvements and \ngrowth that have shaped Transylvania University. In the past 20 years \nthe additions to the campus have included the Young Campus Center, the \nRosenthal and Poole residence halls, the Cowgill business center, the \nLucille Little Theatre, the Clive Beck Athletic and Recreation Center, \nthe John R. Hall Field for intramurals and athletics, and the Marquard \nbaseball field.\n  The commitment and devotion Dr. Charles Shearer has demonstrated to \nTransylvania University is inspiring. Fewer than 5 percent of college \nor university presidents serve 20 years or more. His ability to work \nand grow with people has enabled Dr. Shearer to serve Transylvania \nUniversity in a spectacular way. While Dr. Shearer has received \nnumerous offers to serve at other academic institutions, he has \ndeclined in order to continue his role at Transylvania and thus has \nbecome the longest serving president in the school's 223-year history. \nI am thrilled Dr. Shearer has remained at Transylvania and am \noptimistic for the university's future. I thank the Senate for allowing \nme to recognize Dr. Shearer and Transylvania University. He is one of \nKentucky's best at one of its finest institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9491-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING STEPHEN ARTHUR HEAVENER\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I recognize Mr. Stephen Arthur \nHeavener who will retire on August 1, 2003, after having served 8\\1/2\\ \nyears as the Executive Director of the Front Royal-Warren County \nEconomic Development Authority. He leaves this position to become \nExecutive Director of the Department of Development in Carlsbad, NM.\n  During Mr. Heavener's 8\\1/2\\ years of service at the Warren County \nEDA more than 1,100 county jobs were created and the local industrial \ntax base increased from 8.5 percent in 1990 to 13.5 percent in 2002. \nThese particular accomplishments came to fruition largely because of \nMr. Heavener's work with Pen-Tab Industries, Toray Plastics, America, \nFamily Dollar, Ferguson Enterprises and SYSCO Northeast Cooperative, \nInc. Mr. Heavener also assisted in the redevelopment of the Avtex \nFibers Superfund site in Front Royal. The massive construction on this \n500-acre site will eventually create more than 11,000 square feet of \npremium rehabilitated office space, 240 acres of Conservancy Parklands, \n160 acres of eco-business park, and 30 acres of soccer fields. In \naddition, Mr. Heavener has also aided in the growth and expansion of \nlocal businesses in Warren County by creating the Rural Business \nEnterprise Loan program, which has provided loans for small businesses \nin the amount of $250,000.\n  Mr. Heavener's record of success as Executive Director of the Front \nRoyal-Warren County Economic Development Authority is well-known and \nrespected. I congratulate him on his years of dedicated service to the \npeople of Warren County and the Commonwealth of Virginia and wish him \nwell in his new position in the Department of Development in \nCarlsbad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9491-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9491-S9492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE BOSTON CELTICS--HEROES AMONG US\n\n Mr. KENNEDY.

In 1997, they \nestablished the ``Heroes Among Us'' award to honor outstanding \nindividuals in New England who have made an especially significant \nimpact on the lives of others. The award is designed to honor men and \nwomen in Massachusetts who stand tall in their commitment to their \ncommunity. The extraordinary achievements of the honorees include \nsaving lives, sacrificing for others, overcoming obstacles to achieve \ngoals, or lifelong commitments to improving the lives of those around \nthem. They include persons of all ages and from all walks of life, \nincluding students, community leaders, founders of nonprofit \norganizations, members of the clergy, and many others.\n  At each home game during the season, the Celtics and their fans \nsalute the exemplary efforts of an honoree in a special presentation on \nthe basketball court. So far, over 250 individuals have received the \n``Heroes Among Us'' award.\n  All of us in Massachusetts are very proud of this program, which has \nbecome one of the most recognized and respected initiatives in our \nState.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Arthur \nBrown, who has been a long-time resident of Idaho and a great \ncontributor to our State and its economy.\n  Art Brown came to Idaho from South Africa 36 years ago to begin a new \ncareer in the mountains of Idaho's Silver Valley. Art, his wife Tiia, \nand their children began a journey that would support not only them but \na company and our community.\n  As an engineer down in the mines, Art pursued the American Dream. \nAfter years of hard work and commitment, he rose to become the chairman \nand chief executive officer of Hecla Mining Company, which was the top \nperformer on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979 and again in 2002.\n  Throughout his journey, Art never lost sight of his family and \ncommunity. He served his local community as the mayor of Pinehurst. He \nled youth golf and ski programs. Art even gained a reputation as a head \ncheerleader of sorts, running the sidelines at his daughter's \nbasketball games. Most notable is the culture of community service he \nfostered at Hecla, first by his example and then by encouragement to \nhis employees to do the same thing. Giving back to the community became \na way of life for a Hecla employee under Art's direction.\n  Hecla Mining has been a part of the fabric of Idaho for over 112 \nyears. And so have people like Art Brown, who contribute to their \ncommunity, their State, and so much more. This year Art will be \nretiring from his service at the helm of Hecla. However, he will not be \nretiring away from Idaho. True to form, Art will remain rooted in his \ncommunity and family of Idaho.\n  I am proud of Art Brown, for the example he has set for business in \nthe State of Idaho, for his contributions to his community, and for his \nfamily who has supported him in his endeavors over the years. On behalf \nof myself and so many others in the great State of Idaho, I wish him \nthe best in his future endeavors and thank him for his service to \nIdaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9492-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2195.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to allow \nworkers who attain age 65 after 1981 and before 1992 to choose either \nlump sum payments over four years totaling $5,000 or an improved \nbenefit computation formula under a new 10-year rule governing the \ntransition to the changes in benefits computation rules enacted in the \nSocial Security Amendments of 1977, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe Social Security is one of the \ngreatest success stories of our government.\n  Social Security is the only program in the history of our Nation that \nhas provided dignity and respect for our senior citizens, regardless of \ntheir income or backgrounds.\n  For almost 70 years, Social Security has been there for our citizens \nwhen they need it. It has provided seniors with independence and \neconomic security in their retirement years.\n  In addition to helping millions of senior citizens, Social Security \nhas provided economic security for surviving spouses and children and \nto countless Americans with disabilities.\n  It is easy to see why people believe Social Security is the most \nsuccessful social program our country has ever adopted.\n  I rise today to reintroduce legislation that would correct a problem \nthat plagues a special population of Social Security recipients. I am \nspeaking on behalf of those affected by Social Security notch.\n  The Social Security notch causes more than nine million Social \nSecurity recipients born between the years of 1917 and 1926 to receive \nfewer Social Security benefits than Americans born outside the notch \nyears due to changes made in 1977 to the Social Security benefit \nformula.\n  I have continued to speak out on this issue and the injustice it \nimposes on millions of seniors. The notch issue has been discussed, \nstudied and reviewed, yet to date, Congress has not corrected this \nwrong. Because of this, many older Americans born during this period \ncannot afford the most basic necessities.\n  Congress must accept responsibility for any error that was made. We \nshould not ask notch Seniors to accept less because of our mistake. \nWhile we must preserve and protect Social Security for future \ngenerations, we have an obligation to those, who through no fault of \ntheir own, receive less than those that were fortunate enough to be \nborn just days before and after the notch period.\n  The notch situation has its origins in 1972, when Congress decided to \ncreate automatic cost-of-living-adjustments to help Social Security \nkeep pace with inflation. Prior to 1972, each adjustment had to await \nlegislation, causing beneficiaries' monthly payments to lag behind \ninflation. When Congress took this action, it was acting under the best \nof intentions.\n  Unfortunately, this new benefit adjustment method was flawed. To \nfunction properly, it required that the economy behave in much the same \nfashion that it had in the 1950s and 1960s, with annual wage increases \noutpacing prices, and inflation remaining relatively low. As we all \nknow, that did not happen. The rapid inflation and high unemployment of \nthe 1970s generated rapid increases in benefits.\n\n  In 1977, Congress revised the way that benefits were computed. In \nmaking its revisions, Congress decided that it was not proper to reduce \nbenefits for persons already receiving them. It did, however, decide \nthat benefits for all future retirees should be reduced.\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\n  We have an obligation to convey to our constituents that Social \nSecurity is a fair system. Notch Babies in Nevada feel slighted by \ntheir government and if I were in their situation, I would too. Through \nno fault of their own, they receive less, sometimes as much as $200 \nless, than their neighbors.\n  The legislation I am offering today is my proposal to right the \nwrong. Let us fix the notch problem and restore the confidence of the \nnine million notch babies across this land. Government has an \nobligation to be fair. My support of notch babies is longstanding. I \nsponsored numerous pieces of legislation over the years to address this \nissue. With this legislation, my effort continues.\n  It is unfortunate that these measures have not seen the light of day. \nMany who have written to me think Congress is waiting for notch babies \nto die rather than honor this debt. I must tell you it concerns me when \nour constituents have this perception of their elected representatives.\n  We have to do something to make sure Americans believe that Social \nSecurity is a fair system. Passage of my legislation provides us that \nchance.\n  My legislation is intended to make good on what this government \nshould have done long ago. I propose that workers who attain the age of \n65 after 1981 and before 1992 be allowed to choose either lump sum \npayment over four years totaling $5,000 or an improved benefit \ncomputation formula under a new 10-year rule governing the transition \nto the changes in benefit computation rules enacted in the Social \nSecurity Amendments of 1977.\n  It is time to put these dollars into the hands of those who earned \nthem. It is time to show our support for notch reform.\n  I am introducing this legislation because actions speak louder than \nwords. The `Notch Fairness Act of 2003' that I am introducing on behalf \nof notch victims today, is intended to put my words into action. I ask \nall my colleagues to join me in support of this important and long \noverdue legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to support the establishment or expansion and \noperation of programs using a network of public and private community \nentities to provide mentoring for children in foster care; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I send a bill to the desk and ask for \nits appropriate referral. I send this bill to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, the Senator from Indiana, Senator Bayh, Senator Kerry, and \nSenator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I appreciate the Democratic leader's \ngenerosity, to give some of his time for the introduction of this very \nimportant bill. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n  This particular measure is called the Foster Mentoring Act of 2003. I \nhave spoken many times on the floor about the issue of foster care and \nadoption, and our efforts as a Congress to try to keep our families \nintact and to provide the economic systems in the country, as well as \nthe social systems from the Federal, State, and local level, to try to \nhelp support our families in a way that will get them through crises \nthat all families experience.\n  It would be our goal as a nation to see that every child born in a \nfamily gets to stay within that family and is loved and nurtured within \nthat family unit, either the immediate family or extended family. But \nwhen family ties break down beyond the ability to repair them even with \nthe best efforts made by the churches and synagogues and mosques and \nfaith-based organizations as well as the Government, then we have to \ncreate a system out-of-home care, or foster care.\n  We have done that. We have created a system, but we have to fix a \nsystem that is now broken and in great need of repair. Many of us have \nbeen working diligently over the past few years to do that. Some great \nprogress has been made.\n  Until the system can be reformed in its entirety, there are some \nthings we can do now, we can do immediately. Passing this Foster \nMentoring Act is one of these things. It would provide a $15 million \ngrant to States to provide foster care mentoring programs, provides $4 \nmillion for a public awareness campaign for the need for mentors for \nthe over 500,000 children who are in foster care in the United States \ntoday, and it would provide, most significantly, up to $20,000 for loan \nforgiveness for anyone who would mentor a foster care child.\n  You ask me have we done this before? Yes, in California, represented \nby a list of advocates I will submit, Children Uniting Nations is the \nlead nonprofit organization organizing this effort. Under the direction \nof Governor Gray Davis and his wife, Sharon, they have been a \nsuccessful pilot for this kind of program in the United States.\n  This bill attempts to take what is working in California and expand \nit nationally and provide foster care mentoring opportunities to \nchildren in foster care.\n  I ask unanimous consent, because my time is short, to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from the former majority leader, Dick Armey, who \nsupports this initiative and really encourages the Congress to take a \nserious look.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 Richard K. Armey,\n\n\n                                       Former Majority Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I understand you are introducing \n     legislation designed to promote mentoring for foster \n     children. I am writing to applaud your effort and objective. \n     Based on my own experience, mentoring works.\n       My own experience with mentoring convinces me that it \n     affords an opportunity for learning and encouragement to \n     children that is all too often not otherwise available. For \n     the past ten years I have sponsored a program, which we \n     called, Tools for Tomorrow in which we arranged scholarships \n     and mentors fifteen deserving children. I have seen first \n     hand how they blossomed through the experience and I have \n     enjoyed the special relationship between the children and \n     their mentors. Mentoring works in the lives of the children.\n       In addition to applauding your active leadership and \n     efforts with respect to mentoring for foster children I also \n     want to commend Daphna Ziman, and Children Using Nations for \n     their support and activities in the private sector. Daphna \n     Ziman, Chairperson of Children Uniting Nations, is a \n     recognized leader who gives much of herself in the tireless \n     pursuit of helping foster children. Her efforts and other \n     private sector initiatives play a critical role in advancing \n     this important cause.\n           With kind regards,\n                                                       Dick Armey.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I urge my colleagues to take this issue, as I know they \nwill, quite seriously, to do what we can now to provide the hundreds of \nthousands of children who are looking for mentorship and stability the \nbenefit of this act and, as quickly as we can, take it up in the \nSenate. Of course, we urge our leadership to do so.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Daschle for giving me the minutes before his \namendment to offer this important legislation.\n  I yield any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I complement the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana for her bill and her leadership on the issue of \nmentoring. She knows a great deal about foster care. I am grateful to \nher for the commitment she had made to the issue.\n  Recent statistics have shown that 45 percent of those children who \nare in foster care are less likely to begin using drugs; 59 percent do \nbetter academically; 73 percent set and attain a higher life \nachievement goal. So there is a lot to be said for fostering. I believe \nthe Foster Care Mentoring Act that she has now just introduced is \nmeritorious and certainly deserves our support.\n  I ask to be a cosponsor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1420. A bill to establish terms and conditions for use of certain \nFederal land by outfitters and to facilitate public opportunities for \nthe recreational use and enjoyment of such land; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nOutfitter Policy Act of 2003.\n  This legislation is very similar to legislation I introduced in past \nCongresses. As that legislation did, this bill would put into law many \nof the management practices by which Federal land management agencies \nhave successfully managed the outfitter and guide industry on National \nForests, National Parks and other Federal lands over many decades.\n  The bill recognizes that many Americans want and seek out the skills \nand experience of commercial outfitters and guides to help them enjoy a \nsafe and pleasant journey.\n  The Outfitter Policy Act's primary purpose is to ensure accessibility \nto public lands by all segments of the population and maintain the \navailability of quality recreation services to the public. While \nprotecting access for many outdoor enthusiasts who possess the skills \nto enjoy recreating on public lands without assistance, this Act \ninsures that outfitters and guides across the Nation can continue to \nprovide opportunities for outdoor recreation for the many families and \ngroups who would otherwise find the backcountry inaccessible.\n  Previous hearings and discussions on prior versions of this \nlegislation helped to refine the bill I am introducing today. This \nprocess provided the intended opportunity for discussion. As well as it \nallowed for the examination of the historical practices that have \noffered consistent, reliable outfitter services to the public.\n  Congress has twice addressed this issue with respect to the National \nPark System permits--originally establishing standards for Park Service \nadministration of guide/outfitter permits on their lands in 1965 and \namending that system in 1998. Therefore, it is appropriate to set \nsimilar legislative standards for other public land systems\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\nsuch as Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands. However, \nthese and other land management agencies are now without Congressional \nguidance, and instead rules, permit terms and conditions and other \nintricacies are often left to local agency personnel. The Outfitter \nPolicy Act would alleviate the discord involved in land management \npermitting, providing consistent guidance on the administration of \nguide/outfitter permits for the other federal land management agencies.\n  The Outfitter Policy Act provides the basic terms and conditions \nnecessary to sustain the substantial investment often needed to provide \nthe level of service demanded by the public. However, the bill provides \nthe agencies ample flexibility to adjust use, conditions, and permit \nterms. All of which must be consistent with agency management plans and \npolicies for resource conservation. The Outfitter Policy Act strives to \nprovide a stable, consistent regulatory climate which encourages \nqualified entrants to the guide/outfitting business, while giving the \nagencies and operators clear directions.\n  The Outfitter Policy Act is a measure that will facilitate access to \npublic lands by the outfitted public, while providing incentives to \noutfitters to provide the high quality services over time. It is \nnecessary to ensure that members of the public who need and rely on \nguides and outfitters for recreational access to public lands will \ncontinue to receive safe, quality services.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation has not passed in its current form. \nSo I will be working with my colleagues, Senators Bingaman and Wyden, \nto capture these concepts and draft a bill that will pass our \ncommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1420\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Outfitter Policy Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to authorize the subdivision and dedication of \nrestricted land owned by Alaska Natives; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Native Allotment Subdivision Act is \nthe only answer to resolving the question of whether Native landowners \nhave the authority to subdivide their own property. Individual Alaska \nNative landowners cannot subdivide their land to transfer it either by \ngift or by sale. There is no current authority that allows them to \ndedicate rights-of-way across their land for public access or for \nutility purposes. The lack of explicit statutory authorization calls \ninto question the legal validity of lands that have been subdivided and \nlands that likely could be subdivided in the future. This legislation \nwill provide the necessary authorization to the Department of the \nInterior and Native landowners to dedicate their land for public \npurposes as they see fit. No other legislation or policy exists that \naddresses such a unique problem. Essentially this bill allows Alaska \nNatives to own lands with the same obligations and privileges of other \nprivate landowners in Alaska. However, the bill creates no obligation \nof Alaska Natives to do anything with their allotments unless they \nelect to sell or dispose of their lands.\n  Over the past twenty years, hundreds of allotments have been \nsubdivided, either for the purpose of commercial sale or to facilitate \ntransfers of land to the landowners' children or other relatives. \nProblems arose when the Borough placed a utility line across frontage \nproperty of one of the Native landowners. Frontage property the Borough \nthought it had legal access to; there was no reason to consider \npotential conflicts existed. The new owner questioned the validity and \nlegality of the Borough placing any kind of feature across his land. In \naddition, grantees of existing easements, such as utility easements for \nlocal electric cooperatives, have felt threatened with trespass action \nfor easements previously granted in good faith.\n  The question clearly goes to whether a trespass had been committed by \nlocal government. In fact in this case, subdivision plats were filed, \nsigned and approved as evidenced by the appropriate signatures of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, the landowner and by the local governing \nauthority. The official plats show streets laid out to provide frontage \nto the lots created by the subdivision, describing 10 foot utility \nrights-of-way on each lot. It is recognized that compliance with State \nlaw is required when landowners choose to subdivide their land. Given a \nchoice, it would be advantageous to the Alaska Native landowners if the \nsame opportunity was available to them. There is no applicable Federal \nlaw on the subject of subdivision of Native allotment lands. State law \nrequires that access to subdivided lots be assured, typically by \ndedication of public rights-of-way, which will be shown on the \nsubdivision plat.\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\n  In an effort to overcome this problem, a collaborative process was \nundertaken by the affected Boroughs and the State of Alaska to validate \nsuch dedications by separately conveying either easements or title to \nroads and utility easements to State and local governments. This was so \nburdensome, time-consuming and complex, the process had to be \nabandoned. The platting authorities and the State were so disenchanted \nby this process, they had no choice but to turn to Congress for relief. \nThe common sense approach to solving this dilemma, is to afford the \nsame considerations to Native landowners that others have. Native \nlandowners must have the same authority to subdivide and dedicate their \nland as anyone else has the right to do, according to existing State \nlaw\n  By speeding up and simplifying the allotment subdivision process, the \nNative landowner, the Federal, State and local governments would all \nbenefit. This legislation permits a Native landowner at his own option \nto abide by and receive the benefits of subdividing his land in \naccordance with State or local law. The uncertainty of whether \nofficially filed allotment subdivision plats are valid would be \nremoved. This legislation will also serve to authorize future allotment \nsubdivisions, ratify and confirm the legal validity of those already \ncreated.\n  The Native landowner will not be deprived of any of the protections \nof restricted land status. This legislation will confirm the restricted \nNative landowners' right to act in his own best interest. The issue \nthey face is a choice between being able to subdivide their land, \nobtain a much greater total compensation for sales of subdivided lots \nor continue to be unable to subdivide their land. Their only option \nwill be to sell one large tract that will almost always bring a \nsubstantially smaller total amount of compensation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is an issue that applies to \nAlaska only. The solution affects the Native Allotment Act of 1906, the \nsame legislation which provides for Alaska Natives to receive title to \nup to 160 acres of public land.\n  This legislation is non-controversial and is beneficial to all \naffected parties and to the general public. The State of Alaska and \nlocal governments have urged such legislation. The Department of the \nInterior is supportive.\n  And, finally, passage of this legislation will be in the best \ninterest of the Native allotment owners and the general public. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1421\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Native Allotment \n     Subdivision Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Alaska Natives that own land subject to Federal \n     restrictions against alienation and taxation need to be able \n     to subdivide the restricted land for the purposes of--\n       (A) transferring by gift, sale, or devise separate \n     interests in the land; or\n       (B) severing, by mutual consent, tenancies in common;\n       (2) for the benefit of the Alaska Native restricted \n     landowners, any persons to which the restricted land is \n     transferred, and the public in general, the Alaska Native \n     restricted landowners should be authorized to dedicate--\n       (A) rights-of-way for public access;\n       (B) easements for utility installation, use, and \n     maintenance; and\n       (C) additional land for other public purposes;\n       (3)(A) the lack of an explicit authorization by Congress \n     with respect to the subdivision and dedication of Alaska \n     Native land that is subject to Federal restrictions has \n     called into question whether such subdivision and dedication \n     is legal; and\n       (B) this legal uncertainty has been detrimental to the \n     rights of Alaska Native restricted landowners to use or \n     dispose of the restricted land in the same manner as other \n     landowners are able to use and dispose of land;\n       (4) extending to Alaska Native restricted land owners the \n     same authority that other landowners have to subdivide and \n     dedicate land should be accomplished without depriving the \n     Alaska Native restricted landowners of any of the protections \n     associated with restricted land status;\n       (5) confirming the right and authority of Alaska Native \n     restricted land owners, subject to the approval of the \n     Secretary of the Interior, to subdivide their land and to \n     dedicate their interests in the restricted land, should be \n     accomplished without affecting the laws relating to whether \n     tribal governments or the State of Alaska (including \n     political subdivisions of the State) have authority to \n     regulate land use;\n       (6) Alaska Native restricted land owners, persons to which \n     the restricted land is transferred, State and local platting \n     authorities, and members of the general public have formed \n     expectations in reliance on past subdivisions and \n     dedications; and\n       (7) those expectations should be fulfilled by ratifying the \n     validity under Federal law of the subdivisions and \n     dedications.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SUBDIVISION AND DEDICATION OF ALASKA NATIVE \n                   RESTRICTED LAND.\n\n       (a) In General.--An Alaska Native owner of restricted land \n     may, subject to the approval of the Secretary--\n       (1) subdivide the restricted land in accordance with the \n     laws of the--\n       (A) State; or\n       (B) applicable local platting authority; and\n       (2) execute a certificate of ownership and dedication with \n     respect to the restricted land subdivided under paragraph (1) \n     with the same effect under State law as if the restricted \n     land subdivided and dedicated were held by unrestricted fee \n     simple title.\n       (b) Ratification of Prior Subdivisions and Dedications.--\n     Any subdivision or dedication of restricted land executed \n     before the date of enactment this Act that has been approved \n     by the Secretary and by the applicable State or local \n     platting authority, as appropriate, is ratified and confirmed \n     by Congress as of the date on which the Secretary approved \n     the subdivision or dedication.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act validates or \n     invalidates any assertion--\n       (1) that a Federally recognized Alaska Native tribe has or \n     lacks jurisdiction with respect to any land in the State;\n       (2) that Indian country (as defined in section 1151 of \n     title 18, United States Code) exists or does not exist in the \n     State; or\n       (3) that, except as provided in section 4, the State or any \n     political subdivision of the State does or does not have the \n     authority to regulate the use of any individually owned \n     restricted land.\n       (b) Effect on Status of Land Not Dedicated.--Except in a \n     case in which a specific interest in restricted land is \n     dedicated under section (4)(a)(2), nothing in this Act \n     terminates, diminishes, or otherwise affects the continued \n     existence and applicability of Federal restrictions against \n     alienation and taxation on restricted land or interests in \n     restricted land (including restricted land subdivided under \n     section 4(a)(1)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9504-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9504-S9505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 197--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND \nLEGAL REPRESENTATION IN STATE OF COLORADO V.

Res. 196\n\n       Whereas approximately 80,000 infants, children, teenagers, \n     and young adults of families living throughout the United \n     States die each year from a myriad of causes;\n       Whereas the death of an infant, child, teenager, or young \n     adult of a family is considered to be one of the greatest \n     tragedies that a parent or family will ever endure during a \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas a supportive environment, empathy, and \n     understanding are considered critical factors in the healing \n     process of a family that is coping with and recovering from \n     the loss of a loved one: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates December 14, 2003, as ``National Children's \n     Memorial Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Children's Memorial Day'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities in remembrance of the many infants, \n     children, teenagers, and young adults of families in the \n     United States who have died.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \nwould designate December 14, 2003 as ``National Children's Memorial \nDay.'' This resolution would set aside this day to remember all the \nchildren who die in the United States each year.\n  The Senate has passed a similar resolution for each of the past five \nyears in order to ensure that families who have lost children know that \ntheir loved ones--and their grief--are not forgotten. Whether a child's \ndeath is sudden or anticipated, from illness or from accident, the \ngrief of the families who loved them is unimaginable for all who have \nnot shared their tragedy.\n  Today, we reaffirm that a child's death is a loss not only for one \nfamily, but for all of us, and we grieve together. By passing this \nresolution and sharing a day of remembrance, we can remind families who \nhave lost children that they are not alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/16/senate-section/article/S9505-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1267.
