Mr. President, for Senators who are going to be here for \nmorning business, it will probably be another 20 minutes or so, total \ntime between the two leaders' time, before morning business begins.\n  As I said in my opening comments, our intention is to go to asbestos \nand to bring to closure a very important piece of legislation that a \nlot of people across the aisle have worked on and are dedicated to \naddressing.\n  I believe now is the time to do that. I want to briefly introduce my \nview of the current status of the asbestos litigation debate and how I \nthink we can bring that debate to closure.\n  This body--both sides of the aisle--has recognized that asbestos \nlitigation has run amok. It is time to fix what has become an \nembarrassing, inadequate system that we have, the purpose of which is \nto compensate victims. The current system is broken. It fails to \ncompensate victims fairly, while at\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\nthe same time imposes huge costs on our economy and thus on jobs and \njob creation.\n  We now have a choice, and it is a choice I very much think we should \nface right now, and that is to either leave the sick asbestos victims \nto suffer the vagaries of this system as it works today or put our very \nbest work together to give them a better and more reliable and more \nsecure system. There will be a lot of comments made over the course of \nthe day and the week, but I think it is important to understand that we \nhave made substantial progress, meaningful progress toward creating a \nbetter system. With all of this progress, it is now time to bring it to \na focal point and bring it to closure.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch, has brought \nS. 1125, the FAIR Act, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, \nfrom its introduction through that Judiciary Committee, and a number of \nparties have participated in the various negotiations to get it to the \nfloor.\n  Now is the time to take very deliberate action--it is going to be \ndifficult over the next several days to do that--and to finish the \nprocess and bring relief to victims and stop the devastating impact the \ncurrent system is having on our economy. Although we have made real \nbreakthroughs and we have moved forward through a lot of continued \ndiscussions among the various stakeholders and various Senators, a lot \nof which has occurred since Senator Hatch's work with the committee, \nthere are still a lot of calls to delay and put things off until some \nindefinite time in the future. Since I have been involved, pretty much \nafter it came out of committee, there have been calls for delay--we \nneed another week or 4 days or month or 2 months or 3 months. Now we \nneed to stop talking about it and actually do it. We need to fix the \nsystem, which we know--I think there is a general consensus--is broken; \nthat it is unfair and it hurts the economy. It is a detriment to our \neconomy.\n  I have made it a leadership priority for the Senate to help resolve \nthis issue. We have given parties, again and again, additional time to \nwork out some of the issues. But now we need to take decisive action. \nAs I said, there is wide agreement. If you look at the problem itself--\nthat the current system is a disaster for victims and for jobs and a \ndisaster for the impact on the economy--we are pouring vast amounts of \nmoney into this defunct system. But as we pour money into it, the \nsystem is getting worse and worse. More than 700,000 individuals have \nfiled claims and, right now, there are 300,000 claims out there \npending--300,000 claims. We have spent $70 billion trying to resolve \nthese claims.\n  You must ask, with 300,000 claims out there and having spent $70 \nbillion, what do we have to show for it today? Well, we have a system \nwhere sick victims of asbestos exposure have to wait in line with \nthousands of unimpaired claimants. We have the sick and people who have \nnot been hurt at all, and they are all waiting. Sick victims wait too \nlong for an award. The ones we need to focus on, the ones who are sick, \nnow have to wait a long time. It is almost like a lottery system where \nfew claimants--there are a few who get very large awards, but many get \nlittle, often based on simply where, for example, the claim was filed. \nThe big winners are always the trial lawyers who have taken billions of \ndollars out of the system, which is money that should be going to the \nsick victims.\n\n  As much as half of every dollar spent in the system goes to the trial \nlawyers and to other expenses. If we say there is $70 billion, we say \nhalf is not going to the victims, the people being hurt, not to the \npotential victims. Obviously, it is clear that system needs to be \nfixed. It is inequitable, a wasteful system, and nothing is being done \nto make it better. In fact, you can see it is getting worse.\n  Future funds that should be preserved to compensate sick victims are \nsimply being drained away by frivolous claims today. I keep hearing \nmore and more of the large number of unimpaired claims that are filed \nbased on questionable, so-called ``diagnoses'' that are obtained \nthrough these mass screenings. That process simply has to come to an \nend.\n  As business after business has gone bankrupt paying these claims, \nsources of revenue to pay the claims are drying up. Already more than \n70 companies have filed for bankruptcy after being flooded by asbestos \nclaims. The companies that actually manufacture asbestos products have \nlong been bankrupt. Today we have the lawyers zeroing in on new \ncompanies in order to keep funding their suits. Many of these companies \nhave little to do with asbestos. Right now, 8,400 companies have been \nnamed in asbestos suits. That includes mom-and-pop companies all the \nway to Fortune 500 firms. That is 8,400 companies that have been named \nright now in asbestos suits.\n  When companies collapse under this asbestos suit pressure, not only \ndo resources for the sick victims dry up, for the people who have been \naffected physically by asbestos, but now there is a whole new class of \nvictims that has been created. This new class of workers at these \ncompanies lose their jobs and lose not only current payments but also \ntheir retirement savings. Bankruptcies have affected 200,000 people who \nworked at bankrupt companies. Sixty thousand people lost their jobs, \nand these people will lose an estimated $50,000 in wages each because \nof the disruption. Workers also see retirement savings plummet when a \ncompany files for bankruptcy.\n  In the end, the American economy suffers. That, of course, means the \nloss of new jobs and investment, as well as the loss of companies that \nare literally pulled under by these asbestos claims. If the current \nsituation holds, it will cost as many as 400,000 new jobs that could be \ncreated in this time of economic recovery but will not be because of \nthe failure to invest. So we have watched this deterioration and we \nhave talked about it for all too long. Now we must act.\n  So as we move forward, we need to move forward understanding there is \nbipartisan general agreement that the litigation challenge before us, \nwhich has run amok, must be cleaned up. Rationality and justice must be \nrestored and we must get the compensation to those who need it. We must \ndo it through a system that preserves jobs, preserves economic growth \nfor current workers, and stewards funds for future claimants.\n  Indeed, this body has been struggling with these issues for some \ntime, and it has met with success despite the difficulty of reaching \nagreement in some very specific contentious areas. Chairman Hatch did \nyeoman's work in July getting S. 1125 through the committee. There were \na whole range of successes worked out by the committee. Chairman Hatch \nled a major bipartisan solution on a linchpin issue of medical \ncriteria; and without agreement on this issue, we simply would not have \nbeen able to move forward at all. This issue, over time, has proven \nvery difficult, very controversial. I commend him for his leadership in \nbringing the resolution to this particular issue. That is just one of \nthe many examples of issues that have been overcome.\n  Chairman Hatch noted that as many as 50 changes were made at the \nurging of Democrats before--really between the bill's introduction and \nthe time of markup--and there have been many ongoing discussions in the \nwake of that success.\n  I also thank Members on the other side of the aisle. Senator Leahy \nhas worked hard on this bill, and it simply would not have been \npossible to get as far as we have--even though we have a long way to \ngo--without his work on the other side of the aisle, as well as the \nvarious stakeholders who have an interest in this bill.\n  The commitment of many parties has created the momentum for change, \nfor cleaning up the system, and the good faith that has led to a number \nof key breakthroughs that have been seen today and that I am confident \nwill continue to make success possible.\n  Following the committee markup, I became deeply involved in \nnegotiations on S. 1125, working closely with Senator Daschle, as well \nas Chairman Hatch and Senators Leahy, Dodd and Carper, and others on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, has been \nparticularly instrumental working on key elements of the bill, so I \nwish to recognize him for that.\n  Under S. 1125 and current agreements which are embodied in S. 2290, \nwe will\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\nreplace the current adversarial asbestos litigation system with a new \nstreamlined no-fault system where sick victims will be compensated \nfairly and efficiently. A national trust fund will pay claimants, \ncutting out waste and providing certainty and rationality for claimants \nand for businesses. Most importantly, this system will end the \nbankruptcy spiral, therefore preserving future funding for victims who \nneed it.\n  S. 1125, as reported out of committee, represents an unprecedented \nachievement in forging consensus on issues like medical criteria that \nstalled previous attempts at similar legislation. Nonetheless, a number \nof issues were left open for further discussion, and additional \nconcerns were raised that were not addressed by the committee. I \nidentified these issues on the floor on November 22, 2003, and they \ninclude adequacy and security of funding, claims values, administration \nof the system, and protection of claimants from the risk of a funding \nshortfall.\n  Since the bill was reported out of committee, various stakeholders \nand members from both parties have continued negotiations. There have \nbeen more than 20 meetings starting last July at which my staff and \nSenator Specter's staff have negotiated these issues with staff \nrepresenting the minority. What has emerged from all these collective \nefforts is a proposal that retains the key elements of S. 1125, and \nincludes some critical modifications that address concerns that were \nraised by stakeholders. Today's proposal embodies the best thinking on \nthese issues and represents an aggressive yet feasible solution to the \ncrisis.\n  These negotiated agreements make it possible to bring a bill to the \nfloor, and the bill is better for these changes, difficult as they were \nto hammer out.\n  First, we had to make sure the system contained claims values that \nwould fairly and adequately compensate victims. Second, we had to make \nsure funding was adequate--and that any risk of shortfalls rests on \ndefendants and insurers, and not on claimants. The bill also provides \nthe administrator with more flexibility to ensure that any short term \nbulges in claims can be accommodated. Third, we had to make sure the \nnew system would be easy for claimants to use, and that it could be \nfunded and up and running quickly. Fourth, the bill now contains a \nnumber of additional provisions requested by organized labor to protect \nthe rights of claimants. I am also submitting an expanded description \nof these changes for the Record.\n  The top priority of this bill is to compensate claimants, and under \nany analysis, more money reaches claimants under the bill than under \ntoday's flawed tort system. Even so, we know that we needed to reach a \nnumber that Democrats felt comfortable with, so S. 2290 raises claims \nvalues.\n  We agreed to raise the claims values in order to get consensus even \nthough the claims values in S. 1125 as reported represented a \nbipartisan proposal, and included some of the highest values found in \nsimilar Federal compensation programs. We raised the values even though \nS. 1125 already puts more money into the pockets of claimants than the \ncurrent tort system, where more than half of the resources go into the \npockets of attorneys and consultants. Under the revised bill, S. 2290, \napproximately $111.5 billion of the expected $114 billion in fund \nexpenditures will be available for victims. Compare this with \nTilinghast's actuarial study of the current system, where only $61 \nbillion goes to plaintiffs and the rest to legal fees. Or the Milliman \nstudy, where they estimate as much as $92 billion could go to \nplaintiffs and the rest to legal fees. So the bill gets more money to \nvictims than the leading studies estimate could go to them under the \ncurrent system.\n  What's more, S. 2290 actually gets this money to sick victims, \nwhereas much of the money paid into the system today goes to unimpaired \nclaimants. Under the current system, much of the compensation is \ndrained away from the truly ill to fund these unimpaired mass lawsuits. \nRight now, the sickest victims, those with mesothelioma, are receiving \nonly 17 to 20 percent of the funds in the system, with nonmalignant \ncases getting about 65 percent. The proposed bill would prioritize the \nsickest victims--over half of the funding would be directed to those \nwith mesothelioma. Nonmalignant claimants would receive about 20 \npercent. The new system would also increase the share of funds that are \ndirected to pay cancer claims from about 16 or 18 percent to 24 \npercent. Under S. 2290, funds are properly directed at  the sickest \nvictims. And the determination of the medical criteria that should be \nused is a result of the landmark bipartisan agreement made in \nCommittee.\n\n   S. 1125 also presents a substantially better means of obtaining \ncompensation than through bankruptcy trusts. The trusts being created \nin bankruptcies today discriminate between present and future claims, \nand give preferential treatment to certain claimants, not because of \ntheir medical condition, but because they were first in line. Let me \nalso point out that S. 1125 provides significantly more money than \nclaimants could receive from bankruptcy trusts, many of which are \npaying pennies on the dollar. Johns-Manville pays 5 cents on the \ndollar, UNR 9 cents, Celotex 11.3 cents, and topping out at 15.5 cents \nis Eagle Picher. So while some claimants may appear to win big court \ncases, if the defendants are in bankruptcy, which many are, claimants \nwill likely only get pennies on the dollar. In today's bankruptcy \ncompensation system, the risk that a trust may be inadequate falls on \nthe victims, and that is not fair. Unlike these bankruptcy funds, the \nclaims values in S. 1125 will be 100 percent paid or victims will be \nable to return to the tort system.\n   Despite these generous values in the bill as reported, organized \nlabor and Democrats urged that the values were not high enough. So we \nhave agreed to raise the values because it is so important to create \nconsensus and move this bill forward.\n   It is crucial that the fund has the faith and confidence of \nclaimants, and that it can fulfill its mandate to compensate them. \nFunding must be adequate, it much be secure, and provisions must be \nmade for any shortfall. And any risk must fall on defendants and \ninsurers, not claimants.\n   To ensure funding adequacy, the bill establishes a new overall \nfunding framework, which makes available $114 billion for direct victim \ncompensation. The funding provided is substantially more than what is \nestimated to reach victims if the current tort system is allowed to \ncontinue.\n   Let me say a few words about how this relates to the overall funding \nstructure that came out of committee. The mandatory funding in the bill \nas reported was $108 billion, which is similar to what S. 2290 offers. \nThat funding proposal represented a very fair amount to solve the \nproblem. The committee, however, went well beyond this benchmark during \nmarkup. The net effect of the committee modifications to S. 1125's \nfinancial structure was dramatic. S. 1125 as reported could have \nrequired businesses and insurers to provide compensation at up to two \ntimes the most credible estimates of total future plaintiffs' \nrecoveries under the tort system. As a result, insurers almost \nuniformly withdrew their support for the act, calling it ``dangerously \nunaffordable'' and ``potentially worse then the existing system.''\n   In order to get the legislation back on track, I initiated a \nmediation process between insurers and defendant companies. We reached \nagreement whereby $114 billion would be made available for victims. To \nhelp ensure this funding is obtained, enforcement provisions of the \nbill were further strengthened.\n   To address concerns that there will be early stress on funding, the \nrevised schedule requires money from insurer participants to be infused \nin the first years, where it is expected that the highest demands will \nbe placed on the Fund.\n   To protect against any shortfalls, an additional $10 billion \ncontingent funding is also available from defendants if necessary to \npay claims in the out years of the fund's operation.\n   Furthermore, the bill gives the administrator more time and more \nflexibility to deal with a short term bulge in claims, if necessary. \nUnder the bill as reported, the fund could have unnecessarily sunsetted \ndue to a short term liquidity problem if a large number of claims were \nfiled at once. Alternative sunset provisions have been provided, and \nthe borrowing authority has been\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\nexpanded to increase the funds's liquidity. Sufficient funds will now \nbe available to pay in full all claims found eligible before the fund \nsunsets, and any debt incurred by the fund will be paid by monies in \nthe fund and not the United States Treasury.\n   Finally, and critically, under S. 2290 the risk of underestimating \nthe amount of funds needed will not fall on the victims, but on the \ndefendants and their insurers. Historically, rates of asbestos victims' \nclaims filing are uncertain and difficult to predict. Given the \ncreation of the new compensable disease categories in S. 1125 and the \nstreamlined no-fault administrative system, this problem is even more \nacute. But under the proposal, if future claims exceed estimates and \nthe mandatory funding, including the contingency funding, is not enough \nthe fund will end and victims will be able to seek compensation in the \nFederal courts. Ensuring that the risk of underestimation does not fall \non the claimants was a linchpin in organized labor's proposals.\n  There is, however, one particular risk to the fund that must be \naddressed, and that is the lack of predictability of claims by \nindividuals, particularly smokers, who have occupational exposure, but \nnot enough exposure to have caused asbestosis.\n  S. 1125 is careful to provide the highest levels of compensation to \nclaimants whose illness has the greatest causal connection to asbestos. \nIt is not and cannot be a tobacco compensation bill. With that said, \nthe bill sets out within the consensus medical criteria a level VII \ncategory, a new and untested category for lung cancer cases, that may \nend up compensating large numbers of individuals whose illnesses are \nnot caused by asbestos, but by smoking. There are experts who believe \nthe eligibility criteria for this category will reliably screen for \nasbestos-caused lung cancers. But we just don't have enough experience \nwith these claims. With 87 percent of overall lung cancer cases caused \nby smoking, they could inundate and sabotage the fund.\n  Accordingly, I want to put all Senators on notice that I intend to \noffer an amendment, after consultations with all interested parties, to \nprovide a mechanism to protect the solvency of the fund if claims from \nlevel VII's dramatically exceed expected levels.\n  At its heart, today's proposal represents a policy choice. On the one \nhand, we have the status quo, with its delays, failure to compensate \nvictims, bankruptcies, litigation costs, wasteful transaction spending, \nand major negative impact on the economy.\n  On the other hand, we have an opportunity to rationalize this broken \nsystem. It is true that there is some uncertainty in projecting future \nclaims filing rates, but we are putting over $100 billion into the \nsystem. And any risk that this is not enough would fall back on \ndefendants. There would be a reversion to the Federal tort system, and \ndefendants would have to essentially pay twice--after staking over $100 \nbillion they would still be subject to tort claims. And claimants would \nget their day in court. This bargain is a reasonable policy choice.\n  Another fundamental way S. 1125 improves the current tort system is \nthat it is more accessible and simpler for claimants to use. Organized \nlabor, however, had expressed a concern that the administrative \nstructure in S. 1125 as passed out of committee was too adversarial and \ncumbersome. This was a key concern for labor, so in order to address \nthis concern, industry and labor representatives agreed under the \nauspices of Senator Specter and Judge Becker of the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals, to simplify the process. I commend Senator Specter for this \nleadership in that process, and thank Judge Becker for his expertise \nand commitment.\n  Under the new proposal, claims processing will be moved from the \nCourt of Federal Claims to an executive office situated in the \nDepartment of Labor. Now a single administrator will be responsible for \nboth the claims handling and the management of the fund. The fund will \nbenefit from the experience the Department of Labor has garnered from \nadministering similar compensation programs over the past 90 years. The \ninfrastructure already created under these programs will help with \nprompt program initiation.\n  The claims application process will now be more user friendly, there \nare fewer levels of administrative review, and the claimant assistance \nprogram will be expanded. The new structure provides for advisory \ncommittees with expertise on a host of issues to advise the \nadministrator, and allows for contracting with entities who have \nknowledge and experience with asbestos-related injuries and \ncompensation programs to assist in the processing of claims.\n  The new administrative structure also will help address concerns \nabout how quickly funds will begin flowing to claimants--especially \nthose with the most serious diseases, such as mesothelioma, who may \nonly have a short time to live.\n  The new administrative structure will help to ensure that the program \nis up and running quickly and managed efficiently to the benefit of \nclaimants, including providing for interim regulations and interim \nauthority to begin processing claims as soon as possible. The interim \nadministrator may prioritize claims so that the victims with the most \nsevere injuries, especially mesothelioma victims, have their claims \nprocessed first. Money will flow into the system faster, since S. 1125 \nnow requires upfront funding from participants. Money from defendants \nwill be available within 3 months from the date of enactment from \ncertain defendant participants and within 6 months from the remaining \ndefendant participants, which will be in addition to the monies \nreceived from the bankruptcy trusts. There also is authority to require \nupfront money from the insurer participants so that there is no delay \nin obtaining money from the insurers.\n  As an additional protection against an influx of early claims, the \nbill also provides the administrator with expanded borrowing authority \nto ensure that there are sufficient funds available to initiate the \nprogram and to pay claims in short order. The borrowing would be 100 \npercent collateralized against the mandatory payments from participants \nin the Fund.\n\n  These changes are designed to address concerns raised by Senator \nFeinstein in the committee's consideration of the bill. Senator \nFeinstein raised valid concerns that a delay in creation of the claims \nsystem would harm claimants. However, her amendment would have \nessentially left the current system in place for an indefinite amount \nof time and would allow credits for monies to be paid to the fund, \nhaving the unintended effect of perpetuating the status quo with its \ngross misallocation of payments to unimpaired claimants and its \nexcessive attorney fees. Furthermore, it would have threatened the Fund \nitself, by diverting Fund assets to cover these unwarranted claims and \nfees.\n  Given the improvements that have been made to the claims processing \nsystem, good public policy demands expedited termination of the broken \nsystem and commencement of payments to the most worthy claimants, as \ndefined by the consensus medical criteria.\n  Organized labor has an important role to play in protecting the \ninterests of working people in the congressional debate. In addition to \nnumerous concessions associated with the new administrative structure, \nrepresentatives of organized labor aggressively advocated for a number \nof changes, which were adopted. These changes were aimed at ensuring \nthat the program established under S. 1125 was the most fair to \nvictims, as the intended beneficiaries of the program.\n  S. 2290 now provides for medical monitoring reimbursement for costs \nof physical examinations as well as costs for x-rays and pulmonary \nfunction testing.\n  S. 2290 explicitly extends the protections of HIPAA to ensure that \nclaimants cannot be discriminated against for provision of health \ninsurance solely as a result of filing a claim with the Fund.\n  This bill also requires the use of presumptions for satisfying the \nexposure criteria for certain industries, occupations, and time \nperiods.\n  While I have outlined some major changes here, literally dozens of \nadditional changes have been made to S. 1125 since the introduction of \nthe bill. These changes clarify language and strengthen provisions to \nensure that sick claimants are promptly and fairly\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\ncompensated, that the burden and risk on claimants is reduced to the \nextent possible, and that participants can obtain certainty with \nrespect to their asbestos liabilities as necessary to promote the \ncreation of jobs and the economy.\n  And it was recognized, as the bill was being considered by committee, \nthat even as we are dealing with the aftermath of asbestos, the \nsubstance itself is still in limited use. The committee adopted Senator \nMurray's landmark asbestos ban, and this country's workers will be \nsafer for it. It simply did not make sense to create a compensation \nsystem and continue to allow workers to be exposed.\n  We also addressed the terrible situation in Libby, MT, where many \nworkers and residents have become ill from asbestos and \nthe manufacturer, W.R. Grace has filed for bankruptcy leaving victims \nwith little recourse. S. 1125 contains special provisions so that Libby \nvictims can readily gain compensation from the Fund.\n\n  In addition, we must not forget this Nation's veterans. Veterans have \nbeen long overlooked when talking about the asbestos litigation crisis. \nMen and women who served in the Armed Forces were often exposed to \nsignificant amounts of asbestos while serving our country, particularly \nduring World War II and while serving on ships. S. 1125 provides a \nbetter avenue, and may be the only avenue, for veterans to receive fair \nand prompt compensation, while still preserving the veterans' benefits \nthat are currently available.\n  We have set forth a rational system, offering a positive alternative \nto today's broken system. It is one of the largest, boldest \ncompensation programs in this Nation's history. The choice here is not \nabout the mechanics of the program, the final dollar amount, or any \nindividual provision. We can work those things out. The choice is \nwhether to offer victims a better system than we have today, and at the \nsame time rationalize the system to stop the havoc it is causing to \njobs and the economy.\n  Indeed, we have made major progress in getting this bill ready for \nthe floor, especially considering the controversial issues involved. \nWe've had literally dozens of stakeholder meetings. During this \nprocess, all of the issues have been visited and revisited. All parties \nhave been heard, and all concerns have been heard. While such a \nsweeping bill will inevitably contain compromises that are not perfect \nin the eyes of each stakeholder, we have listened to all concerns and \ncome up with the best solutions possible.\n  I had hoped to bring the bill up for a vote before the last session \nended. At that time, a lot of stakeholders felt that was premature. On \nNovember 22 of last year, I announced that I would wait, but that the \nbill would be considered by the end of March. Again on February 27 I \nmade it clear that the bill would be brought up by the end of March. To \ncontinue the discussions among the stakeholders, I again extended this \ntime to the week of April 19, and, thus, we are here. It is time to \nstop talking and bring these issues to resolution.\n  We have waited long enough and worked to create consensus, and now we \nhave significant support to wrap up the outstanding issues--challenging \nas they are--and hold a vote. There have been suggestions almost from \nthe start that we need more time to come up with better answers. We \nhave very few legislative days remaining, and as we feared, we are \nnearly out of time. Senator Hatch and I have consistently offered \nrealistic scheduling and frankly have allowed too much delay already. \nNow we have run the clock out and we must act.\n  Standing still is not an option, as the situation continues to \ndeteriorate. Victims wait for unpredictable and inequitable \ncompensation, companies continue to declare bankruptcy, and jobs and \nthe economy suffer.\n  For many Members, it will require courage and leadership to change \nthe status quo, but I am calling on this body to give the American \npeople a better system for compensating asbestos claimants. Inaction--\nallowing the status quo--is in itself a choice that harms victims and \nAmerican workers.\n  I believe it is time to move forward by offering the changes I have \ndescribed here in an amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a detailed summary of the \nmajor changes in a section-by-section description be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there will no doubt be constructive \nproposals from Senators on both sides of the aisle to refine and \nimprove this bill. That is what the amendment process is all about.\n  I encourage this process. It is my hope the process will be \nconstructive and it will result in a bill that can pass this body. I \nlook forward to the debate and consideration of S. 1125.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          S. 2290--Summary of Changes From S. 1125 as Reported\n\n       S. 1125, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, as \n     reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, represents an \n     unprecedented advance on complex and difficult issues that \n     have stalled previous attempts at similar legislation. \n     Landmark agreements were reached on asbestos injury \n     compensation issues such as medical criteria, and over 50 \n     consensus-building changes were adopted overall. Nonetheless, \n     a number of issues were left open for further discussion, and \n     additional concerns were raised that were not addressed by \n     the Committee. Since the bill was reported out of Committee, \n     various stakeholders and members from both parties have \n     continued negotiations. The substitute bill being introduced \n     reflects agreements on some of these difficult issues reached \n     during these negotiations, and attempts to address a number \n     of concerns that have been raised but have not yet been \n     subject of agreement. In particular, the First/Hatch bill: \n     raises claims values, creates a more streamlined \n     administrative system that can be up and running quickly, \n     provides increased liquidity and upfront funding so that \n     claims can be paid in short order, and places the risk that \n     the Fund runs out of money on the defendants and insurers and \n     not on the claimants. These are just some highlights of the \n     numerous changes that were made to make a fairer system for \n     claimants. The following provides a section-by-section \n     summary of the changes in the First/Hatch bill from S. 1125 \n     as reported with explanations as to the need for the changes.\n\n\n                          sec. 3. definitions\n\n       Changes were made to various definitions under this section \n     to conform with other amendments in the bill to provide \n     clarifications.\n       Sec. 3(3) Definition of ``asbestos claim.'' S. 1125 seeks \n     to replace the current broken tort system with a streamlined, \n     administrative system. S. 1125, therefore, must preempt and \n     supersede all asbestos claims filed in the current tort \n     system. Concerns were raised that the definition of \n     ``asbestos claim'' in S. 1125 as reported may have been \n     interpreted as unduly limited, failing to cover some types of \n     asbestos claims that are currently overburdening the tort \n     system today, which were intended to be preempted and \n     superseded by the Act. This definition was amended to help \n     ensure that the definition is interpreted broadly to \n     encompass all types of claims that are being filed in the \n     system today. This definition has also been amended to make \n     clear that claims alleging damage to tangible property are \n     left intact.\n       [Sec. 3(6) Definition of ``collateral source \n     compensation.'' The disease categories under S. 1125 are not \n     easily translatable from those filed in the tort system. The \n     definition of ``collateral source compensation,'' therefore, \n     was clarified to more clearly encompass awards in the tort \n     system.]\n       Sec. 3(9) Definition of ``insurance receivership \n     proceeding.'' A new definition for ``insurance receivership \n     proceedings'' was added to S. 1125. This definition \n     accompanies changes made to section 402 that would give the \n     Fund a priority for collection of assessments from insurers \n     in state insurance receivership proceedings. These provisions \n     track those provided for insolvent companies in bankruptcy. \n     This definition describes the state law proceedings to which \n     the priority applies. This, like the bankruptcy provisions, \n     help to ensure that the payments made to the Fund are \n     continued despite any subsequent insolvencies of insurer \n     participants.\n       [Sec. 3(11) Definition of ``participant.'' One of the \n     exceptions to ``participant,'' defined in section 3(11), are \n     companies who have completed their bankruptcy proceedings. \n     This exception was amended to ensure that the bill is in \n     concert with the United States Bankruptcy Code. A  company is \n     not ``out of bankruptcy'' until the plan of reorganization \n     becomes effective in accordance with its terms. Under the \n     Bankruptcy Code, changes to the plan can occur until the \n     date on which the plan is ``substantially consummated,'' \n     as defined in section 1101(2) of that Code. Conforming \n     changes were made to applicable sections in the funding \n     provisions under title II.]\n\n\n                   Title I--Asbestos claims resolution\n\n      Subtitle A--Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation\n        The Frist/Hatch bill incorporates a new administrative \n     structure for the processing and\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\n     paying of claims, which was part of an agreement between \n     representatives of labor and industry groups negotiated under \n     the auspices of Senator Specter and Judge Becker. This new \n     structure responds to concerns raised by representatives of \n     organized labor, who wanted a more streamlined and more non-\n     adversarial system than that in S. 1125 as reported. Various \n     aspects of the new structure promote the efficient management \n     of the program and crate a less burdensome system for \n     claimants. Old title I, subtitle A, which created a claims \n     processing structure within the Court of Federal Claims, was \n     replaced with new subtitle A, which creates an executive \n     office situated in the Department of Labor to administer the \n     program. Subtitle B in S. 1125 as reported, which outlined \n     the claims handling process, also was substantially amended \n     to respond to requests by stakeholders. The new \n     administrative structure also contains provisions to ensure \n     that the program is processing claims as soon as possible, \n     which were added as part of the alternative to the Feinstein \n     startup amendment. Conforming changes were made throughout \n     the bill.\n        Sec. 101. Establishment of Office of Asbestos Disease \n     Compensation Program. New section 101 establishes within the \n     Department of Labor, an Office of Asbestos Disease \n     Compensation. This section clarifies that all administrative \n     expenses of the program are to be paid from the Fund. The \n     office is headed by an Administrator, who will be responsible \n     for both the claims handling and the management of the Fund. \n     The Administrator is appointed by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, and reports directly to the \n     Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employment Standards \n     Administration. The general duties of the Administrator are \n     provided in this section, and provisions regarding the \n     Administrator's fund management duties found in section 222 \n     of S. 1125 as reported (p. 168-69) were incorporated into \n     this general authority provision. Civil penalties up to \n     $10,000 for false statements and fraudulent acts against the \n     Office are also provided for under this section. Two Deputy \n     Administrators will be selected by the Administrator--one to \n     carry out the Administrator's claims processing \n     responsibilities, and one to carry out the Administrator's \n     Fund management responsibilities. Finally, a general \n     provision with respect to the application of the Freedom of \n     Information Act (``FOIA'') was added to section 101.\n        Placing the office within the Department of Labor was \n     requested by labor representatives. In addition, much of the \n     provisions in the Frist/Hatch bill are based on provisions \n     from statutes and implementing regulations for compensation \n     programs administered by the Department of Labor. The \n     Administrator, therefore, can utilize the 90 years of \n     experience the Department has in administering similar \n     compensation programs and the infrastructure already created \n     for these programs.\n       Sec. 102. Advisory Committee on Asbestos Disease \n     Compensation. New section 102 provides for the establishment \n     of an Advisory Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation \n     within 120 days after the date of enactment of the Act. The \n     Advisory Committee will advise the Administrator on general \n     policy and administration matters. The Advisory Committee is \n     composed of 24 members with 3-year staggered terms. Sixteen \n     members are to represent the interests of the claimants (at \n     least 4 of which are recommended by recognized labor \n     federations), defendant participants, and insurer \n     participants. The remaining 8 members are appointed by the \n     Administrator and cannot have earned more than 25% of their \n     income for each of the 5 years prior to their appointment by \n     serving in asbestos litigation as consultants or expert \n     witnesses. The Administrator selects a Chairperson and Vice \n     Chairperson. The Advisory Committee must meet at least 4 \n     times a year for the first 5 years of the program and at \n     least twice a year thereafter. The Administrator must provide \n     information and administrative support as may be necessary \n     and appropriate for the Advisory Committee to carry out its \n     functions. The members are entitled to travel and meal \n     expenses. An advisory committee was provided for under the \n     Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program \n     Act (``EEOICPA''), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7384o, which served as a \n     model to the new administrative structure. The size and scope \n     of the Advisory Committee was outlined by labor \n     representatives in order to provide stakeholders with the \n     opportunity to provide the Administrator with input on the \n     compensation program.\n       Sec. 103. Medical Advisory Committee. New section 103 is \n     permissive rather than mandatory, granting the Administrator \n     the authority to create a Medical Advisory Committee to \n     provide general medical advice relating to the review of \n     claims that cannot be adequately addressed by the larger \n     Advisory Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation. To help \n     ensure objectivity on the part of the members of this \n     Committee, individuals who earned more than 25% of their \n     income for each of the 5 years prior to their appointment by \n     serving in asbestos litigation as consultants or expert \n     witnesses cannot be appointed to the Committee.\n       Sec. 104. Claimant Assistance. New section 104 expands the \n     claimant assistance program under section 116 of S. 1125 as \n     reported (p. 39). At the request of labor representatives, \n     the program was expanded to include, among other things, the \n     requirement to establish resource centers and to contract \n     with labor and community based organizations. Aspects of this \n     more expansive program are modeled on Section 7384v of the \n     EEOICPA, for which several resource centers have already been \n     established by the Department of Labor.\n       The streamlined administrative structure and the claimant \n     assistance program, which includes assistance in finding pro \n     bono legal representation, both reduce the burden on the \n     claimant seeking compensation and the need for a lawyer. \n     Although legal representation is allowed, the goal of S. 1125 \n     is to reduce the high transaction costs of the current tort \n     system, which can be upwards of 40% for legal fees to the \n     plaintiff's attorney alone. As such, the Frist/Hatch bill \n     provides for reasonable limits on attorneys fees to reflect \n     this streamlined process, allowing for higher percentages for \n     more complex cases. Penalties are provided for to ensure that \n     these limits are followed.\n       Sec. 105. Physicians Panels. The Physicians Panels were \n     established in order to perform the functions of the Medical \n     Advisory Committee originally contemplated under S. 1125 as \n     reported, section 114(j) (p. 37). The Physicians Panels will \n     provide necessary medical advice in the adjudication of \n     individual claims, as opposed to the newly created \n     Medical Advisory Committee which would advise on general \n     medical policy. While the Administrator still chooses how \n     many panels are required, the statute now requires that \n     each panel be composed of 3 physicians. The third \n     physician is only to be consulted in the event the other \n     two physicians cannot agree. The qualification that \n     physicians serving on the panels be actively practicing \n     was replaced by a limitation that such physicians cannot \n     have earned more than 25% of their income for each of the \n     5 years prior to their appointment as an employee of a \n     participant or a law firm representing any party in \n     asbestos litigation or as a consultant or expert witness \n     in matters related to asbestos litigation. The previous \n     qualification was deleted in order to allow doctors who \n     are retired but have knowledge and experience with \n     diagnosing asbestos-related illnesses may serve on the \n     Physicians Panels. It was replaced by a requirement that \n     sought to ensure objective doctors were placed on these \n     panels. Labor representatives also requested less \n     restrictive compensation provisions due to its impression \n     that it is currently difficult to retain qualified doctors \n     under the EEOICPA because of a limitation on compensation. \n     A provision ensuring that Physicians Panels are exempted \n     from the Federal Advisory Committee Act was also included \n     at the request of labor representatives.\n       Sec. 106. Program Initiation. New section 106 was inserted \n     in order to address concerns raised by labor representatives \n     that the program could take an inordinate amount of time to \n     start paying claims. This section requires the establishment \n     of interim regulations, including regulations for the \n     processing of exigent claims, within 90 days from the date of \n     enactment in order to allow for an expeditious program \n     startup, addressing concerns raised that victims do not have \n     time to wait through undue delays until a whole new \n     administrative program is established. The Secretary of Labor \n     is required to provide the Administrator with temporary \n     personnel and other resources as necessary to facilitate the \n     initiation of the program. This section also defines \n     ``exigent health claims'' as those made by individuals who \n     are living mesothelioma claimants and others who have been \n     diagnosed as terminally ill from an asbestos-related illness \n     and having a life expectancy of less than one year. The \n     Administrator has the discretion to identify additional \n     exigent health claims as well as extreme financial hardship \n     claims to be handled on an expedited basis.\n       Stakeholders recognized that an interim administrator may \n     be appointed in the event that the Administrator is a \n     presidential appointee to avoid any delays related to the \n     Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation of an \n     Administrator. To address this issue, the Frist/Hatch bill \n     provides that the Assistant Secretary of Labor for the \n     Employment Standards Administration serve as Interim \n     Administrator, until the Administrator is appointed. The \n     Interim Administrator may begin processing and awarding \n     claims without regard to the time limits set forth in the \n     title I, subtitle B. The Interim Administrator also may \n     prioritize claims processing based on severity and causation, \n     so that living mesothelioma victims or terminally ill \n     claimants, who may not have much time, can be placed first in \n     line and be paid as quickly as possible. The provisions, \n     along with placing the Office within the Department of Labor, \n     help to ensure that the program can be up and running in \n     short order and effectively administered in the long run.\n       Sec. 107. Authority of the Administrator. New section 107 \n     was added to provide the Administrator with general authority \n     to issue subpoenas and conduct hearings, and is derived from \n     the Federal Employees Compensation Act (``FECA''), 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 8126. Such authority is necessary to implement the \n     Administrator's responsibilities under the Act.\n     Subtitle B--Asbestos Disease Compensation Procedures\n       Subtitle B lays out the claims handling process. Although \n     it incorporates many of the same provisions found in title I, \n     subtitle B, of S. 1125 as reported, new subtitle B represents \n     the more streamlined process requested by labor \n     representatives and includes changes which labor felt would \n     create a fairer process for claimants.\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\n       Sec. 111. Essential Elements of Eligible Claim. Section 111 \n     amends old section 113 from S. 1125 as reported (p. 28) as \n     requested by labor representatives, by collapsing the \n     requirements that were listed separately into a general \n     reference to the ``medical criteria'' section in subtitle C, \n     which includes latency, exposure, diagnostic and medical \n     criteria requirements.\n       Sec. 112. General Rule Concerning No-Fault Compensation. No \n     change from old section 112 in S. 1125 as reported (p. 28).\n       Sec. 113. Filing of Claims. New section 113 revises section \n     111 from S. 1125 as reported (p. 23). Section 113(a)(1) \n     incorporates the definition of ``personal representative'' as \n     the term is defined in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 104.4, which contains \n     the regulations governing the September 11th Victim \n     Compensation Fund of 2001. This change was made to avoid some \n     of the difficulties that may be encountered in defining who \n     may file on behalf of a deceased claimant and sorting through \n     potential familial disputes. Also at the request of labor \n     representatives, new provisions defining the ``date of \n     filing'' and clarifying the procedures for handling \n     incomplete claims were added. These provisions were based on \n     the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2210 \n     note, section 6(d), and regulations implementing the EEOICPA, \n     20 C.F.R. Sec. 30.100(c), and the Black Lung Act, 20 C.F.R. \n     Sec. Sec. 725.404(d), 725.409.\n       Statute of Limitations. Labor representatives raised a \n     concern with respect to the statute of limitations section in \n     S. 1125 as reported, which would allow setoffs in multiple \n     injury cases of recoveries for all prior claims made with the \n     Fund (section 111(c)(3), p. 27). New section 113(b) clarifies \n     that a claimant who files a second injury claim with the Fund \n     for a subsequently diagnosed malignant disease does not \n     receive a setoff for prior recoveries from the Fund in cases \n     where the claimant has already filed and resolved a claim \n     with the Fund for a nonmalignant injury. This new provision \n     is based on the 2002 Trust Distribution Procedures for the \n     Manville Trust, which recognizes that claimants who develop \n     and receive awards for a nonmalignant claim should not \n     receive setoffs in the event that claminant is subsequently \n     diagnosed with a malignant disease.\n       Another change was made to the statute of limitations for \n     pending claims. Although S. 1125 creates a specific statute \n     of limitations for ``pending claims'' timely filed in the \n     courts or with a bankruptcy trust, S. 1125 does not seek to \n     revive stale claims. As such, a definition of ``pending \n     claims'' with bankruptcy trust was added to clarify when such \n     a claim is ``pending'' for purposes of the statute of \n     limitations. The new definition provides that only claims \n     that have not yet been resolved with the trust be allowed to \n     take advantage of the relaxed statute of limitations, and \n     that claims will not be considered pending simply because \n     they are awaiting additional payment installments or may have \n     the potential to have increased payment.\n       Required Information. Additional changes were made to the \n     required information provision of S. 1125 to reflect concerns \n     raised by labor representatives that the application \n     requirements were too strict, and to clarify certain require \n     information at the request of labor representatives.\n       Sec. 114. Eligibility Determinations and Claims Awards. New \n     section 114 replaces the claims handing provisions of S. 1125 \n     as reported, including the administrative appeals process, \n     largely in response to requests by labor representatives. It \n     establishes a more streamlined system, eliminating at least \n     one level of review from S. 1125; thereby resulting in the \n     deletion of subtitle E of title I (En Banc Review) in S. 1125 \n     as reported. Subsection (a) authorizes the Administrator to \n     render decisions on claims for compensation. This language is \n     based on provisions found in FECA, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8124. \n     Subsection (a) also clarifies that costs associated with any \n     additional medical evidence or testing requested by the \n     Administrator as part of the individual's claim shall be \n     borne by the Fund.\n       Proposed and Final Decisions. The Administrator is required \n     to issue a proposed decision, containing findings of fact and \n     conclusions of law as well as an explanation of the \n     procedures for review, within [90] days of the filing of a \n     complete claim. The claimant then has the opportunity to \n     request, in writing within [90] days of issuance of the \n     proposed decision, an informal hearing or review of the \n     written record. If a hearing is requested, it is to be \n     conducted before a representative of the Administrator, and \n     claimants have the right to request a subpoena, which may be \n     granted or denied at the sole discretion of the \n     representative hearing the claim. If no review has been \n     requested, the Administrator issues a final decision. If the \n     final decision in such cases materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant may then seek review. If \n     review of the proposed decision is requested, the \n     Administrator is required to issue a final decision within \n     [180] days after the request for a hearing, and [90] days \n     after the request for review on the written record. A \n     claimant may authorize an attorney or other individual to \n     represent him or her in any proceeding under this Act. The \n     provisions in new section 114 are largely based on FECA and \n     its regulations and on regulations implementing the EEOICPA.\n       Sec. 115. Medical Evidence Auditing Procedures. New section \n     115 consolidates various program-wide and individual claims \n     auditing provisions found in S. 1125 (sections 115(a), (b), \n     p. 38, sections 114(c)(3)(B)(i), (c)(4), p. 31-32), with some \n     modifications. The general auditing authority was clarified \n     to require the development of methods for auditing and \n     evaluating medical evidence and other types of evidence \n     submitted to the Office (new section 115(a)(1)).\n       Independent Certified B-Readers. The provisions providing \n     for review of x-rays by independent certified B-readers was \n     amended to allow the Administrator to consider the findings \n     of the independent certified B-readers rather than denying \n     the claim in the event the independent B-readers disagree \n     with the reading submitted by the claimant as was previously \n     provided. This change was made to account for potential \n     disagreements between the independent certified B-readers \n     (new section 115(b)(3)). The purpose of this review, however, \n     is still to ensure that questionable x-ray readings submitted \n     by claimants are not considered when determining eligibility.\n       Smoking Assessment. Provisions on the assessment of \n     claimant representations as to their smoking status was \n     amended to clarify that such review applies only to other \n     cancer claims, lung cancer claims, and exceptional medical \n     claims. Based on past experience of claims filing, this \n     section also now provides that the review of claims on \n     smoking status should address at least 5 percent of the \n     claimants asserting status as nonsmokers or ex-smokers \n     because of the potential for fraud in such cases.\n     Subtitle C--Medical Criteria\n       In order to preserve the bipartisan agreement reached with \n     respect to medical criteria, no changes have been made to \n     this subtitle except where necessary to conform to the \n     revised administrative structure under title I. One \n     substantive change that was made as part of the agreement \n     between labor and industry representatives on the \n     administrative structure was to add a requirement that the \n     Administrator develop presumptions for satisfying the \n     exposure criteria for certain industries, occupations, and \n     time periods. A similar provision was included in S. 1125 as \n     introduced, but was dropped from the medical criteria in S. \n     1125 as reported.\n     Subtitle D--Awards\n       Several major changes were made to Subtitle D (p. 81) of \n     title I in S. 1125 as reported. [First, section 131(b)(1) \n     adjusts the claims values to reflect those proposed by the \n     Majority Leader (and to correct one apparent typographical \n     error for nonsmoker, Level VIII claims). This bill raises \n     claims values above S. 1125 in several categories.] Second, \n     section 132(b) now provides medical monitoring reimbursement \n     for costs of physical examinations by the claimant's \n     physician as well as costs for x-rays and pulmonary function \n     testing. A physical examination is another important element \n     for obtaining a proper diagnosis, and should also be covered \n     by the fund. Finally, although providing for payments over a \n     three-year period was provided for in Committee at the \n     request of labor and democrats, it was further clarified, \n     also at the request of labor and democrats, that such \n     payments should be made in the following amounts: 40% the \n     first year, 30% the second year, and 30% the third year. The \n     statute now provides a standard by which the Administrator \n     must comply to extend such payments to 4 years--that is, if \n     warranted in order to preserve the overall solvency of the \n     Fund.\n\n\n            title ii--asbestos injury claims resolution fund\n\n     Subtitle A--Asbestos Defendants Funding Allocation\n       In addition to technical amendments, Subtitle A was amended \n     to reflect the new funding allocation to defendant \n     participants proposed by the Majority Leader, to provide a \n     structure that would guarantee the $2.5 billion (net of \n     hardship and inequity adjustments) in defendant participant \n     annual contributions, and to incorporate a funding proposal \n     that would infuse the Fund with monies within months of \n     enactment.\n       Aggregate Payment Obligations Level. As part of the \n     Majority Leader's funding proposal, section 202(a) now \n     provides that the defendant participants be required to pay \n     $57.5 billion to the Fund, subject only to a contingent call \n     for additional payments. Section 204(h) requires annual \n     aggregate payments to the Fund of $2.5 billion a year for 23 \n     years or until such time as the requirement in section 202(a) \n     is reached (if it is reached in less than 23 years). In the \n     event there are insufficient monies collected from defendant \n     participants to reach this annual requirement (net of any \n     hardship and inequity adjustments) in any given year, the \n     Administrator is granted the authority to obtain the \n     balance from a guaranteed payment account established \n     pursuant to section 204(k). If there are insufficient \n     funds in the guaranteed payment account to raise the \n     balance required, the Administrator is granted the \n     authority to impose a guaranteed payment surcharge under \n     section 204(l) on all defendant participants, on a pro-\n     rata basis in accordance with the liabilities under \n     sections 202 and 203, as necessary to raise this minimum \n     aggregate payment obligation (net of hardship and inequity \n     adjustments) in any one year.\n       Financial hardship and Inequity Adjustments. Unlike S. 1125 \n     as reported, the defendant funding formula now guarantees \n     that funding will be available for hardship and inequity \n     adjustments up to the annual limit of $250 million. Section \n     204(d) was clarified to\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\n     ensure that adjustments in effect in any one year made for \n     both financial hardship and inequity are subject to a \n     combined $250 million cap. Although limits based on a fixed \n     percentage roughly equating to $150 million for severe \n     financial hardship and $100 million for demonstrated inequity \n     were originally provided, the Administrator is now given the \n     discretion to use the $250 million for demonstrated inequity \n     adjustments and for financial hardship adjustments as deemed \n     necessary. It is anticipated that the severe financial \n     hardship adjustments will increase in importance in the \n     future as companies become confronted with unanticipated and \n     unpredictable financial hardships. The Administrator's \n     discretion would be broad enough to allow the Administrator \n     to reallocate monies from inequity adjustments to accommodate \n     future financial hardships. [In addition, unlike S. 1125 as \n     reported, such adjustment determinations would be subject to \n     review.]\n       A financial hardship and inequity adjustment account under \n     section 204(j) replaces the orphan share reserve account in \n     S. 1125 as reported (section 223(h), p. 189). Under section \n     204(k), any excess monies above the $2.5 billion minimum \n     aggregate annual payments are to be placed into the financial \n     hardship and inequity adjustment account up to $250 million \n     in any given year. Any monies not used in the account in any \n     given year are carried over for use in the next year. Any \n     additional excess funds (after the $250 million) go to the \n     guaranteed payment account established under section 204(k) \n     to be used to ensure that the defendant participants reach \n     the minimum annual aggregate payment amount (net of hardship \n     and inequity adjustments) in future years. The monies in the \n     financial hardship and inequity adjustment account are now to \n     be used only to the extent the Administrator grants a \n     financial hardship or inequity adjustment, and not in the \n     event a defendant participant files for bankruptcy and cannot \n     meet its obligations as previously provided in S. 1125 as \n     reported. The guaranteed payment account provided for under \n     section 204(k) (plus the potential surcharge) is meant to \n     address any potential shortfalls due to such bankruptcies.\n       Contingent Call. Pursuant to the new Frist funding \n     proposal, only defendant participants are subject to a \n     contingent call for additional payments and, therefore, the \n     contingent call provisions in S. 1125 as reported (section \n     223(f), p. 179-87) were moved to subtitle A of title II and \n     amended to reflect the new Frist funding formula. Due to the \n     increased liquidity provided for under the Frist funding \n     proposal, the back-end payments provisions (section 223(g), \n     p. 187-89) were deleted. The amended contingent call \n     provision, section 204(m), grants the Administrator the \n     authority to require up to $10 billion in additional payments \n     to be allocated based on the defendant allocation scheme in \n     sections 202 and 203. To invoke the contingent \n     call authority, the Administrator must certify, after \n     consultation with appropriate experts, that such monies \n     are required to meet the Fund's obligations. Although the \n     Administrator may invoke the contingent call authority at \n     any time for purposes of borrowing monies, the additional \n     payments may not be assessed against defendant \n     participants until after the total aggregate payment \n     amount has been reached.\n       Upfront funding. Subtitle A also reflects changes that \n     would require defendant participants to provide upfront \n     funding to infuse the Fund with monies to begin paying claims \n     within months of enactment. Section 204(i) requires a \n     defendant participant to make a good faith determination as \n     to its prior asbestos expenditures and/or payments made to \n     pay claims brought under the Federal Employees Liability Act \n     (``FELA''), and submit payments to the Administrator within \n     90 days of the date of enactment for Tiers I and VII and \n     within 180 days of the date of enactment for Tiers II through \n     VI. It is believed that 90 days is sufficient time for \n     debtors and Tier VII defendant participants to determine \n     their liability under this section and make initial payments. \n     Due to the greater complexity of determining prior asbestos \n     expenditures for Tiers II through VI, however, 180 days is \n     allowed for defendant participants to be able to make an \n     initial, good-faith determination and payment, conforming to \n     the 6 month requirement for bankruptcy trusts to assign their \n     assets to the Fund. The Administrator would still make a \n     final determination as to a defendant participant's tier and \n     subtier, and request additional payment or rebate for year 1 \n     if necessary. After the initial payment, defendant \n     participants must then make payments and submit information \n     as prescribed by the Administrator. The right to an \n     administrative rehearing was also clarified, and the statute \n     now expressly requires the exhaustion of such administrative \n     remedies prior to seeking judicial review.\n       Clarifications for Debtors. The superseding provisions \n     related to debtors under section 202(e) were clarified to \n     ensure that a plan of reorganization or other agreement \n     associated with asbestos claims are superseded.\n     Subtitle B--Asbestos Insurers Commission\n       Subtitle B in S. 1125 as reported has been amended to \n     reflect the new Frist funding proposal and to address \n     potential constitutional problems that were inherent in \n     Subtitle B of S. 1125 as reported. [Additional changes to \n     further clarify these provisions may be necessary.]\n       Establishment of Asbestos Insurers Commission. Given the \n     authority granted to the Commission, the appointment \n     provisions in S. 1125 as reported allowing for Presidential \n     appointment of the members after mere consultation with \n     certain members of Congress, present potential appointments \n     clause problems. Section 211, therefore, now provides that \n     the members of the Commission are appointed by the President \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate. In addition, \n     Section 211 now provides that the Commission may act based on \n     the participation of a majority of the members. S. 1125 as \n     reported had required all the members be present for the \n     Commission to be able to act, which was not practical and \n     could have resulted in unnecessary delays in the allocation \n     process.\n       Aggregate Payment Obligation Levels. As part of the \n     Majority Leader's funding proposal, section 212(a)(2) \n     provides that the insurer participants be required to pay \n     $46.025 billion to the Fund, and section 212(a)(3) outlines \n     the annual aggregate payments. Insurer  participant payments \n     are front loaded, but are to be paid over a period of 27 \n     years. Additional conforming changes were made to reflect \n     the new funding provisions and to clarify the allocation \n     process and criteria.\n        Upfront Funding. Similar to the defendant participants, \n     the insurer participants are now required to provide upfront \n     funding to help infuse the Fund with monies to begin paying \n     claims quickly. Sec. 212(e) grants the Administrator the \n     authority to require insurer participants to pay interim \n     contributions to the Fund to assure adequate funding by \n     insurer participants during the period between the date of \n     enactment of the Act and the date when the Commission issues \n     its final determination of contributions. Contributions \n     required by the Administrator will be credited to the insurer \n     participants subsequent payment obligations established by \n     the Commission.\n       Guaranteed Payment. [To be determined.]\n      Subtitle C--Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund\n        As described above, various provisions were moved to other \n     parts of the bill and deleted from subtitle C in S. 1125 as \n     reported. In addition to provisions previously identified, \n     the provisions relating to violations of environmental and \n     occupational health and safety requirements (section 222(c), \n     p. 171) were moved to Title IV--Miscellaneous Provisions. \n     Various substantive changes, as well as other conforming \n     changes and technical corrections, were made to this subtitle \n     to help increase the Fund's liquidity and to help protect the \n     integrity of the Fund.\n        Borrowing Authority. As part of the Majority Leader's \n     funding proposal, the borrowing authority provision of S. \n     1125 as reported (section 223(c), p. 177) was amended to \n     provide more expansive authority to increase the Fund's \n     liquidity. Under new section 223(b), the Administrator is now \n     authorized to borrow against up to seven years of expected \n     payments by the participants. The new borrowing provisions \n     clarify that any debt incurred is to be paid solely by \n     amounts available in the Fund. To help ensure that the fund \n     is up and running quickly, monies may be borrowed from the \n     Federal Financing Bank during the first two years of the \n     Fund. The increased liquidity will also help to fix short-\n     term funding problems in the event there is a bulge in claims \n     to ensure that the Fund is not unnecessarily subject to an \n     early sunset.\n        Increased Enforcement. Additional provisions were added to \n     subtitle C to strengthen the Administrator's authority to \n     enforce the participants' payment obligations. New audit \n     authority has been provided for under section 223(d). This \n     audit authority is for the following purposes: (a) \n     ascertaining the correctness of any payments made to the \n     Fund; (b) determining whether a person who has not made a \n     payment to the Fund was required to do so; (c) determining \n     the liability of any person for a payment to the Fund; (d) \n     collecting any such liability; or (e) inquiring into any \n     office connected with the administration of enforcement of \n     title II. In addition to the criminal penalties already \n     provided for in S. 1125 as reported, civil penalties for \n     false statements and fraudulent acts against the \n     Administrator have been added under this section. The \n     enforcement provisions in section 225 now provide that the \n     Administrator may enforce the provisions of this Act in \n     proceedings outside of the United States to ensure the \n     ability to go after recalcitrant foreign companies subject to \n     the liabilities under the Act. Additional enforcement \n     provisions aimed at insurer participants were also added \n     to section 225. New section 226 provides that interest be \n     paid on any amount of payment obligation that is not paid \n     on or before the last date prescribed for payment.\n\n\n                       title iii--judicial review\n\n       The judicial review provisions in S. 1125 were largely \n     replaced to reflect changes in the administrative structure \n     and to simplify the provisions. These changes were largely as \n     a result of negotiations between representatives of labor and \n     industry.\n       Sec. 301. Judicial Review of Rules and Regulations. Section \n     301 now applies to judicial challenges of rules and \n     regulations promulgated by the Administrator or the Asbestos \n     Insurers Commission pursuant to the Act, granting the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     exclusive jurisdiction over such actions. Any petition for \n     review must be filed within 60 days of the date the notice of \n     such promulgation appears in the Federal Register.\n       Sec. 302. Judicial Review of Award Decisions. Section 302 \n     now applies to judicial review of eligibility determinations \n     made by\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\n     the Administrator. Any claimant adversely affected or \n     aggrieved by a final decision of the Administrator awarding \n     or denying compensation may petition for judicial review \n     within [90] days of the issuance of a final decision of the \n     Administrator. Such petition may only be filed in the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the claimant \n     resides at the time of the issuance of the final order. At \n     the request of labor representatives, the standard of review \n     of such eligibility determinations was changed from the usual \n     arbitrary and capricious standard to a substantial evidence \n     standard.\n       Sec. 303. Judicial Review of Participants' Assessments. \n     Section 303 now applies to judicial challenges of \n     participants' assessments made by the Administrator or the \n     Asbestos Insurers Commission. The United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, rather than the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia as \n     was provided in S. 1125 as reported, has exclusive \n     jurisdiction over such actions. A petition for review must be \n     filed within 60 days of the final determination giving rise \n     to such action. Defendant participants must file a petition \n     for review within 30 days of the Administrator's final \n     determination (after rehearing), and insurer participants \n     must file a petition for review within 30 days of receiving \n     notice of a final determination.\n       Sec. 304. Other Judicial Challenges. Section 304 provides \n     that any action challenging the constitutionality of any \n     provision of the Act must be brought in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia. The provision \n     also authorizes direct appeal to the Supreme Court on an \n     expedited basis. An action under this section shall be filed \n     within 60 days after the date of enactment or 60 days after \n     the final action of the Administrator or the Commission \n     giving rise to the action, whichever is later. The District \n     Court and Supreme Court are required to expedite to the \n     greatest possible extent the disposition of the action and \n     appeal.\n       Sec. 305. In General. As provided in S. 1125 as reported, \n     section 305 also states that no stays of payments into the \n     Fund pending appeal are allowed. In addition, no judicial \n     review other than as set forth in sections 301, 302 and 303 \n     is allowed. Any decision of the federal court finding any \n     part of the FAIR Act to be unconstitutional shall be \n     reviewable as a matter of right by direct appeal to the \n     Supreme Court within 30 days of such ruling.\n\n\n                   title iv--miscellaneous provisions\n\n       The following provisions in Title IV have been amended from \n     S. 1125 as reported.\n       Sec. 402. Effect on Bankruptcy Laws. Various changes were \n     made to section 402 for clarifications and to address \n     possible constitutional arguments that may affect the ability \n     of the Fund to receive assets from current bankruptcy trusts.\n       Sec. 403. Effect on Other Laws and Existing Claims.\n       Asbestos Claims Barred. Section 403(d)(2) is changed to \n     address a variety of unconventional asbestos claims that \n     plaintiffs have asserted directly against both defendant \n     participants and insurer participants in the tort system.\n       Subsection (d)(6) is added to permit parties to obtain a \n     credit in the event that a court ignores or misapplies the \n     exclusive remedy provisions of the Act, and erroneously \n     awards a judgment in favor of asbestos claimants outside of \n     the federal compensation program.\n       Initiation of the Fund. Because the new administrative \n     structure and the new funding provisions were amended to \n     ensure that the program is up and running in a matter of \n     months, section 403(d)(5) (p. 211) was deleted from the bill.\n       Sec. 404. Effect on Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts. \n     Section 404 (Section 406 in the Committee Bill) deals with \n     the effect of the Act on insurance and reinsurance contracts. \n     Section 406 as it came out of Committee accounted for \n     ``erosion'' of insurance policies that cover not only \n     asbestos liabilities, but also potentially other liabilities. \n     The section established how contributions to the fund by \n     insurers and reinsurers would reduce the limits of existing \n     insurance policies held by the defendant participants.\n       Erosion. Changes have been made in section 404(a), dealing \n     with erosion of insurance coverage limits, in order to \n     account for the possibility of an early sunset of the Fund. \n     Based upon the assumption that insurers and reinsurers will \n     be required to make payments into the Fund for 27 years after \n     enactment, erosion of the policy limits is deemed to occur at \n     enactment. If the Act sunsets early, however, the insurers \n     may not be required to pay the full amount for which they \n     have been given erosion credit. In order to treat this \n     situation, section 404 has been amended to provide for the \n     restoration of unearned erosion that exists at the time of an \n     early sunset.\n       Additionally, section 404(a)(2)(B) has been amended to \n     conform the Act to the revised funding structure. The Bill \n     that passed out of Committee deemed certain erosion to occur \n     upon a contingent call because the contingent funding was \n     shared equally by the insurer participants and the defendant \n     participants. Any required contingent funding is now to be \n     required solely of defendants, and therefore no erosion will \n     be deemed to occur upon contingent payments.\n       Finite Risk Policies Preserved. The Frist/Hatch bill \n     includes a new section 404(d), dealing with finite risk \n     policies. Finite risk policies are non-traditional insurance \n     and reinsurance vehicles that have in recent years been \n     obtained by a relatively small number of defendants in \n     asbestos litigation and some of their insurers in an effort \n     to responsibly manage their asbestos liabilities. These \n     contractual arrangements were specifically designed because \n     traditional asbestos coverage was no longer available after \n     the mid-1980s. Generally, finite risk policies provide \n     coverage with respect to events that occurred in the past and \n     are already known to both parties to the contract. Commercial \n     General Liability insurance provides coverage usually for \n     injuries that may occur in the future.\n       Because of the unique nature of these kinds of contractual \n     arrangements, it is appropriate that finite risk insurance be \n     excluded from the legislation. This will avoid the danger \n     that participants that have entered into these arrangements \n     could be required to pay twice. Without the exclusion, \n     participants that have entered into finite risk arrangements \n     would be required to pay substantial amounts to the trust \n     fund and also be subject to a potential forfeiture of their \n     rights to funds comprised, in effect, mostly of their own \n     money used to prepay their asbestos liabilities. The \n     participants that have obtained finite risk insurance should \n     not be penalized by the legislation. If the finite risk \n     arrangements are not excluded from the legislation, the \n     insurance carriers issuing the finite risk insurance policies \n     would reap a substantial windfall at the expense of such \n     participants.\n       Treatment of Other Insurance and Reinsurance Rights or \n     Obligations. A new section 404(e) has been added to specify \n     the effect of the Act on certain reinsurance and insurance \n     claims. Generally, no participant may pursue coverage claims \n     against another participant or captive insurer for required \n     payments to the Fund. Certain insurance assignments are \n     voided. Otherwise, the Act does not affect insurance or \n     reinsurance rights or obligations unless a person voluntarily \n     pays a claim superseded by the Act or otherwise available \n     limits are deemed eroded.\n       Sec. 405. Annual Report of the Administrator. The sunset \n     provisions in S. 1125 as reported (section 404(3), p. 214) \n     created an inflexible trigger that could cause the Fund to \n     terminate unnecessarily because of a short-term bulge in \n     claims to the detriment of claimants. Section 405 amends old \n     section 404 to provide a workable alternative to the sunset \n     provisions, giving the Administrator more time and more \n     flexibility, such as through the increased borrowing \n     authority, to deal with a short term aberration in claims and \n     available funding. S. 1125 only gave the Administrator a mere \n     90 days to correct for short-term liquidity problems. S. 1125 \n     as reported also would have only ensured that 95% of the \n     award amounts owed for the prior year and 95% of eligible \n     claimants be paid prior to sunset. The alternative now in the \n     bill would require that sufficient funds be available to pay \n     all resolved claims in full. Moreover, the bill now makes \n     clear that any debt incurred by the Fund is paid by monies in \n     the Fund and not the United States treasury. These provisions \n     also ensure that the risk that the Fund runs out of money is \n     borne by the participants, providing that, in the event of \n     sunset, a federal cause of action is created and the \n     claimants may file their claims in federal court.\n       Sec. 406. Rules of Construction Relating to Liability of \n     the United States. This section was previously section 405 in \n     S. 1125 as reported [with one change to conform to the new \n     administrative structure].\n       Sec. 407. Rules of Construction. Provisions found in \n     section 101(d) of S. 1125 as reported (p. 23) can now be \n     found under new section 407.\n       Sec. 408. Violations of Environmental and Occupational \n     Health and Safety Requirements. Provisions found in section \n     222(c) of S. 1125 as reported (p. 171) are now placed in new \n     section 408.\n       [Sec. 409. Tax Treatment. Currently, insurers have tax-\n     deductible status for reserves originally set aside for \n     payment of asbestos claims. Under S. 1125, these reserves \n     would now be used to pay assessments required by the Act. New \n     section 409 would maintain the tax deductibility of these \n     reserves until such time as the insurer makes payment to the \n     Fund.]\n       Sec. 410. Nondiscrimination of Health Insurance. New \n     section 410 incorporates a proposed amendment by labor \n     representatives and Democrats that explicitly extends the \n     protections of HIPAA to ensure that claimants cannot be \n     discriminated against for provision of health insurance \n     solely as a result of filing a claim for medical monitoring \n     reimbursement with the Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4111-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will address a couple of issues. I am \ndisappointed we have come to debate the asbestos issue under these \ncircumstances. I agree with much of what\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\nthe majority leader has said about the need for the Senate and our \ncountry to constructively address this problem. I agree there has been \na negative economic impact on many of our most prestigious businesses \nthroughout the country. I agree in many ways the current system has \nbeen deficient. So there is much of what the majority leader said in \nhis description of the situation with which I agree.\n  He did not mention, but I think it ought to be noted, that as we \nspeak the estimate is 1.3 million Americans are still exposed to \nasbestos in their places of work; that asbestos is still legal in this \ncountry; and that we import 29 million pounds of asbestos each year, a \n300 percent increase in the last decade.\n  He did not mention, but I think it also is noteworthy, the peak death \ntoll for asbestos is not likely to occur for approximately 15 years. \nThe primary asbestos-related illnesses could cause at least 100,000 \ndeaths: mesothelioma, asbestosis. An average 10,000 victims per year \ndie from asbestos exposure. More Americans die of asbestos-related \nillness than drownings and fires combined already. Estimates range that \ncurrent and future victims could be--and this is a stunning number--1.2 \nmillion to 2.6 million people.\n  So we are called upon to write legislation that will become law that \nprojects our best guess on how to address those numbers, not this year \nbut for the next 20 to 30 years. If we are going to do this, I would \nhope in the deepest sense of what it means to be a Senator we do it \nright. I must say we are far from that point as we begin this debate \nthis morning. We are not doing this right.\n  I want to talk a little bit about why I do not believe we are, but it \nis not just the view expressed by some of us on this side--I will go \ninto procedures and lost opportunities over the next couple of \nminutes--but there was an article in the paper this morning quoting a \nprestigious and engaged Member of the Senate, Senator Specter, who says \nthe current plan is counterproductive and argues about why this \nlegislation is not ready for the consideration the majority leader \ninsists we give it today. I ask unanimous consent this article be \nprinted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Apr. 20, 2004]\n\n       Specter Says Frist's Asbestos Plan Is `Counterproductive'\n\n                            (By Klaus Marre)\n\n       A centrist Republican is speaking out against a Senate \n     leadership plan to force a vote this week on a controversial \n     asbestos reform bill.\n       In his first interview on asbestos litigation legislation, \n     Specter said that it would be ``counterproductive to force a \n     cloture vote'' on a bill recently introduced by Senate \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Senate Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). The measure, which \n     would set up a trust fund to pay victims of asbestos \n     exposure, is expected to be debated on the Senate floor this \n     week.\n       Frist spokeswoman Amy Call said Republicans would seek a \n     cloture vote if Democrats object to a unanimous consent \n     agreement on the legislation. ``Senator Frist feels that \n     providing compensation for asbestos victims is an urgent and \n     important piece of legislation that the Senate needs to act \n     on, which is why he is bringing it to the floor this week,'' \n     Call said.\n       Asbestos reform has failed to move in the Senate for a \n     number of reasons, but the major dispute centers on the \n     amount of the planned trust fund. The new bill would be able \n     to pay $114 billion in claims and has a $10 billion \n     contingency fund, which organized labor says kicks in too \n     late.\n       The previous legislation had a total value of $153 billion, \n     including a larger contingency fund that the unions had \n     approved.\n       Specter credited Frist for pressing for action on asbestos \n     reform but said a vote on the new bill would be premature. He \n     added that continuing the long-running negotiations between \n     industry groups, unions and other affected parties is more \n     likely to succeed than a cloture vote.\n       The Pennsylvania senator, who faces an April 27 primary \n     against Rep. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), stressed that he was not \n     criticizing Frist. But he said that his weekly meetings with \n     stakeholders on asbestos reform have yielded ``a tremendous \n     amount of progress,'' adding that he is ``afraid that cloture \n     will hurt efforts to continue the negotiation process.''\n       Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) agrees. Before the April \n     congressional recess, Carper said Frist was moving too \n     quickly on asbestos and urged him to continue negotiating and \n     bring a compromise to a vote later in May.\n       Various stakeholders have come out against the Frist-Hatch \n     bill. In an April 15 letter to Frist, several insurance \n     companies, such as The Chubb Group and the American \n     International Group said the legislation contains some \n     improvements, but is ``inequitable, unaffordable, and \n     provides no finality or certainty to victims, defendants, \n     insurers and reinsurers.''\n       The groups add the proposed trust fund approach is \n     ``fatally flawed and can't be made to work.''\n       Three insurance- and reinsurance-industry groups--the \n     National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the \n     Property Casualty Insurers Association of America and the \n     Reinsurance Association of America--said in a joint statement \n     that the bill ``is absolutely essential to insurers that the \n     Senate resist attempts to bid up the insurance share'' as the \n     legislation makes its way through the Senate.\n       The AFL-CIO strongly objected to the bill, saying it would \n     shrink the trust fund and the ``result is a bailout for big \n     business that fails to provide fair and certain compensation \n     for asbestos disease victims.''\n       The Asbestos Alliance, a coalition of influential business \n     groups that include the National Association of \n     Manufacturers, has endorsed the legislation and is lobbying \n     for its passage.\n       Hatch said last week that he believes his new bill, which \n     he introduced prior to the recess, will likely not attract \n     enough Democratic support to pass. An earlier asbestos reform \n     bill he introduced passed the Judiciary Committee by a 10-8 \n     vote.\n       In an April 8 speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Frist \n     said the new bill has significant improvements over the one \n     that passed out of committee. He said it has additional \n     compensation for victims and has more protections for the \n     proposed trust fund.\n       Frist stressed that Congress needs to act on this issue, \n     pointing out that the lack of a solution has caused victims \n     to go uncompensated and led 70 companies to go bankrupt and \n     to the loss of 60,000 jobs.\n       Specter said he is committed to reaching a compromise this \n     year. He believes that if the amount of the asbestos trust \n     fund is agreed upon, the other pieces will fall into place \n     because ``there would be a sense that it will really happen.'\n       He added that passing a bill this year is crucial because \n     it would provide ``a boost to the economy to take companies \n     out of reorganizations and bankruptcy.'' Specter praised the \n     work of Hatch and Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member \n     Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) for their work on the bill.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is counterproductive. We are concerned that in many \nrespects the legislation before the Senate actually is a step backward \nfrom what was passed out of committee, and that was viewed by people in \nour country and in the Senate on both sides of the aisle as \ninsufficient. One thing we do know is attempts to address this problem \nin other cases affecting other diseases has been an absolute fiasco. \nAsk the black lung victims today whether we did any good when we passed \nthe black lung victims fund. If they are still alive, they will shake \ntheir heads in disbelief. Ask those victims of uranium whether we \nsolved the problem, and again they will shake their heads and say how \ndeeply disturbed they are with the outcome.\n  I can recall how many Senators acclaimed these responses as finally \nhaving addressed the issue. Well, now people get sick, they die, and \nthey have no recourse. While we know perhaps 2.6 million people could \nbe affected by this over the next several decades, the bill before us \nactually reduces the compensation fund from $153 billion--and I might \nadd parenthetically that the potential range of how much this could \ncost reaches $300 billion, so we are locking in a bill already that may \nbe deficient--but we go from $153 billion down to $109 billion in the \nbill currently pending, which maybe one-third of what will be required \nto adequately deal with the compensation we already know will be \nneeded.\n  Then there is the issue of claims. For somebody working brake linings \nin an auto mechanics shop, filled with asbestos, 15 years of asbestos \nexposure, what this bill says is if they have lung cancer after having \nbeen exposed to asbestos for 15 years we are going to give them as \nlittle as $25,000, and that is it. Who conscientiously could look that \nvictim in the eye and say, I am sorry, $25,000 is the best we could do? \nI cannot say that.\n  We also have the problem of pending cases in this bill. I actually \nknow victims who have attempted to do their best under the current \nsystem, have gone through approximately 10 years of extraordinarily \ncomplicated legal process to get to a verdict, they finally reach a \nverdict, there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel, they are \ngoing to get their award, and this bill says forget it, they have to \nstart over. We are going to use a new system. All those years of \nwaiting, all that pain\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\nand that agony, all of that potential for loss of life, it is over. We \nare going to make them reapply. Sorry about that.\n  At least the committee bill acknowledged we do not know how much this \nis going to cost. This could be $300 billion. I know we only have $153 \nbillion in the bill and now $109 billion if we look at this bill. \nBecause of the work of Senator Biden we said, all right, if we run out \nof money, at least people ought to be able to go back to the courts. \nThis bill says, you can go back to the courts, but only if you meet the \nstrict new limits that we've added, and only Federal court. Your \nrecourse is limited. Oh, yes, we put a $10 billion contingency in \nthere, but it's not available until year 24. How cynical is that.\n\n  Democrats want a bill. I want very much to resolve this matter, as \nSenator Frist has noted. I wanted to do it so badly that I asked my \nstaff to meet with Senator Frist last fall, right after the August \nrecess. They did meet five times at the staff level. Then Senators Dodd \nand Leahy and I met with a number of Republicans in November.\n  My staff has participated in virtually all, if not all, of the \nmeetings hosted by Senator Specter since the new year--and I must say \nwhat admiration I have for Senator Specter and the work he has done on \nthis bill. He has been diligent, he has been studious, he has been \nthoughtful, and he has been inclusive. It is too bad it took a Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania to create that kind of environment for real work and \nprogress, but he deserves a lot of credit, and I hope I am not getting \nhim in more trouble for praising him this morning on the floor. But he \ndeserves credit.\n  Senator Dodd and Senator Leahy and I met with the manufacturers and \ninsurers on several occasions through September, October, November, \nDecember, January, February, and March. We have met with advocates of \nthe victims. I went to Senator Frist last year and I said: Could we \nmeet? Could we resolve these issues, you and I? Let's see if we can put \na draft together.\n  That was impossible in December. I was told we just couldn't do it in \nJanuary or in February or in March. I was hoping, at least at the staff \nlevel, that might afford us an opportunity to begin work together, but \neven at the staff level our efforts were repelled until mid-February.\n  Finally, I was told I had a meeting on the 31st of March. I was very \npleased, at long last, having waited 4 or 5 months to get one, we had \none. I got there, to Senator Frist's office, and was told I had 10 \nminutes--10 minutes--to discuss this issue that we know will last \ndecades.\n  We stand ready to work out this legislation in a bipartisan way. \nThere are many on both sides of the aisle who truly and deeply want a \nresolution. I am puzzled, mystified that without any warning, without \nany consultation this bill was laid down, put on the calendar, and is \nnow called before us. It makes a mockery of the system and of any real \nserious and sincere effort to resolve this matter in a truly bipartisan \nway.\n  I think those of us who are truly interested in a resolution ought to \ncontinue to meet with Senator Specter as should those who believe a \nsolution can be negotiated. But this is not the way to do it. This is \nnothing more than a--well, it is nothing more than a lost opportunity. \nI could say more but I don't think incendiary language helps this \nprocess and I will forgo that.\n  But I must say I am troubled that yet again, on an issue of this \nimportance, there are those who will put politics and political \nposturing ahead of finding a real solution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the distinguished leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Do I understand after repeated efforts to hold, I take \nit, a thorough and comprehensive meeting with Senator Frist, which was \nto discuss this matter, when the time for the meeting had arrived--\nwhich had been delayed, I gather, repeatedly--it was scheduled then for \nonly 10 minutes?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It was actually scheduled for a longer period of time, \nbut once the meeting began, I was told the majority leader had about 10 \nminutes, correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Hardly enough time to say hello and goodbye, I might \nobserve.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is just about all that happened at that particular \nmeeting. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The other question I wanted to put, do I understand the \nproposal that has now been brought--sprung to the floor, so to speak, \nbecause I don't know that it represents the culmination of any \nconsultative process--for people who have been working their way \nthrough the existing system toward getting some recovery for the \nillness and the harm they suffered, they would be required to go back \nand start all over again under this? Is that correct? I find that very \ndifficult to accept. I just wanted to be clear on that particular \npoint.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. Under this new proposal, those \nwho have already been given a judgment, have done everything within \ntheir power to resolve this matter using the current system, will be \ntold that effort is now nullified and they will have to restart under \nthis new system for whatever compensation they might be awarded.\n  I would say again--I don't know if the Senator was in the Chamber \nwhen I illustrated or described one particular case, a case involving \nsomeone who had been exposed to asbestos for 15 years--under this bill, \nthat person, who has lung cancer, who smoked, who was exposed to \nasbestos for 15 years, is entitled to as little as $25,000.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is pretty brutal treatment, it seems to me, to \npeople who have suffered real harm. But for people to have worked their \nway through the system with all of the stress and strain involved in \ndoing that, and to have either come up to the point of judgment or, as \nI understand it, perhaps even achieved judgment, then to be required to \ngo back and begin all over it seems to me is just a completely \nunacceptable procedure. I am very concerned to hear that.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am delighted to have this discussion now \nbecause I think what the distinguished Democratic leader and Senator \nSarbanes pointed out is that we have a problem. Whether the problem is \none outlined--it may be in the bill. I don't know the specifics of that \nparticular case and didn't hear the particular case. But the problem, \nand it goes on both sides of the aisle, is that we have an inequitable \nsystem today. It is not working. It is broken. We are falling down on \nprocess.\n  The accusations of 10 minutes in my office, which I resent--I called \nthe Democratic leader this morning. I knew he was at a meeting and I \ndidn't get a call back from him. If the Democratic leader is going to \nmake accusations that I haven't discussed this enough, let's discuss \nthis today. I set aside this whole week and I set it aside starting \nin--the bill came out in July. I said shortly after that, specifically \nin November, we were going to do this in March.\n  People, mainly from the other side of the aisle, came forward and \nsaid we needed more time. I said, OK, we will have more time. Then we \nwent to the end of March and we said, OK, another month, or April. Here \nit is April.\n  We can go back and look. I pointed out in my statement that I knew \nthe Democratic leader and others were either present or present in part \nof it. We had over 20 meetings with staff on both sides of the aisle \nsince the bill came out, going through this bill again and again and \nagain.\n  We can argue process throughout. My only objective is to make sure \nthe patients with mesothelioma--and I have had the privilege to treat \npatients with mesothelioma. I have treated a lot of patients with \nmesothelioma, both as a surgeon in England and in this country, and it \nis a devastating disease, secondary in large part to asbestos. I \ntreated thousands--if not thousands, over a thousand--of people with \nlung cancer, so I know lung cancer. I know it is devastating. I know \nwhat it does to the families. I know the tragedy. I know the causal \nfactors. There are correlations. Some are causal factors. It is \ndifficult in terms of what causes cancer, what doesn't. There are \nlimitations to the science itself. That is something we need to debate \nand discuss and to build upon. That is one of\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\nthe things that makes it hard, because you are projecting out and the \nscience is not just perfect itself.\n\n  But I will make almost a plea to the other side of the aisle: We have \na week. The stakeholders, the people who are affected, the various \nconstituents--they know because I said months ago that we were going to \ndo this--are around this week. If it is an argument over whether I \npersonally haven't spent enough time with either the Democratic leader \nor others, we will spend the time. The stakeholders are here. Senator \nSpecter spent so much time and he has done a tremendous job. Senator \nHatch has. And Democrats and Republicans.\n  Why don't we take this week, which I set aside weeks ago and said we \nwere going to have a week--let's put everybody in a room. There are \nrooms here in the Capitol right now--right now. Take some Democrats, \ntake some Republicans, take mediators, take Judge Becker, take our \nstaff--us. There are rooms right now.\n  Again, I said starting yesterday we have 5 days to resolve the \nproblem. In truth, each one of these issues--this particular bill \npeople worked on 360 days. It was marked up in the committee before. It \nhas been improved again with Democratic and Republican input. It can be \nimproved more.\n  I have told everyone from day one the modifications Senator Hatch, I, \nand others have made with input of labor and others are still not \nperfect, but until we bring it to the floor of the Senate or until \nright now, today, over the next 8 hours today, 12 hours tomorrow, 12 \nthe next day, and 12 the next day, I am convinced we can resolve the \ndifferences. All this talk about being excluded from meetings or not, \nwe have rooms in the Capitol; the ``person'' power is here. People are \nprepared to debate. As I said in my opening statement, nobody is stuck \non particular clauses or amounts.\n  I suggest--and that is a reason I called this morning, about 10 \nminutes before we started; I knew he was in the leadership meeting--\nover the course of today we figure out a process by which we can come \nto resolution of the problem we all know exists, that we have \nbipartisan support on fixing, have some process outlined. I would say \nwe start today because I said 2 weeks ago it would be this week, that \nwe would take a week, so this is no surprise. I went through my \nstatement. I was on the floor of the Senate November 22, March, April, \nthe day before we left. I told everybody it would be this week. People \nare here--if they are not here, they can get here by tomorrow--to sit \ndown and go through the issues.\n  I respond to the Democratic leader's comments that we have a shot. We \nhave a responsibility of addressing this issue. We only have 79 \nlegislative days left. To put this off further is not going to be the \nway to do it. We need to start to put our heads together and put \ntogether a process to do that and fix the system we know has run amok.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am pleased the majority leader came back to the floor \nto reiterate his desire to find a solution. It will take more than just \nreasserting over and over that we want to find that answer, that \ncompromise, that legislative approach that will generate the kind of \nsupport in the Senate that is possible.\n  It takes what he just said. It will take a willingness to meet, a \nwillingness to work through these issues. That is my frustration. I \ntruly believe the majority leader is sincere when he says he wants to \nfind a way to solve the problem.\n  What I don't feel has been done, except in the offices of the good \nSenator from Pennsylvania, is that concerted effort to try to address \nthese issues in an inclusive way. That has been done, but it has been \ndone in large measure by Senator Specter, not by the leadership.\n  We are prepared today, tomorrow, tonight. We will be happy to meet, \nas I have offered to do on many occasions. The sooner we do it, the \nsooner that opportunity for resolution can be achieved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. If the Democratic leader will yield for a question, if we \nstart right now and we work through today, Wednesday, Thursday, and \nFriday on issues we debated and talked about--a lot of people are a lot \nmore expert than me--why can't we do that? Why can't we resolve this \nhuge problem? If we send it off to never-never land for an unlimited \nperiod of time, this will not come back. I know that. This is the \nfourth date I have set as a final date that we will come in just for \nconsideration, so we can get on the bill. Even if we were on the bill, \ntalking about the merits of the bill, debating it, we can be having \ndiscussions with Democrats and Republicans. I ask that Senator Leahy \nand Senator Hatch also be in the room as well.\n  Now is the time. Now is the time for action. Would that be possible?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator is asking me a question, I respond by \nsaying, absolutely. But let me give him one illustration of my \nskepticism about his question.\n  There must have been now, as he said, 20--maybe more--staff meetings \nover the course of the last 6 or 8 months. As he and I discussed this \nmatter and as our staffs discussed this matter, attention has turned to \nthe compensation trust fund. We were absolutely startled, surprised, \ndeeply troubled by this remarkable movement away from the trust fund \nnumber the committee had included: $153 billion. The pending bill has \n$109 billion.\n  My staff and I have both asked staff of the majority leader on \nseveral occasions, Is there a way to find a reasonable number? We have \nbeen stonewalled every single time when that issue has been discussed. \nIt has not been discussed. It is not even discussable on the other \nside.\n  It does not do any good to sit and look across each other at the \ntable if we cannot have a meaningful discussion about some of the \ndifferences we have. If all we do over the course of the next week is \nto say this is our number, with some expectation that maybe by saying \nit 100 times we will concede that then has to be the number, this will \nbe one of the most fruitless experiences he and I will have had in our \ntime in the Senate.\n  So yes, there has to be a willingness to meet; but if those meetings \nhave meaning, there also has to be willingness to negotiate. Frankly, \nwe have not seen much of that except in the Specter meetings. Again, I \nam hopeful we can finally move off these hard positions and find some \ncommon ground. If that can be achieved, then, yes, I think this week \ncould be a productive week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think we need to get on to our morning \nbusiness as we go forward. Hopefully, our colleagues have seen this \nplay out. Both the Democratic leader and I are committed to this. We \nwill have to have a process to get through it. I am absolutely \nconvinced we can do it this week if we get the appropriate process. He \nand I will talk, the leadership will talk, and talk to the relative \nparties over the course of the day. I hope by the end of the day we \nwill figure out what the process will be that would be fair and \nappropriate negotiation, to come to a resolution for the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4114-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the news reports of this morning are that \nthe Department of Labor will shortly publish the final regulations \nregarding changing the overtime rules that have been in existence since \n1938.\n  Frankly, given its past track record, the Bush administration is \nsimply not trustworthy on this issue. This administration has gone out \nof its way, time and again, to undercut working families' rights to \ntime-and-a-half pay for overtime.\n  Now, it is possible that the administration has had an election-year \nconversion on overtime, but I hope you will pardon me if I remain a \nlittle skeptical. I will remain skeptical until I see the regulations \nand have a chance to analyze them and read the fine print. I have asked \nthe Department of Labor to provide me with a copy of the regulations \nthis morning. I am eager to see them as soon as possible. As of a few \nminutes ago, they still have not been posted on the Department of \nLabor's Web site.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: The draft regulations that came out a \nyear ago were a radical rewrite of the Nation's overtime rules and a \nfrontal assault on the 40-hour workweek. Millions of American workers \nwere slated to lose their right to time-and-a-half overtime pay as a \nresult of those proposed regulations.\n  Since passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, overtime \nrights and the 40-hour workweek have been sacrosanct, respected by \nPresidents of both parties--until now.\n  This administration rammed through these new regulations a year ago \nwithout a single public hearing. It has dismissed public opinion polls \nshowing Americans' overwhelming opposition to changes in overtime law. \nThe White House brushed aside the will of the Senate and the House, \nboth of which voted in support of my amendment last year to block \nimplementation of these new rules.\n\n  There is no question the proposed new rules will hurt job creation. \nIf employers can more easily deny overtime pay, they will simply push \ntheir current employees to work longer hours without compensation. With \n9 million Americans currently out of work, why give employers yet \nanother disincentive to hire more workers?\n  Again, while a limited number of low-income workers technically were \ngiven the right to overtime pay--and that base was increased--at the \nsame time, the Department of Labor also gave employers advice on how to \navoid paying overtime compensation to the lowest paid workers. So the \nadministration gave on the one hand and took it away with the other.\n  The Department of Labor is poised to issue its final regulations. But \nI can assure you, this will not be the final act. We will be back. I \nlook forward to reading them. We will look over the fine print, as I \nsaid.\n  For example, last year when the proposed regulations came out, it \ntook some months before everything came out about how bad these \nproposed regulations really were. So we are going to go over these \nproposed regulations and take a look at them.\n  But I know the administration yesterday and in a press report today \nsaid this is a good deal; they are going to expand the eligibility for \novertime pay; this is going to include more people. Well, we heard the \nsame kind of ``happy talk'' a year ago when they first put out the \nproposed regs. However, public exposure showed the real facts of the \nproposed regulations. Up to 8 million Americans were going to lose \ntheir right to overtime pay. Again, it is just one in a series of \nassaults on working Americans by this administration.\n  Again, if you look at this chart, the red line is what the White \nHouse forecast for job creation for 2002. The blue line is what they \nforecast in 2003. The purple line is what they forecast for 2004. Here \nis where we really are down here with the green line. So this is \n``happy talk.'' The administration says, oh, they are going to forecast \nmore jobs. It is all going to get better. But the facts are not so. Job \ncreation has stayed stagnant. So when you hear all this ``happy talk'' \nabout how these final new regulations on overtime are going to be so \nwonderful for everyone working in America, take a look at this chart. \nIt is just more ``happy talk.''\n  We will look them over. But unless this administration has done \nalmost a complete revision of what they proposed, we are going to still \nbe back on the Senate floor asking that these rules not go into effect, \nand we will have a vote on that.\n  Finally, I think an article by Bob Herbert in the New York Times of \nApril 5 says it all: ``We're More Productive. Who Gets the Money?'' \nWhat Mr. Herbert points out in his article is that an awful lot of \nAmerican workers have been had, fleeced and taken to the cleaners, as \nhe said. He said:\n\n     . . . there has been no net increase in formal payroll \n     employment since the end of the recession. We have lost jobs.\n\n  He said: What happened to all the money from the strong economic \ngrowth? Well, he said:\n\n       The bulk of the gains did not go to workers, ``but instead \n     were used to boost profits . . . or increase C.E.O. \n     compensation.''\n\n  Well, it is the first time on record where the bulk of the increase \nhas gone to corporate profits and not to labor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this article of April 5 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 5, 2004]\n\n               We're More Productive. Who Gets the Money?\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       It's like running on a treadmill that keeps increasing its \n     speed. You have to go faster and faster just to stay in \n     place. Or, as a factory worker said many years ago, ``You can \n     work `til you drop dead, but you won't get ahead.''\n       American workers have been remarkably productive in recent \n     years, but they are getting fewer and fewer of the benefits \n     of this increased productivity. While the economy, as \n     measured by the gross domestic product, has been strong for \n     some time now, ordinary workers have gotten little more than \n     the back of the hand from employers who have pocketed an \n     unprecedented share of the cash from this burst of economic \n     growth.\n       What is happening is nothing short of historic. The \n     American workers' share of the increase in national income \n     since November 2001, the end of the last recession, is the \n     lowest on record. Employers took the money and ran. This is \n     extraordinary, but very few people are talking about it, \n     which tells you something about the hold that corporate \n     interests have on the national conversation.\n       The situation is summed up in the long, unwieldy but very \n     revealing title of a new study from the Center for Labor \n     Market Studies at Northeastern University: ``The \n     Unprecendented Rising Tide of Corporate Profits and the \n     Simultaneous Ebbing of Labor Compensation--Gainers and Losers \n     from the National Economic Recovery in 2002 and 2003.''\n       Andrew Sum, the center's director and lead authority of the \n     study, said: ``This is the first time we've ever had a case \n     where two years into a recovery, corporate profits got a \n     larger share of the growth of national income than labor did. \n     Normally labor gets about 65 percent and corporate profits \n     about 15 to 18 percent. This time profits got 41 percent and \n     labor [meaning all forms of employee compensation, including \n     wages, benefits, salaries and the percentage of payroll taxes \n     paid by employers] got 38 percent.''\n       The study said: ``In no other recovery from a post-World \n     War II recession did corporate profits ever account for as \n     much as 20 percent of the growth in national income. And at \n     no time did corporate profits ever increase by a greater \n     amount than labor compensation.''\n       In other words, an awful lot of American workers have been \n     had. Fleeced. Taken to the cleaners.\n       The recent productivity gains have been widely \n     acknowledged. But workers are not being compensated for this. \n     During the past two years, increases in wages and benefits \n     have been very weak, or nonexistent. And despite the growth \n     of jobs in March that had the Bush crowd dancing in the White \n     House halls last Friday, there has been no net increase in \n     formal payroll employment since the end of the recession. We \n     have lost jobs. There are fewer payroll jobs now than there \n     were when the recession ended in November 2001.\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\n       So if employers were not hiring workers, and if they were \n     miserly when it came to increases in wages and benefits for \n     existing employees, what happened to all the money from the \n     strong economic growth\n       The study is very clear on this point. The bulk of the \n     gains did not go to workers, ``but instead were used to boost \n     profits, lower prices, or increase C.E.O. compensation.''\n       This is a radical transformation of the way the bounty of \n     this country has been distributed since World War II. Workers \n     are being treated more and more like patrons in a rigged \n     casino. They can't win.\n       Corporate profits go up. The stock market goes up. \n     Executive compensation skyrockets. But workers, for the most \n     part, remain on the treadmill.\n       When you look at corporate profits versus employee \n     compensation in this recovery, and then compare that, as Mr. \n     Sum and his colleagues did, with the eight previous \n     recoveries since World War II, it's like turning a chart \n     upside down.\n       The study found that the amount of income growth devoured \n     by corporate profits in this recovery is ``historically \n     unprecendented,'' as is the ``low share . . . accruing to the \n     nation's workers in the form of labor compensation.''\n       I have to laugh when the I hear conservatives complaining \n     about class warfare. They know this terrain better than \n     anyone. They launched the war. They're waging it. And they're \n     winning it.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, we will look over these proposed \nregulations. But nothing the administration has done in the last \ncouple, 3 years with regard to job creation, with regard to treating \nlabor fairly in terms of getting its fair share of any economic gains, \nor the proposed regulations last year that would have literally cut off \nat the knees American workers' right to overtime pay changes my mind; I \nremain skeptical that this administration really wants to help work \nworkers get overtime pay.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4116-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4116-S4118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE TAX BURDEN IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, first of all, let me congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa for pointing out and being so \npersistent in dealing with this issue of overtime pay and how working \nAmericans are being treated by the economic policies of the current \nadministration.\n  I have been on the Senate floor a number of times over the last \nseveral months talking about the status of the American economy--the \njob losses that we have had: 2 million, roughly, generally, and 2.6 \nmillion private sector jobs. We have talked about the pressure on the \nmiddle class. Good gracious, we are now talking about cutting overtime \npay for 8 million working Americans in the middle class.\n  Goodness knows, the budget situation in this country, under this \nadministration, has been a fiasco. We have gone from projections of \n$5.5 trillion worth of budget surpluses to $5 trillion of budget \ndeficits over the next 10 years--$18,000 of debt per American to \n$24,000 now, and projections it will get up to $35,000 over the next 10 \nyears--an incredible failure of economic policy.\n  But today I want to talk about another indicator that is showing the \nweaknesses and the failures of this policy. Last week, millions of \nAmericans paid their income tax. A lot of us struggled to figure out \nhow to do that and send it in by the April 15 deadline. But the fact \nis, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of Americans' income \nwas paid in Federal, State, and local taxes--about 30 percent. But \nwhile the average American is paying 30 percent of their income in \ntaxes, the majority of corporations are paying far less. In fact, about \n60 percent of all corporations reporting income did not pay income tax \nat all. That is according to the General Accounting Office. Sixty \npercent of corporations did not pay any Federal tax at all.\n\n  Moreover, about 95 percent of corporations pay less than 5 percent of \ntheir income in taxes. As a share of corporate profits, corporate taxes \nare now at their lowest level since World War II. There has been a \ndramatic shift in the tax burden from corporations and high-income \nfolks to those middle-class folks who are now going to have their \novertime cut. It is an incredible change in the direction of this \ncountry and in fairness.\n  While corporate taxes have declined, as the good Senator from Iowa \npointed out, corporate profits have increased dramatically over the \nlast several years, much greater than wages. Median income during the \nBush administration has fallen about 3 percent for the average worker \nin America. Corporate profits, by contrast, have increased by 26 \npercent. There has been a huge growth in corporate profits at the same \ntime median income for working Americans is down. In other words, \nworkers have received relatively little benefit from the increase in \ncorporate profits. With all this ``hootin' and hollerin''' about GDP \ngrowth, it is not showing up in the paychecks of working Americans.\n  In the early 1990s, when you had an increase in the economy as we are \nseeing now, 60 percent of those increases in income went to wages, and \nabout 40 percent went to corporate profits. In today's recovery, the \none that has occurred over the last several years, only 13 percent has \ngone to working men and women, and almost 87 percent has gone to \ncorporate profits or corporate wages, to the CEOs. It is incredible, 60 \npercent versus 13 percent. There is something afoul here.\n  It fits into an overall flow of facts that middle-class income \nworkers are getting hurt in this economy. The fact is, we have seen \nmedian income decline 3 percent for the average worker in America. And \nby the way, at the same time income has fallen for real families in \nAmerica, the costs are going up. For example, a couple of items that go \non in everybody's budget: Health insurance is up 14 percent at the same \ntime these median incomes are going down. Corporate profits are going \nup. Gasoline prices are up 19 percent. College tuition, something that \ngives access to the American promise, is up 28 percent at the same \ntime. I hate to get into property taxes, but in many parts of our \ncountry, all we have done is shift the tax burden from the Federal \nGovernment to the local level. The Bush record includes income falling \nfor middle-income families and rising costs on things that matter in \ntheir lives.\n  It is incredible, particularly when put in the context that we \nhaven't been creating jobs. The fact is, we have 8.4 million Americans \nwithout jobs. That is the latest survey. We have been hearing a lot of \nhootin' and hollerin' about growth and jobs. There are 8.4 million \nAmericans without jobs. That is 2.4 million more jobs lost during this \nadministration's tenure and stewardship of the economy. Something is \nwrong here. Income is going down. Jobs are going down. Costs are going \nup.\n  What is happening is we are putting incredible pressure on the \naverage American. By the way, even when people get jobs after they have \nlost a job, there is an incredible loss of real income for those \nindividuals. That is how that median income came down.\n  According to survey, for workers who lost jobs in 2001, the average \nsalary was $44,570. Today, for those who have found jobs, the average \nsalary an individual ultimately was able to get was $35,410. That is \nanother 21-percent drop for those people who lost jobs and then \nultimately reentered the workforce.\n  We have median income going down. We see job losses going up. We see \ncorporate profits going up, and no sharing of that going on in the \neconomy.\n  There is a real problem. The administration's proposals and policies \nhave done an incredible job of actually undermining the well-being and \nquality of life for middle-income Americans.\n  Many people have different views about fairness, but since the tax \ndate was last week and we talked about the fact corporations are not \npaying their fair share, I want to mention the fact for the middle 20 \npercent of Americans, a range of people who have an adjusted gross \nincome from filings and income tax, the average tax break for that \nmiddle 20-percent, middle-class America, was $647. That is not \nsomething to throw out the window, but it is not a great amount of \nmoney given what tuition costs are doing, and given gasoline prices and \nhealth care costs. But it is a break. But if you were in the top 1 \npercent of Americans, on that same scale of adjusted gross income, you \ngot an average tax break of about $35,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 1\\1/2\\ minutes of \nthe time allocated to me.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Finally, if you look at those individuals in America who have been \nblessed\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\nwith good earnings and opportunity, with $1 million of earnings or \nmore, a tax cut of $123,500. I don't understand why anyone would think \nthis is going to be stimulative to the economy, efficient to the \neconomy. Let alone does it relate to the fairness most Americans \nexpect. Here we have $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and a whole bunch of it \nis going to the people making $1 million or more, and the middle class \nis getting a very small portion. We have a major problem with economic \npolicy. We clearly are not creating jobs. We clearly are undermining \nthe quality of life of middle-income Americans.\n  There is a classic fairness issue that is going on here which I \nwanted to relate with regard to corporate income taxes and certainly \nwith regard to how tax breaks work.\n  It is time for a rethink. The IMF and the OECD this week released \nreports that said the current administration's policies are going to \nend up undermining growth for the rest of the world because we are \nrunning such big deficits. There is something wrong. It is time for us \nto address it. I will come out here and talk about these kinds of \npressures on the middle class, on our budget, on what is fair. We need \nto make sure the American people know they are not getting a fair \nshake.\n  We need to pass the legislation for which the Senator from Iowa has \nso assiduously fought to make sure 8 million people are protected on \novertime. We need to make sure we change this tax policy so all \nAmericans benefit from the great bounty we have. The choice is clear.\n  We were able in the 1990s, with a different set of policies, to \ncreate 22.5 million jobs, the greatest increase in wealth for all \nAmericans, not just middle class but all Americans. We decreased \npoverty. All good indicators of what happened.\n  Now we have lost 2.6 million private sector jobs; 8.4 million people \nare unemployed; and we have a distribution of income that makes no \nsense for the middle class.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the very able Senator from New \nJersey for his very powerful statement and for putting everything in \ncontext.\n  First of all, I appreciate his taking the April 15 filing deadline, \nwhich most of us have just confronted in terms of filing our tax \nreturns, and pointing out that corporations are paying hardly anything \nin income taxes. As I understand it, 60 percent of corporations filing \nshow no tax liability. As I understand it, 95 percent were paying 5 \npercent or less.\n  Secondly, the Senator has pointed out this huge discrepancy in the \ntax benefit from the Bush tax cuts. His chart shows middle-income \npeople were getting about $600, as I recall the figure. And for the top \n1 percent, what was the figure?\n  Mr. CORZINE. That was $124,000.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the millionaires.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Excuse me, $35,000.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And the millionaires were getting $124,000. This is \nclassic trickle-down economics. It doesn't work. Proof that it does not \nwork is where we are on the jobs front. We have an administration that \nclaims it has a successful economic policy, and it is not producing \njobs. In fact, we have now over 2 million fewer jobs than we had when \nthis administration took over in January of 2001.\n  The last time we had an administration that failed to produce a net \nincrease in jobs over the course of the administration was the Herbert \nHoover administration. Now, stop and think about that. I say to the \nSenator, is it not his understanding that every administration since \nHerbert Hoover has been able to show a net increase of jobs over the \ncourse of their administration--until this administration which now is \nover 2 million jobs in the hole below where we were when they came into \noffice?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. If you \nlook at private sector jobs where a real economy is broadly creating \nwealth for individuals, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, and it is a \nhorrific record relative to the performance of what should be enormous \nproductivity and job growth in this country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Furthermore, it is my understanding, I say to the \nSenator, that this recession we have experienced began 36 months ago. \nAs we have said, we have fewer jobs now than we did when the recession \nfirst started. This is the first recession since the Great Depression \nin which 36 months after the recession began we have failed to come \nback and recover or recreate the jobs that were lost in the recession.\n  Stop and think about that. It is 36 months after the recession began. \nIn every other economic downturn since the Great Depression, 36 months \nafter the recession began we had recovered all the jobs lost and gone \nwell beyond that in most instances in job creation. We have not done \nthat in this business cycle. In fact, if we had grown at the job growth \nequal to the worst on record following a recession--I am just taking \nnow the worst performance of previous economic downturns--if we had \njust the job growth now that we had in the worst recovery period, we \nwould have 3.4 million more jobs than we have today. It is incredible \nwhat is happening on the jobs front. We are not closing this jobs gap. \nThis administration doesn't seem to understand it or face up to it.\n  In fact, in the 2002 Economic Report of the President, the \nadministration forecasted that in 2004--the year we are in--the economy \nwould have 138.3 million jobs. Last year, the President lowered that \nestimate for the number of jobs we would have in 2004. In 2003, he \npredicted only 135.2 million jobs. In the most recent economic report, \nthe administration lowered it again to 132.7 million jobs. In 2 years, \nthey lowered the number of job predictions by 6 million jobs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Maryland understands supply and demand. \nBut if there are 6 million more Americans looking for jobs than is \ndemand, what usually happens when there is excess supply of labor or \nany other element of our economic system versus demand?\n  Mr. SARBANES. You can see the effect on the earnings of workers that \nis taking place in the economy, for one thing.\n  Mr. CORZINE. It is a most important element. This jobs issue is not \nonly impacting people who don't have jobs, it is impacting people who \ndo have jobs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Exactly.\n  Mr. CORZINE. It is undermining the ability of working Americans to \nactually get good wages. That is why median income is down. That is why \nyou go from $45,000 for a job lost to picking up a job worth $35,000.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is right to focus on the inadequacy of \ndemand. If he would put up the chart that shows how much of the benefit \ngoes to workers' wages as opposed to corporate profit in this so-called \nrecovery, we can see that if you go back to the early 1990s, during \nthat recovery, a majority--85 percent--of the benefits were going to \nworkers. In this recovery, the workers are getting only 15 percent.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. It is 13 percent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So 87 percent of it is going to corporate profit. That \nis one of the big differences. That is one of the reasons we are not \ncreating jobs. When it goes to workers' wages, it makes its way back \ninto the economy, stimulates economic activity. As a consequence, it \nhelps produce jobs. Now it is so heavily weighted away from workers and \ntoward the corporations that are showing these record profits that we \nare not getting the same economic stimulus.\n  Then they say, well, if the corporations make big profits, they will \ninvest in plant and equipment. But the corporations won't invest in \nplant and equipment if they don't think there is going to be a demand \nfor what that plant and equipment will produce. The major source of the \ndemand comes from workers' wages, which is being grossly shortchanged \nin this so-called economic recovery. It is no wonder we are facing such \na severe economic situation.\n  Twenty-four percent of the people who are unemployed have been \nunemployed for more than 26 weeks. They are the so-called long-term \nunemployed. We are now at a record in that this percentage has been \nabove 20 for 18 consecutive months. The last time we had long-term \nunemployed at that level for such a long period of time was in the 1982 \nrecession, when the unemployment rate went up to close to 10\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\npercent. So what is happening is a lot of the impact is being concealed \nor disguised. People have dropped out of the workforce. The workforce \nparticipation rate now is at a 16 year low, despite having previously \nrisen almost every year in this postwar period. That is the situation \nwe confront.\n  The Senator is absolutely right to put his finger on these gross \ninequities in the workings of the economy because more and more of its \nbenefits are being pushed to the very top of the income and wealth \nscale. As a consequence, they do not get recirculated back through the \neconomy to create jobs and meet the tremendous challenge that working \npeople in this country are facing, which the Senator has very \nthoroughly outlined in the course of his statement. I commend my \ncolleague from New Jersey for his very strong and powerful statement in \nunderscoring this shift in economic benefits.\n  There is one strata up at the top that is reaping the benefits, and \nall the rest of us are feeling the economic burdens, stress and strain \nof this economy.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I think the Senator from Maryland probably realizes--and \ncorrect me if I am wrong--I think there are 1.4 million or 1.6 million \nAmericans that have even dropped out of looking for work.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator most appropriately talked about the pain \nthat is being inflicted on the unemployed because they are unemployed \nfor a much longer period of time. But what is just as serious is that \nthere are a lot of people who have said the heck with it; there is no \nchance of actually getting a job.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for his very strong presentation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). There will now be 30 minutes for \nthe majority.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4118-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, before I talk on the subject I came to \ntalk about, I want to react a little to what has been said in terms of \nthe economy. It is surprising, because the economy has grown \nsubstantially, that we find some complaining about it over there. It is \nnot a surprise that the person who pays the most taxes gets a tax cut. \nThat should not be a surprise. The idea is that encouraging business is \nhow you create jobs.

This \nplace has become almost like a political rally, when what we ought to \nbe doing is talking about issues. I hope we can do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4118-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4118-S4119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COURT JURISDICTION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this has little to do with the idea of \nestablishing a venue search for various court actions.\n  I would like to address an issue that is very important to all of us, \nparticularly the Western States that have a good amount of public \nlands. First, there are many suits being filed. People are trying \nthrough suits, or the threat of suits, but even worse, if there is a \nsuit, to be able to pick a venue they think is more sympathetic to \ntheir point of view than going to the venue in which the issue occurs. \nThat is what I am talking about.\n  That has particularly been the case with environmentalists who have \nsought to manage public lands and public facilities largely through \nsuits rather than the issues.\n  In recent years, we have been steamrolled quite a bit by Federal \nissues that go to judges completely out of the area rather than dealing \nwith them in the circuit in which the issue occurs. Specifically, we \nhave had some experience with suits involving issues with Yellowstone \nPark or Teton Park.\n  We have a circuit court system. We are in the Tenth Circuit. I need \nto review what I am talking about. The Federal judiciary is set up on a \nsystem of circuit courts. It is set up with a number of circuits \nthroughout the country and based on geography. The reason for that, of \ncourse, is so everyone has access to the legal system and it is fairly \navailable to them.\n  If you go to a circuit court and you appeal that decision, it goes to \nthe appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. The fact is, the \ncircuit court in Cheyenne, WY, is a Federal court, just as the circuit \ncourt in Washington, DC. It certainly is more appropriate to go to \nthem. That is why those circuit courts are there.\n  Our Constitution includes many checks and balances, and the authority \nfor Congress to limit judicial jurisdiction is clearly needed.\n  I have introduced a bill that would provide original jurisdiction to \nthe appropriate court venue in the impacted area for matters involving \nFederal lands. I cannot continue to watch issues that happen in \nparticular parts of the country--in this case in Wyoming and Montana--\nto be taken to a Federal court in Washington, DC, when, in fact, there \nare Federal courts in our area. That is why they are there.\n  My intent is nondiscriminatory. It simply underscores my strong \nbelief that Federal judges in the area should have the first crack at \ncases that have a direct impact on that particular area. Certainly that \nis something on which we need to continue to work. It is a matter, of \ncourse, that affects a lot of Federal lands.\n  Half of the State of Wyoming belongs to the Federal Government. It is \nsimilar in Arizona and other States in the West. The circuits we are in \nare the ones that should, in fact, deal with those Federal land issues \nwhen the issue is in that particular State. Of course, the appeals go \non the same as anywhere else.\n  When I introduced the bill, some folks were shocked and said it was a \nwaste of time. I think it is more shocking to skirt the jurisdiction of \njudicial courts and venue shop and go somewhere they think will give a \nbetter result to the lawsuit that has been filed.\n  The justices need to be fair. Everyone deserves their day in court. \nCertainly we have an issue now where the local court has been involved \nat one time, and they went around the local court and went to \nWashington, DC. We have two courts on the same level with two different \npoints of view on the same issue. It has caused us a great deal of \nproblems.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article written by Judge Robert \nRanck, a retired judge, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Jackson Hole News & Guide, Mar. 24, 2004]\n\n                 Federal Justice and Your Day in Court\n\n                           (By Robert Ranck)\n\n       No one should be shocked. And particularly no one should be \n     confused by the editorial that ran in this paper last week.\n       Apparently, what is needed is a review of our civics.\n       The federal judiciary is set upon a system of circuits \n     based on geography. Each action that leads to a case in a \n     particular geography area must generally be filed in that \n     circuit. If there is an appeal of a case within that circuit \n     from federal district court, it is directed to the federal \n     appeals court of that circuit. If appealed from that federal \n     circuit's appeals court, it then goes to the U.S. Supreme \n     Court in Washington.\n       Why are the federal circuits based on geographic lines? Our \n     judicial system is founded on the premise that everyone \n     deserves their day in court. To have your day in court, you \n     need to be able to get to the court and not be required to \n     travel thousands of miles to do so. That's why the \n     jurisdiction of our federal circuit courts are such--it's \n     called access to justice. And no one--least of all our \n     litigious community--should be shocked or upset by access to \n     justice.\n       Loopholes in the rules of federal venue are being currently \n     exploited by those who want to pick the federal judge who \n     best suits their politics. They do that by twisting the \n     allegations describing the nature of the case. If there is an \n     issue involving snow machining in Yellowstone, for example, \n     some groups think the action arises not in Wyoming or \n     Montana, but in D.C. Why? Because the Park Service is \n     headquartered in D.C. But that's not how the federal system \n     was designed. That is not the intent of the system. That \n     takes justice further from the people most impacted by the \n     matter in question. And that is wrong.\n       In many ways, a federal judge is a federal judge. Brimmer \n     or Sullivan, they are of the same federal rank, with the same \n     federal powers. Here's the difference: one was born, raised, \n     and spent his entire professional career in the jurisdiction \n     where the snowmobiling controversy arose. The other was born, \n     raised and practiced his entire career in Washington, D.C.--a \n     heck of a long way from the Tetons. I am disappointed that \n     this paper, and other usually thoughtful people, are \n     advocating venue concepts that result in justice being less \n     accessible to people\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\n     most impacted by controversies. I wonder if these people \n     think a Wyoming federal judge should have the power to decide \n     a federal challenge to marriage licenses issued to gay \n     couples in San Francisco? I doubt it.\n       Senator Thomas is seeking to close the venue loopholes that \n     currently allow district judges in Washington, D.C. to decide \n     issues that should be heard and decided where they arose. In \n     doing so, he is a populist--bringing the opportunity for \n     access and justice closer to people. That some are \n     uncomfortable with this idea is disturbing. But for some \n     litigants, the ends always justify the means. In this case, \n     the anti-snowmachining lobby will continue to try to have \n     their case heard as far from Wyoming as possible in front of \n     the most sympathetic judge they can find, even if their \n     tactics are unfair to the people who live and work in the \n     West.\n       Two thousand miles is a long way for voices to carry--\n     particularly for people who are too busy earning a living and \n     raising a family to file or defend litigation in Washington, \n     D.C. Federal venue loopholes should be closed in the interest \n     of fairness. Don't be confused by those who are more \n     interested in their desired political outcome than the \n     fairness and integrity of the judicial process.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I hope we can take a look at the idea of \ndirecting these various court activities to the circuit court in which \nit arises. It seems a reasonable approach. I have introduced a bill to \ndo that, and I look forward to pursuing it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue which I \nhave been working on for many years, regrettably, about how we control \nour borders. The issue is how we deal with terrorists or people with \ncriminal intent or who have a history of criminal activity who threaten \nour Nation by coming into our country. Either way, these are \nindividuals who really should not be coming into our country.\n  Back in the nineties, as chairman and ranking member of the Commerce-\nJustice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, we began funding a major \neffort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to organize its \nfingerprint database, called IAFIS. At the same time, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, now part of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, was beginning to set up a fingerprint database for people \ncoming into the country, called IDENT.\n  The problem has arisen that these two fingerprint databases do not \ncommunicate with each other. This, of course, was a function of \nhistory. In the nineties when the FBI was setting up IAFIS, which has \nnow grown to 44 million identifying fingerprint records, their purpose \nwas to create a national repository of criminal fingerprint records to \nidentify a person who committed a crime by their fingerprint match with \nthe system and to assist local law enforcement efforts to do the same. \nIt was a law enforcement tool.\n  The INS, when it began its system in the nineties, was basically \ntrying to find people who were illegally coming into the country or who \nhad been deported and had criminal backgrounds. The purpose was also \nfor law enforcement but a different type of law enforcement. They were \nnot looking for people who actually committed a crime. They were \nlooking for people coming into the country who should not be coming \ninto the country because of their background.\n  These two protocols were set up independent of each other. We noticed \nthis in our committee in the late nineties and directed the two \norganizations to integrate their fingerprint identification systems. \nThis was done by the Commerce-Justice-State Subcommittee, which I and \nSenator Hollings chaired off and on during that period. We exchanged \nchairmanships, depending on the control of the Senate, but our policies \nwere exactly the same.\n  We directed in the late nineties that these two agencies begin to \nintegrate their fingerprint databases. It was pretty obvious to me and \nSenator Hollings at that time that this was important not from a law \nenforcement standpoint, but from an antiterrorism standpoint, and that \nis what drew us in this direction.\n  Regrettably, that was not accomplished. Today we are in a situation \nwhich is extraordinarily inappropriate and, to some degree, ironic if \nit were not so sad and unfortunate. And that is that the FBI is sitting \nover here with 44 million fingerprints of people we know have a \nbackground that required them to be fingerprinted and, therefore, maybe \nwe have some issues with them. We know within that 44-million-person \ndatabase there are at least 12,000 individuals who are identified as \nterrorists. We know the FBI has this IAFIS database which we have spent \n$1.1 billion--billion dollars--to put in place. Our committee has \nfunded this over the years.\n  It had some fits and starts. It took the FBI a while to get it going \nright but now they have it set up. Then we know Homeland Security, \nwhich has now taken over INS, has the IDENT Program, which is the \nbaseline for something called the US VISIT Program, which is a \nfingerprint program, the purpose of which is to fingerprint people \ncoming into the United States for identification and have a database of \nthose people.\n  What we also know is these two major fingerprint databases do not \ntalk to each other. So if someone is coming into our country who is a \nterrorist with fingerprint records in the FBI's IAFIS database, and \nthey are fingerprinted as they would be required to be to get a visa to \ncome into this country, that fingerprint they had for the visa would \nnot show up in the FBI database as a terrorist because the systems \ncannot communicate. The databases of IDENT and US VISIT, which is being \nset up, are not structured to communicate with the FBI database.\n  In the late 1990s, as I mentioned, our committee directed these two \ndatabases start to be integrated and figure out some way to \ncommunicate. There was minor progress made in this effort, and a lot of \nmoney put into it, over $41 million. Yet the reorganization of the \nHomeland Security Department, which took INS out of the Justice \nDepartment, created an atmosphere which was not maybe so convivial to \nthe two groups communicating with each other. Also, the INS has a \ndifferent goal, which is to move people quickly through the \nfingerprinting process. Therefore, they only use as their \nfingerprinting system the fingerprints of two flat digital fingerprints \nof the index fingers. By using the 2-fingerprint system, they can move \npeople through their identification process very quickly, and that is \nimportant at a border entry from the standpoint of making the border \nentries tolerable to individuals to go through. The INS therefore was \nnot willing to go to a roll process of all 10 fingerprints, which would \nrequire a great deal more time. The FBI, however, because it is \ninterested in a more intensive capacity to review the fingerprints, has \nsomething called rolled fingerprints of all 10 fingerprints.\n  So today we still have 44 million fingerprints which have no \nrelevance, for all intents and purposes, to who is coming in and who is \nleaving our country because DHS is only fingerprinting individuals in a \nmanner which is not compatible with the 10-fingerprint procedure of the \n44-million-person database.\n  Now some folks in the administration appear to be aware of this \nproblem and are talking about it. There are a number of things that \nhave been done, and I want to acknowledge them for having done some \nthings. Every 2 weeks they are extracting certain fingerprint records \nfrom IAFIS to IDENT, including certain wanted individuals and potential \nterrorists. Those 12,000 terrorists I mentioned in IAFIS is now \nsupposedly in the IDENT system and accessible to the US VISIT Program. \nThere is an attempt to get NIST, which is the organization which has \nthe capacity to technologically address this issue, to take a look at \nthis issue to see if there is not some way to cross-reference these \nrecords. Even under the most optimistic game plan, however, it is now \nthe position of the administration it will not be until 2008 that they \nare able to integrate IDENT and IAFIS, assuming they are able to \nintegrate them at all. To make them compatible, most likely it will \nmean DHS will have to go from a 2-fingerprint system to an 8-\nfingerprint system, digital flat fingerprints.\n  We need to focus on this as a government. This is one of those \nsituations\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nwhere one learns about it and understands it and says, why is this \nhappening?\n  We understand the history of it. As I mentioned, the history is INS \nand FBI had different purposes for their fingerprint systems when they \nset up these two major databases. Those two purposes have been totally \novershadowed and left in the wake as a result of September 11. The FBI \nno longer has as its primary function catching people after they commit \na crime. The FBI's primary function now, although maybe they do not \ntotally appreciate this, is they are supposed to catch people before \nthey commit a terrorist act. They are supposed to be an intelligence \nagency. That is their primary purpose, to find out who is going to harm \nus and get to them before they get to us. They have this huge resource \nof 44 million fingerprints of people who are potential problems, and it \nshould be a resource, but is instead just sitting there. If someone \ncommits a bank robbery or a Federal crime, it is still a very \nfunctional database, but for the primary purpose of the FBI, which is \nintelligence in anticipation of terrorist threat, it is not very \nfunctional at all.\n\n  Then there is the INS which set up the IDENT system under the theory \nthat people were repeatedly entering the country illegally and in some \ncases after they had been deported and they wanted to get them out of \nthe country or they wanted to know who they were. They did not see them \nas terrorists back in the 1990s. They set up a system to address that. \nNow they have such a system and they are adding to it the U.S. VISIT \nsystem. That system is set up in a manner which, yes, expedites people \nthrough our borders, which I appreciate is important, but, no, it does \nnot tell anybody at DHS whether that person who just got through the \nborder, having been fingerprinted with the two index fingers, is in the \nFBI database as a terrorist or a criminal, unless that name happens to \nhave been moved over to IDENT as a result of basically a manual \ndecision.\n  We cannot afford that historic anomaly to continue. We cannot \ncontinue to have these two systems which do not communicate. It is my \nhope the administration, again working with the various technical \nexperts who are out there--and I suspect they have to be independent of \nthese two agencies because these two agencies have vested interests \nwhich cause them to dig in their heels on occasion--that somebody will \nsit down and say merge these databases and do it before 2008. I hope \nthey will come up with some system which allows us to do that.\n  As an appropriator, I know this is going to cost a lot of money. I \nsuspect Senator Hollings would agree with me on this, and I know \nSenator Byrd would because it is a big issue for him and Senator \nStevens too, who are the chairman and ranking member of the committee, \nI am willing to put in whatever money is necessary in order to \naccomplish this integration on a faster timeframe than 2008 because we \nneed it done. I hope the administration will pursue this effort.\n  Fingerprint compatibility is an issue that affects all Americans. It \nrelates to counterterrorism and protecting our borders; ensuring that \ntaxpayer resources are not squandered; and ensuring that Federal \nagencies actually work as a unified Government rather than a set of \nfiefdoms. The issue is fingerprints how they are taken, processed, and \naccessed.\n  The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, has started a new \ninitiative, US VISIT, to better control who is coming into the country \nand tracking them once they have arrived. The plan calls for the \ncollection of personal data, photos, and fingerprints by the Department \nof State at U.S. consular offices abroad and by the Department of \nHomeland Security at our ports of entry. The fingerprints taken will be \n2 ``flat'' fingerprints, a simple, one-touch of the index finger of \neach hand.\n  Those 2 flat fingerprints, however, cannot be searched against the 44 \nmillion contained in the FBI's national repository of fingerprints of \nterrorists, wanted individuals, and of convicted criminals. That is \nbecause the repository, known as IAFIS, contains 10 ``rolled'' \nfingerprints, a more complete capture of each finger.\n  If the purpose of US VISIT is to better determine who should enter \nthe country, what is more important than knowing if they are terrorists \nor criminals?\n  This is not a new problem. For nearly 15 years, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS--now the Department of Homeland Security--\nand the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, have been developing and \noperating separate and incompatible fingerprint-based identification \nsystems. INS has IDENT, which takes 2 flat prints and was created to \nidentify repeat immigration offenders and deported aliens who should be \ndetained and prosecuted. FBI has IAFIS, which takes 10 rolled prints \nand was created to automate the FBI's paper-based fingerprint \nidentification system of criminal records. Without integration if you \ncheck IDENT, you do not have access to the prints of all criminals. If \nyou check IAFIS, you do not have access to immigration law violators.\n  We raised this issue as early as 1999. In the fiscal year 2000 CJS \nappropriations conference report, we directed the Department of \nJustice, DOJ, to develop a plan to integrate the INS and FBI systems. \nFive years later, the effort ``remains years away'' according to a \nMarch 2004 report by the DOJ Inspector General.\n  Each year, millions of aliens are apprehended trying to illegally \nenter the United States. Many are voluntarily returned to their country \nof origin without further action. Some, however, are detained for \nprosecution if suspected of: multiple illegal entries, a prior \ndeportation, a current arrest warrant, an aggravated criminal record, \nor alien smuggling.\n  Before IDENT, INS had difficulty verifying identities of the \napprehended aliens. False names and spelling errors were common making \nit difficult to check for immigration or criminal histories. An \nautomated fingerprint identification system was the obvious solution. \nIt provided a faster, unique biological measurement for individuals. \nFunding was first provided to develop IDENT in fiscal year 1989.\n  At about the same time, in 1990, the FBI began to overhaul its paper-\nbased fingerprint card system. The FBI had maintained a central \nrepository of ten-prints of criminal offenders' fingerprints since the \n1920's. The FBI wanted a system that would allow for electronic \nsearches for fingerprint matches against criminal histories, wanted \nindividuals, as well as stolen articles, vehicles, guns, and license \nplates. Over $1.1 billion has been spent on building and maintaining \nIAFIS to date. IAFIS now contains over 44 million criminal records, \nincluding 12,000 terrorist records.\n  From 1990-1994, INS and FBI discussed integrating their systems, but \nthey had conflicting priorities and interests. INS focused on the need \nto process apprehended aliens quickly and therefore only wanted to take \n2 fingerprints. FBI wanted INS to take 10 fingerprints so they could \nmatch apprehended aliens against the ten fingerprint records in the law \nenforcement databases or latent fingerprints obtained at crime scenes.\n\n  There were also capacity concerns. FBI did not know if their system \nwould have the capacity to meet INS's high volume of fingerprints in a \nquick response time. FBI did not believe their system would be able to \nsearch and match 2 fingerprints against 10 fingerprints in a timely \nmanner.\n  By 1994, INS began proceeding with its separate system, IDENT. IDENT \nwas developed to match 2 fingerprints of detained individuals against \nfingerprints in two IDENT databases: 1, apprehension database: includes \neach recorded apprehension of illegal border crossers; and 2, lookout \ndatabase: contains information on deported and criminal aliens and \ntherefore ten-print cards.\n  Problems with IDENT quickly emerged. A March 1998 Inspector General \nreport found INS was enrolling less than two-thirds of the aliens \napprehended into the IDENT system; INS was only entering 41 percent of \nall aliens deported into the IDENT lookout database; the data entered \ninto the system was of poor quality because employees did not have \nsufficient training.\n  In 1999, the case of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez reemphasized the need \nfor the integration of IDENT and IAFIS. Resendez-Ramirez was \napprehended by INS for an immigration violation in June 1999 and was \nvoluntarily returned\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nto Mexico because INS was unaware that he was wanted for murder. \nShortly after his voluntary return, he returned to Oregon and committed \nfour more murders. Had IDENT been linked to IAFIS, immigration \nofficials would have known Resendez-Ramirez was wanted for murder, had \nan extensive criminal history and prior deportation, and could have \ndetained him for prosecution.\n  That year, in the fiscal year 2000 conference report, the CJS \nAppropriations Subcommittee responded by directing DOJ to prepare a \nplan for the integration of IDENT and IAFIS databases and fingerprint \nsystems.\n  DOJ submitted a plan for integration in March 2000. The plan focused \non conducting several studies to determine the impact, scope, and \ntechnology needed to integrate the two systems.\n  Good news is the project has slowly moved forward.\n  Records are now extracted from IAFIS and added to IDENT every 2 \nweeks, including those of wanted persons likely to be picked up by \nimmigration officials, birthplace outside of U.S. Over 140,000 wanted \nindividuals have been downloaded into IDENT. There are, on average, 400 \nhits per month, meaning 400 apprehended aliens have active wants or \nwarrants for their arrest. There are also over 12,000 fingerprint \nrecords of known or suspected terrorists extracted from IAFIS and put \ninto IDENT.\n  A workstation has been developed and deployed to DHS field sites, \nborder patrol stations and ports of entry, that has a ten print scanner \nthat can capture ten rolled prints; and a computer that can \nsimultaneously search IDENT and IAFIS and provide an integrated \nresponse from both systems.\n\n  The CJS appropriations subcommittee provided $1 million in fiscal \nyear 2003 for National Institute for Standards and Technology, NIST, \nthe Federal agency charged with establishing fingerprint standards, to \nresearch fingerprint search compatibility. Preliminary results show 8 \nflat prints can be searched against 10 rolled prints with the same \naccuracy as 10 rolled prints, but the search takes 2-3 times longer. \nCompare that to 2 flat prints, in which case the search has an \n``unacceptable reduction in identification accuracy'' and takes 35 \ntimes longer.\n  The bad news: 5 years have passed and $41 million has been provided \nand the systems are still not integrated. Extracting a sampling of \nIAFIS information every 2 weeks is not enough.\n  Wanted individuals who are apprehended by DHS could be mistakenly \nreturned to their country of origin if their warrants are submitted to \nIAFIS during the 2 week lag time. DOJ and DHS claim they will begin to \nextract information daily, but it is unclear when, how and whether that \ncan happen. Even daily extracts cannot substitute real-time information \nor full interoperability.\n  The extracts do not include criminal histories. The need for criminal \nhistories was made apparent in the 2002 case of Victor Manual Batres. \nIn that case, Batres was deported following a conviction for an \naggravated felony. Batres reentered, but information about his \ndeportation was not known because the systems are not integrated, and \nhe was voluntarily returned to Mexico. He illegally entered the country \nagain, at which time he raped two nuns, resulting in the death of one \nof them. Had IDENT and IAFIS been integrated, the immigration officials \nwould have had immediate access to Batres' deportation and criminal \nhistory, and could have detained him for prosecution, thereby saving \nlives. Reentry after deportation alone can carry up to 20 years \nimprisonment.\n  Workstations are only a one way solution. Workstations give DHS \naccess to IAFIS, but they do not give law enforcement access to \nimmigration records. FBI and State and local law enforcement believe \nthere are situations that require access to immigration records, such \nas: Fingerprints captured at a crime scene cannot be checked against \nimmigration violators; and an individual can apply to a sensitive \nposition, security at a nuclear power plant, and there is no way to \nverify his or her country of birth or immigration history.\n  Workstations are only partially deployed. Two hundred and ninety-\nthree workstations have been deployed to only 115 DHS field sites, \nwhich means less than one-third of DHS' field sites have workstations. \nIt is unclear whether there is a plan to deploy workstations at the \nremaining field sites.\n  The administration has no timeline to move to capturing 8 flat \nprints. Eight flat prints would significantly improve the chances of \ninteroperability.\n  The bad news also is that any plans for integration have been delayed \nat least 2 years, with final deployment now not expected until August \n2008 due to fear that the Government could not absorb the impact of \nintegration, the increases in detention, prosecution and imprisonment \nof aliens. There is no agreement between DOJ and DHS on how to \ncollectively proceed with IDENT/IAFIS integration. Personnel and \nresources were diverted from IDENT/IAFIS integration to build US VISIT.\n  Now, DHS is creating its new system, US VISIT, with the same traps as \nIDENT and then some. Problems are already apparent. US VISIT has not \nbeen fully defined. No policy has been identified for Mexico and Canada \nor the ``exit'' aspect of the program, for example, will U.S. citizens \nbe checked every time they leave the country. US VISIT was built on \nIDENT because that was the only way DHS could meet its December 2003 \ndeadline to deploy the program. That means US VISIT continues to \ncapture only 2 flat prints and is not interoperable with IAFIS. There \nhas been no mention of whether and how IAFIS would access the US VISIT \nfingerprint records. It is unclear whether IDENT alone is robust enough \nto handle the additional workload that comes with US VISIT.\n  The State Department, whose job it is to take the photos and \nfingerprints of visa applicants, appears to be on track to meet the \nOctober 26, 2004 deadline to enroll 2 flat prints of all visa \napplicants between the ages of 14 and 79 at all 211 posts. However, \nthere has been some question regarding the quality of the fingerprint \nimages the State Department is enrolling, which we are looking into.\n  In summary, knowing the background of individuals entering the United \nStates is our first line of defense against terrorism. We have spent \nhundreds of millions of dollars to build a criminal database, IAFIS, \nand should take full advantage of the information it contains. The \nadministration should make the integration of IDENT and US VISIT with \nIAFIS a number one priority. These agencies must work together to \ndetermine what is needed to integrate these systems. The administration \nshould submit a statement of policy and a plan, agreed to by FBI, DHS, \nand State, which provides the technology and funding requirements as \nwell as a time line for integration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to address the repeated attacks \ntowards the Bush administration's role in Iraq. Yesterday, one critic \nclaimed that our unilateral policy in Iraq has steadily drifted from \ntragedy to tragedy and made America less safe. The very mention of Iraq \nand the current situation there incites what I have begun to call the \n``liberal naysayers'' to launch into steady streams of empty rhetoric \nagainst our plans in Iraq. Just this week these critics said that our \ntroops are paying the price for flawed policy. These brazenly political \nclaims have no basis, in fact, and serve no purpose other than to \nundermine the administration in a time of war.\n  In liberating Iraq, we have rid the nation and the rest of the world \nfrom the danger of Saddam Hussein. 46 of the 55 of his most wanted \nregime members have been captured or killed. In removing this tyrant \nfrom power and undermining his regime, we have brought about increased \nsecurity in a nation that at one time barely comprehended the term. \nToday, over 150,000 Iraqis, including 75,000 new police personnel, are \nprotecting the Iraqi people. Recently the Iraqi Governing Council \nsigned the Transitional Administrative Law. This unprecedented \nframework promises long overdue civil rights for all Iraqis. It ensures \nfreedom of religion and worship, the right to free expression, the\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\nright to peacefully assemble, the right to be treated equally under the \nlaw, the right to stand for election and cast a ballot secretly, the \nright to privacy, and the right to a fair, public and speedy trial. We \nhave removed many barriers in the Iraqi society and allowed women to \nfinally play a role in every day life--including the new Iraqi \ngovernment.\n  To abandon our mission in Iraq today would undermine all we have \naccomplished up until now. We would leave behind a devastating breeding \nground for terrorists. More importantly, it would give the insurgents \nin Iraq reason to believe they have won--that they finally succeeded in \ndriving us out and halting the process of peace. The recent surge of \nviolence in Iraq is not indicative of failed policy--rather it is proof \nthat terrorists see freedom arriving there--and it terrifies them. Just \nrecently I read of that fear firsthand in a memo written by captured al \nQaida operative Zarqawi. Concerned that the Mujahidin may lose its \nfooting in Iraq he wrote:\n\n       There is no doubt that our field of movement is shrinking \n     and the grip around the throat of the Mujahidin has begun to \n     tighten. With the spread of the Army and the police, our \n     future is becoming frightening.\n\n  The very idea of freedom incites fear in the hearts of terrorists \nacross the world. Insurgents from Syria, Libya, Iran and other \ncountries continue to cling to the fruitless hope that their violence \nwill force the coalition forces out and allow the eradicated reign of \nterror back in. They don't just hate freedom--they fear it. These \nterrorist cells infiltrating Iraq know that the introduction of \ndemocracy and peace in the Middle East is only the beginning of the \nannihilation of terrorism worldwide.\n  The accomplishments are many, and the truth is the liberation of Iraq \nis just one battle in the war on terror. The process of creating a \ndemocracy and turning the government over to an entire new governing \ncouncil will take time. But we are a nation of our word. President \nGeorge Bush has told the world that we would return power to the Iraqi \npeople on June 30, and we intend to stick to that deadline. Our desire \nis to restore sovereignty to the people of Iraq--and ensure peace and \nstability in the transfer. To abandon Iraq prior to either of those \ngoals being accomplished would be a failed mission--and that simply is \nnot an option.\n  While it is important to note the administration's successes in Iraq, \nAmericans should also be aware that our actions in Iraq have made us \nsafer here in the U.S. President Bush recognized that in order to \ncontain the growing threat of terrorism from Iraq we had to eliminate \nit at its source. Our President chooses to allow the war on terror to \nbe fought in Kabul and Baghdad, rather than Washington, DC, or New \nYork. As he so boldly explained just recently, his desire was not to \nstand idly by. He said:\n\n       I made a pledge to this country; I will not stand by and \n     hope for the best while dangers gather. I will not take risks \n     with the lives and security of the American people. I will \n     protect and defend this country by taking the fight to the \n     enemy.\n\n  I applaud our administration for carrying out their mission in Iraq \nso effectively. Our role in Iraq has brought about freedom to 50 \nmillion Iraqis and Afghans and underscored America's character in \nkeeping our word. Former secretary of State George Shultz said it best \nthis week when he wrote:\n\n       Above all, and in the long run, the most important aspect \n     of the Iraq war will be what it means for the integrity of \n     the international system and for the effort to deal \n     effectively with terrorism. The stakes are huge and the \n     terrorists know that as well as we do. That is the reason for \n     their tactic of violence in Iraq. And that is why, for us and \n     for our allies, failure is not an option. The message is that \n     the U.S. and others in the world who recognize the need to \n     sustain our international system will no longer quietly \n     acquiesce in the take-over of states by lawless dictators who \n     then carry on their depredations--including the development \n     of awesome weapons for threats, use or sale . . . September \n     11 forced us to comprehend the extent and danger of the \n     challenge. We began to act before our enemy was able to \n     extend the consolidate his network.\n\n  The war on terror will not easily be won, but America is up to the \ntask. May God bless our brave men and women in uniform fighting for \ndemocracy and freedom--and God bless this land of the free, America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe issue of asbestos, the legislation which is about to be called to \nthe Senate floor, offered by the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Utah. The Judiciary \nCommittee reported out a prior bill in July of last year, and it was \nsupported largely along party-line votes. One Democrat joined in the \nvote to send it out of committee, and I supported the vote to send the \nbill to the floor, having stated a number of concerns I had on specific \nprovisions.\n  In August, during the August recess, I enlisted the aid of the former \nChief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Judge Edward \nR. Becker, who had taken senior status preceding May 5. For 2 days, in \nJudge Becker's chambers, he and I met with representatives of the \nmanufacturers, the insurers, the reinsurers, the AFL/CIO, and the trial \nlawyers, starting to go through a wide range of issues. Since that \ntime, we have met on 18 occasions in my office here in the Hart \nBuilding, virtually every week, with those representatives, and they \nhad meetings in between.\n  During the course of our extensive discussions, we have come to \nsignificant agreements on streamlining the administrative process, \nearly startup, defining the exigent health claims, moving through the \nlanguage on judicial review, and dealing with the issue of medical \nmonitoring. A good number of those provisions were inserted in a new \nbill introduced by Senator Hatch and Senator Frist on April 7. The \nmajority leader has listed the asbestos bill on a number of occasions, \nand each time has deferred it pending the negotiations which have been \nin process and I think are making good progress.\n  I have attended all of these meetings. They have lasted, most of \nthem, for several hours supplementing the 2 days in Judge Becker's \nchambers, which were both all-day events. All the parties have been \nvery, very cooperative. The manufacturers have talked to the AFL/CIO. \nIn between, meetings have been had with the AFL/CIO. The trial lawyers \nhave been cooperative. There is no doubt that some among the trial \nlawyers may feel they have some contrary interests. I think there has \nbeen an overall view--clearly by the trial lawyers and the AFL-CIO--\nthat there are many injured people who have suffered from mesothelioma, \nwhich is a deadly ailment, who are not being compensated because their \ncompanies were bankrupt. In excess of 70 companies have gone bankrupt. \nThere are hundreds of thousands of claims and there are numerous \nparties who have been named as defendants. The specific statistics are \nthat the number of claims is now over 600,000. There are 8,500 \ncompanies which have been named as defendants. As I say, more than 70 \ncompanies have been bankrupt.\n\n  The courts have held that someone is entitled to compensation for \nexposure to asbestos even though the injuries are not yet demonstrable; \nthat even though the injuries are speculative, a jury may return a \nverdict based on what injuries may be sustained. That decision was made \nby the Supreme Court of the United States. That stands at the same time \nthe people who have mesothelioma, which is a deadly disease, are not \ncompensated.\n  So it is a very serious matter on all ends: On the end of the \nclaimants who are not being compensated because the companies are \nbankrupt; on the end of companies which have gone bankrupt spending a \nlot of money on litigation.\n  When a request is made, when legislation is structured to give up the \nright to jury trial, that is a very serious matter with our common law \ntradition for right to trial by jury, a right which is specified in the \nseventh amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the right to jury trial in \na civil case. We are dealing with very weighty matters. We\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nhave established a scale of compensation, a schedule which is patterned \nalong the lines of workers' compensation, but there are very weighty \nmatters to be considered.\n  It is my thinking that a cloture vote this week would be \ncounterproductive. I understand the thinking to the contrary, that a \ncloture vote may put some pressure on the parties to move forward. \nThere are many on both sides of the aisle who want a bill. I see the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Delaware having risen. He probably \nwants to make some comments but is waiting patiently, or impatiently, \nbut at least waiting. Senator Daschle has been a participant. His \npeople have been in these discussions. Senator Leahy, of course, the \nranking Democrat, has been an active participant, and Senator Dodd has \nbeen. Senator Carper keeps calling over the weekend, concerned about \nthese matters. Senator Hatch has been a leader, having constructed the \nidea of the trust fund and having gotten $104 billion in it initially. \nThat figure may be up to $114 billion. Senator Hatch commented about \nthe legislation reported out, if I am incorrect--Senator Hatch is in \nthe Chamber and can correct me--at $139 billion. So there are a lot of \npeople who want a bill.\n  Some of the thinking is if there is a cloture vote it will put people \non record, people whose constituencies would like to see a bill, who \nmay not want to vote against cloture, so there may be that pressure.\n  My own view is progress has been made. I can represent emphatically \nthat these are very complex issues. Judge Becker was the judge who \nwrote the opinion on the class action case brought on asbestos several \nyears ago. His opinion was upheld by the Supreme Court. He is very \nknowledgeable in the field. He happens to be the winner of the \noutstanding jurist award among Federal judges, about 1,000 judges. He \nreally knows the field.\n  I have had substantial experience in litigation and legislation and \nhave examined these complex issues and say emphatically that there has \nbeen no dawdling. Progress has been made on the complex issues, as much \nas could be made, at the meetings presided over by Judge Becker and \nmyself and meetings in between time.\n  So my view is a cloture vote is premature. Earlier today the majority \nleader in the Senate talked to Senator Daschle and raised the \npossibility about a delay but not committed to a delay. His \ninclination, fairly stated, is to go ahead with a cloture vote unless \nthere can be some good reason there will be a way to expedite \nnegotiations.\n  Judge Becker has some commitments this week which he cannot break, \nbut he is available part of the week and is available all of next week. \nI have a commitment next Tuesday that I have to work toward. It is \ncalled a primary election. I am only in town today, breaking my \ncampaign schedule, which is very important. I have a tough fight on my \nhands--it is well within my pay grade--a tough fight. But I met earlier \ntoday with the parties to the asbestos matter, attended a leadership \nmeeting, and spoke with Senator Hatch earlier today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4123-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending business is the motion to proceed \nto the consideration of S. 2290.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Did the distinguished Senator from Delaware have a desire \nto speak?\n  Mr. CARPER. Just for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask I be given the privilege of speaking thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. What was the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent is that Senator Carper \nbe given 5 minutes, after which Senator Hatch will be given 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Before Senator Specter leaves the Chamber, I express my \nthanks to him and certainly to Judge Becker for the willingness to \nenter into what many people describe as one of the most complex issues \nwe will face this year or any year in the U.S. Congress to try to see \nif there is a way to ensure that people who are sick and dying from \nasbestos exposure get the help they need; folks who are not sick, who \nbecome sick, get the help they need, and that the companies which have \na fair amount of exposure, whether they be manufacturers or insurance \ncompanies, get some certainty with respect to their financial \nobligations.\n  I am more encouraged at this moment than I have been for some time \nthat we may have the beginning of a negotiating process. I realize \nthese negotiations are going under the sponsorship of Senator Specter \nand the leadership of Judge Becker. If we are fortunate enough to get \nthe buy-in from both leaders, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, these \nnegotiations, led by Judge Becker, should be the vehicle.\n  We do not have to go out and invent a new negotiation process. This \nis one that works. Judge Becker is smart as a whip. He got the \ninvolvement of the leadership staff on both sides. Senator Hatch's \nstaff, Senator Leahy's staff, Senator Dodd, myself, and others have \nbeen actively involved in these negotiations through Judge Becker.\n  This is a good process. We ought to build on this process. I have \nencouraged our leader to take ownership of the process--not to take \naway from Judge Becker but to ask him to continue to work. Judge \nBecker, for reasons that are beyond my pay grade, enjoys the confidence \nof labor. He enjoys the confidence of the insurers. He enjoys the \nconfidence of the manufacturers, the defendants in these cases, and I \nthink the respect of the trial bar. What we need to do is take him up \non the offer, on his willingness to stay here and work with us.\n  My hope is we will end up with a negotiation that will lead not to \nfurther negotiation but a bill, another bill in the Senate, building on \nwhat has come to the Senate already.\n  I had a chance to talk with Senator Hatch a few minutes ago off the \nfloor. He expressed a willingness to wait for as much as a month before \nwe actually take up the bill. That gives this negotiating process \nanother 4 weeks to bear fruit, further fruit--it has already borne a \nlot--and for us to take up at a date certain--I suggest maybe the week \nbefore the Memorial Day recess--to take up the bill, to negotiate, to \ndebate, to amend it, and to pass it.\n  I am, again, more encouraged than I have been in some time. I express \nmy thanks, again, to the Senator from Pennsylvania for his leadership.\n  I thank Senator Hatch. I know this is near and dear to his heart, and \nSenator Leahy and both of our leaders. We can get this done, and we \nhave to.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. However, I am not as \nsure we are going to get this done as he is. I have to say, we have \nbeen working on this for 15 months. We have met innumerable times with \nour friends on the other side. We have met with every party involved \nhere. I have tried to do everything I possibly can to bring everybody \ntogether. This is mired in politics. There is no question about it.\n  We are talking about a motion to proceed. How often in the Senate \nhave we had a filibuster against a motion to proceed to a bill, when \nyou can filibuster the bill, too? So you would have two filibusters on \nthis bill, assuming we were to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed. \nIt shows the lengths to which some will go in an election year to play \npartisan politics.\n  Look, we have done everything in our power to accommodate Democrats. \nWe have made so many changes to accommodate the Democrats on this that \nI have gotten excoriated by the Wall Street Journal and others who I do \nnot think have looked at these negotiations or understand what is going \non.\n  Keep in mind, there are 8,400 companies that would like to resolve \nthis problem, many of which are going to go into bankruptcy. Seventy \nhave already gone into bankruptcy. Those jobs are lost. Those pensions \nare lost. The money we could have here to help settle this is lost. \nThose were the main\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\ncompanies that handled asbestos. The remaining companies are those that \nhave some peripheral experience with asbestos but really did not do the \nwrongs. But under this system, which is out of whack according to the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America, and any reasonable \nperson who looks at it, we have unjust litigation going on all over \nthis country for people who are not even sick. A high percentage of the \ncases brought are for people who have never had a sick day in their \nlives--certainly not from asbestos. It is another scam, in many \nrespects. Not all of them; some of these cases are valid. That is why \nwe want to come up with $114 billion, that we have had to force the \ncompanies to come up with, to try to solve these problems.\n  This has not been easy, and it has not been fun for me or anybody \nelse in this process. The fact of the matter is, there is a high \npercentage of these lawsuits that are unjustified that are costing us \nan arm and a leg. Let's be honest about it, 60 percent of all the money \nwe are talking about here--assuming we cannot get this bill passed--\nwill go for attorneys' fees and transaction costs, not to the people \nwho need help. Mesothelioma victims are getting 5 cents on the dollar, \nif that, about $17,000 for an absolute cancer that has destroyed their \nlives and has caused them death.\n  I do have some comments to make about the comments my good friend, \nthe distinguished minority leader, made this morning. I would like to \nmake some comments with regard to Senator Daschle's statements this \nmorning. He stated a lung cancer victim with 15 years of exposure would \nreceive only $25,000 in compensation. That is painting a very \nincomplete picture, which I would like to finish. If we are going to \npaint the picture, let's paint the whole picture.\n  First, that picture is the bottom range of compensation. Under the \nclaims values in the FAIR Act we have come up with, claimants who were \nexposed to asbestos and still smoking will receive between $25,000 to \n$75,000 in compensation. And for the record, Senators Leahy and Kennedy \nhave stated they want $50,000 for claimants falling into this category. \nBut it is between $25,000 and $75,000.\n\n  Mr. President, I have come here to discuss the FAIR Act. We have a \nchance to help those who have suffered from asbestos-related injuries \nfor far too long. Many people have spent months getting us to this \npoint. I want to assure we have a complete picture of the bill for the \nrecord. We owe at least that much to the victims.\n  By the way, these are people who do not have any markers, do not have \nany evidence through X-rays or any other reason to show asbestos has \ncaused their cancer. Yet we are willing to give $25,000 to $75,000 to \nthem. If they get mesothelioma, they have a right to go and get the \nmillion dollars under the schedule we have agreed to in the Judiciary \nCommittee. It does not stop them from getting fair compensation. But it \ncertainly is a misrepresentation to say they are only getting $25,000. \nThese are heavy-duty smokers. Almost everybody knows their cancers come \nfrom smoking, but we bent over backwards to give consideration that \npossibly there may be some connection to asbestos, even though there is \nno evidence.\n  Senator Sarbanes, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, stated we, \nand I quote, ``sprung'' the bill on the Democratic Senators and their \nstaff. Come on. Senator Daschle called attention to the total fund \nvalue. I want to state for the record Senator Daschle's staff was \ninformed of the new numbers last October. That was 6 months ago. Since \nOctober, there have been repeated and continuing discussions of these \nnumbers over the ensuing months, and we had many months of discussion \nprior to that. We have been on this for 15 solid months on a daily \nbasis, and we have worked with Democrats on the other side. We have \nworked with everybody involved, including the personal injury lawyers \nwho do not want to lose this bird in the cage.\n  Now we repeatedly asked the Democrats for a response to the numbers. \nRepeatedly we have asked. We have received none. We repeatedly asked \nthe Democrats for a legislative proposal they would like to make, a \nconcept of a structure, something, anything. We have received nothing. \nAs Senator Daschle knows, this so-called new bill we allegedly \n``sprung'' on him includes the very numbers we released months ago, the \nchanges demanded by the Democrats and the changes demanded by the \nunions. We have all kinds of changes we have made for these parties in \nthis matter. This is not some little sprung deal. The Democrats have \nhad every right to participate in these processes, and some have. Some \nhave been kept from these processes by their own party members.\n  I would like to respond to a few of the statements made by my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, earlier this morning \nregarding S. 2290, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of \n2004. If I recall it correctly--and I was watching as Senator Daschle \nstated there was no reversion to the tort system should the moneys not \nbe there--and the moneys are there. Virtually everybody who has \neffectively studied this says this amount of money we have in this bill \nwill take care of the problem. In fact, though, there is a reversion to \nthe tort system should it not. Should the fund become insolvent, then \nclaimants with asbestos injuries who have not received compensation \nunder the fund may pursue their claims in the courts at that time. So \nthat statement there is no reversion is simply wrong. Again, we have \nworked closely with our colleagues on the other side. That was their \nidea, and we accepted it.\n\n  Naturally one of the problems in this matter is some of these \npersonal injury lawyers, who really know better, have been forum \nshopping to special jurisdictions that are out of whack that literally \ndo not care what the law says and literally do not care about justice \nor doing what is right. Some say--I hope this is not true--but some say \nthey are bought and paid for by the personal injury lawyers in their \nrespective jurisdictions.\n  There are at least four or five jurisdictions in this country where \nyou can go in and get whopping verdicts for no injuries, like one \nverdict in one of these counties in one of these preferred \njurisdictions by, I think, dishonest personal injury lawyers, or at \nleast those who are exploiting the system, where there was $150 million \ngranted for five plaintiffs, not one of whom had been sick a day from \nasbestos. That money is not going to those who really are sick, which \nthis bill does. Even the Supreme Court has said this system is broken.\n  I am not against further negotiations. We are happy to do it. That is \none reason why this bill is on the floor right now, because we are \ngoing to have a vote on this. It might be a cloture vote on a motion to \nproceed, of all things, but at least we are going to have a vote so \npeople know where some of these folks stand. Some people have used this \nbill to raise money for their campaigns, saying they are going to be \nfor it, and yet when push comes to shove, they are never for it, it is \nnever good enough, there is never enough money. Yet, as I have said, we \nhave not had a proposal, we have not had a dollar figure, except \noutrageous figures nobody can meet, off the top of the head.\n  We can talk about 15 months of very heavy-duty slogging here. Now \nthey want more time?\n\n  I would like to take a couple minutes to talk briefly about some of \nthe improvements in the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act. We \nworked our guts out to get a bill out of committee. It was a very tough \nthing. I remember staying into the, I think it was the wee hours of the \nmorning or at least pretty close to midnight that night debating this \nbill. There were some amendments added that I have to admit I didn't \nlike and that would have made it impossible for this bill to pass on \nthe floor. But we have worked very hard. Since then, we have had \ncountless meetings with unions, with personal injury lawyers, with \nvictims, with companies, with insurance companies, trying to bring \neverybody together.\n  This bill was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee after a \nlengthy committee markup spanning four separate meetings. S. 1125, the \nbill reported out of committee, included, among other unprecedented \nachievements, a major bipartisan solution with respect to medical \ncriteria where all of the committee members--and this committee is \nideologically divided, very tough--agreed on eligibility requirements \nfor determining asbestos-related injuries compensable under the act and\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nover 50 other consensus-building provisions. It and other bipartisan \nagreements remain in S. 2290, the bill we are discussing today.\n  S. 2290, as many have noted, makes additional significant \nimprovements over the committee bill from a lot of hard work. I praise \nSenator Leahy, Senator Specter, the majority leader, and others who \nhave worked so hard. Of course, their staffs have worked so hard on a \nday-in-day-out basis to try to solve these problems. These improvements \nreflect agreements reached in continuing negotiation among \nrepresentatives of organized labor and industry that were mediated by \nour colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. I praise our mutual \nfriend, chief judge emeritus of the Federal Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals, Judge Edward Becker, who has played a pivotal significant role \nhere.\n  First, let me briefly highlight some of the key provisions of this \nimportant legislation. S. 2290 ends the broken asbestos litigation \nsystem and replaces it with a privately funded asbestos victims \ncompensation program for the payment of asbestos claims.\n  The key elements of the asbestos victims compensation program include \nan office of asbestos disease compensation headed by an administrator \nfor processing and paying claims; a no-fault system based on sound and \nfair eligibility requirements. That no-fault system will not require \nattorneys in most instances and will save the attorney's fees. Sixty \npercent of the moneys here go to the people who are really sick. That \nno-fault system is a very important step. It includes a nonadversarial, \nstreamlined, and less burdensome claims process with only two levels of \nreview. In most cases, the claimant probably will not need an attorney \nor if the claimant has an attorney, we provide for attorney's fees \nunder the bill, but on a scaled down basis.\n  There is still $2.5 billion in this bill for attorneys, even under \nthis system. It provides for over $100 billion in funding assured over \na period of 27 years, actually $114 billion with a $10 billion \ncontingent fund added on. So you could look at it as $124 billion that \nwe are forcing these companies, including the insurance companies, \nwhich have limited liability by the way, we are forcing them to pay \ninto this fund upwards of $124 billion, if it is needed. But $114 \nbillion will be made available, and it does have that $10 billion in \ncontingent funding for defendants.\n\n  S. 2290 bans future asbestos use to eliminate the dangers caused by \nasbestos exposure. It provides grants for mesothelioma research and \ntreatment centers, hopefully to find a way to resolve some of the \nproblems.\n  This represents a good-faith effort to improve this fine legislation. \nThat is just some of the changes. No piece of legislation is perfect, \nbut I am certain that with these changes a very good piece of \nlegislation got better.\n  Let's go to the improvements over S. 1125. We had to get a bill out \nof committee. It was a hard-fought battle. It took us four markups and \na major all-day session. Let me list some of the improvements.\n  This is less adversarial. It provides for a less adversarial, more \nstreamlined administrative process, including less levels of review \nthan the original bill. This bill has a more user-friendly application \nprocess and expanded claimant assistance program, where you might not \neven need lawyers to eat up the funds, although you could have a lawyer \nif you want one.\n  This provides interim authority, interim regulations, upfront \nfunding, and increases borrowing to facilitate the prompt startup of \npaying these folks who have suffered--the real claimants, not these \npeople who haven't suffered who are getting moneys from these false \njurisdictions.\n  This bill increases claims values. Mesothelioma victims are now \ngetting, in many cases, 5 cents on the dollar. This bill resolves that \nproblem, just to mention one thing.\n  This has more secure funding because it guarantees mandatory funding \nfrom funding participants. It gives audit authority and civil penalties \nfor false statements and fraud. It has stronger enforcement authority, \nand it has additional safeguards to ensure priority of payments to the \nfund.\n  It also increases liquidity and provides more flexibility to address \nshort-term funding problems. It has a more orderly wind-up of the fund \nand transition back to the tort system in the event of a sunset, with \npayment in full for all resolved claims. It also provides grants for \nmesothelioma research and treatment centers that are also required to \nparticipate in a mesothelioma disease registry. All of these would be \nwonderful.\n  This new bill increases compensation going to victims over what they \nare getting today. The attorneys do real well, but the victims aren't \ndoing quite as well. It revises the funding provisions to help \nguarantee funding and to protect the solvency of the fund, while \nensuring that any risk or shortfall rests on defendants and insurers, \nnot on claimants. It establishes a more streamlined, less adversarial \nand less burdensome administrative system than provided in our original \nbill, S. 1125, that will be up and running more quickly. It provides \ngrants for mesothelioma research and treatment to help find a cure for \nthis deadly disease.\n  I emphasize that S. 2290 puts even more money in the hands of victims \nthan provided in S. 1125 as reported by the committee, which was \nalready estimated to put over one and one and a half times more money \ninto the pockets of victims than they would have received under the \ncurrent tort system where more than half of the resources now go into \nthe pockets of the plaintiffs' and defendants' lawyers.\n  I am pleased to say, with the leadership of our majority leader, \nSenator Frist, S. 2290 raises award values in certain categories, \nfocusing those diseases that are most clearly caused by exposure to \nasbestos.\n  I might add that as a thoracic surgeon Senator Frist brings a unique \nperspective on this legislation. I think it is fair to say that he is \nthe only Member of this body who has performed surgery on mesothelioma \npatients. The values from the negotiations conducted by Senator Frist \nled to an increase of $100,000 for severe and disabling asbestosis, \namong other increases.\n  Values for smokers and ex-smokers with lung cancer under levels 8 and \n9 were also notably increased, although most likely their cancers came \nfrom their heavy-duty smoking. That involves a lot of union members who \nprobably would get nothing if it weren't for this bill. For the life of \nme, I don't understand why the union leaders have not been totally for \nthis. I have heard them privately say this is a good bill. I commend \nSenator Frist for his insight and efforts in this process.\n  Although some Democrats and some affected parties assert that values \nin S. 2290 are not enough, they generally only focus on the values for \nexposure-only lung cancers. Most experts believe these claimants have \nno clearly established link that the lung cancer was caused by asbestos \nexposure, such as underlying asbestosis, and may have been heavy \nsmokers all their lives. There is no evidence in these cases that their \ncancer or lung problems have come from asbestos exposure, but we give \nthem the benefit of the doubt in this bill. Some conservatives think \nthat goes way too far. Even though these people have been heavy smokers \nall their lives and we know that leads to cancer, we have been willing \nto go this far in the bill. Some of these experts provided testimony to \nthe Judiciary Committee that an exposure-only lung cancer disease \ncategory runs an extremely high risk that lung cancer falling within \nthis category are, in fact, not conclusively attributable to asbestos \nexposure. That is putting it mildly. Providing increased compensation \nfor these smoking-related claimants could frustrate the purpose of the \nfund and put the fund at risk. In fact, lung cancer claimants with no \nmarkers or impairment from asbestos currently receive nothing from \ntoday's bankruptcy trusts--zero. This bill gives them the benefit of \nthe doubt. These claims with no markers and no impairment--meaning no \nindications at all that asbestos was involved--almost always result in \ndefense verdicts in today's tort system.\n  Here we provide the benefit of the doubt to them in the bill. Some \nhave criticized that, but that is how far we have gone to try to get \nthe other side to do something and debate this bill. If they don't like \nprovisions of it, file amendments and bring them up. We are willing to \ndebate them. They may win on some of these amendments. I can live with \nthat. But to just continue to\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nfilibuster everything that can help this country immeasurably at this \ntime seems to me to be hitting below the belt.\n  Upon close consultation with organized labor, S. 2290 contains \nadditional changes to ensure that more money is put into the hands of \nvictims more quickly. Specifically, this entailed locating the program \nat the Department of Labor. The Wall Street Journal doesn't like that \nidea and neither do some of my fellow Republicans. But that is how far \nwe have gone to accommodate them and try to bring this to closure. This \nis a major change from the bill as reported by the committee--which \nassigned the claims processing function to the Court of Claims. I have \nto admit, I don't particularly like that provision. I thought the Court \nof Claims would do a better job. I think any court would probably do a \nbetter job. On the other hand, these people are expert in some of these \nthings. The Government is not making these payments. Payments have to \ncome from the companies. So it is not something like black lung that \ngoes off the charts year after year. It is no secret that the \nadministration has serious reservations about this change. In fact, I \nhave questions about these provisions myself, but in the spirit of good \nfaith and compromise, we decided to include this new administrative \nmechanism in order to attempt to put more funds into the hands of the \nfamilies suffering from asbestos-related illness. We did this in an \nattempt to accommodate our friends on the other side--attempt after \nattempt after attempt--and here we are with a filibuster on the motion \nto proceed. We have acted in good faith. I think a filibuster is in bad \nfaith.\n\n  Reimbursement of costs for physical examinations are now provided as \npart of the medical monitoring program, and structured payments are now \nrequired to be made in a 40/30/30 split over a 3-year period, unless a \nstretch out to 4 years is required to protect the solvency of the fund.\n  The Hatch-Frist-Miller FAIR Act also improves the committee bill by \nproviding more secure funding and additional protections in the fund's \nsolvency, while maintaining that the risk of insolvency falls onto the \nvarious industries involved. Most of them should not be here. Most of \nthem are companies that hardly ever did anything with asbestos, but \nbecause they have either acquired a smaller company, or had some \ncontact with asbestos, although not significant, they are hauled into \nall these cases, and they are going to have to come up with moneys they \nshould never have had to come up with. The mandatory funding for \ndefendants is guaranteed, and moneys from insurers are infused into the \nfund in the early years where the most claims are anticipated. The \nincreased enforcement authority of the Attorney General to compel \npayment and other additional safeguards, such as requiring a priority \nfor payment obligations to the fund in State insurance receivership \nproceedings, further bolsters the fund's solvency. Also, increased \nborrowing authority provides more liquidity and will help with the \nshort-term funding problems.\n  Let me talk about some of the safeguards: We have over $100 billion \nin guaranteed mandatory funding; $114 billion plus $10 billion \ncontingency; a strong enforcement measure for underpayment and \nnonpayment; borrowing authority of 7 years future revenue ensures \nliquidity; regular program reviews, including claims and funding \nanalysis with recommendations for improvements; annual reports to \nCongress on the status of the fund, with recommendations for \nimprovements--Congress can make changes if it has to; and $10 billion \nin contingent funding; a risk of insolvency placed on companies with a \nsunset provision.\n  Those are all safeguards we put into the bill, much to the credit of \nour friends on the other side, who now appear to be filibustering this \nbill--even the motion to proceed. Of course, they are now asking for \neven more time for discussion.\n  Look, I have been told by people who know--or at least think they \nknow--some who have speculated that we are never going to get a bill \nthis year because it is an election year, and there is a lot of money \ninvolved from the personal injury lawyers. By the way, like the \nbankruptcy bill, a lot of money is involved by the companies who tend \nto pour it into people objecting to the bill, hoping they will somehow \nor other do what is right and support the bill. I hope that is not the \ncase, but the more this drags out and the more we have filibusters on \nmotions to proceed; and on this bill, after all the concessions we have \nmade and the negotiations we have had, the more I come to the \nconclusion maybe these rumors are true. In fact, I know a lot of people \nwho believe they are true.\n\n  Because of these new financial safeguards I have discussed, the \nHatch-Frist-Miller bill was able to modify the amendment proposed by \nSenator Biden and adopted in committee, which allowed for a reversion \nto the tort system in the event the fund becomes insolvent. Many \nmembers of the committee--and I thought Senator Biden himself--\nrecognized that the provisions in his amendment, voted on late with \nlittle discussion with the committee, needed further review. We are \npleased our new language satisfies the problem the Biden amendment \naddressed in the first place, but do so in a more flexible and \ndeliberative fashion.\n  Simply stated, the Hatch-Frist-Miller bill replaces these provisions \nwith an alternative program review that will give the administrator \nmore time and more flexibility to address any unanticipated short-term \nfunding problems. Under the new bill, full payment of all resolved \nclaims is required. To create a smoother transition and to avoid \nrecreating the current manifest shortcomings in a handful of State \ncourts, the fund will revert to the Federal court system. We must not \nlose sight of the fact that it is the aberrational result in the courts \nof a few States--especially Mississippi, Illinois, and West Virginia--\nthat has triggered this national crisis.\n  Let me emphasize that under the new language, any risk that the \nfunding is insufficient would still fall on defendants with claimants \nable to get their day in court.\n  Members and other interested parties need not worry that any risk of \ninsolvency will fall on the claimants.\n  I can give you cases that are 20 years long without any resolution to \nthe people who have been injured. This solves those problems almost \ninstantly.\n  Another significant change I would like to discuss further is the new \nadministrative structure and claims handling procedures provided in the \nHatch-Frist-Miller bill. While the committee bill created a more \naccessible and simpler claims processing system for claimants than \nfound in the tort system, organized labor continued to express concerns \nthat the administrative structure under S. 1125 was too adversarial and \ncumbersome.\n  The agreement mediated by Senator Specter and Judge Becker to move \nclaims processing from the Court of Federal Claims to an executive \noffice situated in the Department of Labor included numerous \nrefinements made in consultation with labor union representatives. They \nwere brought in in every way, and they are the ones who demanded this. \nSenator Specter and Judge Becker have negotiated it.\n  In addition to placing the office within the Department of Labor--\nagainst the preference of the Department of Labor, I might add--or an \nindependent executive agency, as requested by industry who lost on this \nissue, the new language also includes simplifying the claims \napplication process, expanding the claimant assistance program, and \nrequiring the creation of exposure presumptions to reduce the burden of \nproof for claimants in high-risk employments.\n  We made further refinements addressing concerns raised by Senator \nFeinstein and others that there may be an undue delay in starting up a \nnew claims system, forcing mesothelioma victims and victims whose \nclaims have been sitting in court for years to wait even longer to \nreceive compensation. Senator Feinstein's amendment could have \nunintentionally threatened the fund itself by diverting resources away \nfrom the fund and to unimpaired claimants.\n  Instead, the Hatch-Frist-Miller bill provides interim regulations for \nthe processing of claims, including exigent claims, interim authority, \nupfront funding, and increased borrowing authority, which all go toward \nensuring the system is up and running as soon as possible after the \ndate of enactment.\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nGood public policy demands expedited termination of the broken tort \nsystem and preservation of funds so that payments can go to the most \nworthy claimants, as defined by the consensus medical criteria.\n  As a final note, proposals for research moneys for mesothelioma were \ncirculated in committee. Mesothelioma victims generally live only a \nyear or so after diagnosis of this horrible disease. More research is \nneeded on mesothelioma to find better treatments and even a cure, and I \nam pleased this bill addresses this problem.\n  Our bill now provides up to $50 million--and I am willing to consider \nincreasing that amount--in grants to mesothelioma research and \ntreatment centers. In addition, these centers must be associated with \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers to provide research \nbenefits and care to veterans who have suffered excessively from \nmesothelioma. These, along with the asbestos ban, are important and \nvital pieces of legislation that must not be overlooked.\n  Again, I tried to highlight here some of the major changes from S. \n1125 as reported, many of which were made to address the concerns \nraised by various members in committee, especially on the Democratic \nside. These revisions are aimed at ensuring that the program \nestablished under the FAIR Act is fair to victims.\n\n  In short, the Hatch-Frist-Miller bill represents a reasonable and \nfair solution to the asbestos litigation crisis and may be the only \nsolution to it. Members from both sides of the aisle recognize that an \nequitable compensation program is necessary.\n  I believe S. 2290, the Hatch-Frist-Miller bill, meets the test. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this bill and at least support \ndebate on this bill and bring up amendments so we can see what further \nchanges the Senate, in working its will, will require. We should \ncertainly see that this bill is fully considered by the Senate.\n  Having said all of that, I am very concerned that this bill is being \ntreated only politically; that there are those who are afraid to vote \non this matter; that there are those who do not want to be involved in \nthis matter right now; that there are those who want to stop this \nmatter because of political pressure by special interest groups.\n  We now have 8,400 companies that are being sued, and it may go as \nhigh as 15,000. I might add that we have about 16 major insurance \ncompanies that are being sued, some of which should not have the \nliabilities we are imposing upon them. Nevertheless, the more companies \nthat go into bankruptcy, the more jobs are lost, the more pensions are \nlost, the more this economy will suffer, and the more all of us will be \nworse off.\n  I might also add that the courts have not proven to be effective here \nand that the tort system has failed. Even the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States says this requires a legislative solution. This is the \nonly legislative solution that is available, and if we want to get \nsomething done, we are going to have to work on this bill.\n  Personally, rather than have a filibuster on the motion to proceed, I \nthink we should go to the bill. I personally would be willing to grant \nmore time if we would have a definite date. I cannot speak for the \nmajority leader, naturally, but I would personally be willing to grant \nmore time, as Senator Specter was, to have further negotiations outside \nthe context of debate on the bill where usually those negotiations help \nbring about a bill. But I would be willing to go another 2 weeks to a \nmonth in intensive 9 to 6 negotiations every day, which we have been \ndoing now for 8 months, if we had a definite time to bring up \namendments and a definite time for final passage of the bill or a final \nvote on the bill. Maybe we will vote it down in the end. I doubt it. In \nfact, I am sure we will not.\n  The fact is, in other words, if we do not have to face another \nfilibuster and if everybody in good faith works to try to bring this \nabout and we have a debate on the floor and people have amendments they \nwant to bring up, they can do it. I cannot speak for the majority \nleader, but I certainly would be willing to recommend that, again \nbending over backwards to try to accommodate our colleagues on the \nother side.\n  If that is not acceptable, then I have to conclude that the \nstatements made by some of the folks outside of the Senate who are \nknowledgeable about this that politics is more important than solving \nthis problem, that money is more important than solving this problem, \nthat the personal injury lawyers are more important than solving this \nproblem happens to be true. I hope that is not true. I hope we can get \nour colleagues to work together. I would like to work with them, as we \nhave. We have not rejected or failed to consider any idea that has come \nup, and we will continue to do so. But if not, then let's go to cloture \non this bill and let's let everybody know who wants to stop even a \nreasonable debate, even a reasonable time to file amendments, even the \nreasonable position the Senate ought to always take, and that is the \nSenate should work its will and we should vote on the amendments one \nway or the other, vote on this bill one way or the other, and let the \nchips fall where they may.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to respond to the \nvery serious allegations contained in Bob Woodward's book about the use \nof counterterrorism funds to support preparations for the U.S. military \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  As a Senator and a taxpayer, I am very troubled by this information. \nThe Constitution gives Congress the sole power of the purse. The \nFounding Fathers did this for good reason. It is a responsibility that \nI take very seriously.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee for more than two \ndecades, I know there is a long, bipartisan tradition of \nadministrations--of both political parties--informing Congress when \nmoney is going to be used for purposes different than what it was \nintended for, especially if it is part of a major change of policy.\n  We do not yet know all of the facts, and we need to get the whole \nstory as soon as possible. But I will say that in the wake of September \n11, the Congress moved very quickly in a bipartisan way to appropriate \nbillions of dollars to respond to the threat of international \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\n  In doing so, we gave the administration a great deal of flexibility, \nbut we also made clear that we expected the administration to keep the \nCongress informed on the use of these funds. And administration \nofficials gave us their word that they would keep us informed.\n  We now learn, as a result of Bob Woodward's book, that millions of \ndollars that we thought we were appropriating for Afghanistan, or to \nrespond to other terrorist threats, may have been used by the Defense \nDepartment to begin preparations for the invasion of Iraq.\n  The problem is that there is not a shred of evidence linking Saddam \nHussein to the September 11 attacks. Even the President has \nacknowledged this.\n  In effect, it appears that the administration has treated the \nCongress with much the same disdain as it treated our European allies. \nRemember? They were the ``old Europe,'' who were out of touch, whose \nsupport we did not need. Like the United Nations, they were \n``irrelevant.''\n  So too the Congress: What do they know? They just appropriate money. \nThey do not need to know what it is being used for.\n  We also have learned, in even more detail, how this administration \nrushed into war without making adequate post-war plans or building a \nreal international coalition. As a result, the reconstruction efforts \nare a mess, our credibility is in tatters, and America's soldiers are \nshouldering a grossly disproportionate share of the burden and the \ncasualties.\n  The proper use of taxpayers' money is not a Democratic or a \nRepublican issue. As representatives of the American people, it is \nsomething that we should all be concerned about, and it may force us to \nchange the way we do business around here.\n  Mr. President, we also have before us an asbestos bill, the Asbestos \nInjury Resolution Act of 2004. This partisan asbestos bill is not ready \nfor floor consideration. It is not ready for prime time, not by a long \nshot. I do believe the Senate should pass legislation to establish a \nnational trust fund to fairly compensate asbestos victims. After all, I \nheld the first hearing ever held by the full Senate Judiciary Committee \nin an effort to get a resolution to the problem facing victims of \nasbestos poisoning. But, despite the title of this bill, it is far from \nfair. It is very partisan. This partisan bill creates a trust fund that \nprovides unfair compensation for asbestos victims. This partisan bill \ncreates a trust fund with inadequate funding, no startup protections, \nand major solvency problems. This partisan bill contains a warped \nsunset provision that could trap victims in a failed trust fund for 7 \nyears or more without having access to compensation.\n  Look at this chart. This fund says victims could be trapped in a \nfailed trust fund for 7 years or more and would have no compensation. \nIf the fund becomes insolvent, then the Hatch-Frist substitute provides \nfor a reversion to the tort system, but only after 7 years from when \nthe fund begins processing claims, and then only in Federal court, and \nthen only for some limited disease categories. So victims could be \ntrapped for 7 years or more with no compensation. That is not fair.\n  Some have claimed this bill provides for contingency funding to try \nto address the many uncertainties of future projections for asbestos \nvictims, but the $10 billion for continued funding only kicks in after \nyear 2023 and only if the funds still exist at this time. Let me show \nyou on this chart. It is only after year 2023. We are in the year 2004. \nThere will be very few in the Senate who will still be around to try to \ncorrect the mischief of this bill. You have contingency funding \navailable after 2023. That means a lot will not be available to pay the \npending 300,000 claims on day one. That is not a fair trust fund.\n  So I would say it is a mistake for the Republican leadership of the \nSenate to insist on proceeding to a bill and have so many major \nproblems still unresolved. The bill is not ready for prime time. Let's \nwork at making it ready, not work at scoring partisan points. Let's do \nsomething for the victims of asbestos.\n  Creating a fair national trust fund to compensate asbestos victims is \none of the most complex legislative situations I have seen in 29 years \nin the Senate. The interrelated aspects necessary for a fair national \ntrust fund is like a child's Rubik's Cube. So it is all the more \nnecessary that a bill be a consensus piece of legislation for it to \nbecome law. I am not looking for a Democratic or Republican piece of \nlegislation; I am looking for a bipartisan one that would work. That is \nwhy I worked so hard in months of bipartisan negotiation, why I worked \nso hard to encourage the interested stakeholders to reach agreement on \nall the critical details. I have had so many meetings in my office and \nin other Senators' offices with the major stakeholders across-the-\nboard, and this is where we are. We have Senator Hatch and the majority \nleader introducing a partisan asbestos bill.\n  I hoped the bipartisan dialog over the past year would yield a fair \nand efficient compensation system that we could in good conscience \noffer to those suffering today from asbestos-related diseases and to \nthe victims yet to come. Our leader, the senior Senator from South \nDakota, Senator Daschle, was entrusted by all of us to speak for our \ncaucus and to try to negotiate an agreement. Time and again he made \nthat attempt. Time and again he was put off.\n  I stood there with him when he spoke to the leadership on the \nRepublican side saying, Can't we get together on a piece of \nlegislation? But unfortunately the Senate majority leadership decided \nto walk away from those negotiations and resort to unilateralism by \nintroducing a partisan bill without Democratic support. That is a \nshame. They ought to pull this bill and sit down with Senator Daschle, \nknowing Senator Daschle will go to the table and negotiate a real bill, \nbecause the introduction of this bill raises many questions, most \nnotably what the sponsors are trying to achieve, because it certainly \nis not a fair compensation model for asbestos victims. By breaking off \nbipartisan negotiations and pushing this bill to the floor, they have \nturned their backs on those of us who have worked so long for a fair \nsolution.\n  I was encouraged to learn this week from a news wire report that a \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, who \nplayed an important role in the negotiations, favored resumption of \nnegotiations. Senator Specter told the Associated Press:\n\n       I declined to join with Senator Frist and Senator Hatch in \n     their substitute bill because I think it is the better \n     practice to try to work through these problems. Senator \n     Specter, of course, has put in untold hours with retired \n     distinguished Judge Becker in trying to work through the \n     points of such a bill.\n\n  We have all learned a great deal about the harms caused by asbestos \nexposure since that first hearing that convened in September of 2002. \nAsbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the \nworkplace. Between 1940, the year I was born, and 1980, more than 27.5 \nmillion workers in this country were exposed to asbestos on the job and \nnearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long periods \nof time. Unbelievably, asbestos is still used today.\n  What we face is an asbestos-induced disease crisis. Hundreds of \nthousands of workers and their families have suffered debilitating \ndisease and death due to asbestos exposure. The disease and the death \nare among the most horrible ways of being sickened or to die. These are \nthe real victims of the nightmare and they must be the first and \nforemost focus of our concern and effort. These are people who, simply \nby showing up for work and doing their job as they are supposed to, \nendured lives of extreme pain and suffering.\n  Not only do they continue to suffer, and their number will grow, but \nthe businesses involved in the litigation, along with their employees \nand their retirees, are suffering from the economic uncertainty created \nby the situation.\n  More than 60 companies have filed for bankruptcy because of their \nasbestos-related liabilities. These 60 bankruptcies have a devastating \nhuman economic effect. Asbestos victims deserving fair compensation do \nnot receive it and bankrupt companies do not create new jobs or invest \nin our economy.\n  In working with Senators Daschle, Dodd, Frist, Hatch, and Specter, we \nencouraged representatives from organized labor, the trial bar, and \nindustry\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nhelp reach consensus on a national trust fund to compensate asbestos \nvictims. We wanted to give financial certainty also for the defendants \nand their insurers.\n  Now a successful trust fund--by that, I mean one that would provide \nfair and adequate compensation to all victims--would bring reasonable \nfinancial certainty to defendant companies and their insurers. To be \nsuccessful, it has to have four essential components. It has to have \nappropriate medical criteria, it has to have fair award values, \nadequate funding, and an efficient, expedited system for processing \nclaims.\n  During the markup session of the Judiciary Committee on the first \nFAIR Act, we unanimously adopted the Leahy-Hatch amendment on medical \ncriteria. This created 10 categories of disease. The medical criteria \nrepresent bipartisan agreement the national trust fund should provide \nmonetary compensation to claimants who suffered impairment and it \nshould provide medical monitoring to those individuals with less \nserious asbestos-related conditions. The bipartisan medical criteria \nare in this new bill. I agree with them.\n  During the mediation process established by Senator Specter and Judge \nBecker--I referred to him earlier as Judge Edward Becker, retired chief \njudge for the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals--the \ninterested stakeholders tried to craft a streamlined administrative \nprocess. Senator Specter and Judge Becker worked very hard on this \nprocess. They deserve the thanks of all Members. I believe their very \ninclusive process was crucial to the establishment of a national trust \nfund at the Department of Labor.\n  Even that agreement, the agreement between the interested \nstakeholders, left many details unresolved. In fact, as this chart \nshows, Judge Becker listed 22 outstanding issues. Many involved \nadministrative process. That list of 22 outstanding issues did not \ninclude the 2 other major components of a fair trust fund: fair award \nvalues and adequate funding to pay for it. These are the remaining \nissues.\n\n  We cannot zip to the Senate floor and because we could not find \nanything else to do, we bring it up. There are many issues, including \nstartup language, sunset time, timeframe, reversion to tort system, in \nwhat forum, pending cases, settlements in pending cases, treatment of \nexisting trusts, worker's compensation, medical screening of high-risk \nworkers, transparencies, setoff rules, statute of limitation language, \nexclusive default judgments, bankruptcies, FELA, exclusivity for \nasbestos-related claims, and on and on.\n  I mention this because this is a highly complex area. Simply putting \nsomething on the Senate calendar to say we put something on the Senate \ncalendar is a lot different than actually being legislators and trying \nto pass something. What we want is a decent piece of legislation, not a \nheadline. The people who are suffering from asbestos-induced injuries \nand illness are not helped by a headline. They are helped by real \nlegislation which requires real Senators doing--guess what--real work.\n  The changes made to a few award values by Majority Leader Frist moved \nin the right direction. His partisan bill does not move far enough \ntoward providing fair compensation to all impaired victims of asbestos \nexposure. In fact, seriously ill victims of exposure would receive \nsignificantly less compensation on average under the current version of \nthis act than they would in the tort system. The so-called FAIR Act is \nnot yet fair.\n  The gravest injustice to the bill is to lung cancer victims. A victim \nwith at least 15 years of asbestos exposure could receive only $25,000 \nin compensation for his or her asbestos-related disease under the new \nbill. Goodness gracious. I ask any Member of this committee, if \nsomebody's negligence caused them to have lung cancer, would they feel \nsatisfied with a $25,000 award? I don't have to poll the other 99 \nSenators. I know it would be a resounding no. Don't do it to the \nvictims of asbestos just because they do not serve in the Senate.\n  My chart underscores the fairness of the award value for asbestos-\nrelated lung cancer victims compared to compensation available in the \ntort system and under the proposal offered by Senator Kennedy and \nmyself during the committee markup.\n  The legislation we are considering today provides as little as \n$25,000 in compensation for victims suffering asbestos-related lung \ncancer. What a cruel joke on these lung cancer victims, especially \nthose who are going to die within the next 2 years. What a cruel joke \non their families who see this as the punishment because the \nbreadwinner in their family went to work every day in one of these \nindustries.\n  When there is smoking and asbestos combined, the likelihood of the \nresulting disease is greater than the sum of the parts.\n  Dr. Laura Welch is a well-respected medical expert who helped us \ncraft medical criteria which was accepted by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority in the committee. She said:\n\n       Smoking and asbestos act in concert together to cause lung \n     cancer, each multiplying the risk conferred by the other.\n\n  There is a synergistic relationship between asbestos exposure and \nsmoking. Smokers who meet the bill's exposure requirements face a risk \nof lung cancer that is up to five times greater than smokers not \nexposed to asbestos. But they receive only $25,000 under this bill.\n  In other words, if you go to work at W.R. Grace or Halliburton or \nsome of the other companies that are getting a real, real big deal \nunder this bill, and they say, ``OK, guys and gals, you can take a 10-\nminute cigarette break,'' if they are foolish enough to do it, that \ncombination of asbestos and smoking--at whatever company it might be; I \npicked W.R. Grace and Halliburton only because they benefit so greatly \nunder the bill; others do, too--then their risk is much greater, and \nthen they may have their awards reduced or even eliminated to repay any \ninsurance carrier.\n  Now, that is a lot different than what happens now. Usually, under \nthese programs, you do not have to repay your insurance carrier, you do \nnot have to repay workman's compensation. Under the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act, you do not have to do that. Under the Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, you do not \nhave to do that. Under the Ricky Ray Hemophiliac Relief Fund Act, you \ndo not have to do that.\n  But what bothers me is that when we made the medical criteria, we got \na bipartisan consensus on the medical criteria. We did it in a way to \nguarantee that we were eliminating what were the most troublesome \nclaims. We were setting a roadmap on which business and everybody else \nagreed. We all say we need to compensate the truly sick, but fair \ncompensation is not free.\n  The Judiciary Committee's bipartisan agreement on medical criteria \nwill be meaningless if the majority, in effect, rewrites the categories \nby failing to fairly compensate many who fall within them. You cannot \ncome to the floor and say, look, you have Republicans and Democrats who \ncame together and worked out the medical criteria that they are all \nvery happy about--and we met with labor, and we met with businesses, \nand we met with insurers, we met with the victims themselves, and we \nworked out a fair medical criteria--and then come to the floor and say, \nsee, we worked it all out. However, we made one little change. And what \nis the little change? The little change is to take away all the money \nor much of the money that was going to pay these victims.\n  If the award values are unfair, the bill will be unfair. And if the \nbill is unfair, it is unworthy of our support. In this case, with this \npartisan bill, it is unfair. It is unworthy of the support of Senators.\n  Since the first hearing, the hearing I held, we have had one bedrock \nprinciple: It has to be a balanced solution. Whatever solution we have, \nit has to be balanced. I cannot support a bill that gives inadequate \ncompensation to victims. I will not adjust fair award values into some \ndiscounted amount just to make the final tally come within a \npredetermined and artificial limit. That is not fair, and I will not \nvote for a bill that is not fair. Remember, we are taking away people's \nmost cherished right, the right of a jury trial. If we are going to do \nthat, we cannot do it in a bill that is not fair.\n  Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle have insisted for \nmonths they will only support a bill that contains\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nfunding with a goal of raising $109 billion over 24 years. But it is \nvery clear from projections of future claims that this funding is \ninadequate to pay fair award values. You cannot have good legislation, \nsuccessful legislation, fair legislation if it is based on a false \npromise. The promise we have to make is, if we are going to take away \nthe rights of a jury trial to these victims, then we have to promise \nthem fair compensation. This bill does not do that.\n\n  On the Judiciary Committee, we reported a bill that contained total \nfunding of $153 billion. But this new partisan bill, introduced less \nthan 2 weeks ago, contains mandatory funding of only $109 billion. All \nof a sudden, we have lost--we have lost--over $40 billion from the \ntotal funding approved by the Judiciary Committee under contingency \nfunding amendments by Senators Feinstein and Kohl.\n  Senator Feinstein--she can speak for herself; she is in the Chamber--\nbut she worked night and day on this issue to get a fair agreement. I \ndo not know the number of times she buttonholed me at the committee or \nelsewhere, and every other Senator on both sides of the aisle, to reach \nan agreement; and she got it. That has been taken out.\n  Look at this chart. Is this fair? We reported a bill, which many \nquestioned whether it had enough money, S. 1125, at $153 billion. Now \nit comes back and it is $109 billion. The first bill, many complained, \ndid not have enough money; the current bill drops $44 billion out.\n  We also know there has to be adequate funding at the beginning of a \nnational trust fund. Why? There are more than 300,000 asbestos claims \nin our current legal system, so you are going to have to have enough \nmoney in there to handle the claims that are going to be there on day 1 \nof this fund. However, this new bill actually provides less upfront \nfunding than the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  It strikes what we passed in the committee, by bipartisan majorities, \na commonsense requirement that directs insurers--who, after all, have \nbillions of dollars sitting today in current asbestos reserves--to \ncontribute their funding within the first 3 years of the fund because \nthat is when most of the claims would come.\n  Another fundamental unfairness in this bill is it provides a \ncorporate bailout for certain companies with serious asbestos \nliability.\n  Take a look at another chart. I ask if this is fair. The present \nvalue of Halliburton's asbestos liability is $4.8 billion. Under this \nbill, they would only pay $75 million a year to a national trust fund. \nThe reason I mention this is Halliburton told their shareholders \nsometime ago they could handle this $4.8 billion, they could handle the \namount of money set aside for their liability. They knew they were \nliable. They knew they would have to pay for it. They could set this \nmoney aside. In fact, when they thought they had a settlement of that \namount, their stock actually went up.\n  But, lo and behold, by the time the Republican majority got the \namount Halliburton would owe--the $4.8 billion--by the time our friends \non the Republican side of the aisle got it, they only have to pay $1.2 \nbillion. They saved $3.6 billion overnight. Not only that, they only \nhad to pay it over 24 years. They are going to make that on the \ninterest on their money. I am not even going to point out how much \nmoney they are making in profits in Iraq at the moment. I will leave \nthat for another day. But they suddenly go from the $4.8 billion that \nbasically they knew they were going to have to pay, and as soon as this \nRepublican bill came up, it is down to $1.2 billion. No wonder \nHalliburton likes some of my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  Let's take W.R. Grace, another good friend of some of my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. W.R. Grace was a company that was \nresponsible for poisoning an entire community. Some of these companies \nonly poison a few hundred or 200 or so of their employees when they \ncome to work. They only poison a few hundred by hiding what they are \ndoing. W.R. Grace goes big time, to quote one of the people they \nsupport.\n  W.R. Grace was responsible for poisoning an entire community, the \nwhole community, whether you worked for them or not. They poisoned the \nwhole community from its asbestos mining facilities in Libby, MT. W.R. \nGrace must love their Republican friends because while they had total \nasbestos liabilities of about $3.1 billion, under this bill they \nsuddenly have to only make payments of $27 million over 24 years, which \nis pocket change for them. Instead of paying the $3.1 billion they are \nliable for today, they will pay only $424 million. No wonder they love \nRepublicans. I mean, this is a walkaway.\n  And the irony is, with a straight face there are those who call this \nthe FAIR Act. I am sure they probably call it the FAIR Act at the board \nof directors of W.R. Grace. I am sure they call it the FAIR Act at the \nboard of Halliburton. But I can tell you, in the families where they \nsee the breadwinner with the oxygen tank suffering, coughing up blood, \nsuffering a horrible death, they don't call it the FAIR Act. They might \ncall it the Halliburton Relief Act. They might call it the W.R. Grace \nRelief Act. They don't call it the FAIR Act.\n  As presently written, the FAIR Act would completely negate all \nlegally binding settlement agreements between asbestos defendants and \nvictims. It would take away their right to the courthouse. Even \nsettlements that have already been partially paid, even those \nsettlements--whether it is W.R. Grace or Halliburton, anybody else--\nwhere they have agreed they are liable, where they have started to make \npayments, all of a sudden comes the FAIR Act, and it is like Christmas \nin April because they can void those agreements even though they have \nbeen making payments.\n  In other words, if a victim agreed to take a settlement over a period \nof time from a defendant in return for dismissing the case, and even \nthough that settlement agreement is an enforceable contract, the \ndefendant, whether it is Halliburton or W.R. Grace or anybody else, \ngets the right to walk away.\n  Victims are actually punished under this legislation for agreeing to \nsettlement terms proposed by asbestos defendants. Is that fair? \nAbsolutely not.\n  In addition, the FAIR Act would retroactively extinguish all pending \nasbestos cases regardless of the stage in the litigation. The asbestos \ncases currently in trial or on the verge of trial would immediately be \nbrought to a halt. Cases with jury verdicts or judgments would end, and \nall appeals would be suspended. Is that fair? No. It is not fair to the \nvictims. It might be fair to W.R. Grace or Halliburton; it is not fair \nto the victims at home coughing out their lungs.\n  The partisan emphasis in this bill on behalf of the interests of the \nindustrial and insurance companies involved, to the detriment of the \nvictims, has predictably produced an imbalanced bill. This bill is a \nreflection of the priorities that went into it. Remember, many of us \nwanted to bring certitude to the companies, to bring fair compensation \nto the victims. Instead, this is totally skewed.\n\n  For us to succeed in reaching the consensus solution we sought for so \nlong, a workable bill should fairly reflect and not discount the \nsignificant benefits that a fair solution would confer on the companies \ninvolved. A trust fund solution would offer these firms reasonable \nfinancial security. Even a casual glance at the way the stock values of \nthese firms have closely tracked the Senate's work on this issue are \nenough to make it crystal clear.\n  I think forcing this new asbestos bill through the Senate would prove \ncounterproductive, even fatal, to the legislative effort. The near \nparty-line vote within the committee on the earlier bill was more of a \nsetback than a step forward. Proceeding further without consensus would \nmake it worse.\n  Many of us have worked very hard. Senator Daschle has worked \nextremely hard. Many of us have worked very hard for more than a year \ntoward the goal of a consensus asbestos bill. This new partisan bill is \nespecially saddening to me, and it is confounding. The obvious question \nthat all of us, including those who brought this new bill to the floor, \nshould be asking is, Does the partisan turn that the sponsors of this \nbill have taken help or hurt our efforts to produce and enact a \nconsensus bill? I think the answer is clear.\n  Instead of writing a bill that will make Halliburton and W.R. Grace \nvery happy with some in this partisan exercise, let's restart our work \nto achieve\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nthe common ground needed to enact a good and fair law. That is the best \nway to move it forward. Remember, we are not legislating as an arm of \nHalliburton or W.R. Grace or a few others. We are legislating for the \ngood of this country. The 100 of us represent 280 million Americans. We \nwant to be fair. Let's represent them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for his \ncomments, most of which--I think all of which I agree with.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized immediately \nfollowing the distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, does the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee know approximately how long he \nmight speak when he does get the floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it would be less than a half hour.\n  Mr. REID. We want to let other people come and speak. So it does not \nmatter how long he speaks, just so we have some general idea. I \nwithdraw the reservation of objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Judiciary Committee \nwho voted for the bill in committee and worked out two amendments that \nare substantial, I regretfully rise to urge my colleagues to vote no on \ncloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. In the course of my \nremarks, what I hope to do is indicate my reasons for opposing cloture \nand make some positive suggestions as to how to close the gap on the \nunresolved issues.\n  There are only two ways to get a bill on asbestos. I say this to \neverybody out there who has a legitimate concern and need for a bill. \nThat is, one, unless the two leaders agree or, two, a bill that goes \nback to the Judiciary Committee and is worked out as a product of that \ncommittee's work.\n  Last July, nearly 9 months ago, the Judiciary Committee passed out a \ncomprehensive asbestos bill. We deliberated and had hearings over \nseveral years.\n  The bill wasn't perfect, but it reflected a substantial step forward \nin crafting a legislative compromise. A few issues were unresolved. \nThey were to be worked out by members in the intervening time. Since \nJuly, labor representatives, defendant companies, insurers, and others \nhave engaged in multilateral negotiations, not only to settle these few \nunresolved issues, but to renegotiate the entire bill.\n  The legislation proposed by Senator Hatch, the distinguished chairman \nof our committee, and Senator Frist, the distinguished majority leader, \nactually sets the debate backward by taking positions directly \ncontradictory to the will of the majority of the Judiciary Committee. \nIt is a substantially different bill that is on the Senate floor today \nthan was the bill that I voted for in committee.\n  I don't believe the bill is ready for the floor and I hope to \ntechnically explain why. In fact, I have written the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee requesting that the bill be returned to committee \nfor future deliberations. We, the Senators serving on that committee, \ndid do our job, and we should be allowed to finish that job and work \nthrough the issues necessary to forge a bill that can pass in this \nbody.\n  Let me explain my concerns. Specifically, the bill Senator Frist \nproposes to bring to the Senate floor eliminates a crucial startup \namendment that guaranteed asbestos victims would continue to have their \nlegal rights until the Trust Fund is fully operational. This was a \nmajor deletion. It will cost the Trust Fund an additional $5 billion.\n  Let me read to you from the CBO letter on that point, which is dated \ntoday and sent to Senator Nickles. ``You''--meaning Senator Nickles--\n``also requested that CBO explain the major differences between our \ncost estimates for S. 1125''--that is the bill that came out of \ncommittee--``and S. 2290''--that is the Hatch-Frist bill on the floor. \n``On March 24, 2004, in a letter to Senator Hatch, CBO updated its \nOctober 2, 2003, cost estimate for S. 1125, principally to reflect new \nprojections about the rate of future inflation, and it assumed a later \nenactment date for the bill. That letter explains that we now estimate \nenactment of S. 1125 at the end of fiscal year 2004 would result in \nclaims payments totaling $123 billion over the lifetime of the asbestos \nfund (about 50 years).''\n  The bill that came out of committee was originally projected to cost \n$108 billion. An amendment I made put in a contingency reserve of $45 \nbillion in case more money was needed. What this CBO letter shows is \nthat money would, in fact, be needed. CBO's projections indicate that a \n$10 billion contingency fund would not be enough to cover the cost. \nThat is major in scope.\n  The bill we are considering today would cost, according to CBO, $17 \nbillion more than the Committee passed bill. Eleven billion of this \nincrease comes from higher awards values.\n  Five billion of that $17 billion increase is due to the elimination \nof my startup amendment. Here is why it costs $5 billion. The startup \namendment guarantees that asbestos victims would continue to have their \nlegal rights until the Trust Fund is operational. In other words, they \ncould go to court until the Trust Fund was fully operational. CBO \nestimates that the Fund would save $5 billion by allowing the private \nsettlement of these claims during this start-up period. That is the \nimplication of eliminating the Feinstein startup amendment made in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Secondly, the Hatch-Frist bill, as I have said, reduces the asbestos \nvictims' trust fund's contingent reserve from $45 billion to $10 \nbillion. The reason for the original $45 billion contingent reserve was \nto ensure the solvency of the Trust Fund if the estimates are wrong. If \nthe reserve is not necessary, it is not used. But if it is necessary, \nit is there. I have already shown you by this CBO letter that it would \nlikely be necessary. CBO predicts that the $108 billion bill we passed \nlast July would actually costs $123 billion because of revised \nprojections. Thus, at the get-go, CBO predicts the Trust would need an \nadditional $15 billion, which is already greater than the $10 billion \nreserve in the new bill. So why pass a bill that, at its beginning, is \nnot going to have adequate funds?\n\n  Thirdly, this bill wipes out final asbestos settlements and trial \ncourt judgments granting victims awards. This was one of the points \nthat was left hanging when we passed it out of committee, and the \nmembers were supposed to get together and solve this. Well, the \nmembers--at least this member--didn't get together. But I gather a \njudge and one member did get together and, up to this point, there is \nno solution. The bill before us simply says to everybody that has a \ntrial court judgment that that judgment is wiped out. That is wrong.\n  This bill also prevents individuals from returning to the tort system \nfor 7 years after the administrator starts processing the claims, even \nif the trust fund goes bust in its first years of operation.\n  In contrast, the bill we passed out of committee said that if there \nis not adequate money, individuals could revert to the tort system at \nany time.\n  Now, I am not going to vote for cloture, but I recognize that 18.8 \nmillion U.S. workers were exposed to asbestos between 1940 and 1979. \nThe best way to look at asbestos is tiny spears, smaller than grains of \nsand, that lodge in your lungs, guts, stomach, and, over a period of \ntime, in your organs. It is bad stuff and it ought to be prohibited. \nThis bill ought to prohibit it, for starters.\n  Our courts are overloaded with claims arising from these exposures. \nIndividuals have brought more than a half million asbestos suits over \nthe last 20 years against 8,400 companies. Approximately 71 companies \nhave filed for bankruptcy due to asbestos lawsuits.\n  Moreover, the current system doesn't ensure compensation for the \nsickest victims. Currently, nonmalignant cases get 65 percent of the \ncompensation awards, compared to 17 percent for mesothelioma, and 18 \npercent for other causes. That is wrong on its face.\n  As this tidal wave of asbestos cases goes forward, serious questions \nremain whether existing victims will ever receive the compensation they \ndeserve. For example, because of the extraordinary influx of claims, \nthe Manville trust is only paying 5 cents on the dollar.\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\n  So I am one who believes we need a comprehensive solution to the \nasbestos crisis so that victims who are truly sick get compensated in a \ntimely and fair manner.\n\n  I recognize negotiations over the asbestos bill have proceeded at a \npace that is satisfying no one, and to advance the debate, I would like \nto ask the Senate to consider the following core proposals, and let me \nmention what they are.\n  The fund must be fiscally prudent. Clearly, it has to have a \ncontingent fund of more than $15 billion. Whether that fund is $20 \nbillion or $25 billion or $30 billion, I think we need to go back in \nthe Judiciary Committee and work the values versus the other provisions \nin the bill. I showed how eliminating my startup amendment cost the \nfund $5 billion. That is not my analysis. That is the CBO analysis.\n  Second, the risk of a delay in the start of a national asbestos trust \nfund should not be borne by asbestos victims. What do I mean by that? I \npointed out the bill eliminates the startup I authored in committee \nthat permitted asbestos claimants to pursue asbestos claims in court \nuntil the administrator of the trust fund certifies the fund is fully \noperational.\n  The reason this amendment is so necessary is to protect the legal \nrights of plaintiffs, and it should be restored. Without it, asbestos \nvictims could be left without any recourse if there is a delay in \nstarting up the fund. Under this bill, they cannot go to court. So if \nthe money is not there right upfront or the money is short upfront, \nthey are out in the cold.\n  The amendment I offered serves as a hammer to get defendant companies \nand insurers to cooperate with the new trust administrator. And for the \nthird time, I point out, it saves $5 billion, according to the CBO.\n  I recognize the concern of some in the industry that asbestos \nclaimants who are not yet ill will use the interim period to press a \nhost of lawsuits against defendant companies. To address this, I would \nlike to propose modifying the Feinstein amendment to allow a 6-month \nstay on asbestos claims upon enactment, except for those claimants \nfacing life-threatening, asbestos-related illness. Thus, the stay would \nonly apply to those who are not ill. I think that is a way out of the \nproblem. For those who are ill, there would be no stay.\n  Thirdly, I would like to suggest if claims exceed projections and the \ntrust runs out of money, plaintiffs should have immediate access to the \ntort system in both State and Federal court. The current proposal on \nthe floor would prevent victims from filing claims for 7 years after \nthe trust starts processing them, even if the trust expires in the \nfirst or second year of operation. We cannot leave victims in this kind \nof legal purgatory.\n  So to address legitimate concerns by defendant companies about forum \nshopping, I would also like to propose plaintiffs who return to court, \nif the trust fund collapses, would only be able to file as a member of \na class or as an individual in State court jurisdictions where they \nwere exposed or where they currently reside. This would handle the \ngreat bulk of forum shopping, if you think about it.\n  Fourth, I would like to suggest award values should have a sliding \nscale in order to reflect the individual circumstances of victims. The \ncurrent asbestos bill applies a one-size-fits-all solution to asbestos \nawards. An 83-year-old asbestos victim without dependents and a 37-\nyear-old single mother with three small children would both receive $1 \nmillion for mesothelioma under the bill, but if we look at the awards \ngiven by asbestos trusts, such as the Western MacArthur trust, \nindividual circumstances are definitely taken into account.\n  For example, mesothelioma victims, under that trust, can receive \nbetween $52,000 and $4 million, with an average value of $524,000 in \nthis particular Western MacArthur trust. This sliding scale brings \nfairness to individual victims' awards. It works in this trust.\n\n  I have talked with the managers of the trust. They believe this half-\na-million-dollar average takes care of the younger victims and balances \nthat in a fair way against older victims.\n  Fifth, award values for the trust should be set in a way that \nprioritizes compensation for the sickest victims whose illnesses can \nclearly be traced to asbestos. This is the hobgoblin of this whole \nthing. All of the companies I have spoken to are concerned the trust \nwill be abused, and it will be abused in this way: that smokers would \nhave access without the defined connection to asbestos. Specifically, I \nthink we should not allow the asbestos trust fund to be overwhelmed by \nsmoking claims. This is a deep and valid concern.\n  In the committee-passed bill--and I want to speak to it--awards in \ncategory 7 of the medical values raise the largest specter of \nuncertainty in terms of smoking claims. This category grants awards to \nsmokers with lung cancer with 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos \nbut no obvious evidence of asbestos disease, such as pleural plaques or \nasbestosis.\n  To prevent these claims from overwhelming the trust resources, I \npropose title VII, smoking cases, revert to the tort system, both State \nand Federal court, if the administrator determines at the year-end \nreview that the incidence rates of those smoking claims will exceed \nprojections by greater than 50 percent.\n  Why do I say that? The tort system historically has been able to \nhandle those cases. So it seems to me if there is a smoking case and it \nshows neither the evidence of asbestos disease, such as pleural plaques \nor asbestosis, let a court make that decision. This would deter smokers \nfrom misusing the trust fund for illnesses caused by smoking rather \nthan asbestos.\n  This is the most difficult part of the bill. In all of the medical \nvalues and all of the hearings and the medical testimony we heard back \nand forth, it is clear there is a difficult line of definition here, \nand that is why the trust fund, which is supposed to be a kind of no-\nfault fund where a medical valuation can be made quickly and \nscientifically, may not always be able to make that valuation.\n  So if the fund is going to be overburdened by smoking cases and the \nadministrator at the end of the year says, Look, we are not going to be \nable to make next year, he can then file in that year-end review with \nthe Congress the request that those cases go to court.\n  We would give him that authority. I believe this is a solution to \nthat problem. I am not wed to it, but to my knowledge it is the only \none that anyone has come up with so far.\n  Six, a fair asbestos bill must exempt from the trust fund final \nsettlements as well as trial court verdicts that compensate victims. \nThe Hatch-Frist bill fails to do this. Specifically, the bill would \noverturn any final settlement that ``requires future performance by any \nparty.'' Thus, if an individual received a $\\1/2\\ million award 5 years \nago to be paid in 10 annual installments, this bill would wipe out the \nlast 5 installments.\n  Of equal concern, the Hatch-Frist bill would wipe out lawsuits unless \nthey were ``no longer subject to any appeal or judicial review before \nthe day of enactment of the act.'' In other words, this bill would \nerase any trial verdict favorable to plaintiffs still on appeal.\n  We should not undermine a litigant's reasonable expectation that he \nor she can pursue a favorable trial court verdict to its conclusion.\n  I am also concerned the bill would overturn the final bankruptcy \nsettlements that have formed the $2.1 billion Western Mac Arthur trust. \nAward recipients of Western Mac Arthur, 90 percent of whom are \nCalifornians, include 8,000 claimants who will be paid hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in a very few weeks. The Mac Arthur trust has also \nset aside funds for 30,000 future claimants. All of this money is taken \nby this bill and put in the national fund. So this final bankruptcy \ntrust is totally wiped out and 8,000 individuals who are going to be \npaid in a matter of weeks lose their settlements. It is just not right.\n  Unlike some other settlements, the Mac Arthur trust places priorities \non the sickest patients. A minimum of 80 percent of the awards paid out \nunder the trust goes to asbestos cancer victims. These awards will be \nbased on historical rates of asbestosis awards in California, which are \nhigher than the rest of the nation.\n  According to attorneys involved with the Mac Arthur trust, almost \nevery present claimant expecting payment\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nunder the Mac Arthur trust will do worse under the Hatch bill than \nunder the trust because of the Hatch bill's requirement that collateral \nsources of compensation be subtracted from any award.\n  Remember, this trust is not the only defendant for many of these \nplaintiffs. Many of the claimants have cases against other defendants \nand those are all wiped out as well.\n  Now, I have policy concerns about wiping out the settlements and the \nfairness, but it is an open question as to whether such a transfer of \nassets is constitutional. Let me speak about that for a moment. Legal \nscholars such as Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren have argued \nthat the bill's expropriation of money from settlement trusts would \nviolate the takings clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits \nthe taking of ``private property . . . for public use, without just \ncompensation.''\n  Specifically, there are a number of individuals with a confirmed \ncourt order allocating money to them who will have these awards taken \naway without receiving comparable compensation from the national trust \nfund. If I have ever heard of a takings case, that is it.\n  Additionally, the Mac Arthur trust, which is an independent legal \nentity in its own right, may have a takings claim if its assets are \ntransferred to a national fund without receiving comparable assets in \nreturn.\n  Renowned legal scholar Laurence Tribe takes an opposing view and \nargues that the conversion of trust assets would be constitutionally \npermissible. The ultimate outcome of this debate is unknown. But it is \nclear that the trustees managing the Fuller-Austin and other asbestos \ntrusts have indicated they will file constitutional challenges against \nthe proposed legislation as soon as it is enacted unless changes are \nmade.\n\n  I will read from a letter dated July 2, 2003, to me from the Fuller-\nAustin asbestos settlement trust:\n\n       Passage of this legislation undoubtedly will set-off a \n     firestorm of litigation challenging its constitutionality. \n     The Trustees' present view is that their mandates under the \n     Fuller-Austin Trust agreement and the Fuller-Austin plan of \n     reorganization would require them to file litigation to \n     challenge the taking of the Trust's assets and the violation \n     of the rights of its claimants. Other existing trusts \n     doubtless will reach the same conclusion. The resulting \n     litigation will likely take years to resolve. In addition, it \n     will take years to establish the claims handling facility \n     mandated by the bill and for that entity to become \n     operational.\n\n  We have $4 billion in this fund from bankruptcy trusts, and $2.1 \nbillion additional dollars from the Western Mac Arthur trust. So that \ntells us something about how this bill is going to start up and whether \nthe money is actually going to be there to pay the people.\n  In this bill, the people lose their right to go to court. It is a \nlittle bit diabolical if one thinks about it for a few minutes. That is \nwhy the startup amendment I offered in committee was so important, \nbecause it said nothing begins until the fund has its money and is \noperational. Therefore, those people had recourse. Once the start-up \namendment was taken out, they had no recourse, and the CBO report says \nthat is a $5 billion cost item right off the top.\n  Now, I offer the principles as a basis for compromise on this \nlegislation. I offer this as one who sat through the hearings and the \nmedical testimony and committee debates and participated in bipartisan \namendments offered on the bill.\n  Thanks to Goldman Sachs, we ran numbers after numbers and Goldman \nSachs has been good enough to run another set of numbers for me. We \nhave changed some of the values to try to meet some of the concerns. I \nhave those numbers with me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Fuller-Austin asbestos settlement \nletter to me dated July 2 be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Fuller-Austin Asbestos\n\n\n                                             Settlement Trust,\n\n                                     Greenville, TX, July 2, 2003.\n      Hon. Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re: S. 1125, The Fairness In Asbestos Injury Resolution Act \n         Of 2003\n        Dear Senator Feinstein: The Fuller-Austin Asbestos \n     Settlement Trust (the ``Fuller-Austin Trust'') was \n     established in December 1998 by order of the United States \n     District Court for the District of Delaware (the ``Court'') \n     in connection with the confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan of \n     reorganization of Fuller-Austin Insulation Company (``Fuller-\n     Austin''). The purpose of the Fuller-Austin Trust is to \n     review and pay allowed asbestos claims of individuals who \n     were exposed to asbestos-containing materials sold, \n     distributed, installed or removed by Fuller-Austin Insulation \n     Company. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, the Fuller-\n     Austin Trust was funded with limited cash and other assets \n     and received the right to the proceeds of insurance policies \n     that covered Fuller-Austin's asbestos liabilities. The \n     purpose of this letter is to express the concerns of the \n     Trustees regarding the application of Senate bill 1125 to the \n     Trust.\n        The Trustees, pursuant to Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy \n     Code, are mandated to provide fair and equitable treatment to \n     all beneficiaries of the Fuller-Austin Trust over the \n     expected claims period, which is anticipated to be the next \n     35 to 40 years. These are beneficiaries who must provide \n     proof of their asbestos-related illness and exposure at one \n     of approximately 360 sites where Fuller-Austin worked from \n     1947 through 1986. There is a finite amount of funding \n     available to the Fuller-Austin Trust to fund its current and \n     anticipated future liability to claimants. The claims \n     procedures for the Trust, as approved by the Court, require \n     the Trustees to make provision for equivalent treatment for \n     present known claimants and the currently unknown claimants \n     who will make claims in the future as their asbestos-related \n     diseases are diagnosed. This requires a careful analysis and \n     balancing by the Trustees to assure the long-term solvency of \n     the Fuller-Austin Trust to meet the anticipated claims. In \n     addition to the trustees, there is a Trust Advisor, whose \n     mandate is to provide advice and consent to the Trustees \n     with respect to issues regarding present, known claimants, \n     and a legal Representative, whose mandate is to provide \n     advice and consent to the Trustees with respect to issues \n     regarding currently unknown claimants, including \n     safeguarding their rights to equivalent treatment.\n       Since 1998, the Trustees have managed the Trust's small \n     base of liquid assets to pay a small percentage of the \n     allowed liquidated value of allowed claims and to cover the \n     cost of insurance coverage litigation to pursue the major \n     asset of the trust--the insurance available to Fuller-Austin \n     to fund its asbestos liabilities. The litigation has been \n     active since 1994. A second phase followed in September 2001, \n     and a jury trial (the final phase) was just completed in May \n     2003. The litigation resulted in (i) settlements with nine \n     insurers for approximately $200 million, some to be paid over \n     the next few years, and (ii) a $188 million jury verdict \n     against the remaining insurers in favor of Fuller-Austin on \n     May 6, 2003. As a result of the settlements, the Trustees \n     have increased the percentage of payments for each \n     established disease value paid to holders of valid asbestos \n     claims. The claims facility that receives, reviews, \n     determines and pays these claims has been fully operational \n     since August 2001.\n       Senate Bill 1125 presents the Trustees with several \n     conflicts. First, the proposed law would take away the cash, \n     property and insurance assets that were dedicated or \n     transferred to the Fuller-Austin Trust pursuant to the \n     Fuller-Austin plan of reorganization confirmed by the Court, \n     undermining the orders of the Court. It would take away the \n     assets in the form of settlements and verdicts the Trustees \n     carefully have fought to muster for the beneficiaries of the \n     Fuller-Austin Trust. The foreign insurers that are now the \n     subject of a jury verdict, will argue that they now escape \n     all liability under the proposed law, avoiding their \n     contractual obligations as affirmed by the verdict of a \n     dedicated jury, who spent more than eleven weeks hearing and \n     deciding the Fuller-Austin case. Fuller-Austin's insurers \n     used and abused the court system for nine years to delay \n     paying their obligations under the policies they issued. The \n     proposed law would reward that behavior. In return, the \n     proposed law cannot provide any assurances when the national \n     fund will be in a position to begin paying claims or what \n     those payments will be, and it cannot provide any assurances \n     that the national fund will be solvent and able to provide \n     equivalent benefits to future claimants when their claims are \n     asserted.\n       Second, passage of this legislation undoubtedly will set-\n     off a firestorm of litigation challenging its \n     constitutionality. The Trustees' present view is that their \n     mandates under the Fuller-Austin Trust agreement and the \n     Fuller-Austin plan of reorganization would require them to \n     file litigation to challenge the taking of the Trust's assets \n     and the violation of the rights of its claimants. Other \n     existing trusts doubtless will reach the same conclusion. The \n     resulting litigation will likely take years to resolve. In \n     addition, it will take years to establish the claims handling \n     facility mandated by the bill and for that entity to become \n     operational. Finally, the limited annual funding provided by \n     the bill will result in the need for years of build-up in the \n     fund before current claim obligations can be paid. In the \n     meantime, the beneficiaries of the Fuller-Austin Trust, many \n     of whom gave up valuable rights in the tort system in \n     exchange for the promised certainty of being paid by the \n     Trust, would not be paid. Many would die before payments \n     began from the federal fund and many more would not have \n     funding for\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\n     much-needed medical care over the next few years. Please \n     remember that most of our beneficiaries are senior \n     citizens, and a delay of a few years could be critical.\n       The Trustees realize that many oppose the bill on a number \n     of grounds, including constitutional challenges and concerns \n     as basic as that the proposed funding levels will be \n     insufficient to pay expected claims over the life of the \n     trust. However, if the Committee decides to approve the bill, \n     the Fuller-Austin Trust urges that existing asbestos trusts \n     be exempted from the legislation or at least given the option \n     not to participate. As a solution to (i) the issue that the \n     proposal would take away the rights of beneficiaries of \n     trusts established by court order under confirmed plans of \n     reorganization and (ii) the funding crisis that would result \n     for many present and future asbestos claimants, we suggest \n     that existing trusts be allowed the option of continuing to \n     function as intended and funded, leaving in place the \n     obligations of the insurers to fund existing policies, \n     settlements and judgments.\n       While we personally have concerns about the constitutional \n     issues, the proposed funding levels for the trust, the \n     medical criteria to be utilized, the award values and the \n     potential windfall to certain insurers, our primary concern \n     is to be able to continue to meet our mandate using funds and \n     assets provided by Fuller-Austin's court-approved plan of \n     reorganization through its fully operational trust and claims \n     processing facility. The Fuller-Austin Trust is currently \n     receiving, reviewing, determining and paying valid asbestos \n     claims that meet the requirements of the procedures \n     established by its plan. Senate Bill 1125 would completely \n     derail this efficient and effective process to the extreme \n     detriment of the beneficiaries of the Fuller-Austin Trust. In \n     an effort to find a global solution to the asbestos \n     litigation problem, pleas do not ignore the workable \n     solutions already confirmed, in place and funded in the form \n     of the existing trusts.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Anne M. Ferrazzi,\n       Trustee.\n     W.D. Hilton, Jr.,\n       Managing Trustee.\n     Mark A. Peterson,\n       Trustee.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I also ask unanimous consent that the CBO report \ndated as of today to Senator Don Nickles also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you requested, CBO has prepared a \n     cost estimate for S. 2290, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2004, as introduced on April 7, 2004. The \n     bill would establish the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution \n     Fund (Asbestos Fund) to provide compensation to individuals \n     whose health has been impaired by exposure to asbestos. The \n     fund would be financed by levying assessments on certain \n     firms. Based on a review of the major provisions of the bill, \n     CBO estimates that enacting S. 2290 would result in direct \n     spending of $71 billion for claims payments over the 2005-\n     2014 period and additional revenues of $57 billion over the \n     same period. Including outlays for administrative costs and \n     investment transactions of the Asbestos Fund, CBO estimates \n     that operations of the fund would increase budget deficits by \n     $13 billion over the 10-year period. The estimated net \n     budgetary impact of the legislation is shown in Table 1.\n       S. 2290 contains both intergovernmental and private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). CBO estimates that the aggregate direct cost of \n     complying with the intergovernmental mandates in S. 2290 \n     would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold \n     ($60 million in 2004, adjusted annually for inflation) \n     established in UMRA. CBO also estimates that the aggregate \n     direct cost of complying with the private-sector mandates in \n     S. 2290 would well exceed the annual threshold established in \n     UMRA ($120 million in 2004 for the private sector, adjusted \n     annually for inflation) during each of the first five years \n     those mandates would be in effect.\n\n                                                     TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 2290\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        By fiscal year, in billions of dollars--\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nClaims and administrative expenditures of the Asbestos Fund:\n    Estimated budget authority................................        *     18.5     12.8     12.9      5.3      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0      4.9\n    Estimated outlays.........................................        *      7.5     10.7     14.6      9.8      7.6      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0\nInvestment transactions of the Asbestos Fund:\n    Estimated budget authority................................      5.4      2.0     -4.8     -3.3        0        0        0        0        0        0\n    Estimated outlays.........................................      5.4      2.0     -4.8     -3.3        0        0        0        0        0        0\nTotal direct spending:\n    Estimated budget authority................................      5.4     20.6      8.0      9.6      5.3      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0      4.9\n    Estimated outlays.........................................      5.4      9.5      5.9     11.3      9.8      7.6      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0\n                                                                   CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nCollected from bankruptcy trusts \\1\\..........................      1.0        0        0      4.6        0        0        0        0        0        0\nCollected from defendant firms................................      3.3      2.8      2.8      2.8      2.7      2.7      2.7      2.7      2.7      2.6\nCollected from insurers.......................................      2.7      7.5      2.2      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total revenues..........................................      7.0     10.3      5.0      9.0      4.4      4.3      4.3      4.3      4.3      4.3\nEstimated net increase or decrease (-) in the deficit from         -1.5     -0.8      1.0      2.3      5.5      3.2      1.0      1.0      0.9      0.8\n changes in revenues and direct spending......................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Cash and financial assets of the bankruptcy trusts have an estimated value of about $5 billion. The federal budget would record the cash value of\n  the noncash assets as revenues when they are liquidated by the fund's administrator to pay claims.\n \nNotes.--Numbers in the table may not add up to totals because of rounding. * = less than $50 million. CBO estimates that by 2014 the Asbestos Fund under\n  S. 2290 would have a cumulative debt of around $15 billion. Borrowed funds would be used during this period to pay claims and would later be repaid\n  from future revenue collections of the fund. We estimate that interest costs over that period would exceed $2.5 billion, and CBO's projections of the\n  fund's balances reflect those costs. However, they are not shown in this table as part of the budgetary impact of S. 2290 because debt service costs\n  incurred by the government are not included in cost estimates for individual pieces of legislation.\n\n     Major provisions\n       Under S. 2290, a fund administrator would manage the \n     collection of federal assessments on certain companies that \n     have made expenditures for asbestos injury litigation prior \n     to enactment of the legislation. Claims by private \n     individuals would be processed and evaluated by the fund and \n     awarded compensation as specified in the bill. The \n     administrator would be authorized to invest surplus funds and \n     to borrow from the Treasury or the public--under certain \n     conditions--to meet cash demands for compensation payments. \n     Finally, the bill contains provisions for ending the fund's \n     operations if revenues are determined to be insufficient to \n     meet its obligations.\n       S. 2290 is similar in many ways to S. 1125. A more detailed \n     discussion of the fund's operations and the basis for CBO's \n     estimates of the cost of compensation under these bills is \n     provided in our cost estimate for S. 1125, the Fairness in \n     Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003, which was transmitted \n     to the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 2, 2003.\n     Budgetary impact after 2014\n       CBO estimates that S. 2290 would require defendant firms, \n     insurance companies, and asbestos bankruptcy trusts to pay a \n     maximum of about $118 billion to the Asbestos Fund over the \n     2005-2031 period. Such collections would be recorded on the \n     budget as revenues.\n       We estimate that, under S. 2290, the fund would face \n     eligible claims totaling about $140 billion over the next 50 \n     years. That projection is based on CBO's estimate of the \n     number of pending and future asbestos claims by type of \n     disease that would be filed with the Asbestos Fund, as \n     presented in our cost estimate for S. 1125. While the \n     projected number of claims remains the same, differences \n     between the two bills result in higher projected claims \n     payments under S. 2290. The composition of those claims and a \n     summary of the resulting costs is displayed in Table 2.\n       Although CBO estimates that the Asbestos Fund would pay \n     more for claims over the 2005-2014 period than it would \n     collect in revenues, we expect that the administrator of the \n     fund could use the borrowing authority authorized by S. 2290 \n     to continue operations for several years after 2014. Within \n     certain limits, the fund's administrator would be authorized \n     to borrow funds to continue to make payments to asbestos \n     claimants, provided that forecasted revenues are sufficient \n     to retire any debt incurred and pay resolved claims. based on \n     our estimate of the bill's likely long-term cost and the \n     revenues likely to be collected from defendant firms, \n     insurance companies, and certain asbestos bankruptcy \n     trust funds, we anticipate that the sunset provisions in \n     section 405(f) would have to be implemented by the \n     Asbestos Fund's administrator before all future claimants \n     are paid. Those provisions would allow the administrator \n     to continue to collect revenues but to stop accepting \n     claims for resolution. In that event, and under certain \n     other conditions, such claimants could pursue asbestos \n     claims in U.S. district courts.\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n\n\n TABLE 2.--SUMMARY OF ESTIMATED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND AWARDS UNDER S. 2290\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Initial 10-year        Life of fund\n                                     period        ---------------------\n                             ----------------------\n                              Number of             Number of   Cost of\n                                claims      Cost      claims     claims\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClaims for malignant             59,000        $36    127,000        $82\n conditions.................\nClaims for nonmalignant         627,000         17  1,230,000         36\n conditions.................\nPending claims..............    300,000         22    300,000         22\n                             -------------------------------------------\n    Total...................    986,000         75  1,657,000        140\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Major differences in the estimated costs of claims under S. \n         1125 and S. 2290\n       You also requested that CBO explain the major differences \n     between our cost estimates for S. 1125 and S. 2290. On March \n     24, 2004, in a letter to Senator Hatch, CBO updated its \n     October 2, 2003, cost estimate for S. 1125, principally to \n     reflect new projections about the rate of future inflation \n     and an assumed later enactment date for the bill. That letter \n     explains that we now estimate enactment of S. 1125 at the end \n     of fiscal year 2004 would result in claims payments totaling \n     $123 billion over the lifetime of the Asbestos Fund (about 50 \n     years).\n       Three factors account for the difference between the \n     estimated cost of claims under S. 1125 and that under S. 2290 \n     (see Table 3):\n       The award values specified in S. 2290 are higher for \n     certain types of diseases. That difference would add about \n     $11 billion to the cost of claims, CBO estimates.\n       Under S. 2290, most asbestos claims could not be settled \n     privately once the bill is enacted. In contrast, under S. \n     1125, asbestos claims could continue to be settled by private \n     parties between the date of enactment and the date when the \n     Asbestos Fund is fully implemented; defendant firms could \n     credit any payments made during that period against required \n     future payments to the fund. Consequently, CBO estimates that \n     the fund created by S. 2290 would face about $5 billion in \n     claims that, under S. 1125, we anticipate would be settled \n     privately.\n       S. 2290 specifies that administrative expenses of the \n     program would be paid from the fund. Under S. 1125, in \n     contrast, administrative costs would be appropriated from the \n     general funds of the Treasury. That difference would increase \n     costs to the fund by about $1 billion over its lifetime.\n       In the limited time available to prepare this estimate, CBO \n     has not evaluated the differences between the two bills in \n     administrative procedures. Under S. 2290, the Asbestos Fund \n     would be operated by the Department of Labor rather than the \n     U.S. Court of Federal Claims. This and other differences \n     between the two bills could affect the cost of \n     administration, the timing and volume of claims reviewed, and \n     the rate of approval for claims payments.\n\n   TABLE 3.--DIFFERENCES IN ESTIMATED CLAIMS AGAINST THE ASBESTOS FUND\n                        UNDER S. 1125 AND S. 2290\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   In\n                                                                billions\n                                                                   of\n                                                                dollars\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated cost of asbestos claims under S. 1125:                     123\n  Added costs due to higher award values under S. 2290.......         11\n  Additional claims not privately settled after enactment              5\n   under S. 2290.............................................\n  Administrative costs under S. 2290 \\1\\.....................          1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total estimated claims against the fund under S. 2290....        140\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Under S. 1125 administrative costs would be appropriated from the\n  general fund of the Treasury.\n\n     Major differences in estimated revenue collections under S. \n         1125 and S. 2290\n       CBO estimates that the Asbestos Fund under S. 2290 would be \n     limited to revenue collections of about $118 billion over its \n     lifetime, including contingent collections. CBO has not \n     estimated the maximum amount of collections that could be \n     obtained under S. 1125, but they could be greater than $118 \n     billion under certain conditions. In our cost estimate for S. \n     1125, we concluded that revenue collections and interest \n     earnings were likely to be sufficient to pay the estimated \n     cost of claims under that bill. That is not the case for S. \n     2290.\n       Over the first 10 years of operations, we estimate that \n     revenue collections under S. 1125 would exceed those under S. \n     2290 by $7 billion. Thus, under S. 2290 we estimate that \n     there would be little interest earnings on surplus funds and \n     that the Asbestos Fund would need to borrow against future \n     revenues to continue to pay claims during the first 10 years \n     of operations.\n     Estimates of the cost of resolving asbestos claims are \n         uncertain\n       Any budgetary projection over a 50-year period must be used \n     cautiously, and as we discussed in our analysis of S. 1125, \n     estimates of the long-term costs of asbestos claims likely to \n     be presented to a new federal fund for resolution are highly \n     uncertain. Available data on illnesses caused by asbestos are \n     of limited value. There is no existing compensation system or \n     fund for asbestos victims that is identical to the system \n     that would be established under S. 1125 or S. 2290 in terms \n     of application procedures and requirements, medical criteria \n     for award determination, and the amount of award values. The \n     costs would depend heavily on how the criteria would be \n     interpreted and implemented. In addition, the scope of the \n     proposed fund under this legislation would be larger than \n     existing (or previous) private or federal compensation \n     systems. In short, it is difficult to predict how the \n     legislation might operate over 50 years until the \n     administrative structure is established and its operations \n     can be studied.\n       One area in which the potential costs are particularly \n     uncertain is the number of applicants who will present \n     evidence sufficient to obtain a compensation award for \n     nonmalignant injuries. CBO estimates that about 15 percent of \n     individuals with nonmalignant medical conditions due to \n     asbestos exposure would qualify for awards under the medical \n     criteria and administrative procedures specified in the \n     legislation. The remaining 85 percent of such individuals \n     would receive payments from the fund to monitor their future \n     medical condition. If that projection were too high or too \n     low by only 5 percentage points, the lifetime cost to the \n     Asbestos Fund could change by $10 billion. Small changes in \n     other assumptions--including such routine variables as the \n     future inflation rate--could also have a significant \n     impact on long-term costs.\n     Intergovernmental and private-sector mandates\n       S. 2290 would impose an intergovernmental mandate that \n     would preempt state laws relating to asbestos claims and \n     prevent state courts from ruling on those cases. In addition, \n     the bill contains private-sector mandates that would:\n       Prohibit individuals from bringing or maintaining a civil \n     action alleging injury due to asbestos exposure;\n       Require defendant companies and certain insurance companies \n     to pay annual assessments to the Asbestos Fund;\n       Require asbestos settlement trusts to transfer their assets \n     to the Asbestos Fund;\n       Prohibit persons from manufacturing, processing, or \n     distributing in commerce certain products containing \n     asbestos; and\n       Prohibit certain health insurers from denying or \n     terminating coverage or altering any terms of coverage of a \n     claimant or beneficiary on account of participating in the \n     bill's medical monitoring program or as a result of \n     information discovered through such medical monitoring.\n       S. 2290 contains one provision that would be both an \n     intergovernmental and private-sector mandate as defined in \n     UMRA. That provision would provide the fund's administrator \n     with the power to subpoena testimony and evidence, which is \n     an enforceable duty.\n       CBO estimates that the aggregate direct cost of complying \n     with the intergovernmental mandates in S. 2290 would be small \n     and would fall well below the annual threshold ($60 million \n     in 2004, adjusted annually for inflation) established in \n     UMRA. CBO also estimates that the aggregate direct cost of \n     complying with the private sector mandates in S. 2290 would \n     well exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA ($120 \n     million in 2004 for the private sector, adjusted annually for \n     inflation) during each of the first five years those mandates \n     would be in effect.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Lanette \n     J.

Where we have made some changes--and I would suggest \nthem--is in the second class, raising the Hatch-Frist values from \n$20,000 to $25,000; in class III, raising the values for asbestosis/\npleural disease B from $85,000 to $100,000; in class VI, other cancers, \ngoing from $150,000 to $200,000; in class VII, giving nonsmokers with \n15 years weighted exposure a range of $225,000 to $650,000--that is \n$50,000 more than in the Hatch-Frist proposal; in class VIII, lung \ncancer with pleural disease, giving nonsmokers a range of $600,000 to \n$1.1 million--a $100,000 increase; in class IX, giving nonsmokers a \nrange of $800,000 to $1.1 million a $100,000 increase; and for \nmesothelioma, the last category, a $1.1 million average award on a \nsliding scale.\n  These numbers have been run by Goldman Sachs. They total $123.6 \nbillion, as opposed to the $114.4 estimated for the Hatch-Frist \nproposal.\n  Because I have not been party directly to any of the discussion, \nregretfully, the only way I can get my views through, it appears, is \nthrough the floor of the Senate. I believe this is much more fair to \nnonsmokers and I believe the methodology of giving the trust \nadministrator the ability that, if nonsmoker cases rise above a certain \npercent in the next year, at the end of the previous year the \nadministrator be given the power to put all of those cases into the \ntort system which will not only act as a deterrent, but will also \nprovide the ability to fund this.\n  One other point I want to make before I yield the floor has to do \nwith the CBO letter. The CBO letter, in addition to the additional $5 \nbillion that removing my startup amendment would cost the fund, also \npoints out the bill on the floor is different from the bill we passed \nout of committee because in the\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nbill we passed out of committee, administrative costs would be \nappropriated from the general funds of the Treasury. That difference \nincreases costs to the fund $1 billion over its lifetime.\n  So those are the reasons why CBO determined that the Hatch-Frist bill \nwill cost $17 billion more than the Committee-passed bill.\n  By way of conclusion, I would very much hope this bill will go back \nto the Judiciary Committee. I very much hope all members of the \nJudiciary Committee would have input into this bill. Or a bill should \nbe negotiated between the two leaders, so it is bipartisan. There is no \nway I see a bill being written in private passing this body. Too many \nof us have put in too much time to try to get a fair solution to let \nthat happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator from Utah yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend the Senator from California for her statement and \ncomments. She has been deeply involved in this effort, as have many of \nus over the last number of months, if not years. She has made a very \ncomprehensive set of suggestions, to which I think our colleagues want \nto pay serious attention. I know my colleague from Utah will. He is a \nfairminded individual who cares deeply about this legislation as well. \nBut I commend her for her comments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. DODD. At an appropriate time, I say to the distinguished chairman \nof the committee, I will ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of the Senator I may have some time, too. I don't know what the \norder is, but is such a request appropriate, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can seek consent.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of the remarks by \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Utah, that \nthe Senator from Connecticut be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to the distinguished Democratic \nleader on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. He made a number of \nstatements I feel need to be corrected. I know he sincerely made them. \nI am not trying to disparage him in any way, but he has made the same \nmistake I think the minority leader made this morning, that only \n$25,000 is given to these people who are heavy smokers, who have no \nsign of asbestosis, no markers, no signs on their X-rays, where we have \n$25,000 to $75,000 for these people, even though in all likelihood \ntheir maladies have come from their smoking.\n  If smoking and asbestos work in concert, together, why don't any of \nthe bankruptcy trusts pay any money for lung cancer claims that do not \npresent any markers or impairment at all? They do not.\n  Here we are giving $25,000 to $75,000 for complaints that get \nabsolutely zero in court. Why are these same claims almost always met \nwith a defense verdict in the tort system? Even the tort system, as out \nof whack as it is, will not give these people money. Yet we do. You \nwould think it was a crime that it is not more. That is typical of the \narguments on the other side. You will never have enough money here to \nsatisfy some on the other side no matter what you do. What we are \ntrying to do is resolve this problem so the country can go forward, so \nthese businesses don't all go belly up, so the jobs are not lost, \npensions are not lost, and so people can get money without paying 60 \npercent of the recoveries to attorneys and for transaction fees.\n  By the time you add the defense attorneys' costs, the plaintiffs' \nattorneys' contingent fees, and the transaction costs, it is 60 percent \nof every dime that is raised in these horrendous court decisions that \nare paying people who are not sick to the exclusion of people who are. \nThis bill solves that problem.\n\n  Isn't it true this bill pays up to $1 million to lung cancer claims \nwhere there is more certainty it was caused by asbestos exposure? The \nfact is, it is true. That is $1 million some of these--a lot of these \npeople will never get under the current tort system. But a lot of \npeople who have never suffered 1 day of impairment in these \njurisdictions I have been talking about will wind up with millions of \nundeserved dollars because this system is out of whack.\n  I am getting a little sick and tired of hearing my colleagues blast \nHalliburton. There is only one reason they do that. That is because, \neven though he has nothing to do with it, even though he has long been \ngone from it, even though everything he has had to do with it has been \nfinalized and closed, the Vice President used to work for Halliburton. \nIt gets old. I mean it is cheap shots, there is no question about it. \nFrankly, let me say I have to respond to the dubious argument that \nHalliburton is gaining a windfall by this fund. Anybody who believes \nthat should call them and ask how they feel about this fund. The truth \nis they may actually be better off by not having this legislation.\n  Even some personal injury lawyers involved in the settlement with \nHalliburton believe that is the case, that they are better off not \nbeing part of raising the $124 billion.\n  The truth has not stopped some of my colleagues from making \nexaggerated statements about this bill. I suppose it is no surprise \nthat when they get the chance to take a shot, truthful or not, at their \nfavorite whipping boy, they are not going to pass it up. That is what \nthey do--as if all big businesses are bad and all big businesses screw \ntheir employees and all big businesses are out to hurt the economy.\n  Let me state for the record how this bill compares to the Halliburton \nsettlement. The conditional settlement reached with the plaintiffs' \nlawyers is just over $4 billion. There is a conditional settlement that \nHalliburton entered into that is a little over $4 billion. Only $2.7 \nbillion of that amount is cash. Of this $2.7 billion, about $2.3 \nbillion may be recovered by Halliburton from insurers. The remaining \namount of the settlement, about $1.3 billion, involves issuing shares \nof stock. If the legislation is adopted, it seems likely the stock \nvalue will increase so that any dilution of stock values in the short \nrun will be offset by medium- and long-term capital gains. So the \nactual cost to Halliburton is not the $4 billion they throw in, which \nsome of my colleagues claim.\n  We understand the firm believes recoveries from insurers in issuing \nnew stock--two elements that those who argue this is a bailout always \nneglect to mention--will act together to create an actual out-of-pocket \nliability to the firm of less than $1 billion.\n  How does their fund liability compare? As a tier 1 company in this \nbill, under the fund they would pay $86.5 million per year. The total \nnominal value of their liability under the fund would be just short of \n$2 billion. This is a bailout? It is a lot more than they would have to \npay under their settlement. I hesitate to even say this in the Senate \nbecause if I were with Halliburton, I would take care of the \nsettlement, the heck with this. But it would take some real effective \nmoney away from this trust fund. Halliburton is not the only one.\n  Again, it appears some of my colleagues are not interested in hearing \ndetails such as these. They would rather confuse the facts and do \nanything they can to make sure the personal injury lawyers who support \nthem do not lose out on their more than $60 billion of projected fees--\njust from asbestos litigation--if this bill is not passed.\n  No wonder they can afford to run these stupid ads all over America, \nacting as if they are fighting for little individual people. Give me a \nbreak. The fact is, everybody in this body knows there is a tremendous \nrip-off of a lot of people who have suffered from mesothelioma and \nother related asbestos diseases who are not going to get anything, or \nwill get relatively nothing, if this bill does not pass.\n  Now, we are faced today with a historic opportunity to right a \nserious wrong being committed against victims of asbestos exposure, as \nwell as the thousands of companies and individuals who stand to lose \nout in terms of potential bankruptcies, loss of jobs, loss of pensions, \nunder today's downright irrational system of compensation under our \ncurrent tort system.\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\n  For more than 20 years, our compensation of legitimate asbestos \nvictims has been unacceptably diminished and delayed. It has become \nquite evident to the Judiciary Committee that tens of thousands of true \nasbestos victims, including their families, are faced with agonizing \npain and suffering, with uncertain prospects of any meaningful recovery \nin the existing tort system.\n  These inequitable results are particularly troubling when viewed \nagainst the reality that large dose exposures to asbestos, associated \nwith asbestos-related diseases, ended in the 1970s. That is when they \nended. Asbestosis is considered by many as a ``disappearing disease.'' \nThese victims are left with little to nothing because, among other \nthings, precious resources are being diverted toward the defense and \npayment of a massive influx of asbestos claims brought largely by a \ngroup of overzealous personal injury lawyers on behalf of these many \nunimpaired plaintiffs, people who have never suffered from anything to \ndo with asbestos.\n  Cardozo law school professor, Lester Brickman, found that more than \n80 percent of claims made in recent years and 90 percent at present do \nnot involve a medically recognizable injury. You wonder what is going \non. That would not happen but for courts that literally are not abiding \nby the law, where judges are bought by trial lawyers, and where they \nare totally plaintiffs oriented and the jurors come from areas where it \nis not their money, so they will put up any amount of money for people \nwho are not even injured.\n  In other words, a great majority of asbestos lawsuits today are \nbrought by those who are not even sick. These claimants show lung \nconditions similar to the general population, including that of \nindividuals with absolutely no asbestos exposure at all.\n  To put the asbestos litigation problem in perspective, I will share \nthe story of Mary Lou Keener, the daughter of an asbestos victim, who \nhas spoken out in support of this legislation. Mary Lou knows all too \nwell how the current asbestos crises has failed some of our Nation's \ntrue patriots, our veterans.\n  Mary Lou Keener's father served in the engine rooms of the USS \nMayrant, Lindsey, and Columbus in World War II in the Pacific. Both the \nMayrant and Lindsey suffered serious damage from enemy attacks. Mary \nLou's father had the dangerous assignment of helping to bring these \ncrippled ships back to port, spending months fighting to keep them \nafloat, and beginning massive repair work while they were still at sea. \nHe then spent months at the shipyard helping to finish the repairs.\n  What Mary Lou's father did not know was that the countless hours \nspent in the engine rooms and boilers would cost him his life. The same \nis true of thousands of veterans like him. These ships, like almost \nevery vessel in our fleet at the time, contained massive amounts of \nasbestos. Every moment he spent working to return these ships to \nbattle, breathing the contaminated dust and debris, worsened his \ncondition and guaranteed that he would never ever be able to recover.\n  Not surprisingly, he developed mesothelioma, ultimately succumbing to \nthis horrible, painful, and deadly disease on--guess what--Veterans \nDay, 2001.\n  Mary Lou's father was more fortunate in one way than many veterans: \nHe had a daughter, a truly exceptional woman who is a nurse, a lawyer, \nand a Navy Vietnam veteran. She is also a member of the Veterans Rights \nCommission.\n  When she learned of her dad's condition, she rushed to help him and \nher mother navigate the complicated maze of regulatory and legal \nsystems that he faced. Unwilling to take no for an answer, Mary Lou \npushed to have him examined at the National Cancer Institute, part of \nthe National Institutes of Health. It was there that Mary Lou's father \nreceived the definitive diagnosis that he suffered from mesothelioma. \nMary Lou made sure he received the best treatment available from \nexperts throughout the country.\n  After his death, Mary Lou helped her mother fight through the \nregulatory requirement to obtain dependent indemnity compensation from \nthe Federal Department of Veterans Affairs for a service-connected \ndeath. She helped her mother find an asbestos plaintiffs law firm to \nfile a tort and wrongful death claim. Now, despite Mary Lou's efforts, \nher father's lawsuit, even with a resourceful and tenacious advocate \nlike his daughter, has been languishing in the courts for over 18 \nmonths.\n\n  As most veterans learn, there are few viable defendants left who are \nresponsible for supplying asbestos to the Navy. Mary Lou's mother \nreceived three checks from defendant companies, but they are all \nbankrupt and the amounts are very tiny. She can only cling to the hope \nthat there may be other viable defendants, but the reality is that far \ntoo many veterans will go uncompensated under the current tort system.\n  Perhaps this is why Mary Lou Keener spoke out in support of S. 2290, \nstating:\n\n       The courts are clogged with asbestos cases, and even if [my \n     mother] finally has her day in court, the law firm will \n     collect almost half of any jury award. That's why passage of \n     [the FAIR Act] is so important. The Trust Fund solution to \n     this problem envisioned by [the FAIR Act] will bring much \n     needed compensation to veterans suffering from asbestos \n     related diseases and end the vagaries and lengthy delays of \n     the current/tort wrongful death systems.\n\n  Last year, Mary's mother received a call from her attorney. \nUnfortunately, it was not about her husband's case. Instead, she was \ntold she should consider contacting her Senators immediately and ask \nthem to vote against the asbestos legislation. Needless to say, she \ndeclined that request. She understands that for veterans like her \nhusband, while the status quo might benefit a handful of personal \ninjury lawyers, it completely fails the one group that should be given \nthe ultimate priority; that is, the asbestos victims.\n  Now, let me refer to this chart: What is wrong with asbestos \nlitigation? This is for the Navy veteran I have been talking about with \nmesothelioma. Under the tort system, he gets nothing. Under the FAIR \nAct, each of them gets $1 million. I have to say, no amount of money \nwill compensate people for what they have gone through, but that is so \nmuch more than any of them are ever going to get without this bill.\n  Now, as I say, unfortunately, the asbestos litigation problem reaches \nbeyond our veterans and into the lives of everyday, hard-working \nAmericans who are victimized by asbestos and the very system designed \nto vindicate their rights. One matter I find particularly troubling is \nthe case of Huber v. Taylor. That is a class action lawsuit currently \npending in the Western District of Pennsylvania. The suit was filed by \n2,644 plaintiffs in asbestos personal injury suits against the personal \ninjury lawyers who represented them. The suit charges that the lawyers \ntreated their clients as mere inventory, distributing only a few \nthousand dollars to each plaintiff for their injuries, while retaining \ntens of millions of dollars in attorneys' fees.\n  Now, I bring this case to the Chamber's attention because it \nunderscores the severity of the asbestos litigation crisis and why it \nis imperative we, as a legislative body, must now act to address this \nproblem.\n  Ronald Huber spent 35 years as a steelworker, inhaling asbestos \nfibers while working on the job. In 1995, he joined a class action \nagainst nearly 200 companies that made or distributed asbestos or \nasbestos-containing products. Although that class action settled for \napproximately $140 million, Mr. Huber has not seen a single penny from \nthis award. How much did Mr. Huber's lawyers walk away with? They \nreceived $56 million.\n  Look at this chart: What is wrong with asbestos litigation? Huber v. \nTaylor. The trial lawyers got $56 million; asbestos victims basically \nnothing. Think about it. That is right, the lawyers received $56 \nmillion and the asbestos victims received nothing.\n  In response to this severe injustice, Mr. Huber and over 2,000 of his \nfellow class members filed a lawsuit on February 7, 2002, in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the \npersonal injury lawyers who represented them in the first action. As of \ntoday, the court is still hearing arguments on various motions.\n  The complaint charges the defendants with breach of fiduciary duty; \nfailure to disclose the identity and nature of the actions they had \njoined; false representation to deprive the plaintiffs of funds \nbelonging to the plaintiffs;\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nfailure to exercise the degree of competence and diligence exercised by \nlawyers in similar circumstances; and misrepresentation of material \nfacts. The plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\n  All of the plaintiffs to this action are described as ``hard-working \nunion members in blue-collar trades.'' All of them were exposed to \nasbestos during their working years. All, to a large extent, have \nlittle knowledge or experience in the legal system. All state they were \n``recruited'' by plaintiffs' law firms for inclusion in ``mass \nactions,'' and all say their lawyers told them nothing about the \nlawsuits in which they were involved.\n  Their complaint arises from what they call the ``corruption of the \npersonal injury bar.'' The lawsuit states that, as early as the early \n1980s, the prosecution of asbestos personal injury claims had evolved \ninto an industry and the lawyers who were prominent in that industry \nhad accumulated a vast amount of wealth. To quote the complaint:\n\n       The promise of such wealth drew additional plaintiffs' \n     lawyers into the field, and this resulted in more and more \n     aggressive efforts to recruit asbestos personal injury \n     plaintiffs.\n\n  I think it is a sad state of affairs when asbestos victims have to \nsue their own lawyers to receive compensation for their injuries. We \ncannot allow the current, broken system to continue in this manner. It \ndeprives victims of a meaningful remedy and diminishes public \nconfidence in our civil justice system.\n  I think we have to do something now to ensure there are no more \nRobert Hubers who are left with no recourse other than to sue their own \nlawyers.\n  We must also act now to ensure that the tireless efforts of everyday \nAmericans such as Mary Lou Kenner are not taken in vain. These are two \nof just thousands and thousands of people.\n  It is because of these problems that I urge my colleagues to support \nS. 2290. Under this bill, victims will receive prompt and certain \ncompensation through a privately funded trust administered by the \nDepartment of Labor. Moving existing claims to the fund will \nsignificantly cut out the exorbitant transaction costs inherent in our \ntort system--especially given the no-fault nature of the new system \nbeing proposed.\n  In today's tort system, victims bear the heavy burden of proving that \na specific product caused their illness. They must show culpability \nthrough causation and connect the dots that lead to the ultimate \ndefendant. Unfortunately, few victims today are capable of producing \nsufficient evidence to show their illnesses were caused by a particular \ncompany's products. In fact, because of the long latency period \nassociated with these asbestos-related diseases, the quality of \nevidence will inevitably degrade over time where memories fade and \ndocuments get lost. Thus, for the scores of victims who do not have an \nironclad case against any one defendant, a no-fault system is an \nextremely important component when crafting a solution to the asbestos \nproblem.\n  Now, to illustrate my point, I would like to share the story of \nsiblings Paul and Suzanne Verret. After being diagnosed with plural \nmesothelioma, both brought suit against four defendants, each a \npotentially responsible party under tort law. But after hearing \nevidence presented by the defense, a Texas jury ruled, just last month, \nthat the Verrets' conditions were not caused by any of the four \ndefendants who were likely to have been the result of exposure to \nasbestos from a Johns Manville factory in the neighborhood.\n  Asbestos tailings from the plant have been used for driveways and \nparking lots in the neighborhood where the Verrets grew up. Johns \nManville, however, is now bankrupt and its asbestos trust is paying \npennies on the dollar on all claims. As a result of the jury's verdict, \nthe Verrets are unlikely to recover any compensation for their \ninjuries, but under S. 2290 they stand to recover $1 million each in \ncompensation.\n  Now, look at these Texas mesothelioma victims, Paul and Suzanne \nVerret. Under the current tort system, as shown on the chart on the \nleft, victims hire lawyers and sue defendants. After years of trial \nprocesses and delays, victims are unable to prove causation. They use \ntrial lawyers and collect zero. But under this bill, S. 2290, with the \ntrust fund--if enacted--each of these people will collect $1 million in \ncompensation.\n\n  By the way, unless they are lucky enough to get a lawyer who is going \nto forum shop for them into a jurisdiction where the judges are \nbasically in the pockets of the plaintiffs' lawyers, the personal \ninjury lawyers, they might get something that way, but there are going \nto be very few who get that, and most of those people are not going to \nbe ill. They are not going to have suffered and not going to be able to \nprove their case in other courts of law in the country. It is pathetic.\n  Naturally, there are some great lawyers who do what is right here. I \ndo not mean to find fault with them. I find fault with these phonies \nwho use forum shopping jurisdictions and really what I consider to be \ncorrupt judges and, in many cases, corrupt juries, to obtain humongous \nverdicts for people who are not even sick, taking the moneys away from \nthose who are sick, which this bill would solve.\n  In the coming days, we will be engaged in a historic debate regarding \nthe asbestos litigation crisis facing this country. The outcome of this \ndebate will have very real consequences on the victims of asbestos and \ntheir families. These victims are counting on us, their elected \nSenators, to do the right thing and address the problems in our tort \nsystem that is badly broken by asbestos litigation.\n  I have to say, when you folks out there see these phony ads about how \nthis bill is bad and the tort system is good, those ads are paid for by \nthese attorneys who have already taken $20 billion in fees away from \nvictims, and will take another $40 billion more, for a total of $60 \nbillion, out of their pockets. It is easy to see why they do not want \nthis bill. It is a gravy train they do not want to stop.\n  They certainly don't want it to be stopped by this bill, which is \nwhere the gravy train would end for lawyers and recoveries that are \nworthy will begin for victims.\n  Let me say, although the stakes in this debate are high, the risk of \nnot acting or allowing a broken system to remain broken is even more \nconsequential. We at the very least owe it to people such as Mary Lou \nKenner and Ronald Huber to make this bill the pending business of the \nSenate. We really need to do that.\n  Let me tell you one more story about the impact of the current \nasbestos system on American business. The reach of the personal injury \nlawyers--I am talking about the dishonest ones--and their web of \nabusive litigation practices appears to have no limit. At last count \nthese personal injury lawyers have cast their asbestos net to include \nsome 8,400 defendant companies representing virtually every industrial \nsector of the U.S. economy.\n  Approximately 70 companies, 35 since the year 2000 alone, have now \nbeen driven into bankruptcy as a result of asbestos litigation. \nDisturbingly, most of these companies that now find themselves named as \ndefendants in asbestos cases had little or nothing to do with the \nmanufacture, sale, or distribution of asbestos or asbestos-containing \nproducts. Under the ``deep pocket'' theory of law now commonly \nsubscribed to by many personal injury lawyers, liability is not based \non culpability; instead, it is based on the nearest available pot of \nmoney.\n  What is more, an estimated 90 percent of the claims now being filed \nare on behalf of persons with no discernable illness, many of whom were \nrecruited by for-profit, mass- screening operations being sponsored by \nenterprising trial lawyers.\n  I would like to talk about a company that has facilities in my home \nState of Utah. Philadelphia-based Crown Cork & Seal is representative \nof all too many of the businesses that have found themselves targeted \nby the personal injury lawyers over asbestos.\n  In 1963, Crown Cork & Seal, a consumer products packager in the can \nand bottle cap business, purchased, for $7 million, the stock of Mundet \nCork Company, a New Jersey-based firm that made cork-lined bottle caps \nand insulation that contained asbestos. Because Crown was only \ninterested in the bottle-cap business, Mundet sold its insulation \ndivision approximately 90 days after the purchase of its stock by \nCrown. Thereafter, Mundet, consisting\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nonly of its bottle cap business, was merged into Crown.\n  Crown never operated Mundet's insulation business, nor had it ever \nintended to operate its insulation business. Crown was only interested \nin acquiring Mundet's bottle-cap assets; no Mundet insulation managers \never worked for Crown, and no Mundet stockholders ever had any \nownership interest in Crown.\n  The trial lawyers have made Crown Cork & Seal pay dearly for the 90 \ndays it owned the insulation division of Mundet. To date, Crown has had \nto pay out over $400 million in asbestos claims. To give this some \ncontext, that is over 57 times what Crown paid for Mundet in 1963. In \nfiscal year 2003 alone, Crown paid over $200 million in asbestos-\nrelated costs, of which only $25 million--or 12.5 percent--went to real \nvictims of asbestos-related diseases, and that is what is going on.\n  It is a rip-off. That is what is going on. That is what our \ncolleagues are arguing for. It is a rip-off. Why? Some say it is \nbecause these personal injury lawyers are going to put up $50 million \nor $100 million for their nominee for President. I hope that is not \ntrue, but it is all too evident that that probably is.\n  Here are these victims who should not have been able to sue Crown \nCork & Seal to begin with. Crown Cork paid over $200 million in \nasbestos-related costs last year alone, and the victims got $25 million \nout of $200-plus million or 12.5 percent. All the rest went to lawyers, \nclaimants who were not ill, and other costs.\n  Look at this Crown Cork & Seal chart. What is wrong with asbestos \nlitigation? Crown Cork & Seal: $25 million out of $200 million total. \nOf the more than $200 million paid by Crown Cork & Seal in 2003, \nactually only $25 million went to individuals impaired with asbestos-\nrelated illnesses. Where did the $175 million go? It is a rip-off. That \nis what is happening.\n  This bill will stop that. It is an expensive bill for the companies \ninvolved. They are going to have to pay for 27 years and pay through \nthe nose. Many of them are in the same position as Crown Cork. They \nshould never have had to pay a dime to begin with. The story of Crown \nCork & Seal is just one of thousands of examples why we cannot put off \nfixing this problem any longer. Our current system is one that does not \nserve businesses and their employees whose livelihoods depend on them. \nOur current system surely has not served the victims of asbestos.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the FAIR Act, to vote \nfor cloture so that we can stop this obstructionist filibuster being \nled by some of my Democratic colleagues. Think about it. They are \nfilibustering a motion to proceed to this bill so we can debate the \nbill itself, filibustering it so we cannot add amendments to the bill. \nIf they have good amendments, bring them up. We will listen to them and \nhopefully pass them, if they are good. If they are not, they might get \nthem passed anyway. The point is, let's at least allow the Senate to \nwork its will. Let's not stop even a motion to proceed this bill.\n  I would like to respond to claims that were made earlier today that \nthe Hatch-Frist-Miller bill is not fair to pending plaintiffs. This \nbill preempts and supersedes those claims pending in the tort system \ntoday, including verdicts that are still subject to appeal or judicial \nreview. Preemption of such claims assures an end to a broken tort \nsystem that everyone agrees is slow, unwieldy, and fundamentally unfair \nto asbestos victims.\n  The opponents' solution to their concern that the FAIR Act is unfair \nfor pending plaintiffs is to keep the tort system open for pending \nclaims. These critics are asking Congress to perpetuate the very \nproblem this bill is seeking to rectify; that is, a broken system that \nis failing victims by misallocating resources away from the truly sick, \nwhere such victims receive too little because so much is going to the \nunimpaired and to attorneys who take most of the money.\n  We all know the statistics. The vast majority of the claims being \nfiled today, as high as 90 percent, are by individuals with little or \nno current functional impairment. Let me tell you how this translates \ninto real money. Using the values cited by the minority views in the \nreport of the Judiciary Committee on S. 1125 for unimpaired claimants, \nit is $40,000 to $125,000. Allowing pending claims to continue could \ndirect anywhere from $10.8 billion to $33.8 billion or more to \nunimpaired claimants.\n\n  How many of these claims are based on mass screenings? It has been \nestimated that the abuse of mass screenings has resulted in $28.5 \nbillion having been paid for meritless claims. That is almost $30 \nbillion that has gone to people who don't really have claims. This \ncompletely undermines the consensus public policy decision to redirect \nthese funds to those who are truly sick from asbestos exposure and the \nwhole purpose of this asbestos legislation.\n  The bipartisan medical criteria argument forged in the Judiciary \nCommittee recognizes unimpaired claimants should be monitored but \nshould not be paid for illnesses they have not and may never develop. \nBut we will pay for monitoring.\n  Opponents of the bill who seek to perpetuate the tort system would \nalso preserve the exorbitant attorney's fees associated with such \nclaims. As much as 40 to 50 percent of awards go to the personal injury \nplaintiffs' lawyers fees and costs. Indeed, while we debate the bill, \npersonal injury attorneys likely will file a large number of claims in \nthe tort system, most of which undoubtedly will be for unimpaired \nclaimants which would be allowed to continue if these opponents have \ntheir way. The rest, probably another 10 percent, goes to the defendant \nattorneys who have to defend these companies, many of which should not \nhave any liability at all.\n  There is no justification for allowing personal injury lawyers to \ncontinue to siphon significant resources out of the system when these \nresources could be dedicated to compensating those who are truly sick \nfrom asbestos exposure. The intent of the FAIR Act is to fix a system \nthat everyone agrees is badly broken and in desperate need of repair.\n  John Hyatt, the counsel for the AFL-CIO who testified before the \nJudiciary Committee in 2002, described the tort system as having ``high \ntransaction costs, inequitable allocation of compensation among \nvictims, delays in payment to victims, and a general climate of \nuncertainty that is damaging business far more than it is compensating \nvictims.'' That is the counsel for the AFL-CIO. I have often heard \nDemocratic colleagues make similar statements perpetuating the tort \nsystem, claims that undermine the bill, saying that would be better or \nmore ``fair'' treatment than they would get under the FAIR Act. \n``Fair'' has to be in quotes in that manner.\n\n  In fact, the Hatch-Frist-Miller bill provides relief to current \npending claims. Any claimant who has filed a lawsuit in any State would \nbe eligible for prompt compensation from the fund provided they meet \nthe eligibility criteria set forth in the bill. These criteria are \nquite wrong. We should not treat plaintiffs in court as second class \ncitizens. Cases filed in the tort system take years to process, and \nthere is no guarantee that even with the trial date, a case will \nproceed. Cases in New York City given trial dates in 2002 have yet to \ngo to trial. Even then, in most jurisdictions, cases that actually have \nbeen tried are often appealed, and years pass before the case is \nformally resolved. In the interim, plaintiffs are without relief, and \nmoney is being spent on lawyers, with no relief. There is no reason to \nleave this type of system in place. Moreover, the mere fact that a case \nis filed is no guarantee it will proceed. Claimants' cases proceed \nsometimes based on how many slots the trial has for your lawyer, where \nthe cases were filed, what defendants are left, and other vagaries \ncompletely out of a claimant's control. That day will stop with the \npassage of this bill, which now provides expedited payments to anyone \nwho can demonstrate a hardship, who has been diagnosed--anybody who can \ndemonstrate a hardship or who has been diagnosed with mesothelioma or \nwith another asbestos-related disease who has less than a year to live \nor can otherwise establish a circumstance requiring accelerated \npayment. The money is there now, when it is needed, and it can be paid \nout quickly to help these families. This bill also fixes the judicial \nsystem, unclogs the courts, allowing these judges to deal with other \nmatters, not\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nasbestos cases in the wings waiting for court time that is precious \nand, at this point, unavailable.\n  There is no need or benefit to leave these cases which have been \nclogging the courts pending in the courts. These cases are the very \nreason we are seeking to fix a broken system. There is no evidence the \ncourts can or will handle them properly and not prejudice the litigants \nwaiting their turn. Creating a two-track process is likewise unfair to \nvictims and defendants. Despite all the rhetoric from opponents to the \nbill, when compared to what the current tort system will provide, \nlegitimately ill claimants will fare much better under this FAIR Act.\n  We will have victims who get immediate relief through the fund, while \nthose with litigation pending must wait and hope for a court date and \nthen hope the company responsible is still solvent and can afford the \ncost. What will we say to them when we have left a system that we agree \nis broken, and they are sitting in court for years? Great care has been \nmade to ensure that the compensation program would be processing and \npaying claims soon after the date of enactment. There are no assurances \nthat plaintiffs would have claims resolved in the tort system within \nthis same amount of time. Indeed, experienced staffs say they are \nlikely to continue to sit in court even longer.\n  Furthermore, awards in the tort system are disparate and depend \nlargely on where the claim was filed, what judge is presiding, rather \nthan the severity of the illness. In other words, it is a phony system.\n\n  Professor Laurence Tribe described the system as resembling a \nlottery, noting: Some victims receive astronomical awards, while others \nreceive little or nothing. Quite a few severely injured victims die \nbefore their cases could can be heard. Plaintiffs point to the larger \nawards in some cases and cannot be denied, so some have been able to \nwin in this lottery system, or win the lottery. These awards, however, \nare the exception and reserved for the few claimants who can survive \nthrough a long and hard trial, as well as appeals, often taking many \nyears to see any moneys at all. Then they will find that about 60 \npercent of the moneys are gone anyway.\n  The plaintiffs bar doesn't point to the majority of claims receiving \nsignificantly less money for more severe claims or even up to 40 \npercent taken out for attorneys' fees. As a stark example, a 2001 \nasbestos verdict awarded Mississippi plaintiffs $25 million each, where \nnone of the plaintiffs claim prior medical expenses or absences from \nwork due to any related illness with the case of a cancer victim who \nunderwent a lung removal operation. This cancer victim grudgingly \nagreed to join a class action suit against an asbestos company. He \nnever lived to see the outcome of the case, and after 7 months his \nestate was awarded a mere $3,000. The others didn't even have injuries.\n  Substantial judicial proceeds dating back to the early 20th century \nsupports the constitutionality of Congress' authority to preempt tort \nclaims when it believes it is in the public interest. It is clearly in \nthe public interest, and especially in the interest of asbestos \nvictims, that Congress used the full extent of its powers to preempt \nthe current asbestos litigation system.\n  Finally, Mr. President, allowing personal injury lawyers and the \nunimpaired to continue to drain resources out of the system and away \nfrom those who deserve the resources would not only be unfair to the \ntruly ill, it is likewise unfair to defendants who ask them to pay into \na no-fault system, give up some of their insurance company, and still \nexpose them to the litigation lottery. We cannot expect the defendants \nto bear the costs and risks if it fails the judicial process. This \nsystem will continue to take 60 percent of every dollar and waste it on \nlawyers' experts and administrative costs.\n  The Hatch-Frist-Miller bill will stop the litigation lottery in its \ntracks and instead replace it with a fair administrative process that \ntreats all participants fairly and consistently.\n  I want to respond to a few statements made by my friend and colleague \nfrom South Dakota earlier this morning regarding S. 2290, the Fairness \nin Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2004.\n  Senator Daschle stated there was no reversion to the tort system. In \nfact, there is reversion to the tort system. It is one of the \nconcessions we made. Should the fund become insolvent, then claimants \nwith asbestos injuries who have not received compensation under the \nfund may pursue their claims in the courts. The statement that there is \nno reversion is simply wrong. I want to correct the record.\n  Senator Sarbanes stated that we ``sprung'' the bill on the Democratic \nSenators and their staffs. Senator Daschle called attention to the \ntotal fund value. For the record, Senator Daschle's staff was informed \nof the new numbers last October. That was 6 months ago. Since October, \nthere have been repeated and continuing discussions of these numbers \nover the ensuing months. We repeatedly asked the Democrats for a \nresponse to the numbers. We have received absolutely none. We \nrepeatedly asked the Democrats for a legislative proposal--some \nlanguage, an outline, a concept of a structure, something, anything. We \nreceived nothing.\n  As Senator Daschle knows, this so-called new bill that we allegedly \n``sprung'' on him includes the very numbers we released months ago, the \nchanges demanded by the Democrats, and the changes demanded by the \nunions. We have had 8 months of serious negotiations. I don't think it \nis justified for anybody to say they have been kept out of the process, \nwe have not tried to accommodate them about these matters.\n  Mr. President, I have one more comment that I would like to make to \nsenator Daschle's statements this morning. He stated that a lung cancer \nvictim with 15 years of exposure would receive only $25,000 in \ncompensation. He painted an incomplete picture which I would like to \nfinish. First, that figure is the bottom of the range of compensation. \nUnder the claims values in FAIR Act, claimants who were exposed to \nasbestos and still smoking will receive between $25,000 to $75,000 in \ncompensation. And for the record, Senators Leahy and Kennedy have \nstated that they want $50,000 for claimants falling into this category. \nMr. President, I have come here to discuss the FAIR Act. We have a \nchance to help those who have suffered from asbestos-related injuries \nfor far too long. Many people have spent many months getting us to this \npoint and I want to ensure that we have a complete picture of the bill \nfor the record. We owe at least that much to those victims.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chaffee). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by, first of all, commending my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee. I am not a member of this \ndistinguished committee. I had the good fortune of serving on the \nJudiciary Committee in the other body years ago, in the House of \nRepresentatives. I have great respect for my colleagues who serve on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in either body because they deal with \nsome of the most contentious issues before the American public.\n  It is not easy to be the chairman of that committee, regardless of \nwhich party is in the majority in the Senate. I have the utmost respect \nfor my friend from Utah. He and I have spent many years serving in this \nbody together. There have been countless pieces of legislation that we \nhave worked on together that are the law of the land today. I have \ngreat admiration for him.\n  He is a legislator. I say that because there seems to be a shrinking \nnumber of legislators around here regardless of party affiliation. He \nis a legislator. That means someone who is willing to sit down and work \nout issues. I wish to begin by thanking and commending him for his \nefforts on this difficult subject matter, asbestos. This is an area in \nwhich I have had a longstanding interest, as many of my colleagues \nknow, going back a number of years. This issue is of critical \nimportance to my State of Conneticut, because it is the home of \nnumerous small and large manufacturers, as well as several major \ninsurance companies. They have a strong interest in the outcome of a \nresolution of this very perplexing problem of asbestos litigation and \nrelated issues.\n  I have a strong interest in trying to come up with a solution for, \nfirst and\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nforemost, victims of asbestos exposure. It is estimated that more than \n27 million people who have been exposed to asbestos over the years.\n  Regrettably, we know there are many who will die prematurely because \nof their exposure to this product. In fact, last year alone, 10,000 \npeople in this country died as a result of their exposure to asbestos. \nThe numbers are truly staggering. We know there are over 600,000 past \nand pending cases involving over 6,000 businesses, that have been cited \nas defendants in these cases. And we know there are going to be \nliterally millions of people who are going to suffer.\n  So we must attempt to provide a better answer than the present system \nwhich has clogged up our courts, which has denied too many victims--\nseriously impaired victims--of the kind of compensation they deserve. I \nhave had a longstanding interest in trying to come up with a solution. \nWe have gotten very close to such a solution.\n  Let me begin by reporting on the progress that has been made. There \nis a tendency to only discuss the areas where there is still \ndisagreement, and I think that only tells part of the story. People \nsuch as Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, have worked tirelessly on this \nissue. The majority leader, Senator Frist, and the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle and their staffs have also spent a great deal of time \non this legislation. Senator Daschle has always kept his door open, and \nrepeatedly tried to see if we could proceed with a meaningful \nnegotiation process. Such a process must occur in order to bring the \nvarious parties together around a resolution of this issue.\n  There are many others who have been critically involved in this \nissue. We heard from Senator Feinstein earlier and other members of the \nJudiciary Committee. Senator Nelson from Nebraska has also worked hard \non this issue. Senator Carper has also worked on this issue. There are \nmany others who care about this issue and have spent a great deal of \ntime on it. Senator Specter has been performing an invaluable service \nin trying to work out the administrative structure of the proposed \ncompensation fund. I am sure I am leaving some of my colleagues out, \nand I apologize for that, knowing, as I do, that almost every State, \nwithout exception, is affected by this lingering question. When there \nare over 600,000 total cases, every State and Senator is affected.\n  Seventy companies have already declared bankruptcy on this issue \nalone because of the judgments that have come in against them.\n  As a result of those 70 bankruptcies, over 70,000 jobs have been lost \nfrom these companies. This is a major economic problem, as well as a \nmajor health issue that needs and demands resolution.\n\n  The good news is this: There are about five or six major issues \ninvolved in the question of whether we can establish a bona fide trust \nthat would allow for fair and equitable compensation to those who have \nbeen determined to suffer from diseases related to exposure of \nasbestos. The five or six major issues are the following:\n  One, can we establish medical criteria which would make it possible \nto determine who has been exposed and to what extent have they been \nadversely affected as a result of that exposure. I thought that issue \nwould never get resolved. This has not been an easy task. Can you \nimagine trying to bring doctors together with organized labor, \nmanufacturers, and insurance companies, all sitting down and agreeing \non what the medical criteria for this legislation should be? I am \npleased to announce that months ago we were actually able to reach an \nagreement on the medical criteria. Amazingly, the issue of medical \ncriteria has been resolved.\n  The second issue is whether we could create an administrative system \nto process and review claims. This is also not an easy undertaking. \nThanks to Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and thanks to his \nconstituent, Judge Becker, and, by the way, the involvement of a number \nof our Senate colleagues under the auspices of Senator Specter's \nleadership--we have reached an agreement in this area we think is going \nto work.\n  Creating an administrative system is a major accomplishment. Many \npeople thought we would never be able to resolve this issue. On two of \nthe major five or six issues, we have already achieved results. But it \ntook weeks to work out the details behind these agreements.\n  An asbestos compensation trust fund idea is complex. It is very \ncomplex. When we envision a trust fund that might have to last for 30 \nyears or more, that must deal with thousands and thousands of cases of \npeople who have been exposed to asbestos, it is a serious undertaking. \nEvery comma, every period, every semicolon can and does mean something. \nSo we have to be very careful in how we draft this legislation.\n  We have hundreds of manufacturers who have been, and continue to be \naffected by what we are doing. There are major insurance companies that \nclearly must be involved and will contribute to a trust fund, as the \nmanufacturers will be. Organized labor, representing the hundreds of \nthousands of victims, must ensure that a trust fund is going to have \nadequate funding, and that monetary awards are fair and efficiently \nprovided.\n  We have seen the consequences of the current system. In fact, in the \nJohns-Manville trust resolution, the trust that was established under \nthe name of that particular company, is a example of the problems with \nthe current system. They believed that the amount of money initially \nplaced put into that trust was going to more than adequately provide \nfor the victims who have been exposed under the Manville situation. As \nit turns out today, the Manville trust is only paying about 5 percent \nof the compensation victims should be receiving.\n  It went very wrong, not because the people who put it together \nplanned it that way, but nevertheless that is what happened. No one I \nknow of wants that to happen here, but it makes my point that this is a \ncomplex issue. And that getting this right is very important. We must \nbe sure that this solution is going to work well. So it takes a little \ntime--and in my opinion, it is time well spent.\n  I do not know why at this very hour we have this legislation before \nus. It is not ripe yet. It has not matured enough yet. There are still \nhuge issues outstanding.\n  Obviously, one of the major open issues is the overall dollar \namounts. I know it sounds like a lot of money--and there is a lot of \nmoney at stake here. But when we start talking about 25 or 30 years of \na trust fund's existence, the difference is somewhere around $115 \nbillion and $155 billion, give or take a billion here and there. As \nSenator Everett Dirksen said: A billion here and a billion there and \npretty soon you are talking about real money. This is real money. We \nare not talking about hundreds of billions of dollars difference. We \nare talking $20 to $30 billion or so over 30 years, spread among a \nlarge number a defendant companies and insurers who face greater losses \nand greater uncertainty under the current system.\n  It seems to me if we get actuaries together, and agree at the \nuniverse of potential claimants, and provide them fair compensation, we \nshould be able to come up with a neutral number to satisfy the needs of \nexpected claimants.\n  We have changed approaches from where we started at the outset of \nthis debate. We initially tried to create a bill that was \n``evergreen,'' that is, that it would be the complete solution to this \nproblem for as far as the eye could see in the future. However, we \nbegan to realize the difficulties of creating a fund that lasts \nforever. Several factors caused us significant uncertainty. For \nexample, we still import asbestos in this country. There is still \nasbestos being used, or at least people are being exposed to it even \nthough we now know the problems that result from exposure. So the idea \nthat we are going to have a final number in perpetuity, I think, was \nabandoned by all sides.\n\n  We have contended that this number is somewhere between $115 billion \nand $155 billion. If that does not end up being right at the end of the \nday, then we ought to resort back to the present tort system to solve \nthe problem.\n  I just heard my colleague from Utah say his bill includes that \nprovision. With all due respect, I must disagree with my friend from \nUtah because the provision in the bill being offered by the Senator \nfrom Utah and the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, has a 7-\nyear gap between when the trust fund may run out of money and\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nwhen the tort system could be used by a victim.\n  Now, that is hardly reassuring to the victims and their families that \nthe system that presently is in place which provides them some \nfinancial relief will be taken off of the table in the event that the \ntrust fund becomes insolvent.\n  Let me quickly point out as well, that these numbers of 115 or 155--\nif one takes the high end or the low end, are hardly unreasonable. The \nRand Corporation, which is hardly an organization that identifies \nideologically with the left or right or Democrats or Republicans, has \nestimated that the cost of the current problem is somewhere around $300 \nbillion. So at the outset we are talking about a trust of only $155 \nbillion.\n  While we disagree over actual dollar amounts at this point, I believe \nthat people of good will, sitting down, can come to an honest \ncompromise that would satisfy all parties involved in this debate.\n  Another open issue is the value of the claims themselves. If we are \nable to reach agreement on the medical criteria and able to reach \nagreement on an administrative system, it seems to me, again, that good \npeople who care about this should be able to resolve this issue and \nprovide fair compensation to victims of asbestos.\n  Another outstanding issue that needs resolution is what to do with \npending claims. There are some claims that have been adjudicated. Some \nare completely adjudicated, others are only in the discovery process. I \ndo not want to get too technical legally, but I think most people would \nunderstand there are some cases that are already mature in the judicial \nsystem. Determining at what point in the judicial process, should cases \nbe abrogated and claimants directed into the trust fund is a difficult \nquestion. When is the judicial process allowed to be completed where \nthose claims exist? I do not have an answer for that one today, but, \nagain, I think people of good will who care about this issue and \nrealize what a huge problem this is could come to some thoughtful, \nreasonable compromise on how to deal with pending claims.\n  That is not the complete universe of all the problems, but those are \nthe major ones. Two of them we have solved. Three or four of them \ndeserve additional time and effort to resolve. Certainly the intent of \nthe amendments adopted in Committee by Senators Feinstein and Biden \nthat addresses pending claims and returning back to the tort system in \nthe event of insolvency are ideas that should be reconsidered and \nadapted. There may be others ideas that are also helpful.\n  The point is there are people making suggestions to resolve these \nquestions. I do not understand why this body is being asked to make a \ndefinitive decision on this bill that none of us have seen because it \nwas introduced only 2 or 3 days before the last senatorial recess. We \nare being asked to accept voting on cloture on this matter on Wednesday \nor Thursday of this week. I might point out that last November or early \nDecember we reached an agreement, a compromise, on how to proceed to \nthe class action issue. I happened to be one of those involved in that \nnegotiation. Why do we not bring up that bill? That bill is ripe and \nready to go, not that many of my colleagues would support it. But for \nthose of us who are willing to support a class action reform bill, we \nreached an agreement on that 4 or 5 months ago, and yet that bill is \nnot being brought up. Why not? That bill is ready to go. This bill is \nnot ready to go.\n\n  Why are we taking 3 days in a very abbreviated session of the Senate, \nwhen we do not have much time remaining, some 30 days, to bring up a \nmatter where there is so much disagreement that could be resolved if we \nwould spend the time doing it as Senator Specter has done, as Senator \nDaschle has done, and as Senator Leahy has done? I know Senator Hatch \nand his staff have also worked tirelessly on this topic.\n  Legislating on a matter like this is hard work. It is labor \nintensive. Any one of my colleagues, Republican or Democrat, who has \nbeen in the Senate for any length of time will say that on major \nlegislation, particularly legislation that is precedent setting such as \nthis is, people are required to roll up their sleeves and put in a \ntremendous amount of hours to resolve these matters. In my view, it \ncannot be done thoughtfully or carefully by engaging in open-ended \nfloor debate with amendments flying around that no one really knows the \nimplications of, some of which are passed 51 to 49, others defeated 51 \nto 49. When we are dealing with something as serious as this, where \nliterally thousands and thousands of lives depend upon receiving \nadequate compensation, we know we are dealing with a very complex \nproblem.\n  I urge that a cloture motion not be filed. I know one has not yet \nbeen filed, and my strong appeal to the majority leader would be please \ndo not file this cloture motion. There is still time. This is only \nApril. I presume we are going to be here until sometime in early \nOctober. Give us the chance, insist upon people meeting and trying to \nresolve these issues. It may come down that a few of these matters are \nnot resolvable through negotiation, and the only way to resolve them is \nby having some floor votes on them. I accept that may be the final \ndetermination. But we ought not to jump to that when there still is an \nopportunity to resolve some of these outstanding questions.\n  I have spoken to organized labor, John Sweeney, and his \nrepresentatives. They want a bill. It is their membership, many of \nthem, who suffer from the exposure to asbestos. It is their membership \nthat is losing jobs in companies that are declaring bankruptcy. They \nwant a bill, but they want to make sure when they have a bill that the \nresources will be there to provide adequate compensation.\n  By and large, the insurance industry, with some exceptions, wants a \nbill because they realize that the current system is flawed and could \ncause untold economic hardships on some of these companies. It could \ncause some of them to collapse, and I am not exaggerating when I say \nthat. They are very interested in getting a bill. I know the \noverwhelming majority of manufacturers, those that were either involved \nin the production or use of asbestos over the years, in most cases \nbefore anyone knew of the great harms caused by this product, they want \na bill.\n  This is one of those unique situations where all of the parties, all \nof them, and including, I might add, many of the trial lawyers involved \nin this area, understand some different resolution of this issue is \nneeded other than the present tort system. Obviously, that is not the \nview of everyone who is a trial lawyer, but many of them have already \nspoken out on this issue.\n  So we have a unique political environment where the major \nparticipants are anxious to get a bill. I rarely find that. Normally \none finds people highly divided where labor or business is at complete \nopposite ends of the spectrum on a matter that is before us. Here, \nnearly all stakeholders want a bill. Instead of sitting down and \nkeeping people at the table and working it out, we are prematurely \nbringing up something causing this bill likely to fail, and fall before \nwe have an opportunity to resolve the differences. As I said a moment \nago, why not bring up class action? Why not bring that up? That is \nready to go. Where is the business community that has said to me over \nand over again: Why don't we get a class action bill here? We have been \nready since November and December. Here it is April and nothing has \nhappened on class action. Yet you bring up and consume 3 days of time \non the floor of the Senate with a bill that everyone knows, if you \ninvoke cloture or file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed, it is \ngoing to fail. And it should fail. It should fail. I say that with deep \nregret.\n\n  I have committed the time of staff members and my own time over the \nlast number of years on this issue. I think to come this close to \nresolving a major issue affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of \npeople and their families and attempt to address it in a premature \nfashion is a huge mistake.\n  So my appeal to my colleagues is: Sit back and work this out. It is \nhard, but it can be done. And, if we get near the end of the session \nand we have not been able to resolve everything, either wait until we \nget back in January or bring it up and leave a smaller number of issues \nout on the floor to be resolved\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nby votes on the floor and healthy debate. But don't jam this now, \nparticularly when we know the outcome, taking up the valuable time of \nthis body on the floor where the time can be better used to take up \nissues where there has been agreement, at least agreement by a \nsignificant majority of us to move forward on the legislation. That has \nbeen done now on class action.\n  Why doesn't the majority leader come over and move to proceed to that \nbill so we can vote on it? We have been ready for that now, as I said, \nsince 3 or 4 or 5 months ago. There has been no action at all. No \naction. Why not? Why is that bill not on the floor right now, being \ndebated and discussed?\n  Of course we have seen the same thing with medical malpractice. There \nis no effort to negotiate it out. There is a proposal on the Democratic \nside. It is different from what the majority has proposed, but not that \ndifferent. You could bring those two sides together and resolve the \nissue. Doctors deserve better than they are getting. They are being \ntold the Democrats are stopping everything. Why is it the majority \nrefuses to even sit down and try to work out the differences?\n  I stand ready. My staff does. Again, I am not a member of the \ncommittee. Obviously, Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, as I mentioned \nearlier, have done a tremendous amount of work on this and deserve a \ngreat deal of credit for trying their best at this.\n  The leader on this side, politically, is Senator Daschle. I have been \nwith him on numerous occasions when we met with the manufacturers, met \nwith the insurance industry. As Senator Daschle has said over and over \nagain, his door has been open to do whatever it takes to try to get a \nbill done. I know from personal knowledge he has offered on numerous \noccasions to meet with the majority leader and others to try to figure \nthese things out.\n  I mentioned Senator Specter already. Senator Biden, obviously, \nSenator Feinstein, and a number of others have been involved in this, \ntrying to get this done. My hope is that the majority leader will not \nwait until Thursday. Listen to us over here. We can get this done. It \ncould be a proud moment of this Senate's session, to have actually come \nup with an answer to a major problem in this country. We are getting \nvery close to resolving it. It will take a little more work, in my \nview, over the next coming weeks, but it could be done.\n  My plea this afternoon would be that filing a cloture motion on the \nmotion to proceed would be withheld, that we bring up other matters \nthat are ripe and ready to go forward, and send the people back to work \non this bill and let's see if we cannot draft a piece of legislation of \nwhich America can be proud.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                JOBS Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, right before we had our break we were asked, \nSenator Daschle and I, to see what we could do to move the FSC bill \nalong. The majority has affixed the name the jobs and opportunity bill, \nor something like that.\n  We have always known the importance of this legislation, and we did \nour very best to move this along. It was held up initially because we \nwanted a vote on overtime. The majority, for reasons I fully don't \nunderstand, refused to allow us to have a vote on this.\n  As the Chair will recall, this amendment passed previously. What our \namendment would do is say the President does not have the right to take \naway the ability of American nurses, firemen, police, and a total of 8 \nmillion people, from getting overtime. In effect, what we have been \ntold by the administration is they were going to promulgate a rule that \nwould take away overtime pay for people who make more than $22,000 a \nyear.\n  We wanted a vote on this. You can't do that. It passed once; it was \nstricken in a Republican-only conference. The House passed a resolution \nsaying they wanted their conferees to do the same thing the Senate did \nand stop the President from doing this.\n  We have been told by the majority--the distinguished majority leader \nhas come out here on a number of occasions and said this is a must-pass \nbill. American businesses are getting hurt. So Senator Daschle and I \nworked for the better part of a day calling individual Members. We had \n75 amendments. We worked to get them cut down. We not only cut down the \namendments to 18, but we have time agreements on these amendments, as \nlittle as 5 minutes on some of the amendments. We clearly could have \nfinished all of these amendments in 1 day. All of them wouldn't require \nvotes but, if they did, we would be willing to put in an extra-long \nday. Therefore, we, through our Democratic leader, went to the \nRepublican leader and said, Here is what we have. Some of these \namendments, quite frankly, would not require votes and some would not \neven be offered. So we wait one night, come back to the majority and \nsay, We are willing to do this deal. We know this is an important bill, \nthat tariffs are being applied against American manufacturers and other \nbusiness people; what is the problem?\n\n  To make a long story short, we were told the majority had 50 \namendments with no time limits on them whatever.\n  The FSC bill is not going forward not because of anything we have \ndone. It is because this Congress, I am sorry to say, using the Harry \nTruman term, is a do-nothing Congress. We do not do anything. If we \nhave to work past 5 or 6 o'clock at night, that is not a good idea. We \ncannot even consider coming in and voting at noon on Monday. To think \nwe could vote past 9 or 10 o'clock on Friday, even on a bad day, is out \nof the question. We usually vote Tuesday afternoon and finish the votes \nas early on Thursday as we can. This is not a good way to accomplish \nthings. That is why this Congress is doing nothing.\n  I don't want another word ever said about the FSC bill not going \nforward because of the Democrats. We want to go forward. We have done \neverything we can to move this forward. We have wasted on this piece of \nlegislation many days of legislative business when we could be working \non things that need to be done in addition to that.\n  Gasoline prices in Nevada have increased 46 cents a gallon since the \nbeginning of the year, almost 50 cents a gallon. I have not checked \ntoday. They may be up another 4 cents. Since the first of the year the \nprices in Nevada have gone up 46 cents per gallon.\n  I talked to a contractor who is the largest contractor, he says, in \nnorthern Nevada, the Reno area. Diesel fuel prices for his company are \ncosting his company $7,500 a day in addition to what he was paying at \nthe first of the year. This is in addition to the mess we have with \nsteel prices. This is a tremendous burden.\n  There is no doubt the price of crude oil has contributed to higher \nprices in Nevada and throughout the country. However, the outrageous \n46-cent-a-gallon increase in Nevada since January is not driven by \ncrude oil but corporate greed and profit.\n  We are used to it in Nevada because during the Enron debacle we were \ntold it was supply and demand. It had nothing to do with supply and \ndemand. It had everything to do with Enron reaping windfall profits. \nEnron told consumers it was a matter of supply and demand. But it \nturned out Enron was manipulating the supply of electricity.\n  In Nevada we get all of our gasoline from California refineries, so \nany problem with the supply in California is a problem for Nevada. This \nis a lot of talk about the tight California gasoline market, where \nprices are typically 20 to 30 cents above the national average. We hear \nabout the law of supply and demand all the time driving prices higher.\n  One thing I know for certain about the law of supply and demand with \nthe Enron situation, is that it cost the Nevada ratepayers nearly $1 \nbillion during the electricity crisis almost 3 years ago. Based on this \nbitter experience which is still being litigated in the courts, I was \nconcerned Nevadans might be getting ripped off again when gasoline \nprices went through the roof early this year. I asked the Federal Trade \nCommission to investigate these wild price increases, particularly with \nan eye toward any possible manipulation of gasoline markets. After 5\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nweeks, the FTC responded by saying prices in Nevada were ``unusually \nhigh'' and above predicted norms. An informal FTC investigation is \nstill looking into the cause of the price hike.\n  There are spikes FTC says they cannot understand. They are having a \nhard time showing collusion or market manipulation, but they know \nsomething is wrong. As they said, the usually high prices are above \npredicted norms.\n\n  I don't need an investigation to tell me big oil profits have soared \nat the expense of working families. These markets are not competitive \nwhen a handful of companies can decide what price they are willing to \nsell for and what price a consumer is forced to pay.\n  As a nation, we need to address both the supply and demand side of \nthe energy equation to promote a truly competitive market. On the \ndemand side, we have to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and \npromote public transit. Maybe that is wishful thinking. On the supply \nside, we can increase the use of alternative fuels and renewable \nenergy.\n  In the short term, we have to increase supply. We can do that, in my \nopinion, by having the President at this time, when the Saudis and \nothers are turning off the spigots and making the supply less--we can \nincrease supply by pulling oil from our petroleum reserves. We need to \ndo that. President Clinton did it. The first President Bush did it.\n  In the long term, we have to do something with alternative energy. We \nhave to. It is important. I was encouraged before the recess when the \nenergy tax incentives were added to the FSC bill, which I just talked \nabout. I applaud Senators Grassley and Baucus for the excellent \nprovision dealing with section 45 production tax credit for renewable \nenergy resources that expands and extends the credit for wind, \ngeothermal, solar, and biomass energy. We must harness the brilliance \nof the sun, the force of the wind, and the heat within the Earth. By \nusing the bountiful resources to diversify our energy supply, we \nprotect the air we breathe and we protect consumers from these wild \nprice swings.\n  We cannot lose sight of the fact renewable energy will make our \nNation more secure because it is made in the United States of America. \nI was disappointed to learn we will put off consideration of the FSC \nbill, even though we have agreed to the finite list of amendments.\n  The other thing the President can do on a short-term basis is have \nthe Saudis provide more oil. We are told in Woodward's book he has a \ndeal to do this in the fall. Move it up, make the deal a little \nearlier.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is time for us to bring the asbestos \nbill to a floor vote and to bring it to discussion so we can continue \nthe progress that needs to be made on this important bill. As I said \nearlier this morning, every day we do not act is a day victims are not \nreceiving appropriate compensation for what they need and deserve.\n  The bill we put forward provides a reasonable solution to the \nasbestos litigation crisis and has numerous consensus-building changes \nthat have been added to the underlying bill, many made at the request \nof Democrats and representatives of organized labor.\n  What has emerged is a collective effort to date on a proposal that \ncomes from the original S. 1125 and has critical modifications that \nhave been added on the counsel of stakeholders. As I said this morning, \nthere will be a lot of constructive proposals put on the table through \nthe amendment process from Senators on both sides of the aisle to \nfurther refine and improve this bill.\n  I encourage this process. We have had numerous discussions throughout \nthe day, solidly since this morning. I have had the opportunity to talk \nto the Democratic leader on several occasions discussing both options \nand how we can best bring this bill to appropriate closure. We will \ncontinue these conversations over the course of this evening and \ntomorrow. A lot of stakeholders are at the table discussing issues that \nare very important.\n  Reference has been made to Judge Becker on numerous occasions and \nover the course of the day and in the statements this morning, and of \nthe mutual respect both sides of the aisle have of the work he has done \nto date. I would like to continue those discussions tonight and \ntomorrow to see if there is some way we and the Democratic leadership \ncan put a process in order where we can help mediate some of the \ndifferences we all know exist.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say we need more time, \nand I respect that. In truth, we have made real progress, and we are \ngetting real focus on a very important bill. We have been discussing \nand negotiating and changing and working on this bill for over a year \nnow, and I believe all our colleagues are coming to the table in \nearnest at this point.\n  We are going to be filing a cloture motion. The cloture vote will \ngive everyone an opportunity to put their views on the record as we go \nforward and continue to work on this bill.\n  Again, every day we do not reach an agreement on this bill is another \nday victims of asbestos litigation malfunction are suffering. \nTherefore, I believe working together we are going to be able to bring \nresolution.\n  Having said that, we will be filing a cloture motion.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. President, I now send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 472, S. 2290, a bill to create a fair \n     and efficient system to resolve claims of victims for bodily \n     injury caused by asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Orrin Hatch, Gordon Smith, Lamar Alexander, \n           Saxby Chambliss, Ted Stevens, Michael B. Enzi, Trent \n           Lott, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Susan M. Collins, Pete \n           Domenici, Rick Santorum, Jon Kyl, George Allen, George \n           Voinovich, John Ensign, Wayne Allard.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will continue discussions tonight and \ntomorrow. We will talk with the Democratic leadership as we go forward \nover the next several days. I am very hopeful we are going to work out \na suitable and appropriate process to address these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been listening to the discussions \ntoday on asbestos litigation, and there have been some provocative \nstatements made on both sides. This is a very important issue. I have \nto say I have some sympathy for the businesses. But the sympathy I have \nfor the businesses is overwhelmed by what I have seen in the personal \nsuffering of the people who have been injured, some of whom are dead. \nWe do not know how many thousands will die this year. Estimates are \nprobably 10,000 from asbestos.\n  We still import thousands of pounds of this poison into our country. \nSo I hope all the people who have good intentions--I know they all do--\ntalking about this asbestos reform will, first of all, understand Judge \nBecker, whom I have never met, is not a Senator. It is nice he has \nagreed to come in and work on these proposals, but Judge Becker is not \na Senator, I repeat. He is not a member of the staff. I do not know who \nhe is meeting with, why he is meeting with them. There are a lot of \njudges in America, retired judges. It so happens this one is from \nPennsylvania. There are retired judges in other places who have the \nsame expertise he has.\n  I listened to Senator Hatch speak today. I listened to Senator Leahy \nspeak today. We cannot write an asbestos bill in the Senate. We cannot \nwrite it outside here in some office building downtown. The only way I \nwill ever feel comfortable about legislation dealing with asbestos is \nif it goes through\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nthe channels it is supposed to go through: the Judiciary Committee.\n  We have men and women on the Judiciary Committee, both from the \nmajority and the minority, who have spent years working on this issue. \nThey are certified experts. They not only understand litigation, they \nunderstand legislation.\n\n  So I hope everyone understands it is good people who are interested \nin this legislation do everything they can to weigh in on this issue, \nbut I hope we all look to the Judiciary Committee to come to us with a \nproduct. It cannot come out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee that I work on. It cannot come out of the Appropriations \nCommittee. It cannot come out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. It \ncannot come out of any other committee. It has to come out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  But we have people who have worked on this issue--not only the two \nleading members of the committee; that is, the ranking member and the \nchairman--but also people on that committee who have listened to hours \nand hours and days of testimony. Maybe they should listen to some more. \nBut this is legislation we are talking about that is going to have a \nprice tag on it from $150 billion--I should say, the figure in this \nbill is a very ridiculously low figure of $109 billion, to maybe as \nmuch as $700 billion or $800 billion, maybe $1 trillion. So this is not \nsomething we need to rush into.\n  We need to help victims of asbestosis, mesothelioma. I would hope we \nwould do as the State of Illinois has done, have some type of pleural \nregistry so people who have worked around asbestos and are afraid they \nare going to get sick would be able to go on to that registry so the \nstatute of limitations is not tolled.\n  In short, the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over this \nlegislation, and this is from where the legislation should come that we \ndeal with on the floor, not some retired judge, or not a Senator who \nfeels he knows more about it than others. I am not pinpointing any \nSenator. I am saying there are a lot of people who think they have an \ninterest in this issue. Everyone has an interest in this issue. All 100 \nSenators care greatly about this issue. Some feel more strongly about \nthe businesses than I do; others feel for the victims.\n  But I would hope we do not try to rush into this and do something \nthat is written here or downtown someplace; that whatever we do, \nwhatever suggestions, whatever people feel will improve our ability to \npass this legislation, they will work through Senators Hatch and Leahy \nand have the full committee vote on what we do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I did not hear all the Senator from Nevada \nhad to say about this subject. I have listened to some of the \npresentations this afternoon. I want to make a couple of comments about \nthe asbestos issue and then I want to talk about a couple of other \nunrelated matters.\n  First, on the asbestos issue, I am one of those Senators who has in \nthe past year or year and a half written letters to my colleagues, to \nSenator Frist and to Senator Daschle, in support of efforts to find a \nnegotiated solution.\n  On July 31 of last year, I sent a letter to our joint leadership \nurging that we reach a bipartisan compromise on the issue of asbestos. \nThat letter was signed by a number of other colleagues: Senators \nMiller, Breaux, Ben Nelson, Baucus, Carper, Kohl, Lincoln, Levin, and \nStabenow.\n  In late October, I sent another letter to Senators Frist and Daschle \nurging that we seize the moment and pass an asbestos bill, but \nrecognizing that in order to do that, there needs to be serious \nnegotiation. All of the stakeholders--and there are big stakeholders on \nthis matter--need to come together to resolve the issues in a way that \nreflects a true compromise.\n  There are a couple of things that are necessary to say at this point. \nOne, I believe there is an urgency to deal with this issue. The failure \nto deal with it causes great economic uncertainty for companies and for \nour economy. The failure to deal with it means there are some who are \nsick as a result of having contact with asbestos during their lifetime \nand who will not be compensated. There are others who are not sick who \nwill receive compensation. There are lawyers in the middle of some of \nthese suits who will receive a disproportionate percentage of awards. I \ndon't think this system works at all. The system is broken.\n  For that reason, I believe it is in the interest of everyone for us \nto have legislation in the Senate that can truly reflect a bipartisan \ncompromise. But the bill before us now is not such legislation.\n  I was surprised, frankly, the week before last, just before the \nSenate took a 1-week break, to read statements made on the floor of the \nSenate. I shall not ascribe them to any particular colleague, but those \nwho want to know can look in the Record.\n  One of the colleagues who brought this bill to the Senate floor \nsuggested that the asbestos negotiations were being blocked because the \npersonal injury bar would not otherwise put up $50 million for John \nKerry in the election. This colleague of mine said that such a \nsuggestion, if true, was ``pathetic.'' Well, these words are an affront \nto all those colleagues on my side of the aisle who have been working \nvery hard to get a good asbestos bill through the Senate this year. And \nthese words are hardly appropriate from someone bringing a bill to the \nSenate floor, for which he seeks bipartisan support.\n  This is not a serious proposal. We understand that. Senator Specter, \nwho I think has done much of the serious work in the Senate trying to \nbring people together and reach a compromise, does not support this \nproposal. Let me read what Senator Specter said, again a Member of the \nmajority party:\n\n       I decline to join with Senator Frist and Senator Hatch in \n     their substitute bill because I think it is the better \n     practice to try to work through these problems.\n\n  I completely agree with Senator Specter. I think the approach to have \ntaken on this would have been for Senator Frist to have engaged with \nSenator Daschle and have all of the stakeholders work over a period of \nmonths to reach a compromise. And it is not too late to do that.\n  In recent months, Senator Daschle has attempted numerous times to \nmeet with Senator Frist to hammer out these issues, but those meetings \nhave not taken place. I don't know all that has happened with respect \nto that, but I do know this: Putting a bill on the floor of the Senate \nthat is far short of a true compromise with the stakeholders is not \ngoing to solve the problem.\n\n  Yet this is an urgent problem that needs solving. I believe, as some \nof my colleagues do--Senator Carper, for example, on my side, who has \nworked very hard on this issue, who believes very strongly, as do I--\nthat there needs to be a solution. I certainly believe that if we end \nthis session of the Congress without addressing this issue, without \npassing some legislation, we will have failed. All of us will have \nfailed.\n  It is simple enough to bring legislation that is unacceptable to the \nSenate floor so you can then have a press conference and say: Well, the \nother side killed this legislation. That is simple enough, but it does \nnot address any problem or solve any issue.\n  My hope is that in the coming days, the joint leadership--Senator \nFrist, Senator Daschle--might join with the stakeholders in this issue \naround a table and have some hardnosed negotiating and hammer out and \ndevelop a proposal that represents a true bipartisan proposal that \nrepresents a true compromise by all of those engaged in this issue so \nthat we can pass legislation. Bringing what has been brought to the \nfloor of the Senate the week before last and filing cloture on it is \nnot a way to legislate. They know and we know that this means this \nlegislation does not advance. I fail to see how that solves a problem \nor begins to address an issue that I believe is urgent.\n  Once again, there are some principles involved. One, I don't believe \nthat people who are not sick and have never been sick should be \ncompensated. Two, I believe those who are sick should be compensated \nand compensated fairly and not have to go through a tort system and \nspend a lot of money for lawyers to be compensated. Three, I believe \nthat the American business community deserves some certainty and that \ncertainty does not exist at this point. That is why I believe a trust \nfund of sorts that is set up and established with appropriate medical \ncriteria and other definitions is the best\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nway for us to resolve the issue. I believe we should get to that \npoint--the sooner, the better. But we have wasted a great deal of time.\n  The process that has now been embarked upon by the majority leader \nwill almost certainly guarantee we will not get to that point. I regret \nthat because I hope at the end of this process, this Congress will \nunderstand the urgency for workers, for business, for all of the \nstakeholders to pass asbestos legislation.\n\n\n                  The Office of Foreign Asset Control\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about a \nsubject I discussed with the Treasury Secretary this morning when he \ntestified before my Appropriations subcommittee. We are fighting \nterrorists who want to attack this country. They have killed thousands \nof innocent Americans. They wish to attack this country and kill \ninnocent Americans once again. It is an enormous challenge to fight and \ndefeat terrorism. It takes all of our energy every day in our law \nenforcement areas, in the intelligence community. It takes a lot of \ncoordination and good work. It takes getting it right.\n  So we have the homeland security office. We have the CIA. We have the \nFBI, the Defense Department. We have everybody working on these \nissues--the U.S. Customs Service, and a little agency in the Treasury \nDepartment called OFAC, the Office of Foreign Asset Control. These are \nthe people whose principal responsibility is to try to track the \nfinancial transactions happening between terrorists, to shut down the \nfinancial connections that finance terrorist activities.\n  But that is not all that is done in the Treasury Department with \nrespect to OFAC. This rather small office is doing other things. Their \nprincipal job ought to be to track terrorism and to shut down the \nfinancial root that funds terrorist activities. But there are some at \nthe OFAC who are doing other things. Let me describe them.\n  First, from a speech in December by the Under Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, in Miami, a speech by Asa Hutchinson, where he talked about \nthe crackdown on enforcement of the U.S. embargo against Cuba and goes \ninto some detail; and then the Secretary of the Treasury, also in \nFlorida, on February 9 gives a speech. The Office of Foreign Assets \nControl at Treasury, he said, is working closely with customs agents \ninspecting all direct flights to Cuba at Miami, JFK airport, Los \nAngeles Airport. That is hundreds of aircraft, tens of thousands of \npassengers, and agents are being meticulous.\n  Well, I wonder if we are checking quite so closely with respect to \ntrying to track terrorists. You know what they are looking for? I will \ngive you an example. They are enforcing the embargo that we have with \nrespect to Cuba, and part of that embargo is to prohibit Americans from \ntraveling in Cuba, so we have all of these resources and personnel at \nairports tracking every passenger and every plane to see if someone has \ndone something wrong. This is an example of what they discovered.\n  This agency in the Treasury Department that is supposed to track \nterrorism tracked down Joanie Scott. She went to Cuba 4 years ago to \ndistribute free Bibles. Four years later, the folks who wear suspenders \nat OFAC at the Treasury Department decide they are going to slap her \nwith a $10,000 fine because 4 years ago she went to Cuba to give away \nfree Bibles. She said she didn't know she needed to get a license. Four \nyears later, they slapped her with a $10,000 fine. That is not all of \nit.\n  This is a picture of Joan Slote, a 74-year-old grandmother, who is a \nbicyclist. She is a senior olympian. She rides bicycles all over the \nworld. She happened to ride one in Cuba with a bicycling group from \nCanada. Guess what happened to Joan Slote? She got fined by OFAC, this \nlittle agency in Treasury that is supposed to be tracking terrorists. \nThey are tracking little grandmothers who are riding bicycles in Cuba, \nin order to punish Castro and enforce the travel ban. They fine \nAmerican citizens for traveling in Cuba. So she gets fined $7,630 for \nriding a bicycle in Cuba.\n  These are some folks who are disabled athletes. They got to go to \nHavana about 2 years ago for the games for disabled athletes, the world \ngames. They applied again this year, but as the Treasury Secretary and \nMr. Hutchinson and others have said, including President Bush, we have \nthis crackdown now on travel to Cuba; so these folks were denied a \nlicense to compete in the games for disabled athletes in Havana. The \nresult is that they lost the $8,000 they paid to a travel agency for \ntransportation to Havana to participate in world team sports for \ndisabled athletes. Quite the terrorists, aren't they?\n  So we have people down at the Treasury Department tracking these \nfolks, a retired grandmother, a woman who takes free Bibles for \ndistribution in Cuba, to see if we can find them. That is what is going \non--levying fines of $5,000, $10,000.\n  There is another man from the State of Washington who decided his \nfather's last wish was to be buried or have his ashes distributed in \nthe church he once ministered at in Cuba. Cevin Allen of Washington \nState traveled to Cuba to bury his father's ashes on the church grounds \nwhere his father once ministered. They decided to fine him $20,000.\n  That is what they are tracking down at OFAC. They ought to be ashamed \nof themselves. Their job is to track terrorists.\n  Let's look at what they have done. They have people stationed at \nairports. They have trained Homeland Security agents. Hundreds have \nbeen trained to do this. Here is what they have nabbed with 45,000 \npassengers. They have actually worked overtime to thwart terrorists \nimporting cigars from Cuba.\n  On October 10 of last year, they had this directive from the \nPresident and, boy, they went at it. Homeland Security and OFAC at \nTreasury grabbed this issue. They found that 215 of the 45,461 \ntravelers to Cuba were suspected of taking a vacation. Maybe that is a \nfelony. They were suspected of taking a vacation. What an awful thing. \nAnd 283 tobacco and alcohol violations were found. The Homeland \nSecurity spokesperson, Christine Halsey, said each violation involved a \nsmall amount of rum or cigars; 245 are going to take a vacation, and a \nsmall number are bringing in rum. There were 42 narcotics seizures, but \nit involved prescription drugs, not heroin. There was one hazardous \nmaterial violation. We have this ramp-up and we are supposed to protect \nAmerica against terrorism, and you have these folks in green eyeshades \ntrying to levy fines on Americans, and you have agents at airports \ntrying to see who comes back from Cuba, and who traveled illegally so \nwe can fine them. One hazardous material violation was discovered. It \nwas apparently a carbon bioxide canister, which was probably used to \nadd fizz to seltzer water.\n\n  Does this sound stupid? It does to me. That is a harsh word. \nSometimes our public policies seem flatout dumb. We are confronted with \nthe specter of terrorists who want to kill Americans, cross our borders \nand commit acts of terror. Yet we have people at airports, Homeland \nSecurity agents, and OFAC trying to track little old ladies that went \non bicycle trips in Cuba. What are they thinking at the Department of \nTreasury? Is that the way they want to use their resources?\n  All of us know that lifting the travel ban to Cuba would happen \ninstantly if we had a vote in the House and Senate. The only way they \nprevent it is to prevent a vote. But to use assets at the Department of \nTreasury, agents are supposed to be tracking terrorists, but instead \nare tracking little grandmothers riding bicycles, or women distributing \nBibles, or a son who wants to bury his father's ashes at his home \nchurch in Cuba. That defies description to me.\n  So I am going to find a way during the appropriations process to find \nout how many resources they are using at the Department of Treasury to \ndo this, and if they don't want to use them properly, they should lose \nthem. If they want to keep them, they ought to use them to protect us \nagainst terrorists, not to slap a fine on a grandmother who rode a \nbicycle in Havana. I think that is nuts.\n  As we go into the appropriations process, I want to bring attention \nto that single issue. That is an important issue, and one that I think \nought to be dealt with.\n  I wish to make a comment on an additional issue today. We are heading \ninto an appropriations process. We\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nhave a huge budget deficit, significant fiscal policy problems. Three \nyears ago, it looked as if there were going to be surpluses forever. \nNow we have the biggest budget deficit in the history of this country. \nThere is no prospect in sight of anything resembling a surplus for the \nnext 10 years and beyond. Despite all that, we still have some needs in \nthis country. We need to find a way to meet them.\n  With respect to a number of functions, it is Katie bar the door, \nwhatever they need. We are spending $100 billion more for defense than \nwe used to spend. I understand that. We are spending $130 billion \nalready in Iraq, $5 billion a month, $4 billion in Iraq, $1 billion in \nAfghanistan. Nobody is being asked to pay for it. Increases in homeland \nsecurity spending, I understand that. Tax cuts, tax cuts, and more tax \ncuts, and a President who says: Let's make all of them permanent. I \nunderstand why he is saying that as well. I don't support it.\n  I think someone who makes $1 million a year is fortunate, and good \nfor them. I am all for them, but suggesting they should have a $123,000 \ntax cut per year on their $1 million salary, at a time when we are up \nto our neck in deficits, in my judgment, defies description.\n  Let me mention one other issue that I think we need to deal with--the \nissue of the Indian Health Service. I want to show a picture of a \nlittle girl named Avis Littlewind. She died 2 weeks ago. Her aunt said \nshe took her own life around noon in her home. She missed 90 days of \nschool since the start of the school year. She is a 14-year-old girl \nwho apparently felt there was no hope. She lives on an Indian \nreservation. On the reservations, there are precious few resources to \ndeal with the kinds of problems this young girl obviously confronted--\none psychologist, a social worker, no psychiatrist, no automobile to \nprovide necessary transportation.\n  There is a crisis in resources to deal with these issues. A young \ngirl takes her own life and nobody seems to say much about it. It is \njust what happens. The fact is, this should not happen. It should not \never happen.\n  I remember speaking one day on the floor of the Senate about another \nyoung girl, a Native American, a young Indian girl, age 3, placed in a \nfoster home, but they did not check out the foster home before they \nplaced her there. The caseworker worked 150 separate cases and did not \ncheck out the foster home.\n  This young girl had her nose broken, her hair pulled out by its \nroots, and her arms broken at a drunken party. She will never outlive \nthe scars of that beating she took. Why? Because one person was \nhandling 150 cases involving children.\n  We have a full-blown crisis on Indian reservations in this country \ndealing with the basic social services that every American family ought \nto be able to expect to access. When a young girl has serious problems, \nserious emotional difficulties, and needs help, that young girl ought \nnot to take her own life at age 14 because help is not available. This \nis a better country than that.\n  When we come to funding the Indian Health Service this year, we can \nno longer pretend Third World conditions do not exist on some of the \nIndian reservations in this country when it comes to health care for \nkids. We just cannot any longer pretend. Lives are being lost, lives \nare being ruined, and we can do something about it.\n  I am going to have more to say as we get into the appropriations \nprocess, but I did want to simply say there is a tragedy that is \nunfolding every day, every hour in parts of this country that are in \nAmerica's shadows. Out of mind, out of sight for some, but not for all. \nWe, in this Congress, must shine a light on these problems and begin to \nsolve them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Patriot Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the PATRIOT Act, a \nsubject which has been much misunderstood. I think some of the \nmisunderstanding has been perhaps just from lack of information or has \nbeen misinformation that has been spun in an effort to confuse people \nand perhaps even to scare people about what is in this important \nlegislation. Indeed, we are all committed to making sure not only that \nour Nation is secure, and I believe the PATRIOT Act has contributed \ntremendously to improving the security of the United States of America, \nbut at the same time we have a fundamental commitment in this country \nto civil liberties. I believe, and I think the American people believe, \nthe Founders of this country believed firmly that we can have both our \nnational security and our civil liberties. Particularly, in a time of \nwar such as we are in now, while there will be some tension, we need \nnot sacrifice our civil liberties.\n\n  Nevertheless, there are those who would play politics with this issue \nin an effort to score political points, or I think others who perhaps \nfor more benign reasons might just be not very well informed and kind \nof go along, not really knowing the truth. So I want to talk just a few \nminutes about the PATRIOT Act and what it has done.\n  Of course the PATRIOT Act has passed overwhelmingly, just a short \ntime after the terrible events of September 11. Indeed, the purpose of \nthe PATRIOT Act was to give law enforcement the tools and our \ncounterterrorism experts and agents the tools they needed in order to \nprevent future 9/11s.\n  Indeed, the evidence is clear that the PATRIOT Act has served that \nimportant purpose. The Department of Justice has broken up four \nterrorist cells in the United States since September 11, in Buffalo, \nPortland, Detroit, and Seattle. It has filed criminal charges related \nto terrorism against more than 300 individuals. So far it has secured \n176 convictions or guilty pleas. Perhaps the best evidence of the \nsuccess of the PATRIOT Act has been the fact that, thank goodness, \nAmerica has not suffered another horrific event like 9/11 since that \nterrible day some 2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  I might add we have also been successful in freezing some of the \nfunding that has been essential to financing terrorism around the \nworld. In fact, the PATRIOT Act has allowed us to freeze more than $200 \nmillion in funds from organizations that have been sponsoring and \nfunding international terrorism.\n  Particularly, last week, I guess it was, when we heard the testimony \nof the former FBI Director Louis Freeh, the former Attorney General \nJanet Reno, and the current Attorney General John Ashcroft, the \nAmerican people became introduced more or less the same way that law \nstudents are to fundamental principles of law enforcement and due \nprocess. Even more than that, the American people were introduced to \nsomething that was referred to as ``the wall.''\n  The wall was the subject of a 1995 memo by Jamie Gorelick, then \nDeputy Attorney General, now on the 9/11 Commission. Indeed, as she has \npointed out, the wall between our antiterrorism and intelligence-\ngathering efforts and our law enforcement efforts has been \nlongstanding. But it is not a matter that is constitutionally required; \nit is something the American Government had done to itself. It is a \nlimitation that Congress had placed on information sharing between law \nenforcement officials. Some only investigate crimes after they have \noccurred, trying to root out the guilty and then to convict the guilty \nof the crimes they have committed. The wall is between those law \nenforcement officials and those intelligence agencies, counterterrorism \nofficials whose job it is to prevent a terrorist attack from even \noccurring and to preempt that terrible event from occurring. So it was \nthrough the PATRIOT Act that we saw this wall come down that has been \nso important to information sharing.\n  Indeed, this is not a partisan issue. Attorney General Janet Reno \nsaid just a few short days ago, on April 13, with respect to the \nproblems of information sharing within the FBI and other Federal \nofficials, that:\n\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\n\n       Many of these issues will be or have been resolved by the \n     passage of the PATRIOT Act or other statements.\n\n  Indeed, to my recollection, that is not the same words but \nessentially the same testimony that was presented by former FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who served \nduring the previous administration, in talking about this wall that had \nbeen brought down as a result of the PATRIOT Act said:\n\n       . . . the wall is not an appropriate one with respect to \n     counterterrorism, and that's been repaired both by the \n     PATRIOT Act and the court of review.\n\n  I believe the court of review he is referring to is the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, which creates a court of seven Federal \njudges who review requests for various intelligence mechanisms that try \nto make sure or, in fact, do make sure as much as is humanly possible \nthat the rights of people who are accused of crimes are not unfairly \njeopardized in this process.\n  The point is that the wall that had been erected separating our law \nenforcement personnel and preventing them from sharing information with \nour counterterrorism officials has now been torn down and we now allow \ninformation sharing which, indeed, has made America safer.\n  The PATRIOT Act specifically makes it easier to track terrorists in \nthe digital age. When journalist Daniel Pearl of the Wall Street \nJournal was kidnapped in Pakistan, the terrorists made the mistake, as \nit turned out, of sending the ransom demands by e-mail. The PATRIOT \nAct, having brought our laws into the information age, allowed \ninvestigators to quickly obtain essential information from the Internet \nservice provider that the terrorists were using. This in turn led them \nto cybercafes in Pakistan and then to some of Daniel Pearl's killers, \nwho are now in prison thanks to the expanded tools provided by the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  Some have worried aloud that we are jeopardizing our civil liberties \nby creating a law which allows expanded authority to law enforcement \nand counterterrorism authorities. But what many people don't \nunderstand, or don't know--there is no reason they should know other \nthan the fact that they have now learned more about it--is the PATRIOT \nAct actually applies tools that have already been in use in other \ncontexts. For example, before September 11, investigators had better \ntools to fight organized crime than they did to fight terrorism. For \nexample, for years law enforcement officials used roving wiretaps to \ninvestigate organized crime. I think it was Senator Joe Biden who said \nif roving wiretaps are good enough for the mob, then they are good \nenough for terrorists. He, of course, advocated, as many on this floor \ndid, for that. Here is a copy of his remarks. I paraphrased it. Let's \ngo to the exact quote. He said:\n\n       . . . the FBI could get a wiretap to investigate the Mafia, \n     but they could not get one to investigate terrorists. To put \n     it bluntly, that was crazy. What's good for the Mob should be \n     good for terrorists.\n\n  Those are statements with which I agreed, made by Senator Joe Biden \non October 25, 2001, which I submit were true then and remain true \ntoday.\n  I already mentioned that aspect of the PATRIOT Act which has made it \neasier for us to cut off the financial support that has been used to \nsupport terrorist acts. Osama bin Laden, when he first left Saudi \nArabia and went to Afghanistan as part of the anti-Communist Jihad, \nafter the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, he and other Jihadists declared \nholy war against the Soviets at the time. The way he got started in his \nterrorist activities was financially supporting the acts of other \nJihadists, other Muslim extremists. At that time, he directed their \nfire at the Soviet Union until, of course, the Soviet Union left \nAfghanistan. Then they turned their fire on America and other freedom-\nloving countries.\n  My point is, getting at the financial support for terror was very \nimportant. Indeed, the PATRIOT Act has made it much easier to get to \nthat and was responsible for capturing some $200 million in terrorist \nfinancing, which has been very important.\n  One of the things that has concerned me, and no doubt others, about \nthe PATRIOT Act has been the way people have used the PATRIOT Act as \nalmost a dirty word. It has been used to scare people. It has been used \nto mislead people about what the act does. It is important to \nunderstand what the act does and what it does not do.\n  It has also been used to raise money. This is part of the scare \ncampaign the American people deserve to know about and we as Members of \nthis body need to remind ourselves of and make ourselves aware of. I \nhappened to get a solicitation from the American Civil Liberties Union \nat my home. This is an excerpt. It caught my eye because I thought, now \nI understand why there are so many people who are misled and frightened \nby the PATRIOT Act because there are organizations such as the ACLU \nthat are misleading people about what it does. They are using that fear \nto raise money. We know one of the strongest motivations there is for \nhuman beings is to scare them. Indeed, that is exactly what is \nhappening by misleading the American people about what the PATRIOT Act \ndoes, by organizations such as the ACLU.\n  This solicitation letter I received at my residence said in part:\n\n       We need your immediate help to stop radical anti-liberty \n     proposals from becoming radical anti-liberty laws of the land \n     with Congress' and the White House' seal of approval.\n\n  Indeed, that sort of statement is not alone. We have another chart \nthat talks specifically about the PATRIOT Act, and another excerpt from \nthe same solicitation by the ACLU:\n\n       The USA PATRIOT Act expands terrorism laws to include \n     ``domestic terrorism'' which could subject political \n     organizations to surveillance, wiretapping, harassment, and \n     criminal action for political advocacy.\n\n  If that were true, I would be standing and saying we need to look at \nthis twice. We need to do something about it. We need to look further \nto see whether perhaps we have done something wrong or it needs \ncorrection or review.\n  I was at a hearing of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and Senator Feinstein put her finger on this and pointed out \nthe kind of hysterical scare tactics the ACLU and others have used in \nmischaracterizing what the PATRIOT Act does are flatly unfounded. I was \nthere at this hearing, but I had the statement made into a chart so the \nquote is clear. Senator Feinstein, to her credit, is always a Senator \nwho does her homework. She does her homework in every case, sometimes \nto my aggravation when she is on the other side of an issue, but \nsometimes I am glad she does. This is a case where I am glad she did \nher homework as she always does.\n\n       I have never had a single abuse of the PATRIOT Act reported \n     to me.\n\n  She was not just sitting passively back waiting for people to write \nor call as they do to our offices to complain or to register some \nconcern about legislation or some Federal activity.\n  She went on to say:\n\n       My staff e-mailed the ACLU and asked them for instances of \n     actual abuses. They e-mailed back and said they had none.\n\n  It is very disturbing that the same organization that mails \nsolicitations to houses of not just Members of Congress but to people \nall across America, trying to frighten them, mislead them, and scare \nthem into believing Congress has acted without concern for civil \nliberties or perhaps some law we passed has been abused by Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft and others, when, in fact, it is just not true. \nEveryone should be concerned about that. It ought to be exposed for \nwhat it is.\n\n  Notwithstanding the comments of people like Senator Biden, who \nsupports the PATRIOT Act, Senator Feinstein, who has done this \ninvestigation to find out whether, in fact, there has been abuse--and \nthere has been none reported, even when asked for examples to support \ntheir scare tactics--there are some now who say it is time to eliminate \nthe PATRIOT Act or to replace it, using other similar scare tactics.\n  I might point out this is not limited to the Congress. I had my staff \nrefresh my recollection because I had remembered--indeed, the Presiding \nOfficer may remember, too--there are press reports about city councils \naround the United States that passed resolutions condemning the PATRIOT \nAct based on the disinformation and scare tactics the ACLU and others \nhave used to mislead them about whether there was, indeed, a threat to \nthe civil liberties of their constituents. In fact, 287 local \ngovernments across the United States\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nof America have passed such resolutions condemning the PATRIOT Act. I \nam sad to say, three of those were in Texas: If my recollection is \ncorrect, the Dallas City Council, Austin City Council, and one from a \nsmaller municipality.\n  So we know at least there is some evidence that the kind of scare \ntactics and misinformation people have been spreading, people at the \nACLU have been spreading, is, unfortunately, working, because not \nenough people like me and others in this body are standing up and \ncorrecting the record and providing the truth.\n  Unfortunately--it is not unfortunate; it is our system. We have \nelections for President every 4 years. We have elections for the House \nevery 2 years and every 6 years for the Senate, but it should not be \ntoo surprising some of this disinformation and misinformation and scare \ntactics have gotten into the Presidential campaign.\n  Indeed, I listened with some concern during the race for the \nDemocratic nomination for President where various candidates for that \nDemocratic nomination for President continued along this line of \ndisinformation, misinformation, and scare tactics specifically \nregarding the PATRIOT Act. The current nominee for President of the \nDemocratic Party participated in that, what I call ``piling on.'' He \nsaid in a speech at Iowa State University:\n\n       So it is time to end the era of John Ashcroft.\n\n  Unfortunately, this is an instance, I will interject in the quote, in \nwhich Attorney General Ashcroft has been reviled, he has been called \nall sorts of names, held up as a boogeyman in part of the scare tactic \nfor doing his job, for enforcing the laws Congress has passed and the \nPresident has signed. If the Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica will not enforce the laws Congress passes and the President \nsigns in order to make America more secure, who will? Thank goodness, \nwe have a courageous individual who is willing to stand up against \nunwarranted criticism and this sort of misinformation or disinformation \ncampaign and enforce the law Congress passes because he believes, as \nCongress believed when it passed the law, as the President believed \nwhen he signed the law, the PATRIOT Act makes America more secure.\n  Going back to the quote by Senator Kerry at the Iowa State \nUniversity:\n\n       So it is time to end the era of John Ashcroft.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       That starts with replacing the PATRIOT Act with a new law \n     that protects our people and our liberties at the same time.\n\n  He later had an interview on ``Morning Edition'' on National Public \nRadio on August 18, 2003. He said:\n\n       If you are sensitive to and care about civil liberties, you \n     can make provisions to guarantee that there is not this blind \n     spot in the American justice system that there is today under \n     the Patriot Act.\n\n  Unfortunately, this disinformation campaign, which stands in stark \ncontrast to the lack of any evidence that Senator Feinstein found in \nher investigation about abuses, continues now into the Presidential \ncampaign, now that the Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party has \nbeen chosen.\n  Indeed, this is on Senator Kerry's Web site, John Kerry for President \nWeb site. He said:\n\n       John Ashcroft has used new authority under the Patriot Act \n     to perform ``sneak and peek'' searches without ever notifying \n     anyone and without any judicial oversight.\n\n  Well, besides this campaign of disinformation and misinformation and \nscare tactics, I can assure you neither the Attorney General nor any \nother United States attorney or Federal law enforcement official can \nlegally perform any kind of search without judicial oversight. That is \nwrong. It is a false statement.\n  Even if we pulled this out of all the other contexts I have talked \nabout--the disinformation, the misinformation, and the scare tactics--\nthis is a flat misstatement. I hope Senator Kerry will correct that on \nhis Web site because no search under any kind of warrant can be \nconducted without the approval of a judge or an impartial magistrate. \nThat is a basic part of our criminal law. But, here again, I am worried \nthat unless people stand up and correct the record, this kind of \ndisinformation will continue.\n  But the worst part of it is this: Notwithstanding the kind of \nstatements I covered by Senator Kerry and others, these are some of the \nsame people who voted for the PATRIOT Act when it passed. Indeed, on \nOctober 25, 2001, Senator Kerry said:\n\n       I am pleased at the compromise we have reached on the \n     antiterrorism legislation, as a whole, which includes the \n     sunset provision on the wiretapping and electronic \n     surveillance component.\n\n  Then later, more specifically to the subject at hand, this quote is \ntalking generically about the laws that changed included in the PATRIOT \nAct and others. But he was interviewed on Fox News on October 25, 2001. \nJohn Gibson of Fox News said:\n\n       Senator Kerry, today, Attorney General Ashcroft said that \n     terrorists have reason to be afraid, very afraid of this new \n     terror legislation. Why? What's in it that has so much \n     sharper teeth?\n\n  Senator Kerry said:\n\n       It streamlines the ability of law enforcement to do its \n     job. It modernizes our ability to fight crime.\n\n  Well, I agree with the comments of Senator Kerry in October of 2001 \nabout the benefits of the PATRIOT Act. And I disagree with the comments \nSenator Kerry--the same person--made when he decided to run for \nPresident, and now that he is a Presidential nominee, where he is using \nthe misinformation, this disinformation, these scare tactics, \nunfortunately, in contrast to the lack of evidence Senator Feinstein \nwas able to glean from even the ACLU about any evidence of abuses.\n  The fact is, the PATRIOT Act has made America a safer place. And no \npolitical campaign, no fundraising goal justifies misleading the \nAmerican people about what is good about the PATRIOT Act and how it has \ncontributed to bringing down this wall separating law enforcement and \ncounterterrorism officials from sharing information. Indeed, as I said, \nthe best evidence about why the PATRIOT Act is good law, good public \npolicy, is the fact we have not been hit like we were on 9/11. Thank \nGod for that. I know, of course, we hope and pray we never will again \nbe hit in that way. But we are not going to be safer if we play \npolitics with our national security, even in a Presidential year when \nthe attraction is so irresistible, it appears, to some.\n\n  The PATRIOT Act has made America safer. Janet Reno, John Ashcroft, \nLouis Freeh, people on both sides of the aisle, people who have put \ntheir hand on a Bible and sworn to uphold the laws of the United States \nof America, to protect the Constitution--these are people who have \ntestified under oath the PATRIOT Act has made America safer.\n  So I say, let's not play politics with this important law. Let's not \nplay politics and risk American lives by continuing the disinformation \nand misinformation and the scare tactics to the point where we would go \nback and eliminate or revise or neuter this important protection which \nhas made our country so much safer.\n  So, Mr. President, with that, I would like to turn to some additional \nmatters on behalf of the majority leader.\n  I see Senator Reid on the floor. At this time, on behalf of the \nmajority leader, I would ask----\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The assistant Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield for a comment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The staffs are not quite ready to do the close yet. They \nshould be ready in a matter of a few minutes. So if the Senator would \nallow us a few more minutes?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Under the circumstances, Mr. President, I ask----\n  Mr. REID. I will make a statement that will take a couple minutes. \nSenator Daschle is going to make a statement. We can go ahead and do \nthe close, and he can speak after the close, but we are not quite ready \non this side to close. It will take another few minutes.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for me to make a very brief \nstatement?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n\n                              Patriot Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would agree with my friend, the former \nattorney general of Texas, the PATRIOT\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nAct has made America a safer place. I think that is a fair statement. \nBut I would also say the PATRIOT Act is something we have to watch very \nclosely. We realized when we passed this legislation there may be \nprovisions in it that went too far, not far enough. As a result of \nthat, we have put a provision in this very important bill, the PATRIOT \nAct, that it would sunset; that if we did not renew that legislation, \nit would fail; therefore, next year we have to renew this act.\n  I am confident, based on what is going on around the country, in \nspite of the statement from the American Civil Liberties Union--we can \nlook to Las Vegas, my home, on one criminal prosecution, what the \nauthorities did there. It is my understanding they used the PATRIOT \nAct. A person bought a car with global positioning in it. The reason \nthey bought that, of course, is in case something went wrong you could \npress a button and come and find out where the car is, or, if it was an \nemergency, someone trying to hijack the car, emergency authorities \nwould be notified. The person never realized law enforcement \nauthorities could focus on that vehicle and listen to everything that \nwent on in that car. That is what they did.\n  I would have to think without getting a judge's order, without doing \nsome things in addition to what I have described, that was probably \ngoing a little too far. The point being, the PATRIOT Act is something \nwe need to take a look at. That is why we have this legislation that \nwill sunset.\n  I hope the Judiciary Committee and other committees that believe they \nhave jurisdiction will begin as soon as possible taking a look at this \nlegislation to see if there are provisions that should be revised, \neliminated, added to. I don't think we need to criticize Senator Kerry \nbecause he thinks we need to take a look at the PATRIOT Act. I believe \nwe do, and that is certainly appropriate. The Senate agreed. That is \nwhy we included a sunset provision in this most important legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, April 20th, is being observed as \nEqual Pay Day.\n  I wish I could say it is a celebration of Equal Pay for women. But it \nisn't.\n  Instead, this day symbolizes the fact that women continue to earn \nonly 77 percent as much as men, 77 cents on the dollar.\n  Today, April 20, marks how many extra days a woman has to work to \nearn as much money as a man earned last year.\n  Women are paid less than men even when they have the same experience, \nthe same education, the same skills, and live in the same parts of the \ncountry.\n  And they are paid less for doing the same jobs.\n  For example, women lawyers and women doctors both have median weekly \nearnings that are nearly $500 less than those of male lawyers and \ndoctors.\n  Women food service supervisors are paid about $100 less each week \nthan men in the same job, and waitresses earn about $50 less than \nwaiters.\n  Women professors' weekly earnings are nearly $300 less each week than \nmen's, and the median weekly salary for women elementary school \nteachers is $70 per week less than that of male elementary school \nteachers.\n  When women are short-changed in their paychecks, it doesn't just hurt \nthem. It hurts their whole family, including their children and \nspouses.\n  Lower pay for women means a family can't afford as nice of a home, or \ngive their children the same opportunities, as they could if women were \npaid as much as men.\n  If married women were paid the same as comparable men, their family \nincomes would rise by nearly 6 percent. And the poverty rate among \nfamilies of working women would decline from 2.1 percent to 0.8 \npercent.\n  On average, every working family loses $4,000 every year because of \nunequal pay for women.\n  If single working mothers earned as much as comparable men, their \nfamily incomes would increase by nearly 17 percent, and their poverty \nrates would be cut in half, from 25.3 percent to 12.6 percent.\n  If single women earned as much as comparable men, their incomes would \nrise by 13.4 percent and their poverty rate would fall from 6.3 percent \nto 1 percent.\n  Women lose 23 cents on the dollar compared to men--almost a quarter.\n  Over a lifetime of work, that 23 cents adds up fast. It adds up to \nreal money.\n  For an average 25-year old working woman, it adds up to about \n$523,000 during her working life. That's more than a half-million \ndollars less than a man will be paid.\n  Because women are paid less when they work, they can't save as much \ntoward their retirement. Half of all older women who received a private \npension in 1998 got less than $3,486 per year, compared with $7,020 per \nyear for older men. In other words, the pensions for women were less \nthan half of the pensions for men.\n  The figures are even worse for women of color. African-American women \nearn only 67 cents and Latinas 55 cents for every dollar that men earn. \nAsian Pacific American women still earn only 83.5 cents on the dollar \ncompared to men's salaries.\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\n  These statistics remind us that we still have a long way to go, even \nthough we have been fighting for decades to win equal pay for women.\n  When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, it became \nillegal for companies to pay women less than men who were doing exactly \nthe same work.\n  Unfortunately, other forms of discrimination have continued, \nincluding relatively low wages for jobs that have traditionally been \nconsidered ``women's work,'' like teaching, nursing and child care.\n  Some recent legal settlements provide insight into the kind of \ndiscrimination that women still face in the workplace: In 1997, Home \nDepot and Publix Supermarkets each agreed to pay more than $80 million \nto settle major lawsuits charging them with sex discrimination against \nthousands of working women. The lawsuits alleged that, among other \nthings, the companies had assigned women to lower-paying jobs, refused \nto give them raises, and denied them promotions. In 1999, Texaco agreed \nto pay $3.1 million in a ``glass ceiling'' settlement to women who \nalleged they were consistently paid less than their male counterparts \nin similar positions. In 2000, Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay $3.8 \nmillion to women and minority applicants who claimed they were denied \njobs as entry-level assemblers. In 2002, American Express Financial \nAdvisors Inc. agreed to pay $31 million to settle a sex discrimination \ncase alleging that female professionals were paid less and unfairly \ndenied promotions.\n  Everyone agrees that women deserve equal pay. But we still haven't \nreached that goal.\n  That's why we must vigorously enforce the equal pay laws that are \nalready on the books. Pass stronger and better equal pay laws, such as \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act, which I am proud to co-sponsor. And protect \nthe rights of workers to organize and bargain with employers.\n  It is simply not fair that a young woman beginning a career in the \nworkplace today will earn a half-million dollars less than a man.\n  It isn't fair that pensions for women are half as much as pensions \nfor men.\n  And it isn't fair that the families of working women are penalized in \nevery paycheck.\n  Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, and let's work to finally \nensure that women who work get paid as much as men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4151-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENVIRONMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\n\n  Mr. REID.

I take this opportunity to recognize \nthe Washoe Tribe and Ms. Lefevre for their strong commitment to \npreserving our State's rich natural heritage.\n  Headed by Marie Barry, the Washoe Tribe Environmental Department has \nhelped restore a section of the Carson River corridor through Jacks \nValley in Douglass County, NV.\n  The tribe has contributed significantly to the environmental health \nof its ancestral land, while engaging the local community in a \nconstructive and educational experience. Its ``Washoe on the River \nDay'' events attracted dozens of volunteers to participate in the \nrestoration process, and learn about the environmental history of the \nCarson River and its cultural connection to the Washoe people.\n  As Director of the Nevada Outdoor School, Stephanie Lefevre has \ndeveloped an environmental education plan to teach students about the \nproblems posed by illegal dumping in local areas. She has also created \nseveral other environmental programs in Winnemucca, including a \ncommunity garden and composting program and a volunteer community \nrecycling program. The recycling program expands conservation efforts \nand teaches students about responsible environmental stewardship.\n  Please join me in congratulating the Washoe Tribe Environmental \nDepartment and Stephanie Lefevre on their outstanding work and well-\nearned recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4151-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4151-S4152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                            Pvt Noah L. Boye\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof PVT Noah L. Boye, a Nebraskan serving in the United States Marine \nCorps. Boye was killed on April 13 when he came under enemy fire near \nFallujah, Iraq. He was 21 years old. Boye served in the 1st Battalion, \n5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Expeditionary \nForce based in Camp Pendleton, CA.\n  A resident of Grand Island, NE, Private Boye was a proud and \ndedicated soldier who was committed to his country. Private Boye \nenlisted in the Marine Corps when he was 17 years old. He died \ncourageously performing his duty. Our thoughts and prayers are with his \nfamily at this difficult time. All of America mourns Noah Boye and is \nproud of his service.\n  Private Boye and thousands of brave American service men and women \nconfront danger every day in Iraq and their tremendous sacrifices must \nnever be taken for granted or forgotten. For his service, bravery, and \nsacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring \nPVT Noah L. Boye.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, PVT Noah Boye was a dedicated \nMarine who served his country with honor. He joined the Marine Corps \nright after he graduated from high school in 2001. He was deployed to \nKuwait in February 2003 and was part of the initial coalition forces \nthat helped bring down Saddam Hussein in March. Private Boye spent 4 \nmonths in Iraq that year and redeployed to Iraq last month. He is \ndescribed as a caring person who was always there for everybody and \nanybody. His family remembers him as the life of the party and a \ngenuine and gentle man. The last contact he had with his mother was a \nletter that she received from him 3 weeks ago that was dated March 7. \nWhen his mother showed concern about her son going to Iraq, he told \nher, ``Mom, that's my job. It's what I have to do.'' Private Boye \nfought for his country with no regrets and with great honor.\n  I would like to express my deepest sympathy for the Boye Family, and \nI know all Nebraskans join me in remembering and honoring Noah's \ncontributions to Grand Island and his sacrifice on behalf of his \ncountry. Private Boye's sacrifice will forever remind this Nation of \nthe danger that comes with the duty to protect our Nation's interests \nand the freedoms of others around the world. As a nation, we are \ngrateful to Marines like Private Boye who make the ultimate sacrifice \nso that all Americans can live in freedom.\n\n\n                            Sp Dennis Morgan\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof SP Dennis Morgan, a Nebraskan serving with the South Dakota National \nGuard. Specialist Morgan was killed on April 17 south of Baghdad, Iraq \nwhen a roadside bomb exploded as a convoy passed. He was 22 years old. \nSpecialist Morgan was a member of the 153rd Engineer Battalion based in \nWinner, South Dakota.\n  Specialist Morgan, of Valentine, NE, worked to protect others by \nfinding and disarming explosive devices along the roads. He died \ncourageously performing his duty.\n  Specialist Morgan is survived by his wife, Cassie; his mother, Diane \nMangelson; and his grandmother, Doris Morgan. Our thoughts and prayers \nare with all of them at this difficult time. All of America mourns \nDennis Morgan and is proud of his service.\n  Specialist Morgan and thousands of brave American service men and \nwomen confront danger every day in Iraq and their tremendous sacrifices \nmust never be taken for granted or forgotten.

Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments \ntoday to reflect on the life of Marine PFC Anthony P. Roberts. Anthony \nepitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who fought to \nfree Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. He \nexhibited unwavering courage, dutiful service to his country and, above \nall else, honor. In the way he lived his life--and how we remember \nhim--Anthony reminds each of us how good we can be.\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\n  A resident of Middletown, Anthony's passing has deeply affected the \ncommunity. A 2003 graduate of Middletown High School, Anthony was the \nson of Emma Roberts and the late William Roberts, Jr. Friends, family, \nand school officials recalled Anthony Roberts as a bright young man who \nsaw military service as a way to give something back to his country. He \nviewed the Marine Corps as an opportunity to get away from a small \ntown, meet new people, and start a career.\n  Anthony always had a strong interest in the military. He was a member \nof Middletown High School's Air Force Junior ROTC program. His \nparticipation in that program enabled me to meet him and many of his \nfellow cadets several years ago when I visited their high school. \nFriends and family remember Anthony as standing extra tall after \nearning his Marine Corps uniform.\n  After graduating from school, Anthony underwent basic training at \nCamp Lejeune, NC, before being stationed at Camp Pendleton, CA. Anthony \nbecame a member of the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment. He died in \nfighting around Ramadi.\n  Anthony was a remarkable and well-respected young soldier. His \nfriends and family remember him as an honorable man. He enjoyed \nspending time in Philadelphia, writing rap music lyrics, reading \nautomobile magazines, and playing computer games.\n  I rise today to commemorate Anthony, to celebrate his life, and to \noffer his family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic \nloss.\n\n\n                        1LT ROBERT HENDERSON II\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor the service of 1LT Robert Henderson II of Alvaton, \nKY. His death while performing his duty to his country is a great loss \nto us all.\n  On April 17, 2004, LT Henderson was leading a convoy near Diwaniyah. \nAs they were passing through, they were ambushed and LT Henderson was \nwounded. He later died at a field hospital. I offer my sincerest \ncondolences to LT Henderson's family and loved ones.\n  His service with the Kentucky Army National Guard's 2123rd \nTransportation Company was exemplary and duly appreciated. Lieutenant \nHenderson, according to reports, showed bravery by continuing to drive \nhis lead vehicle toward safety after he was wounded. As one of the U.S. \nSenators from Kentucky, I know that Lieutenant Henderson served as a \nfine example of what it means to be a true patriot and an American of \nthe highest caliber.\n  We are humbled and honored by the sacrifice Lieutenant Henderson has \nmade. His loss reminds us of the heavy cost exacted for our freedom. We \nmust remember that the American way of life has been made possible by \nthe bravery of men and women like Lieutenant Henderson. When freedom \nhas been challenged many like him have answered the call to arms. We \nmust never forget that.\n\n\n                     ARMY SERGEANT DAVID MC KEEVER\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, SGT David McKeever was a \nsoldier who fought honorably for his country. He joined the Army in \n1997, right after graduation from South Park High School in South \nBuffalo, NY. Before going to Iraq to try to help keep peace, he served \nproudly in Bosnia. He just recently reenlisted to serve his country. He \nwas also approved for a promotion from army specialist to the rank of \nsergeant just before his death. This well-deserved honor was given to \nhim posthumously.\n  David had 15 days remaining before he would have left Iraq for \nGermany, and then return home. His family describes him as a dedicated \nsoldier, proud American, and hero who was fully aware of the high cost \nof freedom.\n  SGT David McKeever will be greatly missed and our thoughts and \nprayers will be with his family and friends. He leaves behind a wife, a \none-year-old son, his parents and his four sisters. As a nation, we are \ngrateful to David McKeever and other soldiers like him who make the \nultimate sacrifice so that others can live free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4152-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4152-S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2004 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, H.

The current level for \nrevenues is $3.1 billion above the budget resolution in 2004.\n  Since my last report dated March 23, 2004, the Congress has cleared \nand the President has signed the following acts: the Welfare Reform \nExtension Act of 2004, Pub. L. 108-210; an act to reauthorize certain \nschool lunch and child nutrition programs through June 30, 2004, Pub. \nL. 108-211; and, the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, Pub. L. 108-\n218. In addition the Congress has cleared for the President's signature \nS. 2057, an act to require the Secretary of Defense to reimburse \ncertain transportation expenses of members of the U.S. Air Force.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 3, 2002, a 17-year-old transgender woman, Gwen Araujo, was \nviciously killed and buried in a shallow grave near South Lake Tahoe. \nGwen was beaten severely--with fists, canned goods and a metal \nskillet--then strangled to death. Before driving her to a remote \nlocation to be buried, the attackers wrapped her body in blankets and \nhit her in the head with a shovel to make sure she was dead.\n  After a confession to police by one of Gwen's attackers, her body was \nfinally found 2 weeks later. Currently, three men--Michael Magidson, \n23, and Jose Merel and Jason Cazares, both 24--stand trial for her \nmurder. A fourth man was also charged with her murder but pled guilty \nto manslaughter in exchange for testifying against the others. Despite \nthis confession and eyewitness testimony in this case, defense \nattorneys have suggested that Gwen's murder was a result of something \nthe victim provoked because of her lifestyle choice. The defense has \nasserted that Gwen ``deceived'' her attackers. Once learning of her \nbiological sex, it caused one defendant to become enraged ``beyond \nreason,'' thereby resulting in her attack. One attorney has even \nclaimed that no hate crime has been committed in this case.\n  Clearly, the murder of Gwen was motivated by hatred. I believe that \nthe government's first duty is to defend its citizens, and to defend \nthem against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become one of substance. I believe \nthat by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can \nchange hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4153-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             1139TH MILITARY POLICE COMPANY OF MOBERLY, MO\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I rise today to express my appreciation \nfor the service and the sacrifice of the service men and women of the \n1139th Military Police Company of Moberly, MO, for their contributions \nto Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The 1139th was mobilized in January 2003, and served in Iraq from May \nto December 2003. Their missions included convey security, securing the \nflow of personnel and material to sustain the U.S. mission in Iraq; \nensuring the security of fixed-site locations in Iraq, performing law \nenforcement and presence missions to maintain law and order, and to \ntrain Iraqi police as they prepare to assume an ever-greater share of \nthe day-to-day duties of stabilizing the country.\n  Their efforts, and their willingness to leave their families and \nhomes, to assist in the larger effort to stabilize and return Iraq to \nthe family of freedom- and peace-loving nations, says much regarding \ntheir understanding of the word service, and their appreciation for the \nobligations of citizenship.\n  The United States is a wealthy and powerful Nation, but it is the \nwillingness of young men and women such as these that makes us great. \nIn a dangerous world, they make the difference, both here and overseas. \nTheir efforts will set men free. Their efforts will break the shackles \nof despotism. Their efforts will secure the safety of Americans here at \nhome.\n  To the 65 service men and women of the 1139th, you have my respect \nand my heartfelt thanks for your service.\n  May God bless these fine young men and women and their families.

Mr. President, a little before noon 5 years ago \ntoday, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris began a killing spree at Columbine \nHigh School that left a dozen of their fellow students and a teacher \ndead, and more than two dozen others wounded.\n  The Columbine incident was a wake up call to a nation awash with \nguns, and showed us all once again what one or two grievance killers or \nmalcontents can do with powerful, semi-automatic assault weapons.\n  Klebold and Harris were troubled young men who chose, tragically, to \ntake out their angst on fellow students.\n  Twenty or thirty years ago, that decision might have simply led to a \nfist fight during recess outside on the playground. But now, with the \nprevalence of high-capacity, high-powered firearms, that decision \nquickly led to the deaths of more than a dozen innocents, and then the \ntwo shooters themselves.\n  Using several long guns and a TEC-DC9 semi-automatic assault pistol, \nKlebold and Harris were able to move through their high school with \nimpunity, firing shot after shot in rapid succession, and quickly \nending the hopes and dreams of so many youngsters.\n  Nobody could take them down, because their weapons made them, for all \nintents and purposes, invulnerable.\n  And while Columbine was tragic, it was not unique.\n  Similar grievance killings have occurred across the nation, in every \nforum:\n  In a San Ysidro, CA McDonald's in 1984, when a gunman with an Uzi \nkilled 21 and wounded 15 others.\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\n  In Stockton, CA, in 1989, when drifter Patrick Purdy walked into a \nschoolyard with an AK-47 and killed 5, wounding 30 others.\n  In Long Island, NY, in 1993, when a gunman killed 6 and wounded 19 \nothers on a commuter train--he was only brought down when he finally \nstopped to reload.\n  In Pearl, MS, in 1997 when two students were killed.\n  In Paducah, KY, in 1998 when three students were killed.\n  In Jonesboro, AR, in 1998 when five were killed, and ten more \nwounded.\n  In Springfield, OR, in 1998 when two were killed, and 22 wounded.\n  In Atlanta, GA, in 1999 when a troubled day trader killed his wife, \ntwo children and several people trading stocks.\n  At a Granada Hills, CA Jewish Community Center when a gunman wounded \nthree and killed one.\n  At a Fort Worth, TX Baptist church where seven were killed and seven \nmore wounded at a teen church event, all by a man with two guns and 9 \nhigh capacity clips, with a capacity of 15 rounds each.\n  And the list goes on, and on.\n  Just last week, I spoke at the funeral of San Francisco Police \nOfficer Isaac Espinoza, who was shot and killed by a gang member armed \nwith an AK-47 and a 30-round clip. Officer Espinoza took three shots in \nhis back as a gunman fired 15 rounds in just seconds, giving Officer \nEspinoza and his partner, who was also shot, no time to seek refuge.\n  Officer Espinoza was a bright young star in the San Francisco Police \nDepartment, and he had a promising future and loving family. Now, that \nfuture is gone. His wife Renata is without a husband. His beautiful \nthree-year-old girl Isabella is without a father.\n  These are the real consequences of assault weapons. This is not a \npolitical debate about a theoretical issue. This is about the death, \nand tragedy, and loss.\n  That is why Senator Warner, Senator Schumer and I are seeking to pass \nlegislation to reauthorize the federal assault weapons ban for another \n10 years, before it expires on September 13 of this year.\n  This amendment received 52 votes in this body just last month, but \nthe NRA scuttled the underlying gun immunity bill rather than allow the \nassault weapons bill to pass.\n  As a result, we are running out of time. The ban expires on September \n13th of this year. We cannot afford to let these weapons back on our \nstreets. We owe the American people more than that. It is just that \nsimple.\n  This should really be an easy issue.\n  After all, this amendment already passed the Senate once.\n  The President has said many times that he supports the current law, \nand supports renewing the current law.\n  Every major law enforcement organization in the country supports \nrenewing the ban, as do countless civic organizations, including: \nFraternal Order of Police, National League of Cities, United States \nConference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, International Brotherhood of Police \nOfficers, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Education \nAssociation, NAACP, and the American Bar Association.\n  And the list goes on, and on.\n  More than three-fourths of the American people, and two-thirds of gun \nowners, support renewing the ban.\n  In a poll conducted by Mark Penn and Associates October 1-6 of last \nyear: 77 percent of all likely voters supported renewing the assault \nweapons ban; Only 21 percent opposed renewal; 72 percent of Republicans \nsupported renewing the ban, as did 71 percent of those describing \nthemselves as ``conservatives''; 66 percent of gun owners supported \nrenewal, and only 32 percent of gun owners opposed it.\n  So one might wonder, why don't we just pass the ban by unanimous \nconsent, get it through the House and have it signed into law tomorrow?\n  But an interesting dynamic is at work here. An interesting dynamic \nthat relates to one, very powerful interest group that has violated the \ntrust of its members and has used threats, distortions and bullying \ntactics to fight against common sense gun control at every level, and \nat all costs.\n  That group, of course, is the National Rifle Association.\n  But it is my hope that in the coming weeks, this body will stand up \nto the NRA and instead listen to the President of the United States, \nwho supports the ban.\n  Listen to law enforcement all across the nation who know that this \nban makes sense, and saves lives.\n  Listen to the studies that show that crime with assault weapons of \nall kinds has decreased by 50 to 66 percent since the ban took effect \nalmost ten years ago.\n  A 1999 National Institute of Justice Study found that crime gun \ntraces of assault weapons fell 20 percent in just the first year \nfollowing enactment of the ban, from 4,0777 traces in 1994 to just \n3,268 in 1995.\n  Murder rates that year dropped 6.7 percent below what they had been \nprojected to be before the ban, once researchers had isolated for other \nfactors.\n  Murders of police officers with assault weapons also dropped from \nabout 16 percent of gun murders of police in 1994 and early 1995 to 0 \npercent in the latter half of 1995 and 1996.\n  A recent study released by the Brady Center shows that the proportion \nof assault weapons used in crimes fell from a high of 6.15 percent in \nthe year before the ban, to just 2.57 percent by 2001. This is a 58 \npercent decrease in just 8 years, and includes not only the banned \nguns, but copycat guns, as well.\n  The analysis in this study was performed by Gerald Nunziato, who for \n8 years served as the Special Agent in Charge of ATF's National Tracing \nCenter. So this is not some fly-by-night study. This is by the one \nperson who perhaps knows what these numbers mean better than anybody.\n  This follows a statistical analysis by the Department of Justice \nindicating that banned assault weapons used in crime fell by an even \ngreater percentage--almost 66 percent--between 1995 and 2001.\n  The bottom line is that this ban has worked.\n  If we let these guns back on the streets, we open the door to more \nand more killings.\n  If we let these guns back on the streets, we tell Steve Sposato, \nwhose wife Jody was killed in the 101 California shooting more than ten \nyears ago, that we have forgotten his pain.\n  If we let these guns back on the streets, we send an invitation to \nterrorists to come to America and arm themselves, as recommended in an \nAl Qaeda training manual. Is now the time to do this?\n  If we let these guns back on the streets, we ignore ten years of \nsuccess.\n  What is the argument for letting these banned guns back on the \nstreets?\n  Who is clamoring for newly manufactured AK-47s?\n  Who is clamoring for new TEC-9s?\n  These are guns that are never used for hunting. They are not used for \nself defense, and if they are it is more likely that they will kill \ninnocents than intruders.\n  These guns--and everyone knows it--have but one purpose, and that \npurpose is to kill other human beings. Why would we want to open the \nfloodgates again and let them back on our streets? There is simply no \ngood reason.\n  So in the coming weeks I will again offer my amendment to extend the \nassault weapons ban, and I urge the President to come forward and ``put \nhis money where his mouth is'' in terms of helping us get this \nlegislation passed.\n  The families of the students killed at Columbine five years ago, \nOfficer Espinoza's wife, and so many other victims fo gun violence \ndemand that we act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4154-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4154-S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NOMINATION OF EPA DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR STEPHEN JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on March 10, I announced my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the \nnomination of Stephen Johnson to be Deputy Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA. I did this because I had been \ntrying to obtain information concerning EPA's decision to become \ninvolved with the City of Portland combined sewer overflow program \nsince last August. Despite numerous requests, EPA failed to answer my \nquestions and failed to provide me with the documents I had requested, \nwith the exception of a limited number of documents that EPA\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nwould have to provide to any requester under the Freedom of Information \nAct, FOIA.\n  Today, I am releasing my hold on Mr. Steve Johnson to acknowledge \nthat EPA has made a good faith effort to provide documents on the \nPortland sewer situation since I placed a hold on his nomination. \nAlthough I am lifting my hold on Mr. Johnson, I remain troubled by \nEPA's policy for withholding documents from Members of the Senate and \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, in particular. I believe \nthe EPA position on this critical issue is contrary to the law and the \ncontrolling court decisions. I have also voiced my concern that EPA \npolicy would mean the end of Congressional oversight. I believe that \nSenators should not be forced to place holds on nominees in order to \nobtain documents they need to conduct their oversight duties as members \nof the committee with primary responsibility for oversight of EPA.\n  I will lift my hold on Mr. Johnson's nomination today to acknowledge \nrecent EPA efforts to respond to my requests. I will also be monitoring \nEPA cooperation in responding to my requests for information in the \nfuture. And if EPA again tries to stonewall as it did to my requests \nfor information on the Portland sewers, I will put a hold on other EPA \nnominations if that is what it takes to get the agency's attention and \ncooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4155-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OFFICER ISAAC ANTHONY ESPINOZA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have just returned from San Francisco, a \ncity whose heart has been broken by the tragic shooting death of a \nbrave young police officer. On April 10, Isaac Espinoza was killed in \nthe line of duty at the age of 29.\n  Officer Espinoza died doing the duty he loved: protecting the \ncommunity from gang violence. He had volunteered to work as a plain \nclothes officer in the gang suppression unit of Bayview Police Station, \nwhere he served with distinction for 7 of his 8 years on the San \nFrancisco police force.\n  Officer Espinoza was well known and liked in the Bayview \nneighborhood. Residents trusted him, and they appreciated his efforts \nto defuse violence and get guns off the streets. His outstanding work \nwas recognized by the Police Department, which honored him with a \nSilver Medal of Valor and a Purple Heart as well as a Police Commission \ncommendation.\n  Isaac Espinoza was also a loving husband, father, and son. My heart \ngoes out to his wife, daughter, and family. I want them to know that \nthe entire community shares their grief. All San Francisco feels the \nloss of Isaac's death, just as we all appreciate the gift of his life \nand work.\n  A gallant police officer is gone, but he will not be forgotten. We \ncan and must carry on his work by giving community police officers and \nother first responders the resources they need to bring peace and \nsafety to our Nation's streets and neighborhoods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4155-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, due to a previous obligation, I was unable \nto vote on the conference report to H.R. 3108, the Pension Funding \nEquity Act of 2004. If I had been present, I would have voted in \nsupport of the conference report. I appreciate the work done on this \nconference report by my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Gregg, \nMcConnell, Baucus, and Kennedy. As others have mentioned before, this \nlegislation is very important to many businesses and their employees \nsuffering from the recent economic downturn and in need of pension \nrelief that the act will provide.\n  While the act will help millions of employees who are covered under \nthis measure, I am concerned that approximately 9.7 million Americans \nwho belong to multi-employer pension plans, many of them in the \nconstruction industry, who are facing the same problems as employees \ncovered by other pension plans, will not be receiving this relief. In \nJanuary, when the Senate overwhelmingly passed H.R. 3108, we agreed \nthat our pension laws should affect not just single-employer plans but \nalso multi-employer plans. We thought including multi-employers was \nfair and just. Unfortunately, in conference, there were some that \nagreed with the Bush administration that multi-employer plans should \nonly receive partial relief. Some would say that the relief will be \nfour percent, others will say it is even less than that. All I know is \nthat millions of hardworking Americans, who report to work just as any \nother employee, will not receive this relief.\n  However, with the April 15 deadline where many employers were facing \nan inflated contribution to their pension plans and the \nadministration's threat of a veto if the final bill included multi-\nemployer relief, I could not penalize approximately 35 million \nAmericans who are covered by single-employer defined benefit plans. The \nlow 30-year Treasury bond interest rates and the unpredictable stock \nmarket have adversely affected many companies that contribute to these \ndefined benefit plans.

Erin wrote the following essay for a school-\nwide contest for American Education Week on the topic ``Great public \nschools for every child--America's promise.'' Erin's eloquent and \ninspiring words remind us of the importance of education in America. I \nwould like to take a moment to share with you what Erin Smalley wrote \nin her essay, A Passion for Education.\n\n       William Butler Yeats, an Irish poet who won the Nobel Prize \n     for Literature in 1923, once said, ``Education is not the \n     filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.'' He made an \n     excellent point, but reading through is quote just once will \n     not make the meaning sink in. I am going to break it down to \n     make it more easily understood.\n       The first part of Yeats' quote states, ``Education is not \n     the filling of a pail.'' I believe it means this: Education \n     is not just putting information and knowledge into someone's \n     mind. You can't dump fact, after fact, after fact onto \n     someone because it will just go in one ear and out the other. \n     Putting a lot of information into someone's head is just like \n     filling a pail with a lot of water. It will probably just sit \n     there, but it won't sink in. That is why education means \n     something more.\n       The rest of the quote says: ``. . . but the lighting of a \n     fire.'' I believe this means that education is all about \n     enlightening students and making them wonder. To light their \n     fire is to make them want to learn more, to build a passion \n     for what they are being taught. When they have an interest, \n     then they will go for it. When kids are given an education, \n     and they discover a passion for something important to them, \n     then they will go higher and higher and never give up, until \n     they reach their dreams. When the light goes on, that's when \n     they start to discover and learn. That's when education is \n     most important, because then it will hopefully become a \n     turning point in their life.\n       Everyone should get to go to a free school to learn freely \n     and learn new things. I want every kid to be able to have a \n     passion for something, and be able to have the chance to go \n     for their dreams. I want every kid to get the chance, because \n     it's not fair if only some do. I hope that having an \n     education will light all of the flames, and not just fill up \n     the pails.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4155-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4155-S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CENTRAL COLLEGE SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last fall, Central College kicked \noff a year of festivities to celebrate its sesquicentennial. Founded in \n1853 by a determined group of immigrants from the Netherlands, Central \nCollege has grown in size and stature during the last century and a \nhalf, but remains grounded in the tradition and faith of its founders. \nThis weekend, the celebration continues with the Happy Birthday Dear \nCentral Gala.\n  Currently affiliated with the Reformed Church in America, the college \nwas originally created through the efforts of the Baptists of Iowa. The \nIowa Baptist Society worked to establish an ``institution of liberal \nand sacred learning'' in the early days of our State. An enterprising, \nopen-minded Pella resident, Dominie Scholte, believed in the\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\npower of higher education and campaigned to bring the new institution \nto his community. Scholte, a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, \nsealed the deal for Pella by donating land and money to the new school.\n  The new Central University of Iowa opened its doors on October 8, \n1854, with 37 students in a rented buildlng on Washington Street. From \na humble beginning, Central College has grown into a state-of-the-art \nliberal arts college with 1,700 students. The college offers degrees in \n36 disciplines and is well known for its ambitious study abroad \nprogram.\n  The study abroad program began in the summer of 1962 when a group of \nCentral students ventured to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The \nprogram also sent students to Paris, France the following summer and \nwas expanded to a full year of study in 1965. The popularity of the \nprogram and the number of foreign locations has increased and now \nincludes England, Wales, Austria, Spain, Holland, China and Kenya. \nToday, approximately half of Central students spend at least one \nsemester aboard.\n  Central College alumni, students, staff and Pella residents have \nparticipated in a variety of special events over the past several \nmonths. The sesquicentennial celebration has showcased the strong \nliberal arts tradition of the college with special performances, \nlectures, exhibits and social events. As the college community comes \ntogether for the Happy Birthday Dear Central Gala, I offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations on 150 years of excellence in the education and my best \nwishes to Central College for the next 150 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4156-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF THE LADY PANTHERS OF DRURY UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Drury \nUniversity Lady Panthers basketball team on their fantastic march to \nthe NCAA Division II championship game in St. Joseph, MO, on March 27, \n2004. Fans and alumni in Southwest Missouri and across the country are \njustifiably proud of the Lady Panthers.\n  For years fans from the great State of Missouri have enjoyed watching \nsome of America's most outstanding sports legends. The Lady Panthers \nare continuing this tradition of excellence, ending their year with an \nenviable record of 36-2. In an amazing performance, the Drury team \nbattled until the end for the NCAA Division II National Championship. \nIn the words of Coach Nyla Milleson, it was a tremendous journey.\n  What makes this story remarkable is the fact that the Lady Panthers \nbasketball team was established just 4 years ago under the direction of \nthe late Dr. Bruce Harger, Drury's athletic director for 15 years. Many \nteams work for years to gain preeminence and respect in their sport. \nThanks to the brilliant coaching of Nyla Milleson and her staff, along \nwith the team's strong commitment and hard work, the Lady Panthers were \nable to achieve this distinction in a very short time.\n  Coach Milleson skillfully assembled a group of talented young women, \nmany from southwest Missouri where basketball takes center stage in \nmost communities during the winter months. The women's team played \ntheir first game in 2000, joining a Drury men's team that is rich in \ntradition. With strong support from the University and its boosters, \nthe Lady Panthers enjoyed immediate success, culminating in their \nchampionship appearance this March.\n  Long known for academics, Drury University can now add women's \nbasketball to its list of nationally recognized sports programs, \ncontinuing its tradition of excellence. There is no doubt that the \nDrury Lady Panthers are poised to compete in many more games. I \ncongratulate Coach Milleson and all the Lady Panthers team members, \ncoaches and supporters who worked hard to turn their dreams into \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4156-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO MR.

Mr. DiBello then worked his way through the Covington Community \nas an outreach worker, community organizer and program director. As he \nrose through the ranks, his dedication to the community and list of \nachievements only grew.\n  Some of Mr. DiBello's early accomplishments include organizing \ngrassroots efforts for welfare reform and developing the Covington \nNeighborhood Action Coalition, now known as the Covington Neighborhood \nCollaborative.\n  Mr. DiBello is responsible for marked growth of the Community Center, \ntransforming it from a small organization on the west side of Covington \nto a truly city-wide support and development organization. From \ndeveloping partnerships to running a capital campaign, Tom's leadership \nhas been integral to the success of the Covington Community Center.\n  Congratulations again, Mr. DiBello, on your dedicated service to the \nCovington Community Center. You are an inspiration for all of us \nthroughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We look forward to your \ncontinued success and achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4156-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4156-S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALEC BRINDLE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes to offer a tribute to a very significant figure in one of my \nState's largest industries: seafood processing. This man is Alec \nBrindle, who was for many years with Wards Cove Packing Company, and \nwho has now entered retirement. In addition to having played an \nimportant role in the development of Alaska's salmon industry, Alec has \nalso been a friend of mine, and of my family, for many years. It seems \nto me that anyone with the stamina and perseverance to work in the fish \nbusiness for 50 years deserves some recognition.\n  Although Alec was born in the Seattle area, his life has long been \ntied to Alaska's fisheries. Almost his entire extended family has been \ninvolved in Alaskan fisheries since well before Alaskan statehood. As a \nyoung boy he spent summers in Ketchikan, at first playing around the \ncannery, and then, at age 13, he began his career as an employee of the \nfamily salmon packing operation. This was the beginning of a career, \nand a commitment, that would last for 50 years. Alec is one of those \npeople about whom you can say, ``He has truly seen it all''. At various \npoints in his long career fish prices for red salmon have varied from \npennies a pound to a point in the late 1980's when a single fish was \nworth more than a barrel of North Slope crude oil. As Alec himself has \npointed out, the fish business is one where at the beginning of the \nseason the processor doesn't know how much fish he will be able to buy, \nwhat price he will pay, or at what price he will be able to sell the \nfinished product. Needless to say, trying to craft and maintain a \nbusiness plan under such circumstances is not an easy task. But Alec, \nto his great credit, was able to maintain his grace and charm in the \nface of all these challenges. He was a true gentleman in a very tough \nbusiness.\n  Alec did take enough time off from the family business to obtain a \nlaw degree. He spent a year clerking for well known Alaska Supreme \nCourt Justice John Dimond. Since Alaska had only recently been granted \nstatehood, these were exciting times for our young State as we sorted \nthrough the growing pains of creating a judicial system. As a young \nattorney Alec contributed to this process.\n  Most people outside of Alaska aren't aware that the fishing industry \nhas traditionally been my State's largest private employer. Each year, \nthousands of fishermen and other workers come to Alaska to help in the \nharvesting and processing of the amazing variety of fishery resources \nof my State. Although most of Alec's career was spent in the salmon \nbusiness, he and his family have also been involved in the crab, \nherring and groundfish sectors. Many fishermen and processing workers \nhave spent their entire careers enjoying an association with Alec and \nother members of the Brindle family.\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\n  But Alec didn't just make a living from Alaska's fisheries; he also \ngave back a great deal. He was always active in the various industry \ntrade associations which work to maintain the sustainability and \nprofitability of our fisheries. Among these were the Pacific Seafood \nProcessors Association, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, the \nNational Fisheries Institute, and the National Food Processors \nAssociation. Alec's other business activities resulted in his being \nnamed to the Board of Advisors for Wells Fargo Alaska and becoming \nChairman of the Board of the Tongass Trading Company.\n  Achieving educational goals has always been very important to the \nBrindles and in addition to his law degree, Alec proudly holds an \nHonorary Doctorate degree from the University of Alaska Southeast. And \nthe Brindle family has also provided generous financial assistance to \nmany young Alaskans seeking higher education through their support of \nthe Winn Brindle Scholarship program, named for Alec's father.\n  After knowing Alec for so many years, it is hard for me to believe \nthat he will no longer be actively involved in the seafood industry on \na day-to-day basis. However, I know him well enough to say that he \nisn't about to head for a rocking chair. He will undoubtedly continue \nto share his time and expertise with those in the seafood industry, and \nthroughout Alaska. He will be missed, but his many contributions and \nachievements will live on for many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4157-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4157-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4157-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on today, April 20, 2004, \nshe had presented to the President of the United States the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2057.

A bill to extend the deadline on the use of technology \nstandards for the passports of visa waiver participants; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nChambliss and the other cosponsors on this important bipartisan bill to \nprevent serious problems for both border security and our travel and \ntourism industries.\n  These provisions, called the Visa Waiver Program Compliance \nAmendments of 2004, will extend for 2 additional years the October 26 \ndeadline in current law for countries participating in the Visa Waiver \nProgram to begin issuing biometric passports.\n  It has become increasingly clear in recent months that this extension \nis essential. Strengthening the security of the Nation's borders is a \ncritical part of the ongoing effort to prevent future terrorist \nattacks. A key part of meeting our security needs is the use of \ntechnology to screen out potential terrorists. We enacted specific \nlegislation 2 years ago to authorize the development and implementation \nof biometric identification methods for visas and other immigration \ndocuments, in order to produce better screening of foreign nationals \ntraveling to the United States, and provide front-line agencies with \nbetter intelligence for their decisions on applications for admission.\n  Good technology is essential in fulfilling this mission. So are \nhiring additional personnel, retaining experienced workers, providing \nadequate training, and developing effective ways to facilitate \ncoordination and information-sharing among Federal agencies. These \nmeasures all enhance our security and create protections against \npotential terrorist attacks.\n  If we do not extend the biometric passport requirement for countries \nin the Visa Waiver Program, we will lose the real value of that \nparticular protection. The current deadline has turned out to be \nimpractical, because it forces countries to meet it, even if they are \nnot ready to do so. The biometric passport process has been plagued \nwith legitimate problems of global interoperability, privacy, chip \ndurability, and production and procurement delays. The deadline was not \nrealistic even from the start, and it is now clear that countries are \nunable to meet it.\n  As an official from the Department of Homeland Security testified at \na recent Judiciary Committee hearing, ``If we force people to rapidly \ntry to meet the deadline, we are going to get inferior technology that \nis going to be much more difficult for us to make useful at the ports \nof entry.''\n  If we do that, our borders won't be safe. Inferior technology was not \nwhat was intended when Congress passed the Border Security Act.\n  In addition to the danger to border security, the current deadline \nwill have a harsh economic impact. If countries miss the deadline, all \ntheir tourists and business travelers will have to obtain visas. The \nState Department estimates that over 5 million visas will need to be \nissued in the first year. Department officials believe that even with \nadditional staffing for granting visas, they could process only about \n10 percent of the additional workload.\n  The resulting delays in granting visas would obviously prevent large \nnumbers of legitimate travelers from coming to the United States and \nproduce chaos in the Visa Waiver Program. The Department of Commerce \nestimates that ``the elimination of the program would cost the United \nStates economy $28 billion in tourism-related exports over the next \nfive years, result in a loss of 475,000 jobs, and completely erode the \ntravel-trade surplus.''\n  We all agree that we need to screen out terrorists, but we need to do \nso in ways that will not increase our border security problems instead \nof solving them. I urge my colleagues to support this needed \nlegislation. It is not a setback for the war on terrorism to wage it \nmore realistically.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Kennedy, a bill to extend the biometric deadline that is \ncurrently set for October 26, 2004 in accordance with the Enhanced \nBorder Security Act. Our bill will extend the deadline to November 30, \n2006 in an overall effort to improve our homeland security.\n  The biometric passport requirement applies to the 27 visa-waiver \ncountries. Millions of these foreign citizens travel to the United \nStates each year for tourism or business and currently these citizens \nare not required to obtain a visa to enter the United States. All other \ncountries must obtain a visa which includes an interview and background \ncheck at the overseas consulate.\n  There are a number of significant reasons for extending the deadline. \nI have heard from many businesses very concerned about the adverse \nimpact of the current deadline on travel and tourism to the United \nStates and negative effect on our economy as a result. I have heard \nfrom the State Department and Department of Homeland Security about the \nlack of manpower to conduct interviews and issue visas to over 5 \nmillion new entrants per year. But the strongest reason to move the \ndeadline is that it is in our best interests for homeland security.\n  This bill will allow visa-waiver countries to implement the most \neffective biometric technology to deter terrorists from entering the \nUnited States. Although the United States is not requires by law to \nmeet the same standards, today we are still a ways off from \nimplementing biometric features in our passports. Passage of this bill \nwill encourage our allies in the war on terror to continue in their \ncooperation with us and our security efforts both at home and abroad. \nIn conjunction with extending the deadline, the US VISIT entry-exit \nsystem will apply to all visa-waiver country entrants. Under US VISIT, \nthese foreign visitors will undergo the same security measures, \nincluding fingerprinting, which other visitors must meet.\n  A couple of weeks ago I held a hearing in my Immigration and Border \nSecurity Subcommittee on the topic of border security. Several Senators \nasked questions concerning the biometric deadline, and Department of \nHomeland Security Assistant Secretary Stewart Verdery made the case. \nSecretary Verdery said: ``We have gone to Congress and asked for this \nextension, and we believe that within 2 years those countries will be \nable to meet the deadline, The technology will be more mature. It will \nmake sense to have it in place at that time. . . . If we force people \nto rapidly try to meet the deadline, we are going to get inferior \ntechnology that is going to be much more difficult for us to make \nuseful at the ports of entry.''\n  Since September 11, the administration has taken significant and \neffective steps to strengthen our homeland security. The entry-exit \nsystem, US VISIT, is up-and-running and now collecting information on \naliens traveling to the U.S. through air and sea ports. The Department \nof Homeland Security has the SEVIS foreign student tracking system in \nplace and doing its job.\n  The President has created the Terrorist Screening Center to improve \ninformation-sharing and coordinate our\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\nefforts. The extension of the biometric deadline is another step in the \nright direction as we fight the war on terror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4161-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 341--TO URGE THE RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS RELATED TO THE \n      CONFISCATION OF CERTAIN PROPERTY BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ITALY\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise to \nsubmit a resolution designating the 30th day of April 2004 as Dia de \nlos Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans.\n  Nations throughout the world, especially within Latin America, \ncelebrate Dia de los Ninos on the 30th of April, in recognition and \ncelebration of their country's future--their children. Many Americans \nHispanic families continue the tradition of honoring their children on \nthis special day by celebrating Dia de los Ninos in their homes.\n  We have no greater resource than our children and the designation of \na day to honor them will help affirm their importance to the future of \nour country. This special recognition of children will also affirm to \nthe people of the United States the significance of family, education, \nand community.\n  This resolution calls on the American people to join with all \nchildren, families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and \nstates across the Nation to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies \nand activities.\n  I urge you to join me in supporting America's youth by supporting \nthis resolution designating April 30, 2004 Dia de los Ninos: \nCelebrating Young Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4161-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4161-S4162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to \naddress the pending issue of asbestos reform legislation. It is a very \nserious and complicated issue. I look forward to speaking for a few \nmoments about what I consider to be the history of this issue and the \nway we should respond to it.\n  Before doing so, I am compelled to address the previous speaker, my \ncolleague and friend from the State of Texas, Senator Cornyn, who, \nwithin the last hour or so, spoke on this floor about the PATRIOT Act. \nThe reason why this is an issue of great importance to many of us is \nthat it is a law which all but one Senator voted for, and it is a law \nwhich many of us, on both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, \nbelieve has some serious weaknesses and flaws that need to be remedied.\n  In response, I have introduced a bill called the SAFE Act with \nSenator Larry Craig of Idaho. Senator Craig and I are about as far \napart on the political spectrum as humanly possible. Yet we have come \ntogether with the understanding that whether you are conservative or \nprogressive liberal--whatever your label may be--we all value our \nconstitutional rights in America.\n  Senator Craig and I looked closely at the PATRIOT Act and think that \nthere are three or four specific areas that need to be addressed.\n  However, President Bush wants to keep the PATRIOT Act as it is, \nmaking it permanent law, and change some provisions to give the \nGovernment even more power and further reduce judicial oversight. He \nhas chosen to make this one of the bedrocks of his campaign for \nreelection. My friend from Texas, Senator Cornyn, and the President \nhave made an issue over differences that they have with Senator John \nKerry on this issue.\n  I call the attention of the President and his supporters to the fact \nthat the SAFE Act, which we brought to the floor, enjoys bipartisan \nsponsorship. In fact, when we had the press conference announcing the \nchanges we proposed for the PATRIOT Act, we were joined by some of the \nmost liberal and the most conservative organizations in Washington.\n  Rarely do they come together. But on the issue of civil rights and \nconstitutional rights, we finally find common ground. Yet the President \nsees it differently, and Senator Cornyn as well.\n  A little history is worth noting at this moment. We all remember \nSeptember 11, 2001, and what happened, the fear we had that another \nattack might be imminent, and because of the belief that the Government \nneeded additional tools and weapons to fight terrorism, there was a \nbipartisan effort between Congress and the White House to write a bill \ngiving our Government more authority and more power to deal with \nterrorism, changes in the law which were long overdue to deal with \nmodern technology and the scope of the terrorist threat.\n  The bill was debated on a bipartisan basis and passed the Senate and \nthe House with overwhelming numbers of support. We understood as well \nthat September 11, 2001, was a unique moment in American history and \nthat our response was not only to the terrible tragedy of September 11 \nbut also to many of the fears which were welling in the breasts of \nevery American family. Because of our concern that this fear and \nemotion may have taken us too far in the PATRIOT Act, we put in an \ninsurance policy. We said, after a period of time, after a few years, \nwe are going to come back and look at many elements of this law. We are \nnot going to make it permanent forever. We will come back after a few \nyears and decide whether we went too far.\n  In the heat of the moment with the fear of September 11, did we give \nthe Government more power than was necessary to protect us? Did we \nendanger or in any way lessen our constitutional protections more than \nnecessary? So this review provision, this sunset clause, was just \nbasically common sense.\n  The President has chosen this as one of his areas of attack, and his \nargument yesterday was, why do we need to review this law? Is the \nthreat of terrorism gone now?\n  I think the President does not understand why this sunset provision \nwas put in the law. I am certain we will decide that the majority of \nthe elements of the PATRIOT Act are still necessary, but that does not \nmean that every word in that act should be treated like the Ten \nCommandments. We need to take that act and honestly ask whether it was \ndone in the heat of the moment, whether too much authority was given to \nthe Government, and whether we have infringed basic liberties and \nrights which we are here to protect.\n  The President and Senator Cornyn seem to argue that it is the burden \nof the citizens of America to come forward and explain why their rights \nshould not be taken away by the Government. I think they are both \ntotally wrong. It is the burden of the Government to announce and \nrationalize why any individual rights of American citizens should ever \nbe taken away. These God-given rights, as we refer to them in the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution, are basically ours by \nvirtue of our human existence. For any government to take them away, \nthere must be a compelling reason.\n  The PATRIOT Act gets to the issue of privacy and freedom versus \nsecurity and government control. We recognized in the PATRIOT Act the \nneed for the government to monitor the new powers carefully. The 4-year \nsunset provision will force Congress and the administration to honestly \nlook at the PATRIOT Act and see if we have gone too far.\n  Some provisions expire at the end of 2005. None of them expire at the \nend of this year. So there is no need to reconsider the PATRIOT Act \nthis year. This has a lot more to do with an election in November than \nthe act itself. If nothing is done by Congress, the Government will \ncontinue to have all of its authority under the PATRIOT Act through \nthis year and into next year.\n  We wanted to keep the review of the PATRIOT Act out of election year \npolitics, and that is why the sunset was 2005. Sadly, the Bush \nadministration and their supporters in Congress want to put the PATRIOT \nAct on the 50-yard line, right in the middle of this titanic gridiron \nbattle between the two political parties for the Presidency. That is \nunfortunate. The issues of security for America--stopping terrorism--\nshould not be politicized this year. I hope they will not be, but sadly \nthat is what is happening.\n  Think of this for a moment: The President and the White House \nthreatened to veto the reform bill which Senator Craig and I have \nintroduced, the bipartisan SAFE Act, even before it was heard in \ncommittee, even before there was an attempt to amend it, even before \nthere was a vote in either the Senate or the House. It is rare, if not \nunprecedented, for the President and White House to threaten a veto on \na bill so soon after it has been introduced. It shows me that the \nPresident is raising this bill to such a high profile in an effort to \nmake it a central part of a political campaign, rather than focusing on \nprotecting America.\n\n  During the course of his campaign, Senator Kerry said that in his \nfirst 100 days as President he wants to end the era of John Ashcroft. \nJohn Kerry has promised to strengthen terrorism laws that work, \nstrengthen money laundering laws to end funds for terrorists, improve \ninformation gathering and protect the basic rights and liberties of all \nof our citizens.\n  Senator Kerry and I support the SAFE Act, this bipartisan effort to \nreform the PATRIOT Act. Here are several of the most important \nprovisions: It will protect innocent people from Government snooping by \neliminating John Doe roving wiretaps, which do not identify the person \nor place being tapped. It requires warrants for roving wiretaps to \nidentify either the target\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\nof the wiretap or the places to be tapped. So we say to the Government, \nif they are going to intercept my conversations at unspecified \nlocations, they must say to the court that they are going after this \nparticular person. They cannot have a wiretap that might sweep up the \nconversations of my family, my business, my church, whatever it happens \nto be, without specifically saying to the court, this is the person \nthat we want to wiretap, or this is the phone, this is the place that \nwe want to wiretap. That specificity has always been part of the law. \nTo get away from John Doe roving wiretaps, which allow the Government \nto just swoop in and collect information and then take a look at it to \nsee if there is anything there of concern, goes way beyond the \nauthority needed to protect America.\n  This SAFE Act will also impose limits on the Government's ability to \ncarry out what are called sneak-and-peek searches by requiring that \nimmediate notice of a search be given unless the notice would endanger \na person's life or physical safety, or result in flight from \nprosecution or the destruction of evidence.\n  We have seen on television and in the movies and perhaps in real life \nthe knock on the door and someone has a warrant in their hand, issued \nby a judge, which says, we have a warrant to search the premises and we \nare coming in. This is very common. But when it comes to these sneak-\nand-peek warrants, the search can be undertaken on anyone's premises \nwithout immediate notification if that notice would jeopardize an \ninvestigation or delay a trial. This could apply in almost every case. \nWe say that immediate notification has to be given of a search unless \nthere is a compelling reason not to--a person's life or physical safety \nis in danger or there is a risk of flight from prosecution or evidence \nbeing destroyed.\n  Third, it protects libraries and bookstores from Government fishing \nexpeditions, but still allows the FBI to follow up on legitimate leads. \nThis is an issue that really touched a lot of people. To think that \nbecause I use the Springfield public library or the library in the City \nof Chicago that somehow the books that I check out are going to be \nexamined by the FBI to see if I am a suspicious person even though \nthere is no specific reason to look at me goes way too far.\n  None of the changes we suggest will interfere with law enforcement \nand intelligence officials preventing terrorism. We retain all of the \npowers of the PATRIOT Act, but we restore safeguards that are \nindispensable to democracy and civil liberties. These safeguards are a \ncontinuing source of our country's strength. They are not luxuries or \ninconveniences to be dumped in time of crisis.\n  I am afraid the administration wants just the opposite. The President \nwants even broader powers than the PATRIOT Act now allows. Yesterday he \ncalled for a new law to let Federal agents obtain private records and \nconduct secret interrogations without the approval of a judge or even a \nFederal prosecutor. This goes way beyond anything that we have ever \nseen in terms of trying to make America safe. It really infringes on \nour basic rights. We all agree that law enforcement needs the tools to \nprotect us, but President Bush cannot point to a single terrorism \ninvestigation in which officials had any problem obtaining the court \norders they needed. Yet he is asking for expanded authority that would \nundermine civil liberties and judicial review. Frankly, our current \nlaws are adequate to the task. We need to bring terrorism under control \nbut not at the expense of our basic rights as citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4166-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4166-S4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ASBESTOS BILL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The bill pending before us is known as the Hatch-Frist \nasbestos bill. Asbestos is a common material that those of us my age \nremember throughout our lives. It has been used in building materials, \ntiles, insulation, coverings for pipes, and so many different uses. We \nused to view it as that fireproof material that was safe and, frankly, \nprotected us. Over the years, we came to learn that it was much \ndifferent. It turns out that asbestos is an insidious threat to public \nhealth. It is insidious, in that there is virtually no safe level of \nexposure. It is insidious in that it is a random killer. We know of \nworkers who have been in the asbestos industry their entire lives and \nnever once showed any problem--no illness, no symptom, nothing. We know \nin the same circumstances that many of these workers find that their \nwives have come down with serious asbestos-related diseases, even \nthough their wives never set foot in their workplace. Puzzled by this, \nwe started looking into it and found that even though the worker might \nnot have been susceptible to asbestos-related diseases, his wife, who \nmerely laundered his clothes, picked up enough dust in that process to \nend up infected, diseased, and destined to die. That is how it is such \na random killer.\n\n  We also know, despite all of the compelling evidence about the danger \nof asbestos, that we continue to import massive amounts of asbestos \neach year in the United States. While we sit here and argue about how \nthe companies responsible for asbestos-related disease and death should \nbe held liable, when we talk about how victims should recover, the \nsimple reality is that asbestos is alive and well and still to be found \nacross America. New victims of asbestos are being created every single \nday by companies that know the risk and are willing to endanger their \ncustomers and employees for profit.\n  I don't have a lot of sympathy for those companies. They know the \ndanger and they continue to use asbestos in some forms in a dangerous \nmanner.\n  It is regrettable that the bill before us today did not go through \ncommittee. It is regrettable this bill was not debated. This is an \nextremely important issue. Twenty years ago, I was a brand new \nCongressman and I was invited to fly to Colorado right outside Denver \nto visit the national headquarters of Johns Manville Corporation. I \ndidn't know why they wanted me out there 20 years ago, but they asked \nme to come out so I did fly out. I went to this beautiful headquarters, \nlocated outside of Denver in a magnificent building, and they told me \nthey were having a problem with asbestos-related lawsuits.\n  At that time, in August of 1982, Johns Manville was preparing to file \nfor bankruptcy protection because of the lawsuits being filed against \nit. At that time, if anyone suggested that 20 years later, in 2004, \nthere would be over 70 companies facing bankruptcy, such as Johns \nManville, including some of the Nation's largest manufacturers, people \nwould have said that would be impossible. Certainly these companies \nstill would not be sued like Johns Manville and they still wouldn't be \nselling asbestos products in America in 2004, would they?\n  The simple answer is yes. Those products continue to be sold. The \npeople who were victims of those diseases continue to be discovered.\n  If anyone during the 1970s and 1980s had suggested that by the 21st \ncentury, the number of legal claims being filed for asbestos injury \nwould have been rising instead of falling, those predictions would have \nbeen ignored. Yet, those predictions have all come true. Let me show \nyou a chart to give you an idea of the incidence of asbestos-related \ndisease in America. This is for 2002.\n  If you look at asbestos-related deaths here, you will find some \n10,000 deaths. As I said, the number of deaths related to asbestos is \non the rise in America. So there are only three other areas of death \nhere that are larger in numbers: AIDS, of course, some 20,000 victims, \nalmost twice as many; alcoholic liver disease, some 12,000 victims; \nfirearm deaths, right around 12,000; and then asbestos. Then look at \nall of the other causes of death that claim fewer victims than \nasbestos: skin cancer, hepatitis, asthma, drowning, fires, Hodgkin's \ndisease, and tuberculosis.\n\n  This is a serious public health problem in America. Asbestos is an \nongoing environmental and health issue.\n  To better understand the true cost of asbestos, we need to recognize \nboth sides of the litigation, not only companies facing bankruptcy but \nvictims facing disease, debilitation, and death. From my experience \ntalking with people, it seems most Americans were under the impression \nthat asbestos has been banned.\n  I will tell you a story about that and let you know that didn't \nhappen, at least it didn't happen on a permanent basis. Asbestos is \nstill in buildings, schools, homes, offices, and workplaces--in \nautomobiles. It is in and around 200,000 miles of drinking water\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\npipes that have been underground for 40 years and are now \ndeteriorating. Sadly, very few of these items are being regulated by \nthe Government. Why? Because there has been a systematic and long-term \nfailure by the Government of this country when it comes to reining in \nasbestos use.\n  Senator Patty Murray from the State of Washington has a bill to which \nwe need to agree. It is a bill which will virtually ban, permanently, \nasbestos and asbestos products in America with few notable exceptions--\nwhere it is contained and can't be dangerous. Let me tell you the \nhistory leading up to S. 1115, the Patty Murray bill, which is so \nimportant.\n  In July of 1989, the EPA announced the manufacture and sale of most \nasbestos products would be banned. The decision came after 10 years of \nresearch and $10 million in spending. The EPA's ban was premised on \nauthority granted to it by the Toxic Substances Control Act, and it was \nintended to stop the export of asbestos from America as well. The ban \nwas instituted in three stages: a ban on roofing and flooring felt, \ntile, and clothing made from asbestos by 1990; brake linings, \ntransmission components, and the like; and a ban on the use of asbestos \nin pipes, shingles, brake blocks, paper, and the like.\n  As predicted, a lawsuit was filed by asbestos companies and \nindustrial organizations to challenge the EPA ban. The companies argued \nthe ban was just too costly for industry and that alternatives to the \nuse of asbestos were neither safe nor effective.\n  The EPA defended the proposed ban. However, it lost in the Fifth \nCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals. They said the EPA failed to demonstrate \n``substantial evidence'' to justify the ban. Specifically the circuit \ncourt found the Agency's administrative record failed to show the ban \nwas the ``least burdensome alternative'' for dealing with the \nunreasonable risk posed by asbestos. The circuit court did acknowledge \nthat asbestos was a potential cause of cancer at all levels of \nexposure--underline all levels of exposure. There is no safe level of \nexposure to asbestos. If you think, just because you have a ironing \nboard cover at home that gets hit by the iron as you are ironing your \nclothes, only a tiny bit of asbestos dust is floating around your \nhouse, be prepared to accept the obvious. It is dangerous at any level \nof exposure.\n\n  President Bush's father and his administration in 1991 would not \nappeal this decision by the Fifth Circuit, so since then, the EPA, \nunfortunately, has made no further effort to ban asbestos, and it is \ndoubtful this administration in the closing months of this year will do \nso.\n  For those who are watching this debate, following it, I recommend a \nbook that opened my eyes to the deep and sad history of the use and \nongoing danger of asbestos. The book is called ``Fatal Deception: The \nUntold Story of Asbestos.'' The author's name is Michael Bowker. He \ntalks about the hazards of asbestos discovered in the mining town of \nLibby, MT. You ought to read these stories about what happened to the \nunsuspecting miners and their families who worked for W.R. Grace and \nother companies, dealing with asbestos in Libby, MT.\n  He gives a detailed explanation of the dangers of the product, not \njust for the workers, as I said earlier, but also for their families. \nThis book, and another called ``The Asbestos Tragedy'' by Paul Brodeur, \nare significant because they reveal the deep, dark, dangerous secrets \nof asbestos mining and manufacture.\n  Let me share a few examples. By the early 1930s, asbestos workers had \ndeveloped asbestosis and were bringing lawsuits against Johns \nManville--the 1930s, more than 70 years ago. The largest asbestos \nmanufacturer--again, Johns Manville--and Raybestos-Manhattan of \nConnecticut, the second largest asbestos company, faced lawsuits. As a \nresult, the two firms, together with other leading asbestos \nmanufacturers, initiated a systematic coverup of the dangers of \nasbestos that continued for more than 40 years.\n  In 1933, Lewis Herold Brown, the president of Johns Manville, advised \nthe company's board of directors that 11 pending lawsuits brought by \nemployees who developed asbestosis while working at the company's plant \nin Manville, NJ, could be settled out of court, provided the attorney \nfor the injured employees could be persuaded not to bring any more \ncases. That is 1933. The first asbestos lawsuits were being filed, the \nfirst notice being given to American business that they were dealing \nwith a dangerous, toxic, lethal product.\n  In 1935, Sumner Simpson, the president of Raybestos-Manhattan wrote a \nletter to Vandiver Brown, of Johns Manville, telling him:\n\n       I think the less said about asbestos the better off we are.\n\n  Brown, in a followup letter, replied:\n\n       I quite agree with you that our interests are best served \n     by having asbestosis receive the minimum of publicity.\n\n  Is that corporate misconduct? Is that the kind of irresponsible \nconduct we would countenance today or even make excuses for? Or do it?\n  In 1936, Brown and Simpson, together with officials of other \ncompanies, arranged to finance animal laboratories at the Trudeau \nFoundation's Saranac Laboratory in New York. The studies showed \nsignificant numbers of animals developed asbestosis after being allowed \nto inhale it. These results were suppressed, made secret for more than \n40 years.\n\n  The case goes on and on. Some of the things that were said during the \ncourse of events are nothing short of incredible. There is one in \nparticular that is worth noting. On September 12, 1966, more than 30 \nyears after the discovery of asbestos danger to factory workers and \npeople exposed to it, E.A. Martin, the director of purchasing for \nBendix Corporation, wrote to an executive at Johns Manville. This \nletter was disclosed in the course of a lawsuit from the director of \npurchasing for Bendix Corporation writing to Johns Manville about \nasbestos.\n  He says:\n\n       So that you'll know that asbestos is not the only \n     contaminant a second article from OP Reporter assesses a \n     share of the blame on trees.\n\n  Then he closed:\n\n       My answer to the problem is: If you have enjoyed a good \n     life while working with asbestos products why not die from \n     it. There's got to be some cause.\n\n  What an attitude when it comes to the workers and the consumers of \nasbestos products.\n  When we debate this issue with appropriate sympathy for the economic \nplight of many companies that are far removed from those I quote, \nunderstand we came to this moment in our history with the epidemic of \nasbestos-related disease and death because of clear and convincing \ncorporate misconduct for 50 years. Businesses that knew better \nendangered and imperiled their workers and consumers with this product \nto make money. And the cavalier, if not demonic response, from people \nlike E.A. Martin is proof positive of that worst example of conduct.\n  During the last Congress, in September 2002, Senator Leahy held the \nfirst hearing on the state of asbestos injury litigation. We considered \nwhat we could do. Senator Hatch has held a couple of hearings since \nthen and moved the ball further along. We heard testimony from expert \nwitnesses on both sides, a lot of different stakeholders being present. \nThere is probably no issue in Washington that has received more \nattention from both sides.\n  Last spring, Senator Hatch introduced a bill as a starting point for \nnegotiation. I was skeptical of the bill but told him I was willing to \nwork with him and others in good faith to try to find a way to deal \nwith the increasing number of asbestos-related lawsuits. I generally \nsupport the concept of a no-fault trust fund. If we can reach that \nmoment in time where there is an adequate amount of money in a trust \nfund, where workers and others who have been exposed to asbestos can \nstep forward, make their medical claim, and then receive compensation \nwithout lengthy litigation and expensive attorney's fees, this is a \ngood result and a fine and positive thing.\n  I am sorry to report the bill before the Senate does not reach that \nlevel. I agree with many Illinois company representatives who have come \nto see me that they need certainty about their exposure to liability in \nthe future. We can provide it as long as we have a bill that is \nfundamentally fair.\n  I also agree with the victims of asbestos injury and their widows, \nwhom I have met, we need to come up with a quick and easy process to \nissue these\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\npayments. We have an opportunity now to do it.\n  Leading up to last summer, I thought we were going to reach that \npoint. But there were several things about Senator Hatch's original \nbill that we found out were problematic. The Hatch bill was designed to \nprovide certainty to parties who, collectively, was only going to have \npay into a trust fund about $90 billion. It did not provide certainty \nto the victims, only certainty to the companies in terms of their \nliability. Certainly, $90 billion is a lot of money, but when you look \nat the real cost we may face for asbestos-related claims in the future, \nit may not be nearly enough. We may need twice as much.\n  The committee finally increased the value of the trust fund in the \nHatch bill to $153 billion. It is interesting that after we reported \nthat bill, the insurance industry, one of the major players in \nsupplying the money for the trust fund because of their ultimate \nliability, announced they would not support it because it cost too \nmuch. We have been hung up on this issue of how much to put in the \ntrust fund.\n  There is also a question about what happens if we guess wrong. What \nif the trust fund does not have enough money? What if there are too \nmany victims? What happens to those victims if the trust fund runs out \nof money? Don Nickles, a Republican from Oklahoma, fears from his point \nof view the Government will be asked to step in and replenish the trust \nfund with unlimited liability in the future. He is so skeptical of the \namount of the trust fund in the bill pending before the Senate he \nannounced he will oppose it. He does not think it will be enough for \npayouts and taxpayers in the future might be left holding the bag \nrather than the companies and insurance companies that are today \nresponsible. That is a valid point to raise.\n  Claims values are another element. What is it worth? What if you have \nthe worst possible asbestos-related disease, known as mesothelioma, \nwhich is a form of lung cancer which is ultimately fatal? What is it \nworth for you in terms of its value if you are an innocent victim of \nthis mesothelioma? I will show some photos in a few moments of the \nvictims. You will understand they are people, many of whom had no idea \nthat exposure to asbestos was dangerous. What do you do if you were \nexposed to this asbestos and are in a situation where you end up with \nthe disease or face a fatal situation at a later point? How much is it \nworth?\n  The question before the Senate on mesothelioma was whether $1 million \nis adequate. I can state the current litigation and current awards that \nare given in lawsuits are significantly larger, even after considering \nattorneys' fees. That $1 million might be a good value to a family if \nit did not take an attorney and years in court to reach that number, \nbut we have to at least be honest that some of the valuations in the \npending bill are not adequate.\n  This bill, since markup in the committee, has disappeared and \nreappeared, with Senator Frist and Senator Hatch working together. This \nwas an arrangement, a compromise among the principals on the Republican \nside which did not involve any Democrats, to my knowledge, and did not \ninvolve any of those who were critical of the original bill. It was \nbrought on a take-it-or-leave-it basis--again, with no hearing on the \nnew bill.\n  The new bill, sponsors claim, will provide up to $124 billion, $57.5 \nbillion from defendant companies, $46 billion from insurance companies, \nunspecified sums from existing trust funds. There is a concern as to \nwhether that is enough money, as I mentioned earlier. This bill, though \nit is claimed to be the FAIR Act, may not be fair when it comes to \nvictims and the recovery.\n\n  I am concerned with some of the statements made in the Senate. My \nfriend, Senator Hatch of Utah, said in the Senate when he introduced \nthe bill April 7th:\n\n       Some say--I think somewhat cynically--many of our \n     colleagues on the other side are not going to vote for this \n     bill because no amount of money is going to make them \n     satisfied because two of their major constituencies are \n     against the bill, and have been, so far, against any bill.\n\n  Senator Hatch went on to say:\n\n       Some have said they are afraid the personal injury bar will \n     not put up at least $50 million for John Kerry in this \n     election if they vote for the bill. Others are saying without \n     that money, they might not be able to elect John Kerry \n     President. I think that is a pretty cynical approach, of \n     course.\n\n  Let me say to my friend, Senator Hatch, that is an element of this \ndebate which should have been left outside of the record. I don't think \nit is good to question the motives of either side of the aisle. We see \nthis very contentious issue from a different perspective. But to \nsuggest we are being driven by campaign contributions, I hope, is plain \nwrong. In my case, it is wrong and I don't believe we should raise that \nas part of the specter of this debate.\n  Let me say before I go into the victims' stories, we have an \nopportunity to do some good and to pass a bill creating an asbestos \ntrust fund, but we need to adequately fund it. We need to also make \ncertain pending settlements and awards are not extinguished by this new \ntrust fund. We need to make sure the level of compensation for victims \nis adequate. We can do it. But we need to work on a bipartisan basis to \nachieve it.\n  Let me show a few of the victims that tell the story. This is John \nRackow of Lake Zurich, IL. He grew up in Chicago, IL, and eventually \nmoved to the suburbs. He is a businessman, married, with three kids. He \nworked for a lot of different companies and was involved in property \ndevelopment. He was athletic, very active. He started noticing \nshortness of breath. An avid golfer, his game was off. He went to the \ndoctor and his doctor discovered he had mesothelioma, the worst form of \nasbestos-related lung cancer.\n  He did not want to believe the result. He went to a lot of different \ndoctors for treatment and relief of the pain. But, unfortunately, he \nbecame so weak he was ultimately hospitalized. He became weaker by the \nday and passed away at the age of 64.\n\n  This gentleman shown in this picture is also from my home State of \nIllinois, former policeman Donald Borzych, of Tinley Park. He grew up \nin Chicago, IL. He attended parochial schools in the city and studied \nfor the priesthood. Donald eventually chose to become a Chicago police \nofficer.\n  While in school, he worked with various construction companies. You \nwill find that a recurrent theme. Donald was handy with home and auto \nrepairs.\n  After retiring, he and his wife enjoyed traveling and spending time \nwith friends. Donald found himself tired and short of breath. He went \nto a doctor and was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. He went \nthrough numerous treatments but with no positive results. He was \naccepted to an experimental program and lost his hair. He has been in \ntreatment for over 2 years.\n  I met with several widows of the victims of asbestosis and \nmesothelioma. One of those who really brought the issue home to me was \nthe widow of my former colleague, Bruce Vento. Bruce was a great guy. \nHe was a Congressman from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. I served with \nhim for 14 years in the House of Representatives. I saw him in the gym \nevery morning. He thought a lot about his health and physical \ncondition. He always worked out and wanted to be in good shape.\n  Then he started to feel pretty poorly. He went to the doctor, and he \nsaid: You have asbestos-related disease. You have mesothelioma. It \nturned out Bruce contracted this disease even though he did not smoke \nbecause he was exposed to asbestos as a youngman when he worked for a \ncompany that installed asbestos products at job sites.\n  He eventually succumbed and died from this disease. It was a great \nloss to the State of Minnesota and to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I think Bruce Vento was a wonderful person. His wife \nSusan is also a wonderful person. Susan has now taken up Bruce's cause \nand is arguing for fair compensation for victims.\n  Let me tell you about a couple of others who may surprise you if you \ndid not know they were victims of mesothelioma, asbestos-related \ndisease.\n  ADM Elmo Zumwalt, Jr., graduated from the Naval Academy in just 3 \nyears, yet ranked seventh in his class. He was the youngest person to \never serve as Chief of Naval Operations in the United States of \nAmerica. He commanded the U.S. Naval forces in Vietnam. He was the one \nwho crusaded to help those who were involved in exposure to agent \norange after the Vietnam war.\n  In 1999, doctors found a tumor in the admiral's left lung. He was \ndiagnosed\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nwith mesothelioma, based on exposure to asbestos while serving in the \nU.S. Navy. He underwent a tracheotomy but only survived for just a few \nmonths.\n  Here is a rather famous actor from my generation, Steve McQueen. He \ndied of mesothelioma. It turns out, as a young man he had been exposed \nto asbestos when he was working odd jobs in construction areas. And \nMcQueen was one of these handsome, dashing heroes on the movie set who \nultimately was reduced to a shell of a man by this crippling and \ndebilitating disease.\n  I tell you this because I want you to understand in the course of the \ndebate that it is not just the blue-collar workers who are the \nvictims--and many of them are--but people who went on to high and lofty \npositions in life, whether they served in the U.S. Navy or became movie \nstars or went on to Congress, never knowing they were carrying within \ntheir lungs the seeds of their death, the asbestos-related fibers.\n\n  When we say we want to make certain that tomorrow's victims are going \nto be compensated, it is because we do not know how many time bombs are \nticking in America today. I do not know if I have been exposed to \nasbestos. No one listening to this debate can possibly say whether they \nhave been exposed to asbestos because it was so prevalent and was to be \nfound in almost every place we turned.\n  So when we talk about having adequate funds in the trust fund for \nthis to be a payout that is worthy of the disease and death that it has \ncaused, I think it is not an unreasonable request.\n  Many say this debate this week and the vote is really just symbolic. \nSadly, too many things around here have just become symbolism. There \nwas no real genuine effort to hammer out a bipartisan agreement, no \neffort to compromise. We are being given this bill on a take-it-or-\nleave-it basis. Each of us will get up and say a few words about the \nbill. I obviously oppose it. But I sincerely hope, after it is \ndefeated--I think it will be--we will sit down and talk about a trust \nfund that is fair to victims, a trust fund that is fair to companies. \nAnd I would implore those company representatives who come to see me, \nand their insurance companies, to come up with a dollar figure that is \nfair, that gives you some certainty about your future. That is what you \ntell me over and over is what you want. You want to know what your \nliability is going to be so you can plan for it. It is the uncertainty \nof the current system, you say, that makes it so difficult to stay in \nbusiness. I want to work with you on that. I think a lot of the Members \nof the Senate do, on both sides of the aisle.\n  But bringing a bill with a take-it-or-leave-it number in it of less \nthan $124 billion is not an answer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I want to personally thank you for \nstaying. I did not realize you had a 7 o'clock appointment. I hope I \ncan return the favor to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/20/senate-section/article/S4169-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
