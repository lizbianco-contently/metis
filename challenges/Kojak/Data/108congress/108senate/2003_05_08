Under the previous order, the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee is recognized prior to the vote on the \nresolution of ratification.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senate comes together this morning to \nratify the accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \nSlovakia, and Slovenia to the NATO alliance. It will be a truly \nhistoric vote in the Senate and a most important day in the histories \nof these nation-states. I am hopeful the Senate will support \noverwhelmingly this remarkable foreign policy initiative.\n  When President Bush made his first trip to Warsaw Europe 2 years ago, \nhe strongly voiced in his Warsaw address the U.S. commitment to Europe \ngenerally and to NATO in particular. Now, at a moment when relations \nwith some of our European allies are strained, a clear showing of \nbipartisan support for NATO enlargement takes on added importance. The \naffirming message of the first round of enlargement led to improved \nalliance capabilities and strengthened transatlantic ties. I am \nconfident that this second round will do the same. The eyes of a \nhopeful and expectant world are upon us. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin voting for this resolution of ratification.\n  I would like to direct the attention of Senators to the balcony above \nwhere we are joined today by the Foreign Ministers of the seven \naspirant states. They have come together with us today to witness our \nactions and to join with us on the Senate floor at the completion of \nthe vote. At noon they will be hosted by the Secretary of State for \nlunch at the State Department and later by President Bush at a Rose \nGarden ceremony. Their presence, here today, is a personal witness to \nthe close relationship our nations will enjoy as partners in the NATO \nAlliance.\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\n  I thank Senators for their cooperation and ask for their support of \nthe enlargement of the NATO allliance .\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is fitting on this day, which is the \n58th anniversary of VE Day, the victory over Nazi tyranny in Europe, \nthat the Senate is about to vote to admit seven countries that suffered \nunder that tyranny and the tyranny of Communism--Bulgaria, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia--all of which have \ntheir Ambassadors present today and are very welcome.\n  His Holiness Pope John Paul the II and President Reagan should be \nthanked for having hastened the fall of Communism in Europe. President \nGeorge H.W. Bush should be thanked for the unification of Germany, and \nour President Bush for having widened the circle of the current round \nof NATO enlargement, and President Clinton, who skillfully led the way \nto the pathbreaking last round of enlargement which moved NATO into \nformerly Communist Central Europe.\n  Today is a culmination of the work of a number of great men and \nwomen. I am just happy to be able to play a little tiny part.\n  I urge everyone to vote, which I am confident they will, for \naccession.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to express my support for the ratification of the protocols to \nthe North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the accession of Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n  NATO has been perhaps the most successful military alliance in \nhistory, ensuring the peace and security of Europe for over fifty \nyears. I believe these seven countries will not only benefit \nimmeasurably from their inclusion in NATO, but they will all serve to \nfurther strengthen the alliance in ways that we could not have imagined \nin 1949. Though they are all fledgling democracies, they bring with \nthem a zeal for the democratic process that we all share.\n  In 1997, I had concerns about admitting the last three nations into \nNATO--Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. I had significant \nconcerns about the cost we as a nation might incur by allowing these \ncountries with immature political and social structures and outdated \nmilitaries to enter the alliance. But time has proven that these costs \nare less than we imagined, and I believe that the cost required to \nbring these next seven nations into the alliance should be well worth \nthe investment.\n  At the same time, I continue to have reservations about the \nlikelihood of true interoperability with these seven new nations. These \nseven nations use military hardware that is a product of the Soviet \narmed forces, and it is rapidly reaching the end of its useful life. \nVery little of this equipment is compatible with the latest hardware, \nweapons, and ammunition currently utilized by the United States. The \nmilitaries of the seven new nations are also top heavy with senior \nofficers who were trained under the old Soviet regime. As with the \nground forces, their air forces are also products of the Soviet era, \nand are greatly outdated. Finally, interoperability within the \ncommunications arena will be extremely challenging, at best, until \nthese militaries become proficient in English.\n  Despite these misgivings, I still believe that we should admit these \nseven nations into the NATO alliance. The NATO alliance ensured victory \nin the Cold War and has preserved the peace in Europe for over fifty \nyears. But in order to survive for the next fifty years, the alliance \nmust be willing to make much-needed changes to its charter. I support \nthe Warner-Levin-Roberts amendment and its two major provisions that \nthe President of the United States placed on the agenda at the North \nAtlantic Council. First, I agree that we must eliminate the ``consensus \nrule,'' the antiquated requirement in the NATO charter that nearly \nprevented NATO from protecting one of its own members, Turkey, before \nthe commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This rule may have worked \nwhen the alliance was first formed in 1949 with its original 12 \nmembers, but it cannot work any longer. Secondly, I support the need \nfor a new rule in NATO that authorizes the members of the alliance to \nsuspend the membership of any country in NATO which no longer supports \nthe ideals of the alliance. The recent refusal of support on the part \nof some of our NATO allies during the build-up for and execution of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom has again shown the need for such a change. \nOnly with these two critical steps will NATO continue to thrive and be \nas critical to peace and security in the 21st Century as it was in the \n20th Century.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will vote today to provide advice and \nconsent to the ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic \nTreaty of 1949, approving accession to the treaty by Bulgaria, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n  While I will vote for this resolution of ratification, I do so with \ndeep concerns over the future of NATO and its ability to serve as an \neffective military alliance. Five years ago, I voted against expanding \nNATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. I did so, in \npart, because of a belief that there was no logical end point once NATO \nbegan to expand. I was worried at that time that an expanded NATO would \nbecome unwieldy and lose focus on its primary mission as a defensive \nmilitary alliance. Those fears continue today, magnified by the \nrealities associated with seven additional members. However, having \ndecided in 1998 to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, there \nis little reason for the United States to reject the current round of \nNATO aspirants. Based on the logic of this latest round of expansion, I \nassume that this trend will continue, and that new members will be \nadded in coming years as they meet NATO criteria, with the ultimate \ncomposition of the alliance becoming extremely diverse.\n  I am greatly concerned that the inclusion of 10 new NATO members over \nthe past 5 years demonstrates that the United States and its original \nNATO Allies are wavering from the original purpose of the alliance. \nThroughout the cold war, the alliance presented a unified front, \nfunctioning as an efficient, credible deterrent to aggression. With the \nradical expansion of alliance membership by over 50 percent since 1998, \nthe alliance has jeopardized its ability to act decisively in times of \ncrisis. I am concerned that the alliance has expanded to the point of \nbecoming inefficient and unwieldy. It runs the risk that divergent \nviews will lead to paralysis or, worse yet, irrelevance when action is \nrequired.\n  The United States and Europe already have the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe to handle concerns related to \npromoting security in Europe, and there are several other organizations \ndirected toward trade and the resolution of other political issues. I \nam concerned that an expanded NATO will be more suitable for discussion \nthan action, and history has unfortunately shown that action is \nsometimes required. I continue to believe that the original decision in \n1998 to expand NATO was a mistake, but reluctantly agree to accession \nby these seven countries.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today will go down as a remarkable day \nin the history of world diplomacy. I enthusiastically support the \npassage of Treaty Document No. 108-04, the Resolution of Ratification \nto the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession \nof Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \nSlovenia.\n  We are seizing a remarkable opportunity to extend the democratic zone \nof security, stability, tranquility, and mutual assistance eastward. I \nwelcome the seven aspirant countries, and commend their efforts since \nthe fall of their communist regimes 12 years ago to embrace democratic \ngovernance and liberal economic policies.\n  I urge the adoption of the Resolution of Ratification because I \nbelieve that NATO expansion will bring positive security benefits to \nthe United States. Sovereign states no longer pose the greatest threats \nto U.S. national security; transnational actors--terrorists groups and \ntheir networks of supporters do. I believe that the war on terrorism \nwill only be won through effective cooperation between the U.S. and our \nallies around the world. Since 9/11, our NATO allies have helped \ntremendously in our attempt to thwart terrorist attacks here and \nabroad. The NATO accession of Bulgaria, Estonia,\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\nLatvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia will solidify the \ncooperation that already exists bilaterally between the U.S. and these \nseven countries.\n  I do have one concern that I would like to mention: the rights of the \nlarge historic Hungarian minorities in Slovakia and Romania. I urge \nboth countries' governments to continue to work with their Hungarian \ncommunities to resolve property restitution disputes and other \ncontentious issues. And I urge the governments of all seven countries \nto pay continued attention to human rights so that all of their \ncitizens may enjoy the benefits that accession to NATO will bring.\n  I extend a special welcome to the distinguished Foreign Ministers and \nAmbassadors who have come to the Senate Chamber today from each of the \nseven countries. I welcome them to a crucial alliance, one that was \nformed in the wake of World War II to protect freedom and democracy, \nhuman rights, and rule of law through the combined strength of western \nmilitary, intelligence, economic, and political assets.\n  Mr. President, today's vote gives me great optimism about the future \nof our NATO alliance and about the contributions that these seven \nnewest members will make for our collective peace, stability, freedom, \nand prosperity.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of ratification of the \nProtocol to the Washington Treaty to bring seven new members in the \nNATO alliance.\n  Allies and partners make concrete and indispensable contributions to \nAmerican national security in the complex and rapidly-changing post-\ncold war environment. Most security problems cannot be addressed \nunilaterally, and acting with others helps reduce the backlash against \nthe United States. We are virtually always better off sharing the risks \nand burdens and costs with our allies. The NATO alliance has been a \nreliable cornerstone of America's national security since it was \nfounded more than half a century ago.\n  I believe we need to modernize and strengthen NATO as our key \nalliance in the 21st century. We need to do four things to make NATO \nstronger:\n  First, we need to overcome differences over Iraq and other issues by \nworking together to develop a common understanding of the threats we \nface, so we don't again face the challenge of NATO Allies refusing \naccess to U.S. troops or denying protection to another ally.\n  Second, our European partners need to modernize their military \ncapabilities to be ready to take on any potential enemy or military \ntask, and to ensure interoperability between U.S. and European forces.\n  Third, NATO must be ready to act beyond Europe, because our common \nenemies and shared missions could be anywhere.\n  Finally, NATO must be ready to fight new enemies rather than just \nconventional military forces. These threats include the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction and missiles, rogue states and ethnic \nconflicts, and terrorism.\n  The limited debate and sparse opposition to further enlargement of \nNATO are a tribute to the success of the round of NATO enlargement we \nratified in 1996. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are full and \nreliable NATO allies. They have already contributed to America's \nsecurity, joining in the unanimous invocation of article 5 of the \nWashington Treaty, that an attack on one is an attack on all, after \nterrorists attacked the United States on September 11 of 2001.\n  Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are being fully integrated \ninto Europe including membership in the European Union. But they \nunderstand the value of the trans-Atlantic alliance.\n  I am particularly proud that Poland is always ready to stand with \nAmerica. Poland sent ground forces for the war in Iraq, joining only \ntwo other allies: the United Kingdom and Australia.\n  I strongly support NATO membership for the three Baltic states: \nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania. These countries know freedom and are \nwilling to fight for it, because they suffered so long under Soviet \noccupation. The Baltic states are working to help America confront new \nchallenges now that the cold war is over.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania a few \nyears ago, and participate in the NATO parliamentary assembly meeting \nin Vilnius. I was truly impressed by the spirit and progress of the \nEstonian, Lithuanian and Latvian peoples. All three Baltic states are \nbuilding modern armed forces to contribute to the security of NATO.\n  I am particularly proud of the Maryland-Estonia partnership, under \nwhich the Maryland National Guard has helped organize and train \nEstonia's military. All three Baltic states have contributed to the war \non terrorism and international peacekeeping missions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of further enlargement of \nNATO. I believe this round of enlargement, like the last, will \nstrengthen NATO. Strengthening NATO strengthens America's national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of NATO's \nexpansion and the ratification of the Treaty before us. For more than \n50 years, the alliance has been the cornerstone of the U.S.-European \nrelationship, and I believe that NATO remains our most important \nalliance. NATO's enlargement is critical to ensuring its continuing \nrelevance in the 21st century.\n  With the inclusion of 7 new members--Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia--NATO shows its commitment \nto establishing partnerships with its former adversaries and expanding \nthe zone of freedom and security from Europe's West to Europe's East. \nEnlargement enables these countries to complete the journey they began \nwith the end of Soviet communism, a journey that will make them part of \na Europe that is whole, free and at peace.\n  With this step, we also come closer to completing the vision outlined \nby President Bill Clinton nearly a decade ago. In January 1994, \nPresident Clinton first described the enlargement of NATO as one of not \n``whether but when.'' Thanks to his strong leadership, Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic joined the alliance in 1999, and NATO developed \na new relationship with Russia. President George W. Bush deserves \ncredit for continuing his predecessor's policies.\n  I am deeply committed to NATO. A year ago, I voted in favor of the \nFreedom Consolidation Act, which stressed the importance of NATO and \nendorsed taking the step of enlargement. And last December, I went to \nNATO headquarters in Brussels and met with senior alliance officials, \nincluding Lord George Robertson, the superb NATO Secretary General; \nGeneral Joe Ralston, then-NATO's military commander; our excellent U.S. \nAmbassador to NATO, Nick Burns; and several of his fellow NATO \nAmbassadors. I also visited London, where I met with the leader of one \nof our closest NATO allies, the United Kingdom's Tony Blair.\n  In all of these discussions, we agreed that bringing these deserving \ncountries into NATO was critical to making the alliance stronger. But \nwe also agreed that enlargement was only the first step--and in some \nways, that it might prove to be the easiest. This is remarkable, \nespecially when considering how contentious the issue of NATO \nenlargement was less than half a decade ago, not only here in the \nSenate, but around the world.\n  For NATO to continue to be a strong alliance, its members must meet \nat least two challenges. First, NATO members must close the gap in \ntheir military capabilities, and second, we must work to orient NATO \ntoward new missions.\n  The Europeans understand that in terms of military spending and \nmodernization, they are just not keeping up. A big part of the problem \nis budgetary. Last year the U.S. spent twice as much on defense than \nevery other NATO member combined. The $48 billion increase in military \nspending that Congress appropriated after the September 11, 2001, \nattacks was itself twice as much as Germany's entire defense budget.\n  Everyone at NATO understands the problem. Lord Robertson repeatedly \nwarns about it, but the question is whether our European partners can \nmuster up the creativity and political will to get the job done. Since \nI believe that it is in the U.S. security interest\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\nto work more, not less, with our European partners, it is obvious that \nour partners need to be strong and capable of working with the United \nStates.\n  Beyond the issue of capabilities, NATO's members face an even more \nfundamental question: What is NATO's purpose? My answer is this: If \nNATO's cold war mission was to keep the peace in Europe, the real point \nof the Transatlantic security relationship in the 21st century is what \nwe can do together outside of Europe. This includes addressing threats \nlike terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \npandemics like HIV/AIDS. And it includes acting in places that NATO \nplanners have considered ``out of area'': the Middle East, South and \nCentral Asia, and Africa. The bottom line is that neither the United \nStates nor Europe can tackle any of these problems alone. We need each \nother, and to neglect natural building blocks like NATO simply does not \nmake any sense.\n  Over the past 2 years, NATO has made historic strides in addressing \nthese new threats. Following the September 11 attacks, NATO Allies came \ntogether and, for the first time, invoked the alliance's self defense \nclause. NATO partners are on the ground today in Afghanistan. Later \nthis year, the alliance itself will assume command of the international \nsecurity force in Afghanistan.\n  I also believe that NATO can and should play a central role in \nproviding security in a postwar Iraq. We all know that many NATO \nmembers were deeply divided over the issue of what to do about Iraq. \nBut now that the war is over, I believe that we have an opportunity to \nreaffirm NATO's importance and relevance--as well as America's \ncommitment to the Alliance--by looking for ways to include NATO in \nproviding security today in Iraq. Doing so would not only lend \ncredibility to America's efforts in Iraq, but over the coming months \nand years ease the burden on the American people. This is a test, a \ntest not just for NATO but for American leadership in NATO.\n  This is not the first time America's leadership in NATO has been \ntested. In fact, the question of whether or not to enlarge NATO was a \ntest of American leadership, and with our vote today, we will have met \nthat test. Now, I believe we have to show the same sense of commitment \nand resolve to help NATO meet the new challenges we face in Iraq and \nelsewhere.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend Senators Lugar and Biden for \ntheir historic achievement this morning. This has been an effort that \nhas enjoyed strong bipartisan support within our country and within the \nSenate. I commend them especially for their remarkable leadership in \nbringing us to this point.\n  I also welcome the Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors who join us on \nthis momentous occasion from Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. I welcome them to NATO; I welcome them \nhere. This is truly a historic day.\n  We continue today what we did on VE Day, now more than 50 years ago, \nwhat thousands of our GIs, including my father, started more than 60 \nyears ago with the landing at Normandy, the creation of a Europe that \nis whole and that is free.\n  This is the beginning of a partnership that will produce greater \nworld stability, greater international involvement in world affairs, \nand a partnership with countries that will increasingly become valuable \npartners and allies of the United States.\n  Expanding NATO to include these seven democracies will make NATO \nstronger and the United States safer.\n  Five years ago we undertook to expand NATO for the first time. At \nthat time, the debate hung on this critical question: Should NATO limit \nits mission to defending a fixed list of nations, selected more than 50 \nyears ago, against an enemy that no longer existed? Or does it exist to \nprovide a collective security umbrella armed to defend an alliance of \nfree countries--countries that have demonstrated not only a deep \ncommitment to democracy, but a willingness to defend it?\n  A strong, bipartisan majority answered that question by voting to \nenlarge NATO to meet the threats of a new world. The results of that \ndecision did not disappoint.\n  On September 12, 2001, for the first time in its history, NATO \ninvoked Article 5, and mobilized to defeat the threat of terrorism. \nNATO aircraft patrolled American skies and later this summer NATO will \ntake over control of the Security Force in Afghanistan. Today we have \nthe opportunity to take the next step and strengthen NATO yet again.\n  Each of the seven countries seeking to join our alliance has made the \ndemocratic reforms that inclusion in NATO demands. We could not have \nmade this contention 15 years ago. But due to the foresight and \nperseverance of the citizens of each of these countries, Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are all \ntoday strong democracies.\n  Emerging from a history of foreign occupation, and defending \nthemselves against the threats of corruption and organized crime, these \nnations have affirmed their commitment to democracy both in word and in \ndeed. They have earned the right to be members of NATO. With that \nright, comes a responsibility, and they have shown a willingness to \nmeet that responsibility.\n  Each has contributed to the peacekeeping missions in the Balkans. \nEach contributed to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Each has contributed to the International \nSecurity Assistance Force in Afghanistan and have pledged contributions \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  As important as our shared values are, NATO remains, at its core, a \ndefensive alliance.\n  As such, the forces of alliance members must remain capable of \ndefending against a significant military threat--in Europe and beyond.\n  At Prague, NATO members pledged to transform NATO to make it better \nable to address the threats we face now.\n  Gone are the days of defending the Fulda Gap in the heart of Europe. \nNow we must be ready to counter the elusive and ever-present threat of \nterrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction far \noutside the borders of Europe.\n  Each of our new partners will bring specialized capabilities to the \nalliance.\n  In Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans, we have seen first-hand the \nexpertise of Bulgarian and Slovak anti-nuclear, biological, and \nchemical weapons teams; Slovenian de-mining units; and Romanian \nmountain troops.\n  We will continue to draw on their skills as we carry forward our \nefforts to defeat terror and restore stability to Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  The addition of new members amplifies the need to close the \ndisparities between the United States and our Allies.\n  We are encouraged by our new members ``niche capabilities.'' But the \ndifferences between the United States and its NATO Allies in transport, \nlogistics, communications, and intelligence capabilities risk \nundercutting the alliance.\n  As we take this momentous step today--of extending the NATO security \nguarantee to seven new countries stretching from the Baltic to the \nBlack Sea--we remind our friends, new and old, of their responsibility \nto invest in the capabilities of our brothers in arms.\n  We also must not permit periodic disagreements to erode the common \ncause that has made NATO the most successful military alliance in \nhistory.\n  The feud in the North Atlantic Council over how to aid Turkey in the \nevent of an attack by Iraq exposed serious divisions in NATO. \nSubsequent discussion of a EU-based security arrangement as an \nalternative to NATO does little to ease those divisions.\n  These are not insurmountable challenges, but this alliance, like our \nkey alliances in Asia, demand communication, attention, and diplomacy.\n  Handled correctly, this new and newly energized NATO can play a \ncentral role in post-Saddam Iraq--a role that can ease the burden on \nAmerica's troops and American taxpayers.\n  I am proud to cast my vote for this resolution on the anniversary of \none of our Nation's most glorious achievements--V-E Day, May 8.\n  My father was an Army sergeant in World War II. He landed on the \nbeaches of Normandy with the 6th Armored Division on ``D Plus 1''--June \n7, 1944.\n  One of his many duties was getting word back to the States about the \ndead\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\nand missing so their families could be notified. That experience left \nhim with a profound respect for the sacrifices democracy sometimes \ndemands. It is a lesson he passed on to his four sons.\n  He taught my brothers and me another lesson: When you make a promise, \nyou keep it.\n  With this vote, the United States makes a promise--a promise to \nprotect our Allies, old and new, from any threat that may emerge in the \nyears to come.\n  In return, we expect their wholehearted commitment to stand with us \nto continue the push for a Europe, whole and free. That effort began \nover 60 years ago with the blood and effort of soldiers like my father. \nBy advancing their cause, this treaty honors their sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 6 months ago, I traveled to Prague to \nsupport and bear witness to the historic decision of President Bush and \nthe leaders of the Atlantic alliance to invite seven countries to join \nNATO. Today, on the 58th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, the \nUnited States will vote to ratify in this Senate that vision of a free \nEurope, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.\n  I commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nLugar, and the ranking member, Senator Biden, for their efforts to \nsupport this goal. I also thank the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \nfor helping to make this happen.\n  In the few years I have been in Washington and in my few short months \nas majority leader of the Senate, I have seen few ideas that are so \nuntroubled by political differences, that so united the Senate and the \nNation, and that so completely fortified the very foundation of our \nliberty--that democratic government shall be defended and that freedom \nshall prevail.\n  These are exhilarating times in which we live. In just over a dozen \nyears, we have seen the collapse of the Soviet Union, the freeing of \ncaptive nations, the collapse and defeat of tyrannical dictatorships, \nand the birth of new democracies across Europe, Latin America, the \nMiddle East, Africa, and Asia. Each of these victories for freedom has \nbeen hard fought and each is worthy of defending.\n  It should be instructive to us that all seven of these soon-to-be \nNATO Allies were already on our side in the recent fight to liberate \nIraq because they had to fight for their own liberation. They \nunderstand that freedom is not free.\n  It has often been said that during the long years of the cold war, \nAmerica's example inspired Europe's freedom fighters, but to many of \nus, it is their example which is truly inspiring. To those from the \nranks of Europe's new democracies who watch this morning as we cast our \nvotes on this important treaty, I say: Thank you for your example and \nthank you for your inspiration.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the resolution of \nratification.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution of ratification, as \namended.

Two-thirds of the Senators present having \nvoted in the affirmative, the resolution of ratification is agreed to.\n  The resolution of ratification agreed to is as follows:\n\n       Protocols to North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on Accession of \n     Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \n     Slovenia (Treaty Doc. 108-4)\n\n\n   section 1. senate advice and consent subject to declarations and \n                               conditions\n\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the \n     Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia (as defined in section 4(6)), which \n     were opened for signature at Brussels on March 26, 2003, and \n     signed on behalf of the United States of America and other \n     parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, subject to the \n     declarations of section 2 and the conditions of section 3.\n\n\n                          sec. 2. declarations\n\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of the \n     Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the \n     Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia is subject to the following \n     declarations:\n       (1) Reaffirmation that United States membership in NATO \n     remains a vital national security interest of the United \n     States. The Senate declares that\n       (A) for more than 50 years the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) has served as the preeminent organization \n     to defend the countries in the North Atlantic area against \n     all external threats;\n       (B) through common action, the established democracies of \n     North America and Europe that were joined in NATO persevered \n     and prevailed in the task of ensuring the survival of \n     democratic government in Europe and North America throughout \n     the Cold War;\n       (C) NATO enhances the security of the United States by \n     embedding European states in a process of cooperative \n     security planning, by preventing the destabilizing re-\n     nationalization of European military policies, and by \n     ensuring an ongoing and direct leadership role for the United \n     States in European security affairs;\n       (D) the responsibility and financial burden of defending \n     the democracies of Europe and North America can be more \n     equitably shared through an alliance in which specific \n     obligations and force goals are met by its members;\n       (E) the security and prosperity of the United States is \n     enhanced by NATO's collective defense against aggression that \n     may threaten the security of NATO members;\n       (F) with the advice and consent of the United States \n     Senate, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic became \n     members of NATO on March 12, 1999;\n       (G) on May 17, 2002, the Senate adopted the Freedom \n     Consolidation Act of 2001 (S. 1572 of the 107th Congress), \n     and President George W. Bush signed that bill into law on \n     June 10, 2002, which ``reaffirms support for continued \n     enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     Alliance; designates Slovakia for participation in the \n     Partnership for Peace and eligible to receive certain \n     security assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994; \n     [and] authorizes specified amounts of security assistance for \n     [fiscal year] 2002 for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, \n     Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania''; and\n       (H) United States membership in NATO remains a vital \n     national security interest of the United States.\n       (2) Strategic rationale for NATO enlargement. The Senate \n     finds that\n       (A) notwithstanding the collapse of communism in most of \n     Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United \n     States and its NATO allies face threats to their stability \n     and territorial integrity;\n       (B) an attack against Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia, or Slovenia, or their destabilization \n     arising from external subversion, would threaten the \n     stability of Europe and jeopardize vital United States \n     national security interests;\n       (C) Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia, having established democratic \n     governments and having demonstrated a willingness to meet all \n     requirements of membership, including those necessary to \n     contribute to the defense of all NATO members, are in a \n     position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n     Atlantic area; and\n       (D) extending NATO membership to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania,\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\n     Slovakia, and Slovenia will strengthen NATO, enhance security \n     and stability in Central Europe, deter potential aggressors, \n     and advance the interests of the United States and its NATO \n     allies.\n       (3) Full membership for new NATO members. The Senate \n     understands that Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, in becoming NATO members, \n     will have all the rights, obligations, responsibilities, and \n     protections that are afforded to all other NATO members.\n       (4) The importance of European integration.\n       (A) Sense of the Senate. It is the sense of the Senate that\n       (i) the central purpose of NATO is to provide for the \n     collective defense of its members;\n       (ii) the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe is an institution for the promotion of democracy, the \n     rule of law, crisis prevention, and post-conflict \n     rehabilitation and, as such, is an essential forum for the \n     discussion and resolution of political disputes among \n     European members, Canada, and the United States; and\n       (iii) the European Union is an essential organization for \n     the economic, political, and social integration of all \n     qualified European countries into an undivided Europe.\n       (B) Policy of the United States. The policy of the United \n     States is\n       (i) to utilize fully the institutions of the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe to reach political \n     solutions for disputes in Europe; and (ii) to encourage \n     actively the efforts of the European Union to continue to \n     expand its membership, which will help to strengthen the \n     democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.\n       (5) Future consideration of candidates for membership in \n     NATO.\n       (A) Senate findings. The Senate finds that\n       (i) Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides that \n     NATO members by unanimous agreement may invite the accession \n     to the North Atlantic Treaty of any other European state in a \n     position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n     Atlantic area;\n       (ii) in its Prague Summit Declaration of November 21, 2002, \n     NATO stated that the Alliance\n       (I)(aa) will keep its door open ``to European democracies \n     willing and able to assume the responsibilities and \n     obligations of membership, in accordance with Article 10 of \n     the Washington Treaty'';\n       (bb) will keep under review through the Membership Action \n     Plan (MAP) the progress of those democracies, including \n     Albania, Croatia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of \n     Macedonia, that seek NATO membership, and continue to use the \n     MAP as the vehicle to measure progress in future rounds of \n     NATO enlargement;\n       (cc) will consider the MAP as a means for those nations \n     that seek NATO membership to develop military capabilities to \n     enable such nations to undertake operations ranging from \n     peacekeeping to high-intensity conflict, and help aspirant \n     countries achieve political reform that includes strengthened \n     democratic structures and progress in curbing corruption;\n       (dd) concurs that Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia have successfully used the \n     MAP to address issues important to NATO membership; and\n       (ee) maintains that the nations invited to join NATO at the \n     Prague Summit ``will not be the last'';\n       (II)(aa) in response to the terrorist attacks on September \n     11, 2001, and its subsequent decision to invoke Article 5 of \n     the Washington Treaty, will implement the approved \n     ``comprehensive package of measures, based on NATO's \n     Strategic Concept, to strengthen our ability to meet the \n     challenges to the security of our forces, populations and \n     territory, from wherever they may come''; and\n       (bb) recognizes that the governments of Bulgaria, Estonia, \n     Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia have \n     successfully used the MAP to address important issues and \n     have showed solidarity with the United States after the \n     terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001;\n       (III) will create ``. . . a NATO Response Force (NRF) \n     consisting of a technologically advanced, flexible, \n     deployable, interoperable, and sustainable force including \n     land, sea, and air elements ready to move quickly to wherever \n     needed, as decided by the Council'';\n       (IV) will streamline its ``military command arrangements'' \n     for ``a leaner, more efficient, effective, and deployable \n     command structure, with a view to meeting the operational \n     requirements for the full range of Alliance missions'';\n       (V) will ``approve the Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) \n     as part of the continuing Alliance effort to improve and \n     develop new military capabilities for modern warfare in a \n     high threat environment''; and\n       (VI) will ``examine options for addressing the increasing \n     missile threat to Alliance territory, forces and populations \n     centres'' and tackle the threat of weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD) by enhancing the role of the WMD Centre \n     within the International Staff;\n       (iii) as stated in the Prague Summit Declaration, Bulgaria, \n     Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia \n     have ``demonstrated their commitment to the basic principles \n     and values set out in the Washington Treaty, the ability to \n     contribute to the Alliance's full range of missions including \n     collective defence, and a firm commitment to contribute to \n     stability and security, especially in regions of crisis and \n     conflict'';\n       (iv) Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia have been acting as de facto NATO \n     allies through their contributions and participation in \n     peacekeeping operations in the Balkans, Operation Enduring \n     Freedom, and the International Security Assistance Force \n     (ISAF);\n       (v) Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia, together with Albania, Croatia, and \n     the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, issued joint \n     statements on November 21, 2002, and February 5, 2003, \n     expressing their support for the international community's \n     efforts to disarm Iraq; and\n       (vi) the United States will not support the accession to \n     the North Atlantic Treaty of, or the invitation to begin \n     accession talks with, any European state (other than \n     Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \n     Slovenia), unless\n       (I) the President consults with the Senate consistent with \n     Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States (relating to the advice and consent of the \n     Senate to the making of treaties); and\n       (II) the prospective NATO member can fulfill the \n     obligations and responsibilities of membership, and the \n     inclusion of such state in NATO would serve the overall \n     political and strategic interests of NATO and the United \n     States.\n       (B) Requirement for Consensus and ratification. The Senate \n     declares that no action or agreement other than a consensus \n     decision by the full membership of NATO, approved by the \n     national procedures of each NATO member, including, in the \n     case of the United States, the requirements of Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States \n     (relating to the advice and consent of the Senate to the \n     making of treaties), will constitute a commitment to \n     collective defense and consultations pursuant to Articles 4 \n     and 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.\n       (6) Partnership for peace. The Senate declares that\n       (A)(i) the Partnership for Peace between NATO members and \n     the Partnership for Peace countries is an important and \n     enduring complement to NATO in maintaining and enhancing \n     regional security; and\n       (ii) the Partnership for Peace has greatly enhanced \n     security and ability throughout the Euro-Atlantic area, with \n     Partnership for Peace countries, especially countries that \n     seek NATO membership, and has encouraged them to strengthen \n     political dialogue with NATO allies and to undertake all \n     efforts to work with NATO allies, as appropriate, in the \n     planning, conduct, and oversight of those activities and \n     projects in which they participate and to which they \n     contribute, including combating terrorism;\n       (B) the Partnership for Peace serves a critical role in \n     promoting common objectives of NATO members and the \n     Partnership for Peace countries, including\n       (i) increasing the transparency of national defense \n     planning and budgeting processes;\n       (ii) ensuring democratic control of defense forces;\n       (iii) maintaining the capability and readiness of \n     Partnership for Peace countries to contribute to operations \n     of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe;\n       (iv) developing cooperative military relations with NATO;\n       (v) enhancing the interoperability between forces of the \n     Partnership for Peace countries and forces of NATO members; \n     and\n       (vi) facilitating cooperation of NATO members with \n     countries from Central Asia, the Caucasus, and eastern and \n     southeastern Europe.\n       (7) The NATO-Russia Council. The Senate declares that\n       (A) it is in the interest of the United States for NATO to \n     continue to develop a new and constructive relationship with \n     the Russian Federation as the Russian Federation pursues \n     democratization, market reforms, and peaceful relations with \n     its neighbors; and\n       (B) the NATO-Russia Council, established by the Heads of \n     State and Government of NATO and the Russian Federation on \n     May 28, 2002, will\n       (i) provide an important forum for strengthening peace and \n     security in the Euro-Atlantic area, and where appropriate for \n     consensus building, consultations, joint decisions, and joint \n     actions;\n       (ii) permit the members of NATO and Russia to work as equal \n     partners in areas of common interest;\n       (iii) participate in joint decisions and joint actions only \n     after NATO members have consulted, in advance, among \n     themselves about what degree any issue should be subject to \n     the NATO-Russia Council;\n       (iv) not provide the Russian Federation with a voice or \n     veto in NATO's decisions or freedom of action through the \n     North Atlantic Council, the Defense Planning Committee, or \n     the Nuclear Planning Committee; and\n       (v) not provide the Russian Federation with a veto over \n     NATO policy.\n       (8) Compensation for victims of the Holocaust and of \n     Communism. The Senate finds that\n       (A) individuals and communal entities whose property was \n     seized during the Holocaust or the communist period should \n     receive appropriate compensations;\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\n       (B) Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia have put in place publicly declared \n     mechanisms for compensation for property confiscated during \n     the Holocaust and the communist era, including the passage of \n     statutes, and for the opening of archives and public \n     reckoning with the past;\n       (C) Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia have each adjudicated and resolved \n     numerous specific claims for compensation for property \n     confiscated during the Holocaust or the communist era over \n     the past several years;\n       (D) Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia have each established active \n     historical commissions or other bodies to study and report on \n     their government's and society's role in the Holocaust or the \n     communist era; and\n       (E) the governments of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia have made clear \n     their openness to active dialogue with other governments, \n     including the United States Government, and with \n     nongovernmental organizations, on coming to grips with the \n     past.\n       (9) Treaty interpretation.

Mr. President, today the Senate has taken another step in \nmaking Europe whole and free. In June 2001, President Bush delivered a \nspeech in Warsaw, Poland confirming that:\n\n       All of Europe's new democracies, from the Baltic to the \n     Black Sea and all that lie between, should have the same \n     chance for security and freedom--and the same chance to join \n     the institutions of Europe.\n\n  Today the Senate ratified that vision and has voted overwhelmingly to \nenlarge the NATO alliance to include seven new members.\n  I would like to thank a number of people for their contributions to \nthis important debate. Jessica Fugate, Kate Burns, and Mike Haltzel \nworked tirelessly to produce a resolution of ratification and committee \nreport that enjoyed the unanimous support of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and has been ratified by the Senate. Bob Bradtke, of the \nDepartment of State; Kurt Volker, of the National Security Council, and \nIan Brzezinski, of the Department of Defense; worked closely with \ncommittee staff to ensure strong administration support for the work we \nhave completed today. Lastly, special thanks to Paul Gallis, of the \nCongressional Research Service, for his valuable contributions to the \nCommittee's work and the Senate's review of the Protocols of Accession.\n  I especially thank the distinguished ranking member from Delaware, \nSenator Biden, for his cooperation and leadership on this important \nissue. This is the second major treaty the Foreign Relations Committee \nhas guided to ratification in a few short months. I look forward to \ncontinuing our bipartisan partnership in the days and weeks ahead as we \nturn to the State Department authorization bill, the HIV/AIDS bill, and \nthe Foreign Relations Authorization Act.\n  Mr. President, I know unanimous consent has been granted for the \nSenate to stand in recess. I look forward to welcoming the foreign \nministers of the countries we greet today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5888-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VISIT TO THE SENATE OF THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF BULGARIA, ESTONIA, \n           LATVIA, LITHUANIA, ROMANIA, SLOVAKIA, AND SLOVENIA\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 14) to enhance the energy security of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will proceed to discuss a proposed \nethanol amendment that will be offered to this pending bill later in \nthe proceedings when it is in order. When I am finished within a few \nmoments, I will yield to the minority leader who will speak, and \nthereafter we will rotate back and forth for as long a time as we have \nthis morning to discuss this measure.\n  Today the Senate will consider what will soon be offered as an \namendment to S. 14, which I hope will become the renewable fuel \nstandards portion of the comprehensive energy bill. The amendment \noffered today by the majority leader and the minority leader, and \nSenators Inhofe, Dorgan, Lugar, Johnson, Grassley, Harkin, Hagel,\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\nDurbin, Voinovich, Nelson of Nebraska, Talent, Dayton, Coleman, \nEdwards, Crapo, and DeWine--and if there are any others who desire to \njoin in the amendment, it is obviously open for submitting their names \nas additional cosponsors.\n  This represents the culmination of a long and difficult debate about \nthe U.S. transportation fuels policy. The amendment is the product of \nmore than 4 years of work by the stakeholders and Members of this body \nand represents a solid compromise between disparate groups.\n  The amendment establishes a renewable fuels standard providing that a \nportion of the U.S. fuel supply will be provided by renewable domestic \nfuels, primarily ethanol, growing to 5 billion gallons a year by the \nyear 2012. In addition to full support from the affected parties, the \namendment also enjoys the administration's full support.\n  The Frist-Daschle amendment will promote increased domestic energy \ndevelopment, reduce oil imports, protect the environment, bolster our \neconomy, and stimulate rural economic development by increasing \nproduction and use of domestic renewable fuels. I know there are a \nnumber of Senators who strongly opposed a similar amendment when it was \noffered and adopted last year. I expect them to offer a number of \nsecond-degree amendments this year again. This is their right, but I do \nexpect--as the Senate did last year--the Senate to adopt the language \nof the Frist-Daschle amendment.\n  In view of the significant amount of work that has been put into this \namendment and the consensus it represents among the affected parties, I \nurge my colleagues to adopt the amendment as offered, without \namendments.\n  I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I first want to commend the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee for his strong statement in support and for his \nleadership on this and on so many of the issues pertaining to energy. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with him as we proceed in \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  I am also delighted to join with the distinguished majority leader in \nintroducing the first amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n  The fact that this is the first amendment reflects the importance of \nthe subject that we will be discussing. It is my hope that the majority \nleader's endorsement will help assure enactment of this proposal at the \nearliest possible date.\n  It was 1990 when a number of us joined together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, including then-Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, and Tom \nHarkin, and we introduced the reformulated gasoline, or RFG, \nlegislation as a provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.\n  The RFG provision, with its minimum oxygen standard, was adopted in \nthe Senate by an overwhelming vote of 69-30. Eventually, it was signed \ninto law by President George H.W. Bush.\n  I am proud to say that this program resulted in substantial \nimprovement of air quality all over the country. It stimulated \nincreased production of renewable ethanol and other oxygenates needed \nto meet the minimum oxygen standard.\n  In fact, between the onset of RFG in January of 1995 and January of \n2003, production of ethanol has increased from 1 billion gallons per \nyear to nearly 2.5 billion gallons.\n  This increased farm economy by hundreds of millions of dollars \nannually and reduced our dependence upon foreign oil by more than \n100,000 barrels per day. Unfortunately, the detection of MTBE in ground \nwater in the late 1990s required us to find a way to get MTBE out of \ngasoline without sacrificing the air quality and public health benefits \nof the RFG program.\n  The answer that my good friend, Dick Lugar, and I conceived several \nyears ago was the renewable fuels standard, which would eliminate the \nminimum oxygen requirement that some of our colleagues find problematic \nfor urban centers and replace it with a nationwide renewable fuels \nstandard.\n  This standard increases ethanol production and protects consumers by \ncreating a credit trading system that provides an economic incentive to \nuse the type of fuel that is most cost effective in the various regions \nof the country.\n  On May 4, 2000, I was proud to introduce, along with Senator Lugar, \nthe first iteration of the amendment that is before us today.\n  That proposal--similar to the one we are considering today--\nreconciled historically competitive interests in a manner that promoted \na broad range of national policies.\n  It would protect ground water, enhance our national energy security, \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote investment and job \ncreation in rural communities by tripling production of ethanol over \nthe course of the next 10 years.\n  The essence of that proposal was incorporated into legislation \nreported by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in \nSeptember 2000. Unfortunately, time ran out in the 106th Congress \nbefore final action could be taken on that Committee bill.\n  In the 107th Congress, Senator Lugar and I again joined to introduce \nthe Renewable Fuels Act. This legislation was incorporated into last \nyear's Senate-passed energy bill as part of the fuels agreement with \nthe support of 69 Senators. Unfortunately, time again ran out before \nthe energy bill could be enacted into law.\n  This February, Senator Lugar and I, Senator Hagel, one of the real \nmovers on this legislation early on, along with a growing number of our \ncolleagues, re-introduced this latest iteration of the renewable fuels \nstandard that we have now incorporated in this amendment. I am pleased \nthat the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has once again \nembraced it and reported it out of committee. That proposal, S. 791, is \ncurrently on the Senate calendar.\n  This chronology underscores the point that the time to pass this \nimportant legislation is now. The groundwork has been laid, and the \ncase for the bill is established. The benefits of the renewable fuels \nstandard for agriculture, the rural economy, energy and the environment \nare dramatic.\n  The legislation benefits agriculture. Next year, one in every three \nrows of corn grown in South Dakota will go into ethanol production. \nThere are currently nine ethanol plants operating in South Dakota with \ntwo more under construction. Local corn prices have increased 10 cents \nper bushel near these plants, and USDA estimates that corn prices will \nincrease 50 cents per bushel under the RFS. As a result, USDA has \nestimated that the RFS will raise farm income by $1.3 billion annually. \nTaxpayer outlays would drop dramatically because of resulting farm \nprogram savings.\n  This legislation benefits the rural economy. Over 5,000 South \nDakotans have invested in these plants, and over 500 people are \ndirectly employed by the ethanol industry in the state. USDA estimates \nthat for every 100-million-gallon ethanol plant built, 2,250 local jobs \ncan be created throughout a community.\n  This legislation also enhances our energy security. Look at America's \nenergy situation today: gasoline prices are high and America is \nimporting close to 60 percent of the oil we use. At the same time, our \nsubstantial appetite for energy continues to grow. Over the next 10 \nyears, the United States is expected to consume roughly 1.5 trillion \ngallons of gasoline. At the same time, we hold only 3 percent of the \nknown world oil reserves.\n  The Renewable Fuels Standard will save the U.S. $4 billion in \nimported oil each year because we triple the use of renewable fuels \nover the next 10 years.\n  As for the environment, this legislation ensures that the clean air \nbenefits that we have achieved because of the oxygenate standard are \nmaintained through strong anti-backsliding language and addresses the \nserious problems of MTBE contamination.\n  Specifically, the amendment bans MTBE in 4 years, authorizes funding \nto clean up MTBE contamination and fix leaking underground tanks, \nallows the most polluted states to opt into the reformulated gasoline \nprogram, and provides all States with additional authority under the \nClean Air Act to address air quality concerns.\n  The amendment also eliminates the oxygen requirement from the RFG \nprogram, a change that is very important to the efforts of States such \nas California and New York that are planning\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\nto eliminate MTBE from their gasoline supplies in the near future.\n  To preserve the hard-fought air-quality gains that have resulted from \nthe implementation of that requirement, the bill creates a renewable \nfuels standard that will nearly triple the use of renewable fuels like \nethanol and biodiesel over the next 10 years.\n  Finally, the bill provides special encouragement to biomass-based \nethanol, which holds great promise for converting a variety of organic \nmaterials into useful fuel, while substantially reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  This will have substantial benefits for the environment and for rural \neconomies, while helping to lower our dangerous dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Some of my colleagues from large coastal states have expressed \nconcern that this amendment treats their constituents unfairly and seek \na carve-out from its requirements. I respectfully suggest that their \nconcerns are not supported by the facts.\n  Governors Gray Davis and George Pataki, one a Democrat and one a \nRepublican, leaders of the two most populous States in the country, \nhave stated publicly that their States are better off under the \nRenewable Fuels Act than they are under current law.\n  Their first priority by far is to get out from under the minimum \noxygen standard that will force them to use ethanol when MTBE is \neliminated from the gasoline supply. The amendment before us allows \nthem that flexibility which they so desperately seek. Moreover, my \ncolleagues from California and New York worry that even though their \nStates will no longer be required to purchase ethanol as a result of \nthe oxygen standard, the cost of gasoline will rise precipitously as a \nresult of the RFS.\n  That is simply not the case. Last April the Energy Information Agency \nissued a report stating that the cost of establishing a renewable fuels \nstandard is less than 1 cent per gallon for reformulated gasoline and \nless than 0.5 cent per gallon for all gasoline.\n  Just last month, the California Energy Commission issued a report \nstating that the recent increase in California's gasoline prices cannot \nbe attributable to availability or cost of ethanol which is consistent \nwith the EIA projections.\n  What is even more compelling is that California is using nearly twice \nthe amount of ethanol this year than they would be required to under \nthe RFS.\n  I understand that my colleagues are fighting for what they believe is \nin the best interests of their constituents, and I respect that. But my \ngoal in promoting the renewable fuels standard is to solve a nationwide \nproblem with a nationwide solution. My constituents would prefer not to \ngive up the oxygen standard, which has played such an important role \nhistorically in expanding the production of ethanol. But I understand \nthat states like California need greater flexibility in their gasoline \nsupply. That is why I am willing to look for new prescriptions that \nallow States to use alternatives to ethanol and continue to promote the \ndevelopment of the domestic ethanol industry, which I believe is in the \nnational interest.\n  The renewable fuels amendment meets that test. This legislation is a \ncareful balance of often disparate and competing interests--and a \ncompromise in the finest tradition of the U.S. Senate. Meeting our \nenergy challenges is a difficult problem, but is also a great \nopportunity to demonstrate American strength and ingenuity.\n  This amendment takes advantage of both, and I look forward to its \npassage.\n  I thank the Chair for his support and effort, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I failed to indicate at the outset what \nhas been mentioned by the distinguished minority leader at the outset. \nThis is a jobs-producing measure. The entire energy bill, as we \nconsider it, is a measure that will produce literally thousands of jobs \nfor the American people. Right at the outset, the very first amendment \nis a clear indication of how in this bill we intend to produce, in this \ninstance, agricultural jobs but not pure agriculture--industrial, as it \nrelates to agriculture with the construction of ethanol plants in and \nout and around and about agricultural America.\n  Having said that, I know there are a number of Senators who want to \nspeak. It was not for me to say that we have no consent agreement as to \nhow we will proceed, but I saw the distinguished Senator, Senator \nTalent, standing first. I might suggest, just for some orderliness, he \nproceed next, and the distinguished Senator from Nebraska follow that. \nThen, if other Senators are here, and they seek recognition--\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I ask my good friend if he would mention \nmy name in that list?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder, considering the condition of the \ndistinguished Senator, if he might proceed first.\n  Mr. TALENT. I was going to suggest that to the Senator from New \nMexico and the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might we amend that, then, and have Senator Bond go \nfirst, Senator Talent, and then the Senator from Nebraska? Is that all \nright? We will proceed in that manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico and I \nappreciate his kindness, and also my colleagues from Missouri and \nNebraska.\n  I rise today in support of the renewable fuels standard, as passed by \nthe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on which I have the \nprivilege of sitting.\n  This package provides a means for significant reductions in our \ndependence on foreign oil while we pursue cheaper energy for consumers \nthat is produced in rural America by our hard-working farmers and \nranchers.\n  I have spent a lot of years in the Senate Chamber talking about these \nissues. Recently a friend complained to me that he was tired of me \ntalking about biodiesel. We first started talking about it a long time \nago. But I am pleased to have the burr under the saddle to point out \nthat biodiesel and ethanol are vitally important elements for our \nenergy program.\n  I am pleased to see so many of our colleagues joining in the fight \ntoday. My good friend Senator Jim Talent from Missouri has been a \nleader on the Energy Committee. I know my colleague Senator Hagel from \nNebraska has long been a champion of ethanol. I add my thanks and my \nappreciation to the distinguished chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, for taking the \nleadership position on this issue.\n  Increasing the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel \ndiversifies our energy infrastructure, making it less vulnerable to \nacts of terrorism while increasing the number of available fuel \noptions, enhancing competition, and potentially reducing consumer costs \nof fuel.\n  Speaking of decreased fuel costs, I am reminded of some of the \ncomments of my colleagues during consideration of this package in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. At that time, it was suggested \nthat ethanol as an oxygenate was the cause of high fuel prices in \nCalifornia and other areas. I bet we will hear that argument again.\n  Just as a marker, note this fact. I refer my colleagues to the recent \nCalifornia Energy Commission report promulgated by Gov. Gray Davis. In \ndiscussing the report's findings, California Energy Commission chairman \nWilliam Keese indicated that ``Ethanol, the ingredient, did not have an \nimpact that we can see on prices. . . .''\n  Frankly, that ought to answer the questions and concerns that \nundoubtedly will be raised on the floor. In fact, I would argue that \nethanol and biodiesel actually reduced the consumer cost of fuel by \nextending supplies, offering alternatives to more costly imported oil, \nand providing leverage for independent fuel marketers to compete \nagainst the larger, more powerful integrated oil companies.\n  The renewable standard will more than double the amount of renewable \nfuel we use. I am told that renewable fuel use will increase to about 3 \npercent of our total transportation fuel supply, replacing roughly 66 \nbillion gallons; that is, 1.6 billion barrels of foreign crude oil by \n2012.\n  Of course, the environmental benefits of transitioning from petroleum \nfuels to clean, domestically produced renewable ethanol and biodiesel \nis clear. Not only can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil but with \nthe renewable standard our environmental goals of\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\nreducing hydrocarbon, particulate sulfur, and other polluting emissions \nwould be pursued.\n  This RFS will also have a positive impact on the economy, \nparticularly in rural areas which have been hardest hit in the economic \nslowdown.\n  According to studies, the renewable standard would create as many as \n300,000 American jobs, increase net farm income by $6.6 billion a year, \nand reduce farm program payments by $7.8 billion. In other words, we \ncan reduce farm program payments and increase net farm income by a \ncombined total of $14.4 billion. Not many programs give you that much \nbang for the buck.\n  One farm analyst said that as many as 13.1 million acres of corn can \nbe used to supply ethanol by 2012. That is almost 19 percent of last \nyear's corn production. Today, only 6 percent of the crop goes into \nethanol.\n  In our home State, Missouri corn farmers could see an average \nincrease of about 12 cents per bushel over the next 10 years. \nSimilarly, our soybean farmers will see increased benefits as biodiesel \nuse will increase dramatically.\n  I encourage and invite my colleagues to come out to the heartland to \nsee what we have. Come out and visit Nebraska, Missouri, and Iowa and \nsee what this industry is all about. We could all learn the benefits of \nethanol, soy diesel, and biodiesel. We will see how the homegrown \nrenewable fuel benefits the environment, the economy, and our \ncommunities. Come out to my State and see what farm leaders have done \nto provide value-added opportunities for Missouri farmers.\n  In 1994, Golden Triangle Energy of Craig, MO, and Northeast Missouri \nGrain Processors of Macon, MO, organized as new generation \ncooperatives. Northeast Missouri Grain Processors opened their plant on \nApril 29, 2000. I was pleased to be there. It had been producing 22 \nmillion gallons of ethanol per year. They have just flipped the switch \non an additional capacity to make over 40 million gallons a year.\n  Come to Missouri and visit the communities and areas where ethanol \nproduction is underway and see the impact of the expanding usage of \nfuel through this renewable standard on Main Street, U.S.A.\n  I now defer to my colleagues. I thank them for their kind \naccommodation. I express my thanks also to the distinguished manager of \nthis bill, who is doing an outstanding job. We look forward to seeing a \ngood energy bill passed. But a good energy bill must have a good \nrenewable fuel standard.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Missouri for his \nkind comments.\n  It is a great pleasure to be here today to talk on behalf of such an \nimportant amendment and to recognize that we certainly have come a long \nway.\n  For many years, our Nation has needed a sound and balanced energy \npolicy that includes a renewable fuels standard. For many years, we \nhave all talked and talked about alternative energy, about renewable \nenergy, and today with the first bipartisan leadership amendment of \nthis Congress, the Republican and Democratic leaders have introduced \nthe renewable fuels standard legislation as an amendment to S. 14.\n  I believe what has happened today stands on the shoulders of the work \nby many of the most distinguished Members of this body in the last \ndecade. We heard from the senior Senator from Missouri. We are going to \nhear from the Senator from Nebraska and the compromise, if you will, in \nthe last Congress.\n  The renewable fuels standard is the biggest single reason I sought to \nget on the Energy Committee. I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of \nthe amendment and to be associated with what is going to happen today. \nI know there are going to be many chances to come to the floor and fend \noff various second-degree amendments from opponents of renewable fuels. \nSo I will keep my initial comments brief today. I look forward to \nfuture opportunities to discuss other aspects of the amendment.\n  I note also at the outset that this legislation is supported by a \nhistoric coalition. When you get a coalition that ranges from the Farm \nBureau to the American Petroleum Institute, it tells you the consensus \nthat has been created finally on behalf of this idea. It is because it \nis a good idea. It is because it is the right thing to do. It is at the \ncrux of so much we all want for Americans. It is at the crux of \neconomic growth in jobs. It is at the crux of energy security. It is at \nthe crux of environmental quality and value-added agriculture and \nfamily farming.\n  An article ran on April 23 in the Daily Statesman, which is the daily \npaper in Dexer, MO. The headline was ``Missouri Job Loss Rate Number \nOne in the Nation.'' Last year, Missouri lost 77,000 jobs. The \nenactment of the renewable fuels standard will, first and foremost--and \nright away--bring thousands of jobs to Missouri, and tens and tens of \nthousands of jobs--hundreds of thousands of jobs--to the country.\n  We are talking about long-term good jobs in agriculture, in trade, in \ntransportation, in energy, and in food processing. We are talking about \njobs on the farm. We are talking about construction jobs to build these \nplants and maintain them. We are talking about jobs for the suppliers \nof these ethanol plants. We are talking about jobs for those who buy \nthe ethanol and the by-products. We are talking about transportation \njobs in shipping the ethanol. We are talking about trade opportunities \nfor the United States. It will happen as a result of what I believe the \nSenate is going to do today.\n  A recent study found that increasing ethanol production to 5 billion \ngallons annually would create 214,000 jobs in the country, $5.3 billion \nin new investment, and increase household income by $51 billion. I want \nthose benefits for this country, and I want those benefits for \nMissouri.\n\n  These increasingly modern ethanol plants are equipped to produce 40 \nmillion gallons of ethanol a year. I have visited the plants, as has my \ncolleague, Senator Bond, in Missouri, plants we already have in Craig \nand Macon. The economic benefits of one of those plants are \nsignificant. They include an increase of household income for the \ncommunity, the county in which these plants are operated; many of these \ncounties have been struggling economically. It includes an increased \nhousehold income of $20 million for these counties annually. Additional \nfarmer cooperatives around the State of Missouri are organizing funding \nin an effort to produce even more ethanol in Missouri. I know this is \nhappening in Nebraska. It is happening all over the Midwest. It is \ngoing to continue happening.\n  Ethanol is also at the crux of energy security for America. Ethanol, \nbiodiesel, and other renewable fuels are going to be playing an \nincreasing role in reducing the need for imported oil. This is an area \nwhere I have to respectfully disagree with the opponents of the \nrenewable fuels standard.\n  I am very strongly in support of providing incentives for increased \nexploration and recovery of oil reserves in this country. And we have a \nprogrowth, proenergy energy bill, largely because of the efforts of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy Committee. I have supported every \neffort to increase the amount of oil reserves we have in the United \nStates and that we can practically explore and recover.\n  But it is clear that we cannot just drill our way out of our \ndangerous oil dependency. We have to have other alternatives, and \nethanol and biodiesel are the alternatives we have now--not 5 years, \nnot 10 years, not 15 years from now, but now--to reduce our dependence \non oil imports. I do not ever want to be in a situation again where we \nare sending $4 billion a year to somebody like Saddam Hussein to buy \noil, and depending on regimes like that one for the health of our \nnational economy.\n  Ethanol is a key to energy independence for the United States. The \nUnited States is increasingly dependent on imported energy to meet our \npersonal, transportation, and industrial needs. As a domestic, \nrenewable source of energy, ethanol can reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and increase the United States' ability to control its own \nsecurity and economic future. Our energy policy should first and \nforemost promote domestic, renewable fuels, not foreign oil imports.\n\n  This is an area where I respectfully disagree with the opponents of \nrenewable fuels standard. It is clear that we cannot drill our way out \nof our dangerous oil dependency--especially\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\nwithout access to the oil in Alaska's ANWR. America's national, energy, \nand economic security are vulnerable due to our dangerous dependence on \noil imports.\n  In 1999, America was importing over 55 percent of its oil and \npetroleum products. Just 2 years later, our dependency increased to \nover 59 percent. By 2025, the Energy Information Administration \nprojects the U.S. will import nearly 70 percent of its petroleum. \nSomething must be done.\n  It is absolutely necessary that we take steps to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. Over the next decade the RFS will reduce \ncrude oil imports by an estimated 1.6 billion barrels.\n  In addition to the establishment of a national ethanol standard, the \namendment has other important provisions that include an orderly phase-\ndown of MTBE use and removal of the oxygen content requirement for \nreformulated gasoline. That is very important, and it is very important \nto the environment.\n  I am sure that over the coming weeks we are going to have a lot of \nopportunities to debate things such as climate change and CAFE \nstandards. I remind opponents of this amendment that ethanol is one of \nthe best tools we have to fight air pollution from vehicles. I \nencourage all proenvironment organizations to score this amendment as a \nvote in favor of America's air quality.\n  The use of ethanol-blended fuels reduces greenhouse gas emissions by \n12 to 19 percent compared with conventional gasoline. The American Lung \nAssociation of Chicago credits ethanol-blended reformulated gasoline \nwith reducing smog-forming emissions by 25 percent since 1990. Again, \nthis is an alternative which we have today to protect the environment.\n  The chairman's energy bill contains many exciting opportunities for \nthe development of clean hydrogen vehicles. I support that. But those \ntechnologies are a long way off.\n  My children may drive hydrogen cars. Today I can drive a car fueled \nby ethanol. A couple weeks ago, I visited a Break Time convenience \nstore in Columbia, MO, that is selling ethanol at the same price that \nit is selling regular gasoline.\n  Renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel provide a solution to \nour air quality problems that we can use now. Today you could fill your \ncar with an ethanol blend or a biodiesel blend--without any changes to \nyour vehicle. The chairman's energy bill contains many exciting \nopportunities for the development of a clean, hydrogen vehicle, but we \nall know these technologies are a long way off. My children may be \ndriving these hydrogen cars, but today I can drive a car fueled by \nethanol. Fleet vehicles in Missouri can run on ethanol or biodiesel \nwithout any costly engine upgrades--today.\n  The use of these renewable fuels will bring environmental benefits in \nthe short term while we continue to explore long-term opportunities \nsuch as hydrogen cars and other technologies.\n  As I said, I recently toured both of the ethanol plants in Missouri \nand visited an ethanol fueling station during the April recess. I have \nto tell you, this is an exciting and innovative way to add value to \ntraditional commodities. The use of grain for ethanol production adds \nup to 30 cents to every bushel of corn. Not only do farmers benefit \nfrom the higher price but also by joining cooperative and building \nethanol production facilities. They are able to directly take advantage \nof the value-added market through ownership of the plant. They continue \nto make money during times of price volatility.\n  There is no question that the renewable fuels standard will reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. It will slow the deterioration of the \nenvironment through the reduction of fossil fuel emissions, enhance \nnational, energy and economic security, create a new industrial base \nwith tens of thousands of new, high quality jobs, and add value to \ntraditional commodities.\n  I am happy to join Senate Leadership in offering this amendment. It \nis time that we make the RFS a part of our national energy policy.\n  Mr. President, I want to say how pleased and proud I am to be a part, \nin a small way, of this effort. I am especially pleased that this is \nthe first bipartisan amendment that is being offered on the Senate \nfloor. It will strengthen this energy bill we put together under the \nleadership of Senator Domenici. It is something we can all stand up and \nsupport.\n  I hope we will get a thumping, bipartisan majority in support of this \namendment. Again, it is a key to jobs. It is a key to energy \nindependence. It is a key to environmental quality. And it is a key to \nvalue-added agriculture and the family producers in Missouri and around \nthe country. I am pleased to speak in favor of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to hear now from one of the \nearly proponents of ethanol and of this bill and of this composite that \nultimately got such broad bipartisan support. It is my privilege to \nhave as a supporter of this amendment and of the energy bill the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel.\n  I thank the Senator for all the work he has done in this area and for \nall the help he has given me by way of advice on the energy bill, which \nis pending before the Senate, of which this will become an integral and \nvital part. Thank you so much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I first want to recognize the comments of \nthe distinguished chairman of the Energy Committee. He is far too \ngenerous, but that is usually his nature. And I appreciate very much \nhis thoughtful words.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend from Missouri. I think they \ncut to the essence of what this issue is about, as well as the comments \nof our dear friend, the senior Senator from Missouri.\n  (Mr. DOMENICI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am privileged to be part of this effort \nbecause I do not believe there is anything more important for the \nfuture of this country than to establish an energy policy that we can \nbuild upon; that does, in fact, move right to the core of our national \nsecurity, our economic growth, and all of the elements that are \ninterconnected for the future of this country.\n  So I come to the floor this morning to address briefly some of the \nelements of this amendment that will be offered and to, once again, \nregister my strong support of the renewable fuels standard amendment to \nthe energy bill.\n  I, like my colleagues who have spoken prior to me, wish to recognize \nand thank the leadership of Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader \nDaschle for getting this amendment to the floor, and, of course, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici, for \nallowing us to have what many of us believe is a very important \namendment to be the first amendment up on the energy bill, of which I \nam a strong proponent and supporter.\n  This amendment, as we have heard, would enhance air and water \nquality, reduce supply and distribution challenges in the gasoline \nmarket, and increase energy security by expanding the use of clean, \ndomestically produced renewable fuels.\n\n  Specifically, this amendment follows the advice of the EPA's Blue \nRibbon Panel on Oxygenates by repealing the Federal oxygenate mandate \nand phasing out the use of MTBE nationwide. It also contains a \nreasonable renewable fuels standard, which would gradually increase the \nNation's use of renewable fuel to 5 billion gallons a year by 2012--all \nof this while protecting the environmental gains already made by the \nreformulated gasoline program.\n  This legislation mirrors the bipartisan fuels agreement in last \nyear's Senate energy bill, of which it has been stated here this \nmorning gained the votes of 69 Senators. This year, we have worked to \nbuild an even broader bipartisan coalition of cosponsors. Much has \nhappened since the Senate passed its energy bill last year. The \nrenewable fuels industry has expanded considerably to meet growing \ndemand.\n  The ethanol industry opened 12 new plants last year, with 10 \nadditional plants now under construction. Sixteen of these new plants \nare farmer owned--farmer owned--individually owned cooperatives.\n  By the end of 2003, annual ethanol production capacity is expected to \nexceed 3 billion gallons. In December, the ethanol industry wrapped up \na record year--2.13 billion gallons in 2002, up by more than 20 percent \nover 2001.\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\n  Also, Chevron Texaco announced earlier this year it will switch from \nblending MTBE to blending ethanol in the southern California market, \nmaking Chevron the last of the large California refiners to make the \nswitch to ethanol. This means that this year approximately 80 percent \nof California's federally reformulated gasoline will be blended with \nethanol.\n  We should not forget that biodiesel, made primarily from soybeans, \nand still a developing fuel technology, has grown enough that it is now \nused in more than 200 State and Federal automobile fleets, using a 20-\npercent blend or higher.\n  Today, 16 States have already banned or are in the process of banning \nMTBE. With State MTBE bans will come increased challenges to fuel \ndistribution and supply.\n  The national phase-down of MTBE proposed in this bill will help us \nmeet these challenges. And a national renewable fuels standard with a \ncredit and trading program--that makes sense, which is relevant, which \nhas common sense--will ensure that renewable fuels are used where they \nmake the most sense--not a mandate, where they make the most sense.\n  In fact, according to a recent analysis by the Department of Energy, \nenacting this fuels bill would even reduce refiner costs at least by .2 \npercent per gallon compared to current law.\n\n  The standard in this amendment is a fair and workable compromise we \ncrafted over a year ago. My friend from Missouri, Senator Talent, \nreferenced the compromise, referenced the organizations that came \ntogether over a long period of time to fashion a very workable \nalternative, built upon the good work of many you have heard referenced \nthis morning: Senator Daschle, Senator Lugar, so many who have worked \nso hard for so many years, Senator Dole. It has not just come from corn \nand soybean-producing States. It has come from the leadership of \nindividual Senators with a wider lens of understanding of national \nsecurity issues, environmental issues, and economic issues, because \nthey are all interconnected.\n  This effort was bolted together by many people who deserve much \ncredit: The American Petroleum Institute, National Farm Bureau, the \nenvironmental community, Northeast air directors, agriculture groups \nfrom all over the country, DOE, EPA, and many others. Senator Daschle \nand I helped facilitate those talks last year, as well as a number of \nour colleagues who are here today and will most likely speak today.\n  Contrary to the opponents of this amendment, this is not a per-gallon \nmandate. It will not force a specific level of compliance in places \nwhere compliance may be difficult. In fact, the credit trading \nprovision in this amendment will give flexibility to refiners who \nutilize ethanol or biodiesel where it is most economically attractive.\n  Our Nation needs a broader, deeper, and more diverse energy \nportfolio. Today less than 1 percent of America's transportation fuel \ncomes from renewable sources. Under this amendment, renewable fuel \nwould increase to approximately 3 percent of our total transportation \nfuel supply, tripling the amount of renewable fuel we now use. Today \nAmerica imports nearly 60 percent of the crude oil it consumes. The \nSenator from Missouri defined in some detail the numbers. We continue \nto hold our economy, our national security, hostage to foreign oil.\n  This country consumes more than 300 billion gallons of crude oil a \nyear. Of that, 165 billion gallons is refined into gasoline and diesel. \nThis amendment says that by 2012, not less than 5 billion gallons of \nthat 165 billion gallons shall come from renewable sources.\n  By enacting this legislation, we would replace 66 billion gallons of \nforeign crude oil by 2012, reduce foreign oil purchases by $34 billion, \ncreate more than 250,000 jobs nationwide, and boost U.S. farm income by \nmore than $6 billion a year.\n  I join my other colleagues who have spoken this morning--and others \nwho will speak today--to enthusiastically encourage all our colleagues \nto pay attention to the amendment, to be aware of its consequences, \nhave some sense of why this is just not another renewable fuels \namendment. It has dramatic implications for the future of the economy, \nfor our national security, and our independence. It also helps America \naddress the additional and important environmental challenges that lie \nahead. This is an amendment about America's future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice in support of the \nrenewable fuels standard amendment that has been offered by the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader.\n  This may be a bit unconventional for a place like the Senate floor, \nbut I want to begin my remarks by talking about duct tape. I am not \ntalking about it in connection to homeland security, or even the fact \nthat one of the largest producers, 3M Corporation, is in my home city \nof Saint Paul.\n  Duct tape is probably in every garage in Minnesota and on most work \nbenches. Why? Because you can do so many things with it. For those of \nus who are mechanically challenged it is essential. It is cheap. It is \nsimple. You can use it for temporary car repair, plumbing, picture \nhanging . . . I even heard of a guy who used it on a duct! The point is \nthat it is valuable because it can do many things well.\n  The renewable fuels standard we are talking about today is a duct \ntape kind of proposal. It will decrease our dependence on foreign oil. \nIt will help keep America's air and water cleaner. It will increase the \nincome of our hard working farm families. And it will provide economic \ndevelopment and jobs for rural Minnesota. I am not sure if there is one \nother thing we could do as a national government that would do more \ngood, for more people, at less expense and with no down side than set a \nrenewable fuels standard. Allow me to explain in further detail.\n  Today 56 percent of our oil comes from foreign sources. As \nfrightening as that statistic is, we are heading in the wrong \ndirection: becoming more dependent as the years go by. When George \nWashington gave his Farewell Address, he warned us solemnly to ``avoid \nentangling alliances.'' We compromise the sovereignty of our Nation by \ngiving other nations that powerful leverage on our people.\n  This reasonable renewable fuels standard would reduce our dependence \non foreign oil by 1.6 billion barrels over the next 10 years. That \nwould make us an even stronger nation because we would be winning back \nthe power to determine our own destiny.\n  In Minnesota, we put a high value on clean air and clean water. \nCarbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, Nitric Oxide, and other toxins and \nparticulates are responsible for countless environmental and health \nproblems. As a matter of compassion, we must act to reduce these \npollutants to avoid the suffering they cause. As a matter of health \npolicy, the best way to contain costs is to prevent people from \nbecoming sick in the first place.\n  Studies have shown that ethanol can reduce emissions of hydrocarbons \nby 20 percent and particulates by 40 percent. I believe biodiesel holds \nout the same promise. Right down the road from Minnesota in Chicago, \nethanol use helped bring that huge city under the federal standard for \nozone. Phasing out MBTE will have a dramatic impact all by itself.\n  As I spend time with Minnesota's farm families, they don't beat \naround the bush--whom they support, I might add, in large numbers. They \ndon't care to listen to a lot of fancy speeches. They say, ``Senator \nyou can help us if you do two things: lower our costs and raise our \nprices. We'll do the rest.'' The great folks who feed the world and \nundergird our economy--at great personal risk and sacrific--deserve to \nbe heard and listened to.\n  Pure and simple: it is better to send corn and soybeans to ethanol \nand biodiesel plants to create energy then it is to send too much to \nthe elevators and depress prices.\n  The Department of Agriculture estimates that ethanol adds 30 to 50 \ncents of additional value to every bushel of corn produced in the \nUnited States. That is a difference consumers of corn flakes will never \nnotice, but it is a huge change at the margin for hundreds of thousands \nof hard working American farmers.\n\n  And make no mistake: farmers need help right now. In recent years, \nthose who provide us with the safest, most abundant, most affordable \nfood supply\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\nin the world have been struggling with the lowest real net cash income \nsince the Great Depression, record low prices, record high costs of \nproduction, and foreign tariffs and subsidies some 5 and 6 times higher \nthan our own.\n  President Kennedy once said that ``the farmer is the only man in our \neconomy who buys everything he buys at retail, sells everything he \nsells at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.'' The RFS is an \nopportunity to turn things around for our farm families: to give them a \nchance to earn a living off the market while yielding huge economic, \nenvironmental and energy dividends.\n  As every Senator should know, farm policy and rural development go \nhand in glove. The key to so many rural communities is for them to reap \na greater economic benefit from the things they produce. If they just \nharvest the crops or raise the cattle and watch them roll over the hill \nfor someone else to process and profit from, that is not going to \nmaximize economic development and job growth potential in the area. \nThey need to add value to those products.\n  There are no better examples of this than ethanol and biodiesel. Let \nme talk for a moment about what many call the ``Minnesota Miracle.'' I \nhold it out to Members of other States as an incentive for what \napproving an RFS could mean to your communities.\n  The State of Minnesota leads the Nation in promoting the production \nand use of ethanol. Nearly all of Minnesota's 2.6 billion gallons of \ngasoline are blended with 10 percent ethanol, reducing fuel imports by \n10 percent. Today, Minnesota boasts 14 ethanol plants--13 of which are \nowned by Minnesota farmers. And, what these 14 plants have produced--\nbesides ethanol--is truly phenomenal: 40,000 jobs, over a half billion \na year in economic activity, and $15 million in tax revenues.\n  Now, on a national scale, studies suggest that the RFS will, over the \nnext decade, reduce our Nation's trade deficit by more than $34 \nbillion, increase our gross domestic product by $156 billion, create \nmore than 214,000 new jobs, expand households income by some $51 \nbillion, increase net farm income by nearly $6 billion per year, while \ncleaning our air and water and displacing 1.6 billion barrels of \nforeign oil. In short, the RFS will allow Minnesotans to build on our \nState's success while creating new opportunity and promise throughout \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to stand here today in the shadow of the \nwork Senator Hagel has done, the work the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee has done, and stand in support of the amendment offered by \nthe majority leader and Democratic leader, an amendment that will \npromote energy independence, cleaner air and water, stronger farm \nprices, and viable rural communities. Renewable fuel standards will do \nall these things. That does duct tape one better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota not only on his remarkable statement, but likewise on the \nMinnesota miracle. The work in his State is truly a manifestation of \nall that can come from the legislation we are discussing today in terms \nof jobs, income for farmers and, most important, greater energy \nindependence and cleaner air for our country.\n  I am delighted to join my colleague from Minnesota in presenting and \nsponsoring and commending the majority leader and the minority leader \nfor presenting this legislation to us today.\n  I am a strong advocate of this initiative to establish a nationwide \nrenewable fuels standard as a part of America's national energy policy. \nMoving from a hydrocarbon to a carbohydrate economy will increase \nenergy independence, reduce oil imports, protect air and water, reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate rural economies. The renewable \nfuels amendment we are considering today does all of these things, \nwhich is why I regard it as an essential component of the Energy Policy \nAct of 2003.\n  The renewable fuels amendment is the culmination of years of effort. \nAs a result of the hard work, today's amendment enjoys strong support \nfrom both parties and a broad array of interest groups.\n  Several years ago, Senator Daschle and I first introduced a bill \ncreating a renewable fuels standard. It has been my privilege to speak \nwith Senator Daschle for many years on behalf of this concept, in front \nof various groups in our country, as well as with our colleagues in the \nSenate. I have treasured my friendship with Senator Daschle on the \nAgriculture Committee of the Senate. There we have had many hearings \nand productive discussions. The Renewable Fuels Act of 2001, the bill \nSenator Daschle and I introduced, represented an important step toward \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil and improving our Nation's \nenergy security. At the same time, this proposal went far toward \nprotecting the environment, supporting rural economic development, and \nincreasing the flexibility of the national fuel supply to reduce the \nimpact of future price spikes. Last year Senator Daschle and I \nincorporated that legislation into the Senate Energy bill. I am hopeful \nthis year my colleagues will again demonstrate that they appreciate the \nimportance of the renewable fuels standard to our country, and I am \nconfident we will do so.\n\n  When reflecting back on recent history, one trend that should disturb \nevery American is our growing dependence on oil imports. Set that trend \nagainst the many political crises erupting in oil-rich regions around \nthe world, and it is clear our addiction to oil must be curtailed. I \nbelieve part of the answer lies with the development of cheap, \nplentiful, renewable sources of energy. The current tax incentive for \nethanol has helped foster creation of a strong domestic renewable fuels \nindustry. But more needs to be done to reduce the cost of ethanol \nproduction and to make the commodity more competitive with fossil \nfuels. It is time for a nationwide renewable fuels standard.\n  Recent and prospective breakthroughs in genetic engineering and \nprocessing are radically changing the viability of ethanol as a \ntransportation fuel. It is now possible to use biomass, meaning \nvirtually any plant or plant product, to produce renewable fuels. So-\ncalled cellulosic ethanol may decisively reduce the cost of ethanol, to \nthe point where petroleum products may soon face vigorous competition.\n  In 1999, James Woolsey, former director of the CIA, and a consultant \non many important issues, and I coauthored an article in Foreign \nAffairs magazine that talked about our strategic need for energy \nindependence--at least outlined how a biomass strategy, which included \nethanol from many sources, was a critical part of that strategy.\n  In 1999, following publication of that article in Foreign Affairs, I \nintroduced a bill that now drives many of these scientific \nbreakthroughs. The Biomass Research and Development Act accelerated and \ncoordinated the biomass research and development activities of Federal \nagencies. Soon after this bill was enacted into law as Title III of the \nAgricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, a bill that came out of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, its competitive research and development \nprogram began accelerating production of biofuels, biochemicals, and \nbiopower. Today's amendment will build on that initiative in a very \nlarge way by offering an incentive to producers of cellulosic ethanol.\n  I am proud of the significant progress we have already made to \nsupport renewable fuels. We have made great strides toward \nstrengthening our national security, improving our rural communities, \nand protecting our natural environment.\n  With today's amendment, we will move still closer to a safer and more \nprosperous tomorrow for our country and for the world. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to support this important initiative.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, we are on this \nbill\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nuntil 11:30 a.m. for purposes of discussing the pending amendment. So I \nsay to anybody who wishes to discuss it, we have this additional time \nnow. There may be time in the future, but this is assured time now for \nanybody who wishes to speak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nmake a few comments as a member of the Energy Committee on the energy \nbill that is on the floor and which will be subject to amendment \ntomorrow morning. I believe the ethanol amendment will be taken up.\n  There is an overarching possibility in this energy bill. It can \nprovide the opportunity to properly fix the badly broken energy market, \nto reduce our consumption of oil, and to increase energy production \nwhile protecting our environment and addressing climate change. But at \nthis point, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 is missing much of what is \nneeded for a balanced, comprehensive energy policy for this Nation.\n  I voted against the bill in the Energy Committee because of what is \nmissing. I look forward to the opportunity to amend this legislation.\n  First, I believe the bill needs stronger consumer protection to fix \nour broken energy market and to prevent another energy crisis like the \none we experienced in the West.\n  Second, we must increase the fuel efficiency of our vehicles to \nreduce the amount of oil we consume, to lessen the amount of carbon \ndioxide, the No. 1 greenhouse gas released into our atmosphere, and to \nsave families and businesses money at the pump.\n  Third, we must increase our energy production while protecting our \nenvironment. This means not infringing on environmentally sensitive \nareas such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge or the water off the \nCalifornia and Florida coasts.\n  Fourth, we should address global warming and establish plans to \ncombat climate change.\n  Fifth, we must encourage the development of new renewable power from \nsolar, from wind, and from geothermal resources instead of continuing \nto subsidize traditional production from nuclear power, for example.\n  Three years ago this month, California's energy market began to \nspiral out of control. In May of 2000, families and businesses in San \nDiego saw their energy bill soar. The Western energy crisis forced \nevery family and business to pay for more energy. The crisis forced the \nState of California into a severe budget shortfall. It forced the \nState's largest utility into bankruptcy and nearly bankrupted the \nsecond largest utility. Now, 3 years and $45 billion in cost later, we \nhave learned how the energy market in California was gamed and abused.\n  In March, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the ``Final \nReport on Price Manipulation in Western Markets which confirmed that \nthere was widespread and pervasive fraud and manipulation during the \nWestern energy crisis. The abuse of our energy market was so pervasive \nand unlawful. Yet this energy bill does not go far enough to prevent \nanother Western energy crisis and to curb illegal Enron-type \nmanipulation.\n  Remember, this type of fraud and abuse was not limited to just Enron. \nThere was fraud and abuse across the board, according to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission. One of the best examples of this illegal \nbehavior is demonstrated by the transcript from Reliant Energy that \nrevealed how their traders intentionally withheld power from the \nCalifornia market in an attempt to increase prices. This is one of the \nmost egregious examples of manipulation, and it is clear and convincing \nevidence of coordinated schemes to defraud consumers.\n  Let me read one part of the transcript to demonstrate the greed \nbehind the market abuse by Reliant and its traders.\n  On June 20, 2000, two Reliant employees had the following \nconversation that revealed the company withheld power from the \nCalifornia market to drive prices up.\n\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: I don't necessarily foresee \n     those units being run the remainder of this week. In fact you \n     will probably see, in fact I know, tomorrow we have all the \n     units at Coolwater off.\n\n  The Coolwater plant is a 526 megawatt plant.\n\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: Really?\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: Potentially. Even number \n     four. More due to some market manipulation attempts on our \n     part. And so, on number four it probably wouldn't last long. \n     It would probably be back on the next day, if not the day \n     after that. Trying to uh. . .\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: Trying to shorten supply, uh? \n     That way the price on demand goes up.\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: Well, we'll see.\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: I can understand. That's cool.\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: We've got some term positions \n     that, you know, that would benefit.\n\n  Six months after this incident, as the Senate Energy Committee was \nattempting to get to the bottom of why energy prices were soaring in \nthe West, the president and CEO of Reliant testified before Congress \nthat the State of California ``has focused on an inaccurate perception \nof market manipulation.''\n  Reliant's president and CEO went on to say, ``We are proud of our \ncontributions to keep generation running to try to meet the demand for \npower in California. Reliant Energy's plant and technical staffs have \nworked hard to maximize the performance of our generation.''\n  These transcripts prove otherwise and reveal the truth about market \nmanipulation in the energy sector.\n  Yet FERC refused to find and consider all evidence of fraud and \nmanipulation and the State of California was forced to take the \ncommission to court to ensure FERC would carry out its public duty to \nfully investigate the western energy crisis and punish wrongdoing. Only \nwhen the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled FERC had to allow the \nCalifornia parties to collect and submit evidence did we find more \ninstances of pervasive illegal behavior.\n  After a 100-day discovery period that ended March 3, 2003, the State \nof California, the California attorney general's office, and the \nstate's largest utilities filed over 3,000 pages of evidence at the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to show how fraud and manipulation \nwas pervasive throughout the western energy crisis of 2000-2001. The \nmarket abuse was not limited to a few rogue traders at one firm, but \nwas a widespread series of schemes perpetuated by many employees across \nmost companies that supplied and traded in the West.\n  During their discovery period, the ``California parties'' found the \nfollowing information:\n  Details on new specific incidents when energy companies intentionally \nheld their plants offline to drive prices up during 2000 and 2001; new \ntranscripts of conversations between energy company employees revealing \nan intent to defraud and manipulate the California market; new evidence \nof document destruction by energy companies to hide details of their \nbehavior in the western energy market; and new evidence laying out \npossible anti-trust violations by energy companies.\n  I ask unaminous consent that a copy of the report my office issued \nwhen the ``Protective Order'' was lifted by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   New Evidence That Energy Companies Besides Enron Manipulated the \n                         Western Energy Market\n\n        [Unofficial Report--Office of Senator Dianne Feinstein]\n\n       After a 100-day discovery period that ended March 3, 2003, \n     the State of California, the California Attorney General's \n     Office, and the state's largest utilities filed over 3,000 \n     pages of evidence at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     to show how fraud and manipulation was pervasive throughout \n     the Western Energy Crisis of 2000-2001. The market abuse was \n     not limited to a few rogue traders at one firm, but was a \n     widespread series of schemes perpetuated by many employees \n     across most companies that supplied and traded in the West.\n\n\n     highlights of the information filed by the California parties\n\n       (This information from the California Parties was under a \n     ``Protective Order'' at FERC.)\n       Details on new specific incidents when energy companies \n     intentionally held their\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\n     plants offline to drive prices up during 2000 and 2001.\n       New transcripts of conversations between energy company \n     employees revealing an intent to defraud and manipulate the \n     California market.\n       Reliant knew about transcripts proving their employees held \n     power offline, but the company sat on the evidence for over a \n     year before turning them over to FERC. (CA Parties brief, \n     p122, footnote 375/Exhibit CA-218).\n       New evidence of document destruction by energy companies to \n     hide details of their behavior in the Western Energy Market.\n       New evidence laying out possible anti-trust violations by \n     energy companies.\n       The filing by the California parties shows that there was \n     an extensive and coordinated attempt by energy companies to \n     game the Western market to drive prices up by engaging in the \n     following:\n       (1) Withholding of Power--driving up prices by creating \n     false shortages.\n       New evidence of Withholding of Power according to the \n     California parties: (CA Parties brief, p28-31/Exhibit CA-9).\n       On August 15, 2000 Williams reported that its plant in Long \n     Beach called Alamitos 7 was unavailable due to NOX \n     limitations, but AES's real-time logs from that day show the \n     plant was shut down because Williams directed it to be.\n       Reliant failed to return its Etiwanda Unit 2 in Rancho \n     Cucamonga to service for two days after repairs were \n     completed on January 26, 2001, even though the ISO system was \n     experiencing continuous Stage 3 emergencies in California.\n       Redondo Beach Unit 6 power plant was shut down by Williams \n     and AES April 3-April 6, 2000. Although the ISO was told the \n     plant was offline due to a boiler tube leak, the plant \n     records indicate this was a planned shutdown and the leak was \n     an excuse concocted two days later.\n       Dynegy shut down its El Segundo Unit 1 plant August 30-\n     September 3, 2000 for repairs, but the repairs had been done \n     and the plant was shut down to force prices up.\n       Mirant held its Pittsburgh Unit 1 plant offline until \n     October 22, 2000 even though an external tube leak ended \n     October 20, 2000.\n       Duke delayed returning Oakland Unit 1 to service after \n     repairs to a lube oil cooler and a cooling fan in November, \n     2000 despite ISO-declared emergencies.\n       During an ISO-declared emergency December 19 and 20, 2000, \n     Williams declared Redondo Unit 5 a forced outage due to a \n     boiler tube leak. However, the control operator logs \n     uncharacteristically put quotation marks around the outage \n     reason, ``Blr. Tube Leak'' and later, after tests were done, \n     the logs indicate that no leaks were found.\n       Reliant delayed reporting the end of an outage at its \n     Ellwood Unit in Goleta for more than twelve hours during peak \n     demand in early April 2001.\n       Between November 19 and December 5, 2000 Dynegy reported \n     that its El Segundo 1 and 2 units (with a capacity of about \n     350 MW) were on ``forced outage,'' but these units were \n     actually shutdown because Dynegy claimed its operating staff \n     was on vacation. Forced outages should not include vacation \n     days--especially during ISO emergencies, which occurred on \n     November 19 and 20.\n       (2) Bidding to Exercise Market Power--suppliers bid higher \n     after the California ISO declared emergencies, knowing the \n     State would need power and be willing to pay any price to get \n     it.\n       New evidence of Bidding to Exercise Market Power according \n     to the California parties:\n       A Mirant email to eleven traders in July of 2000 reveals \n     this strategy: ``load is avg above 40 thousand during peak. \n     So, submit revised supp. Bids and `stick-it to `em!!' '' (CA \n     Parties brief, p42-43/Exhibit CA-141).\n       (3) Scheduling of Bogus Load (aka ``Fat Boy'' or ``Inc-\n     ing'')--suppliers submitted false load schedules to increase \n     prices.\n       New evidence of Scheduling Bogus Load according to the \n     California parties:\n       A Dynegy trader confirms that Dynegy's load deviation in \n     August 2000 is ``probably because [the traders] are just \n     doing some dummy load scheduling.'' (CA Parties brief, p48/\n     Exhibit CA-202).\n       A conversation between a Mirant trader and a trader from \n     Public Service of Colorado reveal a joint effort to engage in \n     ``Fat Boy.''\n       The trader from Public Service of Colorado states, ``Why \n     don't we just do something where we overschedule, \n     overschedule load and share an upside, dude.''\n       The Mirant trader responds, ``That's fine.'' (CA Parties \n     brief, p49/Exhibit CA-204)\n       A Sempra trader states Sempra should submit ``fake load'' \n     to the day ahead market. (CA Parties brief, p49/Exhibit CA-\n     71)\n       A Williams trading strategy is identified as ``scheduling \n     bogus load.'' (CA Parties brief, p49/Exhibit CA-22).\n       An internal Powerex memo documents that Powerex entered \n     into a contract with the explicit purpose of \n     ``overscheduling'' and ``underscheduling'' and for congestion \n     manipulation. (CA Parties brief, p49).\n       (4) Export-Import Games (aka ``Ricochet'' or ``Megawatt \n     Laundering'')--suppliers exported power out of California and \n     imported it back into the State in an attempt to sell power \n     at inflated prices.\n       New evidence of Export-Import Games according to the \n     California parties:\n       Powerex's head trader congratulated its daily traders on \n     their successful use of strategies to buy-ahead and sell back \n     real-time. (CA Parties brief, p53/Exhibit CA-40).\n       Reliant had ``camouflage transactions'' where the company \n     sold power out of California day-ahead to Arizona and New \n     Mexico utilities, and bought it back for sale in the real-\n     time market. (CA Parties brief, p55/Exhibit CA-56).\n       (5) Congestion Games (aka ``Death Star'')--suppliers \n     created false congestion and were then paid for relieving \n     congestion without moving any power.\n       New evidence of Congestion Games according to the \n     California parties:\n       Other names like ``Death Star'' were given to these \n     schemes: EPMI^Star, CISO^Death, Curious and George, Red and \n     Green, Hungry and Hippo, James and Dean or Chinook and \n     Atlantic and SCEM^Loopy. (CA Parties brief, p59/Exhibit CA-\n     1).\n       These congestion games were called ``free money.'' (CA \n     Parties brief, p59/Exhibit CA-145).\n       A Mirant trader summed up the scheme, ``I mean its just \n     kind of loop-t-looping but it's making money . . . [laugh].'' \n     (CA Parties brief, p48/Exhibit CA-204).\n       (6) Double-Selling--suppliers sold reserves, but then \n     failed to keep those reserves available for the ISO.\n       (7) Selling of Non-Existent Ancillary Services (aka ``Get \n     Shorty'')--suppliers sold resources that were either already \n     committed to other sales or incapable of being provided.\n       (8) Sharing of Non-Public Generation Outage Information--\n     the largest suppliers in California shared information from a \n     company called Industrial Information Resources that provided \n     sellers detailed, non-public information on daily plant \n     outages. A one-year subscription to Industrial Information \n     Resources cost $70,000. Providing multiple competitors the \n     same, non-public, outage information signals all competitors \n     to act in a parallel manner.\n       New evidence of Sharing of Non-Public Information according \n     to the California parties:\n       Duke energy traders called Industrial Information Resources \n     ``the mole.''\n       For example, Duke trader James Stebbins emailed: ``I just \n     heard back from the mole. He is reporting that the PV3 will \n     be coming back on line 6 days earlier than expected. The new \n     return date is March 3. Good luck and happy selling.'' (CA \n     Parties brief, p70/Exhibit CA-95 and Exhibit CA-253).\n       (9) Collusion Among Sellers--sellers were jointly \n     implementing or facilitating Enron-type trading strategies.\n       New evidence of Collusion Among Sellers according to the \n     California parties:\n       Glendale traders learned manipulation from Enron and Coral \n     traders. (CA Parties brief, p77/Exhibit CA-105 and Exhibit \n     CA-1).\n       Sempra provided Coral with advance information regarding \n     the status of a plant. (CA Parties brief, p78/Exhibit CA-1).\n       Transcripts of calls show traders from Public Service of \n     Colorado and Mirant discussing ``sharing'' or ``splitting'' \n     ``the upside. (CA Parties brief, p79/Exhibit CA-204).\n       (10) Manipulation of NONOX Emission Market--\n     sellers manipulated the market for NONOX emissions \n     in the South Coast Air Quality Management District through a \n     series of wash trades that created the appearance of a \n     dramatic price increase that may have been fabricated.\n       For example, Dynegy, together with AES and others, entered \n     into a series of trades of NONOX credits in July \n     and August 2000 by which Dynegy would sell a large quality of \n     credits and then simultaneously buy back a smaller quantity \n     of credits at a higher per credit price. (CA Parties brief, \n     p90-93/Exhibit CA-11).\n       (11) Wanton Document Destruction--sellers (not just Enron) \n     flagrantly destroyed documents detailing behavior in the \n     Western Energy Market.\n       New evidence of Wanton Document Destruction according to \n     the California parties:\n       Mirant--an ex-Mirant employee disclosed that he was \n     instructed to delete certain files relating to the California \n     markets from hard drives and that key Mirant executives were \n     instructed to turn in their laptops so that Mirant could \n     clear their hard drives.

Mr. President, the evidence of fraud and abuse \nsubmitted is really quite extraordinary.\n  Yet this energy bill doesn't prevent the type of gaming that went on \nduring the energy crisis. The bill only bans one type of specific \nmanipulation--wash trades in the electricity market--but it does not \naddress the natural gas market, nor does it prevent other forms of \nfraud and manipulation that took place in California and were detailed \nin memos released by Enron--``Fat Boy,'' ``Ricochet,'' ``Death Star,'' \nand ``Get Shorty.''\n  Furthermore, I am concerned that at this time of great crisis in the \nenergy industry, this energy legislation rolls back the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act--PUCHA--without giving FERC the ability to review \nmergers and acquisitions in the energy sector. I will support an \namendment to be offered by Senator Bingaman on this issue to ensure the \nconsumer protections granted by PUCHA are not repealed.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill does not increased automobile \nfuel efficiency to reduce our consumption of oil. The single most \neffective way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil is to equalize \nthe fuel economy of SUVs and light trucks with that of passenger cars.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe and I introduced bipartisan legislation in \nJanuary to close the SUV Loophole and since that time 16 other Senators \nhave signed onto our bill. Closing the SUV loophole would: Save the \nU.S. 1 million barrels of oil a day and reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil imports by 10 percent; prevent about 240 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide--the top greenhouse gas and biggest single cause of \nglobal warming--from entering the atmosphere each year; and save SUV \nand light duty truck owners hundreds of dollars each year in gasoline \ncosts.\n  Corporate Average Fuel Economy--CAFE--standards were first \nestablished in 1975. At that time, light trucks made up only a small \npercentage of the vehicles on the road--they were used mostly for \nagriculture and commerce, not as passenger cars.\n  Today, our roads look much different--SUVs and light duty trucks \ncomprise more than half of the new car sales in the United States.\n  As a result, the overall fuel economy of our nation's fleet is the \nlowest it has been in two decades--because fuel economy standards for \nthese vehicles are so much lower than they are for other passenger \nvehicles.\n  Rather than increasing fuel economy, however, this energy bill makes \nit more difficult for the Department of Transportation to increase CAFE \nstandards in the future by including a new list of criteria the \nDepartment must consider when revising standards.\n  We need to be responsible and increase fuel efficiency, not create \nmore barriers to increase CAFE standards.\n  I believe a comprehensive energy policy can promote the development \nof new energy supplies while protecting our most precious natural \nareas.\n  Yet this energy bill requires an inventory of all oil and gas \nresources under the Outer Continental Shelf. This inventory is a thinly \nveiled attempt to undermine long-standing and bipartisan moratorium \nprotection. Areas off the West and East Coasts are currently off limits \nto drilling, and we do not want that to change.\n  Even if we ignore the implications of this study on moratorium areas, \nthe inventory itself threatens precious coastal resources with invasive \ntechnologies. The coastal states have made it clear that they oppose \noil development in these areas, and I believe the States' views should \nbe respected.\n  I strongly believe that a comprehensive energy bill cannot ignore \nglobal climate change, yet this bill does nothing to decrease global \nwarming.\n  The International Panel on Climate Change estimates that the Earth's \naverage temperature could rise by as much as 10 degrees in the next 100 \nyears--the most rapid change in 10,000 years.\n  This would have a major effect on our way of life. It would melt the \npolar ice caps, decimate our coastal cities, and cause global climate \nchange.\n  We are already seeing the effects of warming.\n  In November, the Los Angeles Times published an article about the \nvanishing glaciers of Glacier National Park in Montana. Over a century \nago, 150 of these magnificent glaciers could be seen on the high cliffs \nand jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains of the park. Today, there \nare only 35. And these 35 glaciers that remain today are disintegrating \nso quickly that scientists estimate the park will have no glaciers in \n30 years.\n  This melting seen in Glacier National Park can also be seen around \nthe world, from the snows of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to the ice \nfields beneath Mt. Everest in the Himalayas. Experts also predict that \nglaciers in the high Andes, the Swiss Alps, and even Iceland could \ndisappear in coming decades as well. These dwindling glaciers offer the \nclearest and most visible sign of climate change in America and the \nrest of the world.\n  Yet the administration has walked away from the negotiating table for \nthe Kyoto Protocol. This is a big mistake. The United States is now the \nlargest energy consumer in the world, with 4 percent of the world's \npopulation using 25 percent of the planet's energy. We should be a \nleader when it comes to combating global warming.\n  I strongly believe that we can do more to encourage the development \nof renewable power. Solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass are generating \nelectricity for homes and businesses nationwide and we need an energy \npolicy that not only provides tax incentives for their continued \ndevelopment, but also requires their use. I strongly believe it is in \nthe public interest for our nation to stop subsidizing costly nuclear \nplants and require greater development of renewable resources.\n  However, this energy bill does not include a Renewable Portfolio \nStandard to require the use of a certain percentage of energy to be \ngenerated from renewable resources. I support such a standard and \nbelieve it should be part of our energy policy. Unfortunately the \nenergy bill currently has an over-reliance on promoting traditional \nenergy resources.\n  Take the nuclear power section of the bill for example. The energy \nbill provides a new subsidy program to provide loans, loan guarantees, \nand other forms of financial assistance to subsidize the construction \nof new nuclear plants. These subsidies will be allowed to cover up to \nhalf the cost of developing and constructing a nuclear power plant, \nincluding any costs resulting from licensing and regulatory delays. \nSince nuclear power plants cost approximately $6 billion to build, \nthese subsidies could inflict a tremendous burden on the taxpayer.\n  For these reasons I voted against this energy bill in the Senate \nEnergy Committee. I look forward to the opportunity to improve it on \nthe Floor.\n  I strongly believe our nation needs an energy policy that will \nprotect consumers, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and promote \nnew energy development while protecting our environment. If our energy \nlegislation cannot accomplish these objectives it will be an unbalanced \nand incomplete energy policy.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, over the next few days, the Senate will \nconsider legislation that will become the fuels title of comprehensive \nenergy legislation to be enacted by the Congress later this year. As I \nhave stated on other occasions, I firmly believe that the Nation needs \ncomprehensive energy legislation and needs it quickly. One of our \nlargest national security problems is our current energy dependence on \nforeign countries. I strongly agree with Deputy Secretary of Defense \nPaul Wolfowitz, who has called our energy dependence ``a serious \nstrategic issue.''\n  I think that most Members of the Senate would agree that expeditious \naction is needed to address our energy dependence concerns. There is \nmuch less agreement, however, on the specific fuels provisions that are \nbest suited to respond to those concerns. As chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I have worked\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nclosely with the issue surrounding this amendment and the impact they \nwill have on our environment, as well as the economy. I understand the \nvalid concerns on all sides of the debate.\n  This amendment represents a compromise on a number of contentious \nissues. I want to thank the members and their staffs for their \nrespective roles in shaping this compromise, particularly the majority \nand minority leaders, and Senator Voinovich, the Chairman of the Clean \nAir Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this amendment.\n  This amendment has numerous environmental protection provisions, and, \nwith the repeal of the oxygenate mandate, positive steps in removing \nbarriers to allow refineries to make clean burning and affordable \ngasoline.\n  As with all compromises, there are provisions in the document that \nare opposed by various committee members, including myself. Despite \nthat, I hope we can move the proposal out of the Senate with a minimum \nof controversy. To that end, I intend to support the proposal against \namendments even in circumstances where I might agree with the substance \nof the amendment. I urge others to do the same.\n  This is something that has been of great concern for this country. I \nbecame involved with this issue of our energy dependence way back in \nthe early 1980s when then-Secretary of Interior, Don Hodel, and I \ntraveled and talked about the national security ramifications of our \ndependence on foreign countries for our ability to fight a war. \nCertainly, I felt after the 1991 war and after the most recent conflict \nin Iraq that people would be sensitive to that. I think the amendment \nthat we are offering is one that is going to be of great help in \ngetting us to lessen our reliance on foreign countries for our ability \nto fight a war.\n  I look at this provision of the energy bill as a very significant \nprovision. As I said, there are parts of it and provisions that, as \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I do not agree \nwith. However, I strongly urge the support of this provision to the \nenergy bill and hope we can do it with minimum or with no amendments.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 14, the \ncomprehensive energy bill.\n  The chairman and all the members of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee worked hard to produce a comprehensive energy bill. While no \nlegislation is perfect, S. 14 is the product of careful debate and was \nsubject to tough scrutiny through the committee process.\n  Where the committee was uncertain or where significant consensus on \nparticular issues proved difficult, deference was given to Senators so \nthose issues could be addressed before the full Senate.\n  The Committee-reported energy bill represents a careful balance of \ndiverse and complex issues, and I am proud to have had a role in the \nprocess.\n  No matter one's political leanings or personal opinions, two \nirrefutable facts are abundantly clear. First, energy is needed to fuel \nthe economy. Second, America needs more energy.\n  Between 1991 and 2000, Americans used 17 percent more energy than in \nthe previous decade, while during that same period, domestic energy \nproduction rose by only 2.3 percent.\n  Further, our Nation's energy consumption is projected to increase 32 \npercent by 2020.\n  Our projected demand increase translates to projected price \nincreases. The Energy Information Administration estimates that oil \nprices will increase 20 percent and natural gas prices will increase \nmore than 50 percent in the next 25 years. Price increases like these \nemphasize our need to embrace policies that consider our Nation's \ndiverse fuel mix. This bill correctly encourages the consideration of \nall of our energy sources.\n  Some in Congress would pursue policies choosing certain energy \nsources over others, resulting in fuel switching. I oppose such \npolicies for several reasons. Principally, however, I oppose policies \nthat would significantly reduce our Nation's fuel options because such \npolicies would have catastrophic effects on our economy. It should be \nnoted that the EIA projections cited earlier all assume a diverse \nportfolio of energy sources. We can only imagine the cost to ratepayers \nand the Nation if an energy source, such as coal, were no longer a \nviable option.\n  To consider all of our energy options requires more than just lip \nservice. It means taking action based upon stated positions.\n  The Indian Energy Title of the bill moves beyond lip service. It \nincorporates several key reforms based on fundamental principles of \nAmerican liberty and Indian self-determination.\n  I imagine that many, if not all of the members of this body believe--\nor at least say they believe--in the right to self-determination. Many \nof my colleagues celebrate and support the rights of indigenous peoples \nin the context of international law. In the case of Iraq, all agree \nthat the Iraqi Government must be comprised of and run by Iraqis, for \nIraqis, without U.S. interference.\n  Unfortunately, if we are to ask the very same members to apply those \nrecognized principles at home to our Nation's own indigenous peoples, \ntheir resolve and belief in self-governance seems to disintegrate.\n  The Indian Energy Title in the bill before the Senate is not merely a \nreiteration of touchy-feely concepts. Concepts without action do not \nhelp people. And despite what many Americans, and many in this Chamber \nbelieve about Indian gaming and a few rich tribes, the truth is that \nIndians are still the poorest people in America; still have the worst \nhealth care; still have the fewest educational opportunities; and \nIndian children still suffer from sniffing glue, using ``canned heat,'' \nand committing suicide.\n  The truth is often uncomfortable. The truth is undeniable.\n  The Indian provisions in S. 14 are designed not only to respect \ntribes' right to self-determination, but to unshackle them from a \nregulatory and bureaucratic system that doesn't care whether an energy \nproject goes forward; doesn't care whether a tribe's energy partner \ndecides the bureaucratic hurdles are too high; and doesn't care whether \njobs will be created to benefit Indians.\n  Title III provides financial assistance, loan guarantees, hydro and \nwind power and wind power studies, and most importantly a \nliberalization of the Indian land leasing process.\n  These provisions are wholly voluntary, allowing participating tribes \ngreater flexibility in exercising their right to self-determination.\n  Title III contains no NEPA exemptions and the Indian Energy Title \ndoes not circumvent environmental protections. What it does do, \nhowever, is empower Indian tribes with long-overdue authority to manage \ntheir land while, ``ensuring compliance with all applicable \nenvironmental laws.''\n  The Indian energy provisions in S. 14 accepts that unfortunate \nreality and provides critical economic development opportunities to \nparticipating tribes.\n  The chairman has a difficult task--to produce a balanced \ncomprehensive energy bill during a Presidential election cycle. \nPolitics and rhetoric run highest at times like these.\n  Although it has happened since the days of the frontier, the powerful \nand wealthy should not manipulate the disenfranchised for political \ngain.\n  I sincerely hope that my colleagues in the Senate regard the Indian \nenergy provisions as what they are--a tool to exercise self-\ndetermination.\n  If it is good enough for Iraqis, shouldn't it be good enough for \nAmericans?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, this important renewable fuels \nlegislation is one of the pillars for economic development for rural \nAmerica--one segment of the population that has lagged behind during \nthe economic surge of the 1990s and is suffering under the combined \neffects of the current economic slowdown and a 2-year devastating \ndrought--Drought David.\n  This legislation is important for rural America. Last year, we \ncompleted the farm bill--the first part of the economic revitalization \nplan for rural America. And while the Midwest has been blessed with \nrain over the past month, we continue to struggle with the ongoing \neffects of drought. Economic stimulus can come in many forms, and \nrenewable fuels is certainly one of the viable options for increased \neconomic stimulus in rural America, especially in my home State of \nNebraska.\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\n  We need to be working hard to craft a comprehensive rural development \nplan that will spur investment in agribusiness and promote economic \nactivity in the agriculture center. This bill, the Fuels Security Act \nof 2003, is an important part of such a rural development plan.\n  It is clear that use of ethanol, as part of a renewable fuels \nstandard is a win-win-win situation: a win for farmers, a win for \nconsumers, and a win for the environment. That is why I rise as an \noriginal cosponsor and strong supporter this renewable fuels \nlegislation.\n  If passed, the Fuels Security Act will establish a 2.3-billion-gallon \nrenewable fuels standard in 2004, growing every year until it reaches 5 \nbillion gallons by 2012. There are many benefits to this legislation.\n  It will dispute 1.6 billion barrels of oil over the next decade; \nreduce our trade deficit by $34.1 billion; increase new investment in \nrural communities by more than $5.3 billion; boost the demand for feed \ngrains and soybeans by more than 1.5 billion bushels over the next \ndecade; create more than 214,000 new jobs throughout the U.S. economy; \nand expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion over the \nnext decade.\n  It is quite apparent that increased use of ethanol will do much to \nboost a struggling U.S. agriculture economy and will help establish a \nmore sound national energy policy.\n  The greater production of ethanol will also be beneficial to the \nenvironment. Studies show ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide \nand hydrocarbons by 20 percent and particulates by 40 percent in 1990 \nand newer vehicles. In 2001 ethanol reduced greenhouse gas emissions by \n3.6 million tons, the equivalent of removing more than 520,000 vehicles \nfrom the road.\n  A choice for ethanol is a choice for America, and its energy \nconsumers, its farmers and its environment.\n  Enactment of the Fuel Security Act--along with other provisions in \nthis bill that emphasize new sources of energy production from \nrenewables like wind power, as well as conservation to further reduce \nour dependence upon foreign sources of energy--will help us to reverse \nour 100-year-old reliance on fossil fuels a more pressing concern than \never given the possibility of military conflict in the Mideast and the \ncontinuing economic turmoil in Venezuela.\n  I am unabashedly proud of what my home State has accomplished in this \narea. Within the State of Nebraska, during the period from 1991 to \n2001, seven ethanol plants were constructed and several of these \nfacilities were expanded more than once during the decade. Specific \nbenefits of the ethanol program in Nebraska include: $11.15 billion in \nnew capital investment in ethanol processing plants; 1,005 permanent \njobs at the ethanol facilities and 5,115 induced jobs directly related \nto plant construction, operation, and maintenance--the permanent jobs \nalone generate an annual payroll of $44 million----and more than 210 \nmillion bushels of corn and grain sorghum is processed at the plants \nannually. These economic benefits and others have increased each year \nduring the past decade due to plant expansion, employment increases, \nand additional capital investment.\n  If each State produces 10 percent of its own domestic, renewable \nfuel, as Nebraska does, America will have turned the corner away from \ndependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  When you take a hard look at the facts, you will see that this \nlegislation is nothing but beneficial for America. The Fuels Security \nAct is balanced, comprehensive, and is the result of the dedication of \nso many, especially Senator Daschle and Senator Lugar.\n  Now I ask my colleagues to join me in promoting new opportunities for \nthe technologies that will put our Nation and the world's \ntransportation fuels on solid, sustainable, and environmentally \nenhancing ground. We owe it to our country now--and to future \ngenerations-in pass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5899-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5899-S5907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to take up this \nbill. It is under a unanimous consent agreement. Pursuant to that \nagreement, we are going to have some opening statements. I will take \nabout 15 minutes and then Senator Schumer, the cosponsor of the \namendment, will be presenting his remarks. After that, anyone who would \nlike to speak for or against this bill can do so.\n  There will be two amendments in order. One will be an accepted \namendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and \nanother will be offered by Senator Feinstein of California on which \nthere is, I believe, a total of 4 hours authorized for debate. I do not \nthink we will need that much time, but when the time comes, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose and defeat the Feinstein amendment so we can go to \nfinal passage of this legislation.\n  I will briefly describe what the bill does and why we need it. Then I \nwill get into some of the procedure involved. It is actually very \nsimple. It involves an existing law that we passed in 1978 called the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known by the acronym FISA. FISA \nallows us to get warrants, among other things, and allows us to surveil \npeople we suspect of committing acts of terrorism against us; for \nexample, to get a warrant to search their computer or their home.\n  There are two instances where the law currently applies. The \nunderlying predicate is that there has to be probable cause that \nsomebody is committing, about to commit, or planning to commit some \nkind of criminal act, a terrorism kind of act. It applies to two kinds \nof people: somebody who is either working for a foreign government or \nsomebody who is working for a foreign terrorist organization.\n  That leaves a little loophole because there are some terrorists who \nare not on the membership list, shall we say, or who are not card-\ncarrying members of a foreign terrorist organization or a foreign \ngovernment; people such as Zacarias Moussaoui, for example, whom we now \nbelieve to have been loosely involved in the al-Qaida attack of \nSeptember 11.\n  At the time, it was not possible to prove that he was involved with a \nforeign intelligence organization. It may\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nwell be that at the end of the day he was, in fact, a lone wolf, \noperating on his own, but very loosely affiliated with the radical \nIslamic movement which has underpinned a lot of the terrorism which \nthreatens the United States and the rest of the world today.\n  The law as written in 1978 was intended to apply to a very specific \ngroup of people, the Soviet spies, for example, or the Baader-Meinhof \ngang or the Red Brigade or the Red Army. There were a lot of these \norganizations back then, and they were very tightly knit organizations. \nIf somebody was involved in one of these groups, they were involved. \nBut today's radical Islamic movement around the world that associates \nitself with terrorism is much more amorphous. As I factitiously said, \nthese people do not have cards identifying themselves as members of \nthese organizations. They are people who hate the West and the United \nStates. They move in and out of the different countries of the world. \nThey will take training in a certain place. They will affiliate a \nlittle while with a group and then move on to support some other group.\n  The bottom line is that it is very difficult, sometimes impossible, \nto prove that they are affiliated with a specific group. In some cases, \nthey are not. They are simply acting on their own. But they are still \nterrorists. They are still foreign terrorists. They still mean to do us \nharm on the international stage and should be covered by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n\n  We close this loophole by providing that not only does it cover the \nperson working for a foreign government, or who we can prove at that \npoint is working for a foreign terrorist organization, it also includes \nthe so-called lone wolf terrorist, or the individual we cannot yet \nprove is directly affiliated with one of these amorphous groups. That \nis really all the bill does.\n  I will give a specific example. I mentioned Zacarias Moussaoui. \nRemember all of the criticism. He was a person who was taking flying \nlessons. It was under very suspicious circumstances. We understood this \nprior to September 11. There were people who wanted to get a Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act warrant to search his computer. It went \nto the FBI, and somebody in the FBI concluded that, yes, all of this \ninformation looked good in the warrant except that they could not \nspecifically tie him to a specific international group. Quite a bit of \ntime was used following up leads that led to some group of Chechen \nrebels, but that ended up to be kind of a dry hole. Meanwhile, the \nattack of September 11 occurred.\n  Immediately after that attack, we were able to get the warrant. His \ncase is pending in Northern Virginia at this time. He was not able to \nhook up with the attackers of September 11, but clearly his is an \nexample of a case to which this kind of provision should apply.\n  I will quote something from some of the testimony that we had with \nregard to the need for this legislation. Spike Bowman, who is the \nDeputy General Counsel of the FBI, testified at a Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence hearing on the predecessor bill to the one \nthat is before us right now. I will quote at length from his testimony. \nHe said:\n\n       When FISA was enacted, terrorism was very different from \n     what we see today. In the 1970s, terrorism more often \n     targeted individuals, often carefully selected. This was the \n     usual pattern of the Japanese Red Army, the Red Brigades and \n     similar organizations listed by name in the legislative \n     history of FISA. Today we see terrorism far more lethal and \n     far more indiscriminate than could have been imagined in \n     1978. It takes only the events of the September 11, 2001, to \n     fully comprehend the difference of a couple of decades. But \n     there is another difference as well. Where we once saw \n     terrorism formed solely around organized groups, today we \n     often see individuals willing to commit indiscriminate acts \n     of terror. It may be that these individuals are affiliated \n     with groups that we do not see, but it may be that they are \n     simply radicals who desire to bring about destruction.\n       We are increasingly seeing terrorist suspects who appear to \n     operate at a distance from these organizations. In perhaps an \n     oversimplification, but illustrative nevertheless, what we \n     see today are (1) agents of foreign powers in the traditional \n     sense who are associated with some organization or \n     discernible group, (2) individuals who appear to have \n     connections with multiple terrorist organizations but who do \n     not appear to owe any allegiance to any one of them, but \n     rather owe allegiance to the International Jihad movement, \n     and (3) individuals who appear to be personally oriented \n     toward terrorism but with whom there is no known connection \n     to a foreign power.\n       This phenomenon which we have seen . . . growing for the \n     past two or three years, appears to stem from a social \n     movement that began some imprecise time, but certainly more \n     than a decade ago. It is a global phenomenon which the FBI \n     refers to as the International Jihad Movement. By way of \n     background we believe we can see the contemporary development \n     of this movement, and its focus on terrorism, rooted in the \n     Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n       During the decade-long Soviet/Afghan conflict, anywhere \n     from 10,000 to 25,000 Muslim fighters representing some \n     forty-three countries put aside substantial cultural \n     differences to fight alongside each other in Afghanistan. The \n     force drawing them together was the Islamic concept of \n     ``umma'' or Muslim community. In this concept, nationalism is \n     secondary to the Muslim community as a whole. As a result, \n     Muslims from disparate cultures trained together, formed \n     relationships, sometimes assembled in groups and otherwise \n     would have been at odds with one another[,] and acquired \n     common ideologies. . . .\n       Following the withdrawal of the Soviet forces in \n     Afghanistan, many of these fighters returned to their \n     homelands, but they returned with new skills and dangerous \n     ideas. They now had newly acquired terrorist training as \n     guerilla warfare [had been] the only way they could combat \n     the more advanced Soviet forces.\n       Information from a variety of sources repeatedly carries \n     the theme from Islamic radicals that expresses the opinion \n     that we just don't get it. Terrorists world-wide speak of \n     jihad and wonder why the western world is focused on groups \n     rather than on concepts that make them a community.\n       The lesson to be taken from how [Islamic terrorists share \n     information] is that al-Qaida is far less a large \n     organization than a facilitator, sometimes orchestrator of \n     Islamic militants around the globe. These militants are \n     linked by ideas and goals, not by organizational structure.\n       The United States and its allies, to include law \n     enforcement and intelligence components worldwide[,] have had \n     an impact on the terrorists, but [the terrorists] are \n     adapting to changing circumstances. Speaking solely from an \n     operational perspective, investigation of these individuals \n     who have no clear connection to organized terrorism, or \n     tenuous ties to multiple organizations, is becoming \n     increasingly difficult. The current FISA statute has served \n     the Nation well, but the international Jihad movement \n     demonstrates the need to consider whether a different \n     formulation is needed to address the contemporary \n     terrorist problem.\n  Of course, the different way we are approaching it is by adding a \nthird element to the FISA statute. If you are a non-United States \nperson and otherwise we have probable cause to believe you are planning \nan act of or executing an act of terrorism, we have the right to seek a \nwarrant in the FISA court to search you, surveil you, whatever the \nwarrant might request.\n  That is the essence of this legislation. As I said, when FISA was \nenacted in 1978, this international movement around an idea had not yet \nevolved and we were focused on organizations. Now we need to add to the \nstatute, in addition to nations and specific organizations, non-United \nStates persons--in other words, foreign persons--who we believe are \ncarrying out some terrorist plan with international roots, directed at \nthe United States, sufficient to bring it under the aegis of the FISA \nstatute.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress to adapt our laws to these \nchanges. It is this challenge that Senator Schumer and I are attempting \nto address by this amendment.\n  I introduced this bill with Senator Schumer in the 107th Congress on \nJune 5, 2002, so it has been around almost a full year. The current \nbill is the identical bill introduced in the previous Congress. We held \na Select Committee on Interrogation hearing July 2002, the testimony \nfrom which I just quoted, and we heard testimony from six witnesses.\n  There was no Judiciary markup in the previous Congress, but in the \n108th Congress, when we reintroduced the bill January 9, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee held a markup. This bill, by the way, was \ncosponsored by Chairman Hatch, Senators DeWine, Schumer, myself, \nChambliss, Sessions, and there may be others of whom I am not aware.\n  March 6, the Judiciary Committee marked up the bill at an executive \nsession and adopted a substitute amendment, which is the bill we have \nbefore the Senate now, rejected a Feingold amendment by a vote of 11 to \n4, and voted to report the bill unanimously by a vote of 19 to 0 to the \nSenate. That is where we are today.\n  We hope to call anyone who has an interest in this to the floor to \nexpress their ideas. As I say, we are going to\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\naccept one amendment and we will be debating a second amendment, which \nI hope we defeat. There will be a break in our consideration here for \nsome other business in the middle of the day. We will return in \nmidafternoon to complete the work on the bill. It should be done by the \nlate afternoon.\n  Until Senator Schumer arrives, I make another point. There has been a \nworry on the part of some that this expands the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act to private American citizens. I make it crystal clear \nthat is not true.\n  By definition, we could not do that. This is a law that is only \njustified because it relates to international terrorism. So if you come \nhere from a foreign country, you are a non-U.S. person, you come from a \nforeign country, intending to do harm to Americans, as part of this \ninternational movement, whether you are a member of some specific \norganization or not, the act will be allowed to be used to determine \nwhether we should take further action against you. It is not pertaining \nto U.S. citizens; it is only to non-U.S. citizens and only in this \nparticular context.\n  Second, you cannot just do this willy-nilly, like every other \nwarrant. Whether under FISA or not, we have to have probable cause. \nThat requirement is not changed one iota. If anyone suggests there is \nanything improper, certainly it is not unconstitutional, but to the \nextent anyone suggests that we are ready to recite the reasons why, \nthat is not true.\n  I note the Department of Justice has sent a letter announcing its \nsupport for this legislation. Among those testifying in favor of it, \nthe U.S. Attorney General, the Director of the Bureau of Investigation, \nformer CIA Director, and any number of officials in our intelligence \nand law enforcement community have endorsed the bill.\n  I direct Members' attention to a letter I will later put into the \nRecord, dated July 31, 2002, which presented the Department of \nJustice's views on the bill and announced its support for the \nlegislation. It provides a detailed analysis of this question about the \nfourth amendment and whether or not there would be any constitutional \nissues.\n  The Department concluded that the bill would satisfy constitutional \nrequirements specifically related to the fourth amendment. In \nparticular, the Department emphasized that anyone monitored pursuant to \nthe bill would be someone who had at the very least been involved in \nterrorist acts that transcends national boundaries in term of the means \nthey are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to coerce or \nintimidate, or the locale in which the perpetrators operate or seek \nasylum.\n  As a result, it would still be limited to collecting foreign \nintelligence for the international responsibilities of the United \nStates and the duties of the Federal Government to the States in \nmatters involving foreign terrorism, to wit, protecting the American \ncitizens from people who come here to do us harm.\n  Let me conclude these remarks by noting that I have enjoyed the \ncooperation, as usual, of my colleague who serves on the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, who has been a \nstrong advocate of this kind of provision for a long time and whose \nassistance in this matter has been extraordinarily helpful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, Senator Kyl \nfrom Arizona, for his great work on this and many other issues.\n  We live in a new world. It is a post-September 11 world. We have to \nadjust to those realities. I believe we can do both, have security and \nliberty, the great concern of our Founding Fathers. I think this bill, \nin a careful and thoughtful way, readjusts that balance.\n  My colleague from Arizona has been a leader on these issues. We do \nnot always agree, but we often do. It is a pleasure to work with him. \nHis persistence and dedication to making this country secure and \nmaintaining its freedom at the same time is something I share and I \nrespect.\n  As I mentioned, the age-old debate between security and freedom is at \nthe nub of the Constitution. It was probably debated more by the \nFounding Fathers than any other issue. They realized that in times of \ncrisis, in times of war, in times of attack, the pendulum could swing \nmore to the security side and at other times to the freedom side. They \nrealized, as Benjamin Franklin said, that giving up even an ounce of \nprecious freedom is a very serious thing to do.\n  FISA is a debate about that. While I certainly believe, as I think \nmost of my colleagues do, given the fact that what we have learned \nsince September 11, that terrorists can strike in our heartland, that \nsmall groups of people empowered by technology can do the kind of \ndamage we have never seen before, which my city suffered on September \n11. We remember the losses every day. We do have to reexamine this, \nparticularly when there has been one law for people overseas and one \nlaw for people in this country because the walls have changed.\n  That is a general debate on FISA. I know some of my colleagues have \nwanted to do that today. My colleague from Wisconsin says the law has \nshifted too far one way. My colleague from Utah thinks it has shifted \nthe other way. Senator Kyl and I are not debating that. We do not give \nup any liberty in this bill. The very standards that are now in the law \nwith FISA remain, standards of what must be done to get a FISA warrant. \nThose do not change. The only change is our recognition that in these \nnew post-9/11 years, technology has allowed small groups unknown \nbefore, or even lone wolf individuals, to commit terrorism, and if they \nare doing the same thing as established terrorist groups or established \nterrorist nations, there seems to be no reason why they shouldn't be \nsusceptible to the same type of surveillance of other groups. That is \nat the nub of this issue.\n\n  We are informed by history. Again, those who say don't do anything to \nchange don't look at history, in my judgment. We learned from the \ndisclosures regarding Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, \nthat the FBI had abundant reason to be suspicious of him before 9/11, \nbut they did not act, they did not do what Agent Rowley wanted them to \ndo. She, of course, has been heralded as a great leader and a great \nAmerican for what she has done, and I join in that. But they didn't \nwant to do what she wanted, which was pursue a warrant to dig up \nevidence that may have been the thread which, if pulled, would have \nunraveled the terrorists' plans.\n  The anguish she felt then, and so many of us feel afterwards, that \nthis might have been stopped but wasn't because of a provision in the \nFISA law that quickly became archaic as terrorists advanced and we \nlearned that small groups could do such damage, is what motivates this \nlegislation.\n  One reason we have been given--and Agent Rowley agrees with this, I \nbelieve--why the FBI did not seek the warrant is the bar for getting \nthose warrants when it came to those not affiliated with known \nterrorist groups or known terrorist countries was set too high.\n  That is why Senator Kyl and I introduced this amendment to FISA. We \nintend to make it easier for law enforcement to get warrants against \nnon-U.S. citizens--this does not affect a single U.S. citizen--who are \nsuspected of preparing to commit acts of terrorism.\n  As I mentioned, we leave two of the standards in place, the ones that \nmeasure the bar. Right now, the FBI is required to show three things \nbefore they can get a warrant: They must show the target is engaging in \nor preparing to engage in international terrorism. We keep that \nrequirement. It does not change. They must show a significant purpose \nof the surveillance is foreign-intelligence gathering. We are keeping \nthat requirement, too, that foreign-intelligence gathering is a \nsignificant purpose.\n  Here is the problem. They also must show under present law that the \ntarget is an agent of a foreign power, such as Iraq, or a known foreign \nterrorist group, such as Hamas or al-Qaida. That is the hurdle we are \nremoving. If that requirement had not been in place, there is no \nquestion the FBI could have gotten a warrant to do electronic \nsurveillance on Zacarias Moussaoui and, who knows, not certainly but \nperhaps, 9/11 might not have occurred.\n  That is the anguish we all face. Right now we know there may be \nterrorists plotting on American soil. We may have all kinds of reasons \nto believe\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\nthey are preparing to commit acts of terrorism. But we cannot do the \nsurveillance we need if we cannot tie them to a foreign power or an \ninternational terrorist group. It is a catch-22. We need the \nsurveillance to get the information we need to be able to do the \nsurveillance. It makes no sense. The simple fact is, it should not \nmatter whether we can tie someone to a foreign power. Whether our \nintelligence is just not good enough or whether the terrorist is acting \nas a lone wolf or it is a new group of 10 people who have not been \naffiliated with any known terrorist group, should not affect whether we \ncan do surveillance, should not affect whether they are a danger to the \nUnited States, should not affect whether they are preparing to do \nterrorism. Engaging in international terrorism should be enough for our \nintelligence experts to start surveillance.\n  It is important to note if we remove this last requirement now it \nwill immeasurably aid law enforcement without exposing American \ncitizens or those who hold green cards to the slightest additional \nsurveillance. Let me repeat, because I know we get some who write that \nthis is the unraveling of the Constitution and it befuddles me because \nit is not, it does not affect a single American citizen or those who \nhave green cards.\n\n  It is fair. It is reasonable. It is a smart fix to a serious problem. \nIt passed out of the Judiciary Committee with unanimous support. It is \nsupported by the administration as well.\n  One final word. This is about an amendment from my good friend, a \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, which we will debate. She \nis introducing an amendment that would allow some gray into the law, \nrather than making it black or white. Her amendment would leave the \ndecision whether or not to grant the FBI a FISA warrant against a lone \nwolf, she would leave that up to a particular judge.\n  I do not believe we can afford any more uncertainty. We saw what \nuncertainty did when the Zacarias Moussaoui case occurred. The FBI, so \nworried that they might overstep, said no. We need clarity in the law \nwhen it comes to fighting terrorism.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Feinstein amendment and \nsupport the bipartisan bill which is before us today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator DeWine \nbe recognized at 1 p.m. for 15 minutes of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the debate on \nthe pending business involving the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, a letter from the Department of Justice dated July 31, 2002, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Vice-Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: The letter \n     presents the views of the Justice Department on S. 2586, a \n     bill ``[t]o exclude United States persons from the definition \n     of `foreign power' under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 relating to international \n     terrorism.'' The bill would extend the coverage of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillence Act (``FISA'') to \n     individuals who engage in international terrorism or \n     activities in preparation therefor without a showing of \n     membership in or affiliation with an international terrorist \n     group. The bill would limit this type of coverage to non-\n     United States persons. The Department of Justice supports S. \n     2586.\n       We note that the proposed title of the bill is potentially \n     misleading. The current title is ``To exclude United States \n     persons from the definition of `foreign power' under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 relating to \n     international terrorism.'' A better title, in keeping with \n     the function of the bill, would be something along the \n     following lines: ``To expand the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (`FISA') to reach individuals other \n     than United States persons who engage in international \n     terrorism without affiliation with an international terrorist \n     group.''\n       Additionally, we understand that a question has risen as to \n     whether S. 2586 would satisfy constitutional requirements. We \n     believe that it would.\n       FISA allows a specially designated court to issue an order \n     appoving an electronic surveillance or physical search, where \n     a significant purpose of the surveillance or search is ``to \n     obtain foreign intelligence information.'' Id. \n     Sec. Sec. 1804(a)(7)(B), 1805(a). Given this purpose, the \n     court makes a determination about probable cause that differs \n     in some respects from the determination ordinarily underlying \n     a search warrant. The court need not find that there is \n     probable cause to believe that the surveillance or search, in \n     fact, will lead to foreign intelligence information, let \n     alone evidence of a crime, and in many instances need not \n     find probable cause to believe that the target has committed \n     a criminal act. The court instead determines, in the cause of \n     electronic surveillance, whether there is probable cause to \n     believe that ``the target of the electronic surveillance is a \n     foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,'' id \n     Sec. 1805(a)(3)(A), and that each of the places at which the \n     surveillance is directed ``is being used, or about to be \n     used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,'' \n     id. Sec. 1805(a)(3)(B). The court makes parallel \n     determinations in the case of a physical search. Id. \n     Sec. 1824(a)(3)(A). (B).\n       The terms ``foreign power'' and ``agent of a foreign \n     power'' are defined at some length, Id. Sec. 1801(a), (b), \n     and specific parts of the definitions are especially \n     applicable to surveillances or searches aimed at collecting \n     intelligence about terrorism. As currently defined, ``foreign \n     power'' includes ``a group engaged in international terrorism \n     or activities in preparation therefor,'' Id. Sec. 1801(a)(4) \n     (emphasis added), and an ``agent of a foreign power'' \n     includes any person who ``knowingly engages in sabotage or \n     international terrorism or activities that are in preparation \n     therefor, for or on behalf of a foreign power,'' Id. \n     Sec. 1801(b)(2)(C). ``International terrorism'' is defined to \n     mean activities that: (1) involve violent acts or acts \n     dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal \n     laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a \n     criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of \n     the United States or any State; (2) appear to be intended--\n     (A) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (B) to \n     influence the policy of a government by intimidation or \n     coercion, or (C) to affect the conduct of a government by \n     assassination or kidnapping; and (3) occurs totally outside \n     the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms \n     of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they \n     appear intended to coerce of intimidate, or the locale in \n     which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.\n       S. 2586 would expand the definition of ``foreign power'' to \n     reach persons who are involved in activities defined as \n     ``international terrorism,'' even if these persons cannot be \n     shown to be agents of a ``group'' engaged in international \n     terrorism. To achieve this expansion, the bill would add the \n     following italicized words to the current definition of \n     ``foreign power'': ``any person other than a United States \n     person who is, or a group that is, engaged in international \n     terrorism or activities in preparation therefor.''\n       The courts repeatedly have upheld the constitutionality, \n     under the Fourth Amendment, of the FISA provisions that \n     permit issuance of an order based on probable cause to \n     believe that the target of a surveillance or search is a \n     foreign power or agent of a foreign power. The question posed \n     by S. 2586 would be whether the reasoning of those cases \n     precludes expansion of the term ``foreign power'' to include \n     individual international terrorists who are unconnected to a \n     terrorist group.\n       The Second Circuit's decision in United States versus \n     Duggan, 743 F.2d 59 (2d Cir. 1984), sets out the fullest \n     explanation of the ``governmental concerns'' that had led to \n     the enactment of the procedures in FISA. To identify these \n     concerns, the court first quoted from the Supreme Court's \n     decision in United States versus United States District \n     Court, 407 U.S. 297, 308 (1972) (``Keith''), which addressed \n     ``domestic national security surveillance'' rather than \n     surveillance of foreign powers and their agents, but which \n     specified the particular difficulties in gathering ``security \n     intelligence'' that might justify departures from the usual \n     standards for warrants: ``[Such intelligence gathering] is \n     often long range and involves the interrelation of various \n     sources and types of information. The exact targets of such \n     surveillance may be more difficult to identify than in \n     surveillance operations against many types of crime specified \n     in Title III [dealing with electronic surveillance in \n     ordinary criminal cases]. Often, too, the emphasis of \n     domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of \n     unlawful activity or the enhancement of the government's \n     preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency. \n     Thus the focus of domestic surveillance may be less precise \n     than that directed against more conventional types of \n     crime.'' Duggan, 743 F.2d\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\n     at 72 (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at 322). The Second Circuit \n     then quoted a portion of the Senate Committee Report on FISA: \n     ``[The] reasonableness [of FISA procedures] depends, in part, \n     upon an assessment of the difficulties of investigating \n     activities planned, directed, and supported from abroad by \n     foreign intelligence services and foreign-based terrorist \n     groups. . . . Other factors include the international \n     responsibilities of the United States, the duties of the \n     Federal Government to the States in matters involving foreign \n     terrorism, and the need to maintain the secrecy of lawful \n     counterintelligence sources and methods.'' Id. at 73 (quoting \n     S. Rep. No. 95-701, at 14-15, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n     3973, 3983) (``Senate Report''). The court concluded:\n       Against this background, [FISA] requires that the FISA \n     Judge find probable cause to believe that the target is a \n     foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, and that the \n     place at which the surveillance is to be directed is being \n     used or is about to be used by a foreign power or an agent of \n     a foreign power; and it requires him to find that the \n     application meets the requirements of [FISA]. These \n     requirements make it reasonable to dispense with a \n     requirement that the FISA Judge find probable cause to \n     believe that surveillance will in fact lead to the \n     gathering of foreign intelligence information.\n       Id. at 73. The court added that, a fortiori, it \n     ``reject[ed] defendants' argument that a FISA order may not \n     be issued consistent with the requirements of the Fourth \n     Amendment unless there is a showing of probable cause to \n     believe the target has committed a crime.'' Id. at n.5. See \n     also, e.g., United States versus Pelton, 835 F.2d 1067, 1075 \n     (4th Cir. 1987); United States versus Cavanagh, 807 F.2d 787, \n     790-91 (9th Cir. 1987) (per then-Circuit Judge Kennedy); \n     United States versus Nicholson, 955 F. Supp. 588, 590-91 \n     (E.D. Va. 1997).\n       We can conceive of a possible argument for distinguishing, \n     under the Fourth Amendment, the proposed definition of \n     ``foreign power'' from the definition approved by the courts \n     as the basis for a determination of probable cause under FISA \n     as now written. According to this argument, because the \n     proposed definition would require no tie to a terrorist \n     group, it would improperly allow the use of FISA where an \n     ordinary probable cause determination would be feasible and \n     appropriate--where a court could look at the activities of a \n     single individual without having to access ``the \n     interrelation of various sources and types of information,'' \n     see Keith, 407 U.S. at 322, or relationships with foreign-\n     based groups, see Daggan, 743 F.2d at 73; where there need be \n     no inexactitude in the target or focus of the surveillance, \n     see Keigh, 407 U.S. at 322; and where the international \n     activities of the United States are less likely to be \n     implicated, see Duggan, 743 F.2d at 73. However, we believe \n     that this argument would not be well-founded.\n       The expanded definition still would be limited to \n     collecting foreign intelligence for the ``international \n     responsibilities of the United States, [and] the duties of \n     the Federal Government to the States in matters involving \n     foreign terrorism.'' Id. at 73 (quoting Senate Report at 14). \n     The individuals covered by S. 2586 would not be United States \n     persons, and the ``international terrorism'' in which they \n     would be involved would continue to ``occur totally outside \n     the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms \n     of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they \n     appear intended to coerce or intimidate, or the locale in \n     which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.'' 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1801(c)(3). These circumstances would implicate the \n     ``difficulties of investigating activities planned, directed, \n     and supported from abroad,'' just as current law implicates \n     such difficulties in the case of foreign intelligence \n     services and foreign-based terrorist groups. Duggan, 743 F.2d \n     at 73 (quoting Senate Report at 14). To overcome those \n     difficulties, a foreign intelligence investigation ``often \n     [will be] long range and involve[] the interrelation of \n     various sources and types of information.'' Id. at 72 \n     (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at 322). This information frequently \n     will require special handling, as under the procedures of the \n     FISA court, because of ``the need to maintain the secrecy of \n     lawful counterintelligence sources and methods.'' Id. at 73 \n     (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at 322). Furthermore, because in \n     foreign intelligence investigations under the expanded \n     definition ``[o]ften . . . the emphasis . . . [will be] on \n     the prevention of unlawful activity or the enhancement of the \n     government's preparedness for some possible future crisis or \n     emergency,'' the ``focus of . . . surveillance may be less \n     precise than that directed against more conventional types of \n     crime.'' Id at 73 (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at 322). \n     Therefore, the same interests and considerations that support \n     the constitutionality of FISA as it now stands would provide \n     the constitutional justification for the S. 2586.\n       Indeed, S. 2586 would add only a modest increment to the \n     existing coverage of the statute. As the House Committee \n     Report on FISA suggested, a ``group'' of terrorists covered \n     by current law might be as small as two or three persons. \n     H.R. Rep. No. 95-1283, at pt. 1, 74 and n.38 (1978). The \n     interests that the courts have found to justify the \n     procedures of FISA are not likely to differ appreciably as \n     between a case involving such a group of two or three persons \n     and a case involving a single terrorist.\n       The events of the past few months point to one other \n     consideration on which courts have not relied previously in \n     upholding FISA procedures--the extraordinary level of harm \n     that an international terrorist can do to our Nation. The \n     touchstone for the constitutionality of searches under the \n     Fourth Amendment is whether they are ``reasonable.'' As the \n     Supreme Court has discussed in the context of ``special needs \n     cases,'' whether a search is reasonable depends on whether \n     the government's interests outweigh any intrusion into \n     individual privacy interests. In light of the efforts of \n     international terrorists to obtain weapons of mass \n     destruction, it does not seem debatable that we could suffer \n     terrible injury at the hands of a terrorist whose ties to an \n     identified ``group'' remained obscure. Even in the criminal \n     context, the Court has recognized the need for flexibility in \n     cases of terrorism. See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, \n     44 (2000) (``the Fourth Amendment would almost certainly \n     permit an appropriately tailored roadblock set up to thwart \n     an imminent terrorist attack''). Congress could legitimately \n     judge that even a single international terrorist, who intends \n     ``to intimidate or coerce a civilian population'' or ``to \n     influence the policy of a government by intimidation or \n     coercion'' or ``to affect the conduct of a government by \n     assassination or kidnapping,'' 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1801(c)(2), \n     acts with the power of a full terrorist group or foreign \n     nation and should be treated as a ``foreign power'' subject \n     to the procedures of FISA rather than those applicable to \n     warrants in criminal cases.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. Please \n     do not hesitate to call upon us if we may be of additional \n     assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     us that from the perspective of the Administration's program, \n     there is no objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to advise Members that under the \nunanimous consent agreement for the consideration of this bill there is \na period of 2 hours general debate and 4 hours equally divided on the \nFeinstein amendment. We would like to ask Members who have comments to \nmake about this legislation to come to the floor and express themselves \nso that we can conclude this bill today under the unanimous consent. I \nwill continue to discuss the bill. But if other Members would like to \ncome, I will yield the floor to them. I would ask that those who have \namendments that are authorized by the unanimous consent agreement to \nlay those amendments down so Members who wish to speak to those \namendments could also address that.\n  In the meantime, let me continue some of the conversation Senator \nSchumer and I had before. We are talking about a bill which would plug \na loophole in the existing law--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct--which currently authorizes warrants to be obtained in two specific \nsituations. We make it clear that there is a third situation as well. \nThe two specific situations are where you either have somebody you \nsuspect is involved in international terrorism because they work for a \nforeign government--that is a situation like the old Soviet spy--or \nthey work for some international terrorist organization. Remember that \nthis law was created at the time when we had organized groups such as \nthe Red Brigade and the Meinhof gang, and those types of groups. That \nis why those two definitions in the statute were included in the way \nthey were. What was not anticipated is that we would also have people \ncoming from abroad to the United States to commit acts of terrorism \nagainst American citizens as part of this rather amorphus Islamic Jihad \nmovement rather than an organization of people affiliated around a \nculture or an idea or a movement.\n  As a result, the statute needs to include that third group of people, \nas we know, after September 11. We have specific cases of people in \nwhich warrants were sought but were not obtained because we couldn't \nmake that connection to either a specific country or a very specific \nterrorist organization. Instead, the individual had relationships with \nvarious people and organizations involved in terrorism but certainly we \ncouldn't say he was a card-carrying member in the sense that the \nstatute was originally drafted. So the same requirements, as Senator \nSchumer said, would pertain. It doesn't apply to U.S. citizens. It only \napplies to foreign terrorism. But it would include a person coming here \nfrom another country--not a U.S. citizen--and we have probable cause to \nbelieve is engaged in or about to engage in an act of terrorism.\n  In that case, the law enforcement authorities can go to the court and \nseek a warrant just as they do in any other criminal court. But the \ndifference here is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. One of \nthe reasons a special\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\ncourt is set up for that is because the information which the Justice \nDepartment frequently presents is highly classified. Clearly, here you \nare dealing with foreign threats--either an international spy spying on \nus from another country or some kind of terrorist like Zacarias \nMoussaoui, and the information you have that enables the warrant to be \nsought was obtained obviously through intelligence work. You don't want \nto compromise either the sources or the methods of intelligence. As a \nresult, you can't just file publicly in the regular court system for a \nwarrant.\n  That is why the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court was \nestablished. These are judges just like any other judge, but they have \nspecial intelligence clearances. They have been cleared to handle \nclassified material. By the rules of the court, that material is kept \nin the court. Once allegations have been filed against people, then the \nmatter can be debated in camera, which is to say in private--not in \npublic hearings. Proceedings remain classified, at least until the \nmatter is included; perhaps thereafter as well.\n\n  This is the way in which these highly sensitive intelligence matters \nare handled. It takes a special procedure and a special court to do \nthat. But there is nothing antithetical to a constitutional right \nsimply because we have to handle it that way.\n  There are other situations, as well, in which in our court system can \nhandle things nonpublicly. There are sometimes sensitive matters \nbetween litigants that have to be handled in camera; that is to say, in \neffect in the judge's chambers and not out in public. Certainly, I \nthink everybody can recognize that in some of the big spy cases and \ninternational terrorism cases you just can't take the evidence you \ngathered by the intelligence mechanism which we have and produce all of \nthat information in open court. That is why you have these special \nprocedures. But the underlying legal requirements to obtain the warrant \nremain essentially the same. They are slightly different in the \nclassified court than in a regular court.\n  In all candor, they are a little bit easier to obtain. But the basic \nelement of probable cause and belief that a crime is being committed or \nis about to be committed or is planned remains. Nothing is changed.\n  As Senator Schumer pointed out, our legislation doesn't change \nanything relating to the standard of proof, the burden of proof, or \nanything of that sort in the existing law that works so well. What we \ndo is ensure that the warrant can be obtained not just against the spy \nfor a specific country, or the terrorist whom you can identify as a \nmember of a particular terrorist organization--sort of an anachronistic \nconcept in today's terrorist situation--but also pertains to the non-\nU.S. citizen, a foreign person who comes here from abroad with the \nintent to commit some act of terrorism against U.S. citizens.\n\n  When you have those elements, you have the same foreign terrorist \nnexus to the law that our Constitution permits included within the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act for purposes of obtaining \nwarrants or obtaining other surveillance of the individuals. That is \nall we do. That is all that is done by this legislation.\n  So those of us--including I think every one of us on the Judiciary \nCommittee--who consider ourselves civil libertarians need not be \nconcerned that this statute or that this legislation, in any way, would \nimpact on our constitutional rights, nor that it would diminish the \nconstitutional rights of non-U.S. persons who are not engaged in \nterrorism. But if we have probable cause to believe you are engaged in \nan act of terrorism, then, yes, you would be subject to provisions of \nthis law.\n  This legislation has an interesting history, as I alluded to earlier, \nbecause it was assigned to the Intelligence Committee, and it was \nalmost included as a part of the Intelligence Authorization Act of last \nyear. And the chairman of the Intelligence Committee this year was kind \nenough to offer to include it in this year's legislation as well.\n  Since we were able to also have the bill marked up in the Judiciary \nCommittee and brought to the floor as a result of that markup, that was \nnot deemed necessary. That is why the bill is here--actually as a \nresult of action by the Judiciary Committee.\n  So both the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee have \nbeen involved in this legislation, the former having a hearing and the \nlatter having marked up the bill. Having been a member of the \nIntelligence Committee and sitting, as I do, on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I can tell you it was also the subject of additional \ncomments and hearings that were held for broader purposes of examining \nthe terrorism issue. That is why I mentioned the fact that the \nlegislation had actually been supported publicly by various Government \nofficials who testified before either the full Judiciary Committee or \nthe subcommittee I chair on terrorism and technology. They had \ntestified before our committee on terrorism issues generally, and I \nspecifically asked whether they supported the legislation in question; \nthe response to the questions, of course, was that they did.\n  Another interesting hearing, which was a joint hearing, as I recall, \nbetween the Judiciary and the Intelligence Committees had testimony \nfrom Coleen Rowley, referred to by Senator Schumer earlier. You will \nrecall, she was the agent from Indianapolis who was very exercised \nabout the fact that she could not get a warrant against Zacarias \nMoussaoui and complained bitterly that the FBI headquarters had \nprevented her from doing that. She thought the conditions warranted the \nissuance of the warrant.\n  It is a debatable point. But it would not have been debatable if our \nproposal had been law. It would have been very clear. We had the \nprobable cause. The only question was, Can we tie this person to some \ninternational terrorist organization? As I said before, we spent a lot \nof time and a lot of effort trying to run around tracing his contacts \nwith Chechen rebels, and at the end of the day it just was not specific \nenough to be able to use the statute to get the warrant against him.\n\n  Right after 9/11, when essentially the same warrant was sent forward, \nthen we had additional information of contacts this individual had, as \na result of which the warrant was obtained. But that would not have \noccurred had September 11 not occurred--or at least it is doubtful it \nwould have occurred. Let me put it that way.\n  Would that have prevented the September 11 attacks? No one knows for \nsure. I suspect not, but at least a plausible case can be made that we \nwould have known a lot more about the planning of September 11 had we \nbeen able to get into Moussaoui's computers and questioned him and \nascertained what he was up to and, furthermore, traced the contacts we \nwere later able to trace from Moussaoui to others involved in the al-\nQaida movement that would have painted a much clearer picture of what \nwas being planned prior to September 11 than the information that we \nhad.\n  The point is, we do not want to be in that position again. So whether \nit would have prevented 9/11 is really beside the point. We had the \nability to get information which can protect the American people \nagainst acts of international terrorism. Why wouldn't we want to take \nadvantage of that opportunity?\n  As I said, the Judiciary Committee unanimously voted this bill out of \ncommittee to send it to the floor so we could deal with that precise \nissue. I am certain my colleagues will agree that this is important to \ndo and that we will do it a little bit later on this day. When we do, I \nthink we can be very proud of the fact that this is another in a series \nof things we will have done to help prepare our country against the \ninternational terrorist threat.\n  We know that in the whole matter of homeland security you can only \nprovide so much defense, that it really is about taking the fight to \nthe enemy. Because our country is so big, it is so open, we have such \nbroad freedoms in this country--and thankfully so--it is virtually \nimpossible to absolutely protect us from a terrorist who would come \nhere to do us harm. One of the ways we can help to protect against that \nis by getting good intelligence on people who come here from abroad and \nwho we find out mean us ill. This provision today is a way to help us \ndo that.\n  So this is a tool in the war on terror that will really help us \nensure that we deal with as many of these threats as we possibly can. \nAre we always going to find out enough to even get a warrant? Not \nnecessarily so. That is why\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\nthe efforts of the administration to go after these terrorists all \naround the world are so important.\n  But what has helped us in that regard is that we have had cooperation \nfrom other governments. And as much as we have been critical of some of \nour allies for not supporting us as we would like to have had them do--\nsuch as the situation in Iraq--I will tell you, virtually every country \nin the world has been supportive in one way or another in supplying us \nwith information about terrorists in their countries or terrorists of \nwhom they are aware who might be affiliated in some way in this \ninternational movement that threatens us all.\n  One of the things we discovered, however, in talking to legislators \nand parliamentarians from these other countries, and intelligence \nofficials, and law enforcement officials, is that they have legal \ninhibitions just like the United States does. Their laws only permit \nthem to go so far in tracking down these terrorists in their country.\n\n  In the case of Germany, for example, which has been very helpful to \nthe United States, they were able to change one of their laws to make \nit easier for them to go after these terrorists. There was another law \nthey also needed to change, and at last count I do not recall whether \nthey were able to get that done.\n  But the point is, if we are able to change our law, as we did with \nthe Border Security Act and the USA Patriot Act, we can demonstrate a \nseriousness of purpose to these other countries to convince them that \nall of us need to make these kinds of changes in our laws so that we \ncan go after these terrorists.\n  The analogy is, we won the war in Iraq in a most amazing way. We sent \nour troops with the best equipment and the best training ever in the \nhistory of the world. And I wish I could share some of that, the \ninformation about that equipment publicly. But I think we have all, \nthrough the embedded reporters, come to appreciate how just one \nAmerican soldier, with all of the technology at his disposal, can make \na tremendous difference.\n  We also have helped protect them. They have special flak vests, \nbulletproof vests that protect them against a lot of incoming. We try \nto protect them with the special chemical gear in the event of a \nchemical attack, and so on.\n  We want to send our troops into battle protected in the very best way \nand with the very best means of accomplishing their mission. Why would \nwe deny our law enforcement and intelligence officials the very same \nkinds of weapons in the battle that we send them out to win?\n  I guarantee you that the next time there is a case like Zacarias \nMoussaoui or some other terrorist about whom we have some information \nbut we don't go after strongly enough, and he does something to us, the \nrecrimination will be great. Oh, the accusations will fly: Why didn't \nwe do something about that when we could have?\n  So our response today is going to be: We did. We came together as a \nSenate and we enacted another law, another piece--it is a small piece, \nbut it is an important piece--to help us fight this war on terror. We \ndid not shirk our responsibility. When we became aware of the loophole \nin the law, we acted to fill it.\n  Now, we have to do that in order to be able to take this credit, \nobviously, but I believe strongly that the House of Representatives \nwill act similarly and that we will be able to get this to the \nPresident's desk in very short order, so at the end of the day today we \ncan say we have done something very important to advance our ability to \nfight the war on terror and protect the American people.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, if there is no opposition--and I hope \nthere isn't--that is fine. But anybody, either in opposition or in \nfavor of the legislation, come forward so that we can have whatever \ndebate is necessary. And I especially ask the proponents of amendments \nto come forward so that we can begin to debate them.\n  I will take this moment to press some of the comments that will be \nmade about the two amendments.\n  Senator Feingold has proposed an amendment that we will accept and \nthe Senate should accept which requires that the warrants obtained \nunder this law generally--not just the provision we are talking about \ntoday, but if we obtain a warrant under either of the other provisions \nas well, that the information be compiled and shared with the Senate; \nspecifically, that the information be sent to the Intelligence \nCommittee--it is classified information, obviously--and that the \ncleared people on the Judiciary Committee who are appropriate to view \nthe information have full access to that so we can evaluate whether \nthese provisions are being used, abused, how often they are being used, \nhow effectively, and so on. I believe his amendment calls for an annual \nreport which we could examine. That is very useful information for us \nto have.\n  One thing we found was that prior to 9/11, this statute had not been \nused very often. It is not a particularly easy statute with which to \ncomply. You do really have to have your information together before you \nseek the warrant because you don't ever want to be turned down. I don't \nbelieve the Justice Department ever was turned down. That is evidence \nof the fact that they were careful. Since 9/11, there have been a lot \nmore cases in which this has been used. That information will be \navailable to us, and therefore I will support Senator Feingold in \noffering the amendment.\n  The other amendment that is in order under the unanimous consent \nagreement, with all due respect to my great friend and colleague \nSenator Feinstein, would gut the bill and would be bad. It would really \nundermine the whole FISA process. We should reject it. I know she \noffers this amendment not for that purpose. Of all the people in the \nSenate with whom I have worked who share my strong conviction that we \nneed to do everything we can to support our intelligence and law \nenforcement communities, Senator Feinstein is equaled by none. She is \nthe ranking member of the Terrorism Subcommittee, and she and I have \ncosponsored numerous bills or amendments designed to enhance law \nenforcement and intelligence capabilities. She is a very strong \nadvocate of giving our intelligence and law enforcement communities the \nvery best tools possible.\n  She just has a different point of view about how this FISA warrant \nprocess should work. I will let her describe it. I will offer my view \nthat it has no place in the FISA situation. What her amendment purports \nto do really might have some applicability in a court setting because \nit talks about a presumption. As lawyers know, presumptions arise when \nyou have two parties to litigation and one party comes forward with a \nparticular piece of evidence or allegation which then changes the \nburden of going forward with the evidence or the burden of proof in the \ncase. A presumption is established, and then the other side has to \novercome it. That has no place in an ex parte hearing where the \nGovernment is seeking a warrant against a party who is not even aware \nthat the warrant is being sought. Obviously, you don't get a search \nwarrant by notifying him that you are about to do that.\n\n  What her amendment pertains to does not really have application to \nthe situation presented in an application for a FISA warrant and would \nseriously undermine the Government's ability to obtain it. You could \neither read it one of two ways. Either it would be totally \nmeaningless--and I know that that is not intended--or else it would be \nvery pernicious because it would create the suggestion in court that \nthe material presented to it is not, is no more than a presumption, \nthat it is not to be accepted on its face.\n  Specifically, the Government would be asserting that the person \nagainst whom the warrant is sought is a non-U.S. citizen, a foreign \nperson under the definition of the statute. If that information is \npresented in sufficient form for a court to issue the warrant, it makes \nno sense at all to have the information merely a presumption that the \nindividual is a foreign person. How does that advance the ball? How \ndoes it help the court? How does it protect anybody? The court is still \ngoing to have to answer the very same question: Do I believe the \ninformation the Government is presenting to me that this is a non-U.S. \ncitizen? Either he is or he isn't. It is not a matter of a presumption.\n  If the court is not convinced that the Government's information is \ncorrect,\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\nthen the court is not going to issue the warrant. It would be improper \nto do so. If the court is convinced that the person is a non-U.S. \ncitizen, then the court can issue the warrant if the other requirements \nare met. I don't believe Senator Feinstein attacks the other \nrequirements.\n  Either you are a foreign-born person, or a non-U.S. person, or you \nare not. The court has to make that decision. And creating a \npresumption about it is really irrelevant to this particular process. \nIf it is more than irrelevant, there is some kind of a problem. \nObviously, you don't want the court to have to somehow independently \nverify the information that is presented to it by the Justice \nDepartment. That is not a part of; that is not the way the court works. \nThe court does not do this sua sponte, or on its own. The court has the \ninformation before it, and it either has to accept the information or \nnot. It doesn't have to accept the Justice Department's word for it. \nThe Justice Department cannot simply make the assertion. It has to \noffer the proof. If the proof is not satisfactory, the warrant will not \nissue. Later, if it is found that the evidence was not satisfactory, \nthen there is always some question about whether the evidence obtained, \nof course, could be used, say, in a later prosecution.\n  The bottom line is that that amendment does not help. It could \nseriously hurt the application of the entire FISA statute. It is not \njust limited to the amendment we are offering today. I urge my \ncolleagues, when the time comes, to reject the Feinstein amendment, not \nbecause it is not well intended--I am confident that it is--but, \nrather, that its effects are ill understood at best and, at worst, \nwould be pernicious to the application of the statute.\n  I have said all I need to say at this point on the legislation. I \nwould note that time will run against the time allotted under the bill. \nSince both Senator Schumer and I control the time, anyone who wishes to \ncome to speak to the legislation either for or against, I ask unanimous \nconsent that if neither Senator Schumer nor I are here, they should be \npermitted to do so without specific acquiescence by Senator Schumer or \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Unless there is someone else who wishes to speak at this \ntime, I ask unanimous consent that the time consumed in the quorum call \nbe equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, shortly the distinguished Senator from Ohio \nis going to speak for 15 minutes as in morning business. I ask \nunanimous consent that the time, even though in morning business, be \ncharged against the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:25 p.m. \ntoday there be 20 minutes for debate equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee prior to the \ncloture vote at 1:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today--on the 58th Anniversary of the \nunconditional surrender of Germany and the end of World War II in \nEurope--a flag will be flown over this Capitol building here in \nWashington, DC, to honor the men who served in Company K, the most \ndecorated company in the 409th Regiment of the 103rd Infantry Division, \n6th Corps of the 7th Army. The members of the Company will display this \nflag at their reunion later this year in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and at \nall future reunions, in memory of the men from K Company who fell on \nthe field of battle, the men who did not return home.\n  Though it has been 58 years nearly 6 decades, since these men served \nand fought and lived and died together, the men of K Company, now in \ntheir late 70s and 80s, continue to remember and honor their brothers \nwho died in battle.\n  The members of K Company--the men who did return home--the men who \nwere able to lead their lives and have families and grow old and spend \ntime with their children and grandchildren and now even great-\ngrandchildren--these men have great reverence for those who died. As \nBill Gleason, who was a Private in Company K, so eloquently once wrote \nin the Southtown Economist in May 1988:\n\n       Some in our Company were denied the chance to reach old \n     age. They didn't make it to adulthood. They never were old \n     enough to vote in an election. They died then--there in \n     France or Germany. . . . They are frozen in time as they \n     were--forever youthful.\n\n  I would like to take a moment to read the names of those men of K \nCompany, the men who perished during battle, the men who remain, as Mr. \nGleason so fittingly wrote, forever youthful: Wilson F. Rogers from \nTacoma, WA.; James Rosenbarger from Corydon, IN; Rosco Fry from \nSpickard, MO; Stanley Berdinski from Muskegon, MI; Bruno Pashisky from \nChicago, IL; Sherman Sprague from Clinton, IA; Alex Hurtiz from El \nPaso, TX; Charles Frakes from Kokomo, IN; Abe Umansky from San Diego, \nCA; Edwin Byron from Akron, OH; and Albert Strang.\n  K Company was no ordinary company. It was recognized as the Most \nDecorated Company in the 409th Regiment. The soldiers of K Company \nfought valiantly in France, Germany, and Austria. They saw combat in \nthe Rhineland from September 15, 1944 to March 12, 1945 and in Central \nEurope from March 22, 1945 to May 11, 1945.\n  Two books have been written about the Company--one by Bill Gleason, \ncalled Task Force Kommando: Camp Howze, Texas to Jenbach Austria; and A \nCombat Infantryman in World War II, by Otis Cannon, who also served in \nthe Company. Both books provide an excellent perspective of an Infantry \ncompany in combat during World War II. They describe the reality of the \nWar that these brave, young Infantrymen on the frontlines faced. They \npaint us a picture of what life was really like for these men--how they \nstruggled and endured fierce fighting, rugged terrain, and miserable \nconditions until they helped secure the ultimate victory 58 years ago \ntoday.\n  I had the opportunity to read both of these books this past weekend. \nBoth of them provide insightful understanding of what life was like for \nthese men during that period of time.\n  The one book, ``Task Force Kommando,'' by Private Gleason, was \nwritten shortly after the end of World War II. Both books were written \nby the men who engaged in the combat. It goes almost in a day-by-day \nchronicle describing that combat. It gives us an understanding of what \nthe combat was like.\n  K Company's commander was Captain Joseph Bell, who hailed from \nTopeka, KS. By all accounts, Captain Bell was a man among men. He was \nfearless. He was a brilliant tactician. And, he was respected and \nadmired by those who served under him.\n  I was quite taken by a description of Captain Bell that I read from a \nrecent e-mail exchange between two former K Company soldiers. In this \ne-mail, one of the men recalled his first impressions of Captain Bell \nand how this man and how this Company have had a lasting impact on his \nlife. I think that this depiction captures a very colorful image of \nCaptain Bell and how he was looked up to and admired by his men. I'd \nlike to take a few moments to read from that e-mail. It begins as a \nyoung, World War II Army Private, who has recently arrived in Europe, \nawaits his company assignment:\n\n       We were told that the next morning, we would be assigned to \n     some infantry company. That night, we went into a bar and\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\n     were bought some beer by some GI's who knew we were (for want \n     of a better word) very uptight. All they talked about was \n     Captain Bell and his K Company. They told us that if we \n     wanted to do a lot of fighting that would be the company to \n     be assigned to. That was really not what [my buddy, Ernie \n     Dessecker] and I had in mind!\n       A little before dark, someone on the other side of the room \n     yelled that Captain Bell was walking down the street and \n     every single soldier in that bar got up and crammed the \n     windows to get a look at him. He had a couple of other \n     officers on both sides of him, but he was walking a step or \n     two ahead. It was a dirt muddy street, but he looked like he \n     was walking on a parade ground. After he went by, you could \n     hear Captain Bell stories all over the bar.\n       The next day, we were loaded on a truck and at each town, \n     it would stop and some names were called to get off. When \n     Dess and I were told to get off, the first thing we asked \n     was, ``What company is this?'' When told it was Company K, we \n     both wished we could climb back on that truck and head for \n     the rear echelon! Of course, in a very short time, we were so \n     very proud to be part of Captain Bell's Company K, and that \n     pride continues to this day.\n       I was assigned to John Miller's squad in the second platoon \n     with Sergeant Hart and Lieutenant Monk as platoon leaders. \n     They were very kind and excellent leaders. I learned a lot \n     from them that has stayed with me all these years.\n\n  Mr. President, leaders like Captain Bell and John Miller and Sergeant \nHart and Lieutenant Monk were tough soldiers, but they had to be, and \nall the men who served under them came to understand that.\n  As Bill Gleason wrote about Captain Bell:\n\n       We understood . . . that if we made it through the war, we \n     would owe our lives to him. And, we do. . . . [H]e kept us \n     alive simply because he insisted we stay alive.\n\n  Leaders, like Captain Bell, made all the difference.\n  As Memorial Day approaches, I ask my colleagues to think about \nCaptain Bell and the men of K Company. I ask my colleagues to think \nabout and remember all the men and women who served our Nation during \nWorld War II--and to think about and remember all the men and women who \nhave defended our Nation since that time. Memorial Day is a time to \nhonor and remember these individuals. They fought, and therefore all of \nus now know peace and freedom--our children and our grandchildren know \npeace and freedom. We owe them our respect and, we give them our \nthanks.\n  I am grateful for the men of Company K.\n  I am grateful that they fought so that I can be here today in a free \ncountry--that I can stand here today on the Floor of the United States \nSenate in the world's greatest Democracy.\n  And, I am grateful that we can continue to enjoy Life, Liberty, and \nthe Pursuit of Happiness because of their efforts nearly 60 years ago.\n  I thank them.\n  I thank all the men of K Company and especially one man who served in \nthe Company--the author of the e-mail I quoted just a moment ago--a \nPrivate named Richard DeWine. To him, I will simply say:\n  Thanks, Dad.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5907-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5907-S5913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n      CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT--Resumed\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF PRISCILLA RICHMAN OWEN, OF TEXAS, TO BE UNITED STATES \n              CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT--Resumed\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be a cloture vote on the Estrada \nnomination at 1:45.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished occupant of the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate, I believe--and I say this as one \nwho has been here with six different Presidential administrations of \nboth parties--that rather than work with the Senate and Senators from \nboth parties to identify consensus nominees who would get the \noverwhelming bipartisan support of the Senate for prompt confirmation, \nthe administration seems to insist only on partisanship and strong-arm \ntactics.\n  Rather than ideological court packing and political intimidation on \nwhich the other side is insistent, I continue to urge the \nadministration to work with us to take the appointment of Federal \njudges out of politics. If we do that, we can ensure the independence \nand fairness of the Federal judiciary.\n  Everybody, whether they are Republican or Democrat, has a stake in \nhaving an independent Federal judiciary. None of us want this country--\nwhich is rightly praised for having the most independent Federal \njudiciary in the world--none of us want to see it become a partisan \njudiciary.\n  Now, today we are going to be asked to vote on two cloture motions--\none on the Estrada nomination and one on the Owen nomination. I think \nthe last time the Senate was called upon to vote on two cloture motions \nfor nominations on the same day was when Republicans were filibustering \nthe nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon in the year 2000. \nThree years ago, numerous Republicans voted against cloture on those \nnominees, even though Judge Paez had been pending for more than 4 \nyears.\n  I worry that the Republicans spend all this time talking about how we \nare blocking judges. As a matter of fact, we are not. Out of 125 \njudicial nominees the Senate has considered, we have confirmed 123 of \nthem. We have held up two. Two out of 125 is not bad. In fact, \nPresident Clinton would have loved to have had that kind of a record \nwhen he was President, but the Republicans stopped more than 50 of his \njudges--not merely two as we are asking to be reconsidered. They \nblocked 50.\n  Under Republican control, there were not a whole lot of votes on the \nfloor. Basically, they had a routine that if one Republican Senator \nobjected, then the nominee never got a hearing and never got a vote. \nThe Republicans never faced having to debate the nominees on the floor. \nThe nominees were just never given a hearing in committee. They were \nnever given a vote on the floor.\n  We had several Senators, many serving now, who just refused to return \ntheir blue slips. In fact, we had a definite rule by the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee at the time that said that if you had a \nSenator, for example, from the home State who objected, that person \nwould not go forward.\n  We had this once where the Senator from North Carolina objected to a \ncircuit court judge, so, of course, we never had a hearing or a vote on \nthat nominee. The Senator from Texas objected to several courts of \nappeals nominees. Distinguished Hispanic nominees were never given a \nhearing and never given a vote, because, as the chairman said, if both \nSenators from the State objected, of course, you could not go forward.\n  I know the Republicans now intend to go forward with at least one \njudge where both Senators from that State object--apparently it makes a \ndifference who is President. When they blocked 50 or 60, some by a one-\nperson objection, that was considered following the constitutional \nresponsibility of advice and consent. When we ask to hold up two of the \nmost controversial, divisive nominees--2 out of 125 nominations--we are \nsuddenly obstructionists. But 50 or 60 on the other side is ``good \ngovernment.''\n  Now, a lot of us have worked hard to repair the damage done during \nthat time, from 1995 through the early part of 2001. But again, I find, \nunlike the other administrations I have served with here--President \nFord, President Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, \nPresident Clinton; all Presidents who would work with Senators of both \nparties to try to get a consensus on their nominees--this White House \nshows no interest in that.\n  There has been little acknowledgment of our efforts. The current \nadministration continues down the strident path of confrontation and \ncourt packing rather than working with Senators. Well, court packing \nand politicizing of\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\nthe Federal judiciary should never be allowed under any President.\n  One of my heroes is Franklin Roosevelt. When Franklin Roosevelt tried \nto pack the courts, tried to politicize the appellate courts, the \nSenate stopped him. And the Senate should always do that--no matter who \nthe President is.\n  I am not concerned that the President nominates conservative \nRepublicans--and I voted for hundreds of them over the years--but I am \nnot going to vote for somebody who seems to be nominated solely for the \npurpose of politicizing the Federal bench.\n  When I was chairman of the committee, we worked hard to hold hearings \nand confirm nominees, in order to lower the number of vacancies--which \nhad increased because of the refusal of Republicans to allow many \nnominations to go forward during the Clinton years. We had a very high \nnumber of vacancies. After I became chairman, we cut that number of \nvacancies virtually in half. Now the vacancy rate is down to about 5\\1/\n2\\ percent.\n  Now, people seem to talk about two judges not going forward, two \njudges for well-paid lifetime jobs. I wish, having gotten the judiciary \nvacancy rate down to 5\\1/2\\ percent, we would look at the fact that the \nNation's unemployment rate is 6 percent. The number of private-sector \njobs lost since the beginning of the Bush administration is 2.7 \nmillion. Almost 9 million Americans are now out of work. Unemployment \nhas risen by more than 45 percent.\n  The Democrats in the Senate have moved forward to confirm 123 of this \nPresident's judicial nominees. But the Republican-led Senate seems \nobsessed with trying to force through the most divisive of this \nPresident's controversial, ideologically chosen nominees.\n  During the Clinton administration, President Clinton's administration \nadded a million people--a million new jobs--every year. We are losing \nwell over a million jobs a year since this administration came in.\n  I would suggest that if they really want to find some way to fix the \nunemployment, don't talk about two people getting extremely high-paying \nlifetime jobs, talk about the 9 million or so out of work.\n  What bothers me in the Estrada matter, is that the administration and \nthe Republican leadership have shown no willingness to be reasonable to \naccommodate the Democratic Senators' request for additional information \nas shared with the Senate by past administrations. We have endured \nnumerous cloture votes as an indication of Republican intransigence in \nthis matter. It is nothing more.\n  What bothers me, again, is that there has been no effort--no effort \nmade, as there always has been in past administrations--to work through \nthese matters. It just does not happen.\n  I mention this more in sadness than anything else. But it is almost \nas though this administration plays by different rules than any other.\n  I suggest to the administration, they were not given a mandate to \npoliticize our Federal judiciary.\n  They were not given a mandate for court packing. They were not given \na mandate to take the independent Federal judiciary and turn it into a \nvery narrow branch of the narrowest part of the Republican Party. \nNobody is given such a mandate. Just as Franklin Roosevelt found when \nhe wanted to pack the courts from the liberal side and the Senate said \nno, by the same token, President Bush has to be told no now that he \nwants to pack the courts on the other side. We do not want a political \nbench. Anyone ought to be able to come into a court and say, it makes \nno difference whether I am Republican, Democrat, rich, poor, White, \nBlack, Independent, no matter what my background, I will be treated \nfairly by that judge.\n  This is the standard I have always held for the judiciary and for \neach judge--fairness. I voted for hundreds of Republicans. I voted for \nthem in every single State of the Nation. But I am not going to vote \nfor people who seem to be sent there simply to politicize and polarize \nthe Federal courts.\n  When I was chairman, I moved faster on nominations of President Bush \nthan the Republican Party ever did on nominations of President Clinton. \nI stopped the anonymous holds. Dozens upon dozens of President \nClinton's nominations were held up by a single Republican putting an \nanonymous hold. I did away with that when I was chairman. We brought \npeople up, we had hearings, and we voted. As I said before, it is, of \ncourse, a fact that we have confirmed 123 of the President's nominees.\n  We hear all of a sudden that this is so unprecedented. Yes, it is \nunprecedented. We have held up two. They held up 60. Maybe it is \nunprecedented that we did not do the same thing.\n  I believe filibusters should be rare. I said on the floor that I was \nopposed to them but that statement has now been taken out of context by \nsome on the other side of the aisle. If you read the whole quote, you \nwill see that I was referring to a filibuster by anonymous hold, \nsomething I did stop when I became chairman. But the administration \nholds the key to the Estrada nomination. If they want to make it go \nforward, we could.\n  Today the Republican leadership is insisting on two more cloture \nvotes on the Estrada and Owen nominations. These will be the sixth vote \non a cloture petition on the Estrada nomination and the second on the \nOwen nomination. The last time the Senate was called upon to vote on \ntwo clotures for nominations that I can recall is when Republicans were \nfilibustering the nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon in \n2000. Three years ago today, on March 8, 2000, numerous Republicans \nvoted against cloture on those nominees, respectively, even though \nJudge Paez' nomination had been pending for more than four years at \nthat point. Those Republican Senators included nine who are still \nserving today, including majority leader Bill Frist and Senators \nAllard, Brownback, Bunning, Craig, DeWine, Enzi, Inhofe, and Shelby, as \nwell as Senators Gramm, Helms, Hutchinson, Murkowski, and Smith, who \nled the filibuster of these two nominees. In fact, after Republicans \nfailed to keep cloture from being invoked, Senator Sessions moved to \nindefinitely postpone the Paez nominations, and 31 Republicans voted in \nfavor of that motion to stop a vote on Paez's nomination to the Ninth \nCircuit. Those Republican Senators included 22 who still serve in the \nSenate, including majority leader Frist as well as Senators Allard, \nBond, Brownback, Burns, Cochran, Craig, Crapo, DeWine, Fitzgerald, \nGrassley, Gregg, Inhofe, Kyl, Lott, McConnell, Nickles, Santorum, \nSessions, Shelby, Thomas, and Warner.\n  Since July 2001, a number of us have worked very hard to repair the \ndamage done during the years 1995 through the early part of 2001. We \nhave made significant progress. Unfortunately our efforts have received \nlittle acknowledgment and the current administration continues down the \nstrident path of confrontation and court packing rather than working \nwith Senators of both parties to identify and nominate consensus, \nmainstream nominees.\n  While the Nation's unemployment rate rose last month to 6 percent. \nThe vacancy rate on the Federal judiciary has been lowered to 5.45 \npercent. While the number of private sector jobs lost since the \nbeginning of the Bush administration is 2.7 million, almost 9 million \nAmericans are now out of work, and unemployment has risen by more than \n45 percent, Democrats in the Senate have moved forward to confirm 123 \nof this President's judicial nominees, reduced judicial vacancies to \nthe lowest level in two decades, by almost 60 percent. Yet the \nRepublican-led Senate remains obsessed with seeking to force through \nthe most divisive of this President's controversial, ideologically-\nchosen nominees.\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our Nation and, in \nthe case of Miguel Estrada, he has even managed to divide Hispanics \nacross the country. The nomination and confirmation process begins with \nthe President, and I urge him to work with us to find a way forward to \nunite, instead of divide, the nation on these issues.\n  Republican talking points will likely focus on the impasse on two of \nthe most extreme of the President's nominations rather than the 123 \nconfirmations and the lowest judicial vacancy rate in 13 years. They \nwill ignore their own recent filibusters against President Clinton's \nexecutive and judicial nominees in so doing.\n  What is unprecedented about the Estrada matter is that the \nadministration and Republican leadership have\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\nshown no willingness to be reasonable and accommodate Democratic \nSenators' request for information traditionally shared with the Senate \nby past administrations. That we have endured numerous cloture votes is \nan indictment of Republican intransigence on this matter, nothing more. \nWhat is unprecedented is that there has been no effort on the \nRepublican side to work this matter out, as these matters have always \nbeen worked out in the past. What is unprecedented is the Republican \ninsistence to schedule cloture vote after cloture vote without first \nresolving the underlying problem caused by the administration's \ninflexibility.\n  What is unprecedented about the Owen nomination is that it was made \nat all. Judge Owen had a fair hearing and was given fair and extensive \nconsideration before the Judiciary Committee last year. We proceeded is \nspite of the fact that the Republican majority had refused to proceed \nwith any of President Clinton's Fifth Circuit nominees during his last \nfour-year term. Never before in our history has a President renominated \nfor the same vacancy someone voted down by the Judiciary Committee, but \nthat is what this President proceeded to do with this divisive and \ncontroversial nominee.\n  Senator Hatch used to say, when President Clinton was nominating \nmoderates to more than 100 vacancies on our Federal courts, that there \nwas no vacancy crisis. He used to say that he considered 67 vacancies \nto be ``full employment'' on the Federal judiciary. Today we are well \nshort of 100 vacancies and well beyond what he used to term ``full \nemployment'' with 47 vacancies. The committee continues to report \nnominations to fill additional vacancies, as well.\n  From 1995 through the summer of 2001, the Republican majority \naveraged only 38 confirmations a year with only seven to the Courts of \nAppeals. That explains why Federal judicial vacancies rose from 63 to \n110 on the Republican watch and circuit vacancies more than doubled \nfrom 16 to 33. Of course, during those years there were no Republican-\nled hearings calling for prompt action or fair consideration of \nPresident Clinton's moderate judicial nominees. To the contrary, \nSenator Ashcroft held hearings designed to justify the slowdown. \nSenator Ashcroft and others perfected the practice of using anonymous \nholds both in committee and on the floor so that judicial nominees were \nstalled for months and years without consideration. Scores of nominees \nnever received hearings, at least 10 who received hearings never \nreceived committee consideration and those who were ultimately \nconsidered often were delayed months and years through holds and \nfilibusters.\n  Beginning in July 2001, Democrats started bringing accountability and \nopenness to the process. In the 17 months of the Democratic Senate \nmajority we held more hearings on more judicial nominees, more \ncommittee votes and more Senate votes than before. We were able \nvirtually to double the pace and productivity of the process. We did \naway with the secrecy of the ``blue slip'' and the anonymous hold. We \nconsidered President Bush's nominees fairly, responsibly and in those \n17 months confirmed 100 of this President's nominees. We reversed the \ndestructive trends with respect to the numbers of vacancies and length \nof time that nominees had to wait to be considered. While we could not \nconsider all nominations simultaneously, we considered more, more \nquickly than in the preceding years. The Democratic majority inherited \n110 judicial vacancies including a record 33 to the circuit courts. By \nDecember 2002, we were able, through hard work to outpace the 40 \nadditional vacancies that had arisen and reduce the remaining vacancies \nto 60, including 25 to the circuit courts. We have continued to \ncooperate and today the remaining vacancies number 47, including 20 on \nthe circuit courts. This is the lowest vacancy number and lowest \nvacancy rate in 13 years.\n  This is not to say that our work is done. Last week, with the help \nand hard work of the Senate leadership we were able to make additional \nprogress. Last Wednesday, majority leader Frist used the word \n``progress'' to describe how we have been able to resolve complications \ncaused by the manner in which nominations were forced through the \nJudiciary Committee early this year. Last Thursday, I thanked the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader and others for their efforts \nin this regard and for working with us to bring the nomination of Judge \nEdward Prado to a vote without further, unnecessary delay.\n  This Tuesday the Senate debated and voted on the nomination of \nDeborah Cook to the Sixth Circuit. She is the fourth nominee of \nPresident Bush to be confirmed to the Sixth Circuit in less than two \nyears. During the entire second term of President Clinton, the \nRepublican majority would not hold hearings or consider a single one of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to the Sixth Circuit--not Judge Helene \nWhite, not Kathleen McCree Lewis, not Professor Kent Markus. \nNonetheless, while I was chair of the Judiciary Committee we proceeded \nto consider and confirm two conservative nominees of President Bush to \nthe Sixth Circuit and this year the Senate has proceeded to confirm two \nmore.\n  The work of the Senate would be more productive if this \nadministration were more interested in filling vacancies with \nqualified, consensus nominees rather than packing the Federal courts \nwith activist judges. The nominations and confirmation process begins \nwith the President. Far from being someone who has sought consensus and \nunity on judicial nominees, this President has used judicial nominees \nas a partisan weapon and sought sharply to tilt the courts \nideologically. That is unfortunate. Some of us have urged another \ncourse, a course of cooperation and conciliation, but that is not the \npath this administration has chosen. Yet, in spite of the historically \nlow level of cooperation from the White House, the Senate has already \nconfirmed 123 of President Bush's judicial nominees, including some of \nthe most divisive and controversial sent by any President.\n  Last week the Senate proceeded to a vote on the nomination of Jeffrey \nSutton to the Sixth Circuit. He received the fewest number of favorable \nvotes of any nominee in almost 20 years with 52. He is the third \ncontroversial judicial nominee of this President against whom more than \n40 negative votes were cast, yet those three nominees were not stalled \nand not subjected to a filibuster.\n  In just the last 2 years, 123 of the President's judicial nominees \nhave been confirmed. One hundred of those confirmations came during the \n17 months of Democratic leadership of the Senate. No fair-minded \nobserver could term that obstructionism. By contrast, during the 6\\1/2\\ \nyears during which Republicans controlled the Senate and President \nClinton's nominations were being considered, they averaged only 38 \nconfirmations a year. During the last 2 years of the Clinton \nadministration, the Senate confirmed only 73 Federal judges. Combining \nthe 1996 and 1997 sessions, Republicans in the Senate allowed only 53 \njudges to be confirmed in 2 years, including only 7 new judges to the \ncircuit courts. One entire congressional session, the Republican-led \nSenate confirmed only 17 judges all year and none at all to the circuit \ncourts. The Senate confirmed 72 judges nominated by President Bush last \nyear alone under Democratic leadership.\n  By Republican standards, the 123 judges confirmed so far is more than \nthey averaged for President Clinton over 3 years. If the Senate shut \ndown today and did not consider another judicial nominee we would have \nalready exceeded the total needed to best Republican efforts over an \nentire 3-year period. At the present rate, President Bush would not \njust exceed the number of judges appointed by prior presidents, he \nwould shatter all appointment records.\n  This year, in spite of the lack of cooperation by the administration \nand the overbearing exercise of power by the majority, we have \ncooperated with committee action on 26 judicial nominees during the \nfirst 3 months of this year. We have proceeded in the Senate to vote on \nthe confirmations of 23 judicial nominees this year, including four \nextremely controversial nominees to the circuit courts, which makes 123 \nof this President's judges confirmed overall. That compares most \nfavorably to how Republicans treated President Clinton's nominees. In \nthe 1996 session, for example, the Senate did not confirm a single \ncircuit judge all year and confirmed only 17 judges that entire year. \nIn 1999, the third year of that\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\nPresidential term, and in 1997, the Senate did not reach the level we \nhave already attained until October. We are well ahead of the pace in \nevery year in which Republicans were obstructing consideration of \nPresident Clinton's nominees.\n\n  A good way to see how much faster this chairman is processing \nnominations for a Republican President is to compare this year's pace \nto a comparable year in the last Democratic administration. In 1997, \nwhen Bill Clinton was President, the Republican-controlled Judiciary \nCommittee was just holding its second judicial nominations hearing of \nthe year--compared to the ninth hearing that we held this week and was \nconsidering its first two circuit court nominees of the year--rather \nthan its tenth. This chairman has moved five times more quickly for \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees than for President Clinton's, \nand vacancies in the courts are nearly half of what they were in 1997. \nEven more noteworthy, by this point in 1999, the third year of the last \npresidential term, the committee had not held or scheduled a single \njudicial nominations hearing. In fact, no hearing for a judicial \nnominee was held until June of that year.\n  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the \nsummer of 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 \nmonths, despite constant criticism from the administration, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including \nseveral who were divisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer \nreview ratings from the ABA and at least one who had been rated not \nqualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced \njudicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' \non the Federal judiciary by Senator Hatch.\n  During the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee, I worked hard \nto ensure that women and minorities were considered for the federal \nbench, and I am proud of that record. Many Hispanics and women \nnominated by President Clinton were blocked or delayed by the \nRepublican majority, and I did not want to see that repeated.\n  Fine nominees such as Christine Arguello, Jorge Rangel, Enrique \nMoreno and Ricardo Morado and dozens of other Clinton nominees were \nnever allowed hearings by Republicans, and others, such as Bonnie \nCampbell and Anabelle Rodriguez, received hearings but no votes in \nCommittee. Others, including Judge Richard Paez, Judge Hilda Tagle, \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor, and Judge Rosemary Barkett, and dozens of other \nClinton nominees were stalled for no good reason. Many of Clinton's \nnominees were not confirmed the first Congress they were nominated, \nincluding Judge Paez, who waited 1,520 days to be confirmed, as well as \nJudge Tagle, who waited 943 days to be confirmed. Cloture was also \nsought to bring the nominations of Judge Paez and Judge Barkett and \nothers to vote, although scores of others were never allowed hearings \ndue to secret Republican holds.\n  I am proud that did not happen on my watch. I am glad to say that we \nquickly considered and confirmed nominees such as Christina Armijo to \nthe District Court in New Mexico, Philip Martinez and Randy Crane to \nthe District Courts in Texas, Jose Martinez to the District Court in \nFlorida, Alia Ludlum to the District Court in Texas, and Jose Linares \nto the District Court in New Jersey. In addition, this year we have \npressed for expedited consideration of Judge Prado of Texas to the \nFifth Circuit, as well as Judge Otero of California and Judge Altonaga \nof Florida to the Federal district courts. This week the Committee \nincluded Judge Consuelo Callahan of California in a hearing and I \nexpect her nomination to the Ninth Circuit to be confirmed promptly \nwith strong Democratic support, as well.\n  The Senate has this week reduced the number of Federal judicial \nvacancies to the lowest level it has been in 13 years. The 110 \nvacancies I inherited in the summer of 2001, vacancies that rose by 65 \npercent under Senate Republican control, have been more than cut in \nhalf. In the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee we not only \nkept up with extraordinary attrition in the form of an additional 40 \nvacancies, but reduced all those vacancies from the 160 there would \nhave been had we done nothing, down to 60 by last December. Senator \nHatch used to argue when President Clinton was in office that 67 \nvacancies on the Federal courts amounted to ``full employment''. We \nreached Senator Hatch's standard for a full Federal bench during the 17 \nmonths in which the Democrats led the Senate.\n  We have continued our efforts this year and this week we reached the \nlowest level of judicial vacancies in 13 years--the lowest level since \njudgeships were significantly expanded in 1990. We now are working to \nreduce the remaining 47 vacancies even further.\n  Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the fixation of the \nRepublican majority on the President's most controversial nominations, \nwe have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even further. As of \ntoday, the number of judicial vacancies is at 47. That is the lowest it \nhas been in two decades. That is lower than it ever was allowed to go \nat any time during the entire eight years of the Clinton \nadministration. We have reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to \n5.45 percent, the lowest it has been since 1990. With some cooperation \nfrom the administration think of the additional progress we could be \nmaking.\n  Our Senate leadership, both Republican and Democratic, have worked to \ncorrect some of the problems that arose from some of the earlier \nhearings and actions of the Judiciary Committee this year. Last week we \nwere able to hold a hearing on the nomination of John Roberts to the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. We are all working hard to complete \nCommittee consideration of that nomination at the earliest opportunity. \nThus, a number of additional, controversial nominations are in the \nprocess of being considered and will be considered by the Senate in due \ncourse.\n  My point is to underscore that we have made and are making real \nprogress from the thoroughgoing obstruction from 1996 until 2001. While \n``the glass is not full,'' it is more full than empty and more has been \nachieved than some want to acknowledge. One hundred and twenty-three \nlifetime confirmations in less than two years is better than any 2-year \nperiod from 1995 through 2000. We have reduced judicial vacancies to \n47, which is the lowest number and lowest vacancy percentage in 13 \nyears. During the entire 8-year term of President Clinton it was never \nallowed by Republicans to get that low. We have made tremendous \nprogress. These achievements have not been easy.\n\n  The administration has chosen confrontation with the Congress, with \nthe Senate and with this committee. We are now proceeding at three to \nfour times the pace Republicans maintained in reviewing President \nClinton's judicial nominees. We have reached the point where the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate are often moving too fast on some \nnominations and we risk becoming a racing conveyor belt that rubber \nstamps rather than examines these lifetime appointments. Democrats have \nworked hard to repair the damage to the confirmation process and \nachieved significant results. Republicans seem merely results oriented \nand interested in ideological domination of the Federal courts.\n  As Republicans turn their sights on the propriety of the filibuster \nin connection with judicial nominations and speculate about changing \nthe rules and suing the Senate, I trust the Republican majority will \nnot overlook the precedent on this question. Republicans not only \njoined in the filibuster of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court, they organized the filibuster of Stephen \nBreyer to the 1st Circuit, Judge Rosemary Barkett to the 11th Circuit, \nJudge H. Lee Sarokin to the 3rd Circuit, and Judge Richard Paez and \nJudge Marsha Berzon to the 9th Circuit. The truth is that filibusters \non nominations and legislative matters and extended debate on judicial \nnominations, including circuit court nominations, have become more and \nmore common on the initiative of Republicans working against Democratic \nnominees. Now that a Republican President, intent on packing the courts \nwith ideologues, has seen two nominees delayed by filibusters, and even \nthough the other 123 judges he nominated have been confirmed, partisans \nwant to change the rules to make it easier for this President to get \nhis way.\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\n  Of course, when they are in the majority Republicans have more \nsuccessfully defeated nominees of a Democratic President by refusing to \nproceed on them and have not publicly explained their actions, \npreferring to act in secret under the cloak of anonymity. From 1995 \nthrough 2001, when Republicans previously controlled the Senate \nmajority, Republican efforts to defeat President Clinton's judicial \nnominees most often took place through inaction and anonymous holds for \nwhich no Republican Senator could be held accountable. Republicans held \nup almost 80 judicial nominees who were not acted upon during the \nCongress in which President Clinton first nominated them and eventually \ndefeated more than 50 judicial nominees without a recorded Senate vote \nof any kind, just by refusing to proceed with hearings and Committee \nvotes. These are just the sorts of stealth tactics Democrats have \nrejected.\n  Beyond judicial nominees, Republicans also filibustered the \nnomination of executive branch nominees. They successfully filibustered \nthe nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the \nUnited States in spite of two cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David \nSatcher's subsequent nomination to be Surgeon General also required \ncloture but he was successfully confirmed.\n  Other executive branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans \nincluded Walter Dellinger's nomination to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral. Two cloture petitions were required to be filed on that \nnomination and both were rejected by Republicans. We were able finally \nto obtain a confirmation vote for Professor Walter Dellinger after \nsignificant efforts and he was confirmed to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral with 34 votes against him. He was never confirmed to his \nposition as Solicitor General because Republicans had made clear their \nopposition to him. In addition, in 1993, Republicans objected to a \nnumber of State Department nominations and even the nomination of Janet \nNapolitano to serve as the U.S. Attorney for Arizona, resulting in more \ncloture petitions. In 1994, Republicans successfully filibustered the \nnomination of Sam Brown to be an Ambassador. After three cloture \npetitions were filed, his nomination was returned to President Clinton \nwithout Senate action. Also in 1994, two cloture petitions were \nrequired to get a vote on the nomination of Derek Shearer to be an \nAmbassador. And it likewise took two cloture petitions to get a vote on \nthe nomination of Ricki Tigert to chair the FDIC. So when Republican \nSenators now talk about the Senate Executive Calendar and presidential \nnominees, they must be reminded that they recently filibustered many, \nmany qualified nominees.\n  Filibusters should be and are rare. That there are two this year is a \ndirect result of the strategy of confrontation sought by the White \nHouse and Senate Republicans. The administration holds the key to \nending the Estrada impasse, as it has for the last year. It should \ncooperate with the Senate and provide access to his work papers, \nfollowing the example set by all previous Republican and Democratic \nadministrations.\n  The renomination of Judge Owen was most ill-advised and \nunprecedented. Her nomination had already been rejected after fair \nhearings and thorough debate and a committee vote last year. Some \napparently want to rewrite the rules so that this President can have \nevery nominee confirmed, no matter how divisive and controversial, by \nthe Republican Senate majority.\n  Recently, I heard a respected Republican and senior advisor to the \nmajority leader describe cloture as ``the fulcrum on which you balance \nthe rights of the individual and the rights of the institution.'' He \nexplained how important the rights of the minority party are in the \nSenate and how Senate rules are deliberately constructed to reflect \nthat and protect the minority. That Republicans are now intent on \nrewriting longstanding Senate rules shows just how partisan and ends-\noriented they have become.\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our nation. He has \neven managed to divide Hispanics across the country with the nomination \nof Mr. Estrada. He has managed to outrage disabled individuals by his \nnomination of Jeffrey Sutton. The nomination and confirmation process \nbegins with the President. I, again, urge him to work with us to \nidentify and nominate qualified, consensus, mainstream nominees who all \nAmericans can be confident will be fair and impartial and to abandon \nhis ideological court packing scheme.\n  Just yesterday an editorial appeared in the Rutland Herald noting: \n``[P]acking the court with right-wing ideologues is a program that \nDemocrats may legitimately question. The Senate is required to consent \nto the president's judicial nominees because of the checks and balances \ncreated by the Constitution to restrain presidential power. The right \nwing now chafes under that restraint, but [Senators] have every reason \nto stand firm in order to bring balance to the judiciary.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that the full editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Rutland Herald, May 7, 2003]\n\n       A Senate Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing Tuesday to \n     highlight what Republicans claim is an abuse of the Senate \n     rules by Democrats seeking to hold up President Bush's \n     judicial nominees.\n       The subcommittee hearing was described by one Democratic \n     aide as a ``dog and pony show.'' It is part of the \n     ideological warfare unleashed by the right wing to intimidate \n     and destroy its opposition. The Republicans' complaint abouut \n     Democratic obstructionism with regard to judicial nominees \n     makes a villain out of Sen. Patrick Leahy, but their case is \n     bogus and based on a foundation of hypocrisy.\n       The Democrats have kindled Republican wrath because the \n     Democrats have had the temerity to block two nominees. Two. \n     In the meantime, the Senate has confirmed 123 Bush nominees. \n     The vacancy rate in the judiciary is at a 13-year low. When \n     the Democrats took control of the Senate in 2001, the \n     Republicans had left open 111 judicial vacancies. Now there \n     are 43.\n       Members of the judiciary have remarked on how the Bush \n     administration has staffed the Justice Department with \n     fiercely uncompromising ideologues intent, not just on \n     dealing with the opposition, but on destroying it. How else \n     can one account for the war declared by Republicans over two \n     judicial nominees who failed to pass muster?\n       The subcommittee hearing is ostensibly meant to examine the \n     question of whether the Democrats' use of the filibuster to \n     block judicial nominees is constitutional. The filibuster is \n     a delaying tactic in which one side refuses to end debate on \n     a particular question. According to Senate rules, the Senate \n     can end a filibuster with 60 out of 100 votes. Certainly, the \n     filibuster is anti-majoritarian, but over the years it has \n     been used effectively by both Republicans and Democrats.\n       Now that the Democrats have shown they are adept at using \n     the filibuster, the Republicans have begun to froth that it \n     is unconstitutional. They are even claiming there is some \n     kind of exception to the filibuster rule for judicial \n     nominees, though it is a claim without any basis in law that \n     the Republicans would quickly abandon as soon as they found \n     themselves in the minority.\n       It is hard to defend the filibuster as a democratic method. \n     But for the Republicans suddenly to wax indignant about the \n     filibuster now that it has been turned against them is \n     hyppcrisy enough to shock and awe. From 1995 to 2000 \n     Republicans blocked one-third of President Clinton's judicial \n     nominees by a variety of methods that were as anti-\n     majoritarian as the filibuster, including the failure of the \n     Judiciary Committee even to schedule hearings and including \n     the secret hold, by which a senator can block a nominee \n     merely on his or her say-so.\n       If anger and self-righteousness signify the rightness of \n     one's cause, the Republicans are making a good show of it. \n     But packing the court with right-wing ideologues is a program \n     that Democrats may legitimately question. The Senate is \n     required to consent to the president's judicial nominees \n     because of the checks and balances created by the \n     Constitution to restrain presidential power. The right wing \n     now chafes under that restraint, but Leahy and his allies \n     have every reason to stand firm in order to bring balance to \n     the judiciary.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The vote is scheduled for what time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the vote is 1:45.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have we reached that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have about a minute and a half.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I can understand the confusion. We seem to have a number \nof clocks facing different places.\n  I tell the distinguished occupant of the chair that I have been \naround here long enough to recall a time when we were going to end at a \ncertain time in a very late session, and the time stood still. We were \nvery close to finishing. I think the time we had to finish was at \nmidnight. I remember the clock getting all the way up there to 3 \nminutes\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nto midnight. For the next hour, the clock was there at 3 minutes to \nmidnight. Suddenly we worked out the last thing, the clock magically \nsprung forward--not totally magically, somebody pulled it forward. We \nwere at midnight and, with a sigh of relief, we went out. Now I believe \nwe are at the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, tomorrow is the 9th of May, which marks the \nbeginning of the third year that the nominations of Miguel Estrada to \nthe DC Circuit and Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit have been \nsitting in the Senate. This truly is not a good record for the Senate.\n  On May 9, 2001, the President sent to the Senate 11 nominations, \nincluding those of Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen. I regret that a \nminority of Senators in this body continue to deny a final vote on the \nconfirmation of these nominees. It is troubling that we have not yet \nbeen able to confirm these nominees who now are facing unprecedented \nfilibusters in the Senate.\n  Let me again quote a recent editorial, published in the Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution, which discusses the filibusters of Priscilla Owen \nand Miguel Estrada, noting ``the first time simultaneous filibusters \nagainst judicial nominees have occurred in the U.S. Senate.'' The \neditorial continues:\n\n       Both Owen and Estrada are superbly qualified in every \n     respect. Yet on Owen, those who complain that a ``glass \n     ceiling'' exists for women of achievement are busily \n     constructing one to keep her in her place. And those who \n     complain that the federal bench lacks ``diversity'' find \n     Estrada to be too much diversity for their taste. He is \n     considered to be a conservative, and the interest groups that \n     drive the Democratic Party nationally fear Owen is, too, at \n     least on their abortion litmus test.\n       The fear with Owen and Estrada is that one or both will be \n     nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court should a vacancy occur. \n     Senate Democrats are determined to keep off the Circuit Court \n     bench any perceived conservative who has the credentials to \n     serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  As the editorial points out, some Senate Democrats appear willing to \nuse whatever obstructionist tactics it takes, based on any convenient \nrationale, to defeat the President's nominees. While the rationales may \nbe different, the motivation in both cases is the same--it is to block \nthis Senate from expressing the will of the majority with regard to \nthese nominations.\n  I have already pointed out the double standard being applied against \nMiguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen. However, it may be more than a so-\ncalled double standard. I am beginning to conclude that no standards \nare being applied, only political tactics. This game plan of delay and \nobstructionism that some Democratic Senators are following is no longer \nsurprising, but it is getting somewhat contradictory. In the case of \nMr. Estrada, Democrats say they can't vote for the nominee because they \ndon't know enough about him. They allege he didn't answer their \nquestions and therefore they must have Department of Justice \nconfidential memoranda he wrote while he was a line attorney in the \nSolicitor General's office.\n  There are no such claims about Justice Owen. Democrat opponents admit \nthey know enough about her, that she did answer the questions, and that \nshe has a record they can review. There are no phony excuses. They \nsimply oppose her on philosophical grounds namely, her interpretation \nof the Texas parental notification statute that applies to minor girls \nseeking an abortion.\n  We hear over and over that Justice Owen is a controversial or \nextremist nominee. Those seem to be the standard shorthand descriptions \nof a nominee who doesn't toe the line drawn by the abortion-rights and \ntrial lawyer interest groups.\n  In truth, Justice Owen is a consensus nominee. A bipartisan majority \nof the Senate supports her confirmation. The American Bar Association \nhas awarded her a unanimous well qualified rating, their highest \nrating, and the gold standard formerly used by many of my Democratic \ncolleagues. She is a well educated, highly experienced, and respected \njurist.\n  Now, some critics of Justice Owen have fixated on a few rulings made \nby Justice Owen in some parental notification cases and allege that she \nis out of the mainstream on her court or that she is a regular \ndissenter in such cases. The facts show Justice Owen has been well \nwithin the mainstream of her court in the 14 decided notification cases \nin Texas, joining the majority judgment in 11 of those cases. The fact \nof the matter is that the liberal interest groups will find any excuse \nto employ an abortion litmus test, and they have used it with reckless \nabandon against Justice Owen, but that doesn't change the facts. In \nfact, we don't even know Justice Owen's views on abortion and it is \nimproper to make assumptions.\n  Justice Owen has done what a nominee must do--commit to following the \nlaw, including Roe v. Wade. And that is all we ask of nominees.\n  Turning to Mr. Estrada, the real rationale for opposing him has \nnothing to do with access to confidential Justice Department documents. \nIt has nothing to do with allegations that Mr. Estrada did not answer \nthe questions. But it has everything to do with attempts to prevent a \nRepublican President from appointing the first Hispanic to the DC \nCircuit.\n  What the filibusters of Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen have in \ncommon is that they are preventing well qualified nominees from getting \nan up or down vote before the full Senate. They are tyranny of the \nminority at its worst. It is unfortunate that we must have these \ncloture votes at the end of this 2-year period since the nomination of \nMr. Estrada and Justice Owen. There is simply no good reason to \ncontinue them. It is long past time for an up or down. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a substitute amendment \nto S. 113, the Kyl-Schumer FISA bill. I ask you to bear with me because \nthe explanation goes on for a while.\n  I am also pleased that Senator Rockefeller, the ranking member on the \nIntelligence Committee, and Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, are cosponsors of this amendment. I am pleased to \nalso acknowledge that Senators Dodd, Edwards, Feingold, Boxer, and \nWyden are also cosponsors of the amendment.\n  Let me try to briefly describe the difference between current law, S. \n113, and my amendment.\n  S. 113 is the Kyl-Schumer FISA amendment. First, the Kyl-Schumer \namendment only applies to non-U.S. persons. I want to make clear that \nit does not cover green card holders under that amendment.\n  Under current law, the FISA court may only grant a FISA application \nagainst a non-U.S. person if the Government can show probable cause \nthat the target is working on behalf of a foreign power or a terrorist \ngroup. The Government also has to certify that it is seeking foreign \nintelligence information that can't be obtained by any other means.\n  As I understand the Kyl-Schumer bill, it drops a primary requirement \nfor FISA warrants; that is, the individual or the target be agents of a \nforeign power. Under Kyl-Schumer, this prerequisite is gone. That is \nwhat the so-called lone wolf deals with.\n  This would then give the FISA court no discretion to deny \napplications for FISA orders against a true so-called lone wolf. These \nare alleged international terrorists operating completely on their own. \nThis is confusing. In other words, current law gives the FISA court no \ndiscretion to grant FISA orders in closed cases. But S. 113--Kyl-\nSchumer--gives judges no discretion to deny FISA the FISA court \napplication in closed cases. Both of these circumstances raise certain \nproblems.\n  My amendment is essentially a compromise. It grants the court a \npresumption. So the FISA court may presume that a target is an agent of \na foreign power, or the court may choose not to invoke that \npresumption. The bottom line is the court is given some discretion.\n  In other words, the court may choose to grant a FISA order despite a \nlack of evidence that a target is working on behalf of a foreign power. \nSimilarly, the court may choose to deny an order against a true lone \nwolf. It is up to the court.Federal judges in title III criminal cases \nhave similar discretion. Although the standard there is about whether \nthe Government can show probable cause that a person has committed a \ncrime or will commit a crime, that is a very different standard than \nunder FISA. Federal judges have not abused that discretion and, in \nfact, in rare cases have been able to act as a check on the Government \nto prevent overreaching and abuse.\n  Why do the sponsors of S. 113 show less trust for FISA judges in the \nFISA content? In fact, such trust is even more warranted in the FISA \ncontent. Not only is the FISA process secret and hard to keep \naccountable, but the FISA court has only denied one FISA application in \nits 25-year history.\n  Such a lack of trust is even less necessary given the fact that even \nif the Government is unable to get a FISA order against a target, it \nremains completely free to use all the tools of the criminal process \nunder title III to get search and wiretap orders against the target.\n  The bottom line is, our amendment preserves FISA's agent-of-a-\nforeign-power requirement without jeopardizing our security. Our \namendment allows the Government to get FISA orders against suspected \ninternational terrorists even in close cases where the Government \ncannot show the target is working on behalf of a foreign power or \nterrorist group. However, unlike S. 113, the amendment also ensures the \nFISA court is more than a rubberstamp and has discretion to deny a FISA \napplication if the Government overreaches by attempting to use FISA \nauthority.\n  I now would like to discuss the issue in somewhat greater detail.\n  Mr. President, at times of crisis, it is possible the Government can \noverreach in both legislative and executive decisionmaking with respect \nto our criminal and intelligence laws. That can have unfortunate \nconsequences for both our security and individual rights.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, was passed in \n1978. It was the first statute ever passed in\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\nthe United States to provide a statutory procedure for the \nauthorization of clandestine activities of our Government to obtain \nforeign intelligence.\n  Before it passed, then-Attorney General Griffin Bell testified in \nfavor of the bill before Congress. He noted the ``delicate balance'' \nthat needed to be struck between ``adequate intelligence to guarantee \nour Nation's security on the one hand and preservation of basic human \nrights on the other.''\n  He stated:\n\n       In my view this bill strikes the balance, sacrifices \n     neither our security nor our civil liberties, and assures \n     that the abuses of the past will remain in the past. . . .\n\n  Now, what does he mean by ``abuses of the past''? Decades earlier, \nAmerica saw what happened in World War II with Japanese Americans who \nwere removed from their homes, their businesses, and their schools, and \nplaced in interment camps in violation of their rights. We do not want \nthat to happen ever again in this country.\n  I am not saying this is an identically similar situation. I am \nconcerned, however, about zealousness and overreach because now we are \nengaged in a global war on terror. In conducting this war, we must be \ncareful that we not overreach when the temptations are so great.\n  This kind of war is unprecedented for the United States. It is \nunprecedented and unbelievable that anybody could fly four big planes, \nthree into buildings, and kill 3,000 people. This is beyond our ken. \nAmerica and Americans want to protect our homeland and our individuals, \nnotwithstanding this is an entirely secret process and, as such, the \nlaws that govern it must be balanced, must be carefully crafted, and \nmust prevent it, lest someone use them to overreach. It has happened in \nthe past, so you can assume it could well happen in the future. This is \nespecially true, as I said, with FISA.\n  I supported reporting S. 113, the Kyl-Schumer FISA bill we are \ndebating, in the Judiciary Committee. I agree with my colleagues--there \nis a clear problem here, needing a solution; namely, the potential \ndifficulty the Government may have in obtaining FISA orders against \ncertain international terrorist so-called ``lone wolves.'' These are \npeople who have no affiliation with a terrorist group, no affiliation \nas an agent of a foreign power.\n\n  Under FISA, a ``foreign power'' is simply defined as ``two people \nconspiring,'' so it is a very easy goal and target. A problem arises in \ncases where the Government knows of a foreign individual who may be \ninvolved in terrorism but cannot yet prove a connection to foreign \ngroups or governments. This problem stems from the proof requirement \nunder FISA in current law.\n  To get a FISA order against a foreign visitor to the United States \nunder current law, the Government needs to show two key things:\n  First, that the individual is a foreign power or an agent of a \nforeign power. Again, that is defined as two people working together. A \nforeign power could be a foreign government or an international \nterrorist group as defined.\n  And second, that it is seeking ``foreign intelligence information'' \nthat cannot be obtained by other means.\n  This symbolizes the very purpose of FISA: to gather foreign \nintelligence. Criminal courts are for criminal cases, and the FISA \ncourt was set up specially to deal with cases where the Government \nwishes to obtain information or intelligence about the activities of \nforeign powers.\n  The problem is this: Under this current standard, it may well be \ndifficult for the Government to meet the foreign power requirement if \nthe Government does not yet have enough evidence of a connection to a \nforeign group, entity, or power. Some have described this problem as \nthe ``false lone wolf'' problem, where you have an individual who may \nappear at first to be operating as a ``lone wolf,'' even though that \nindividual is really an agent of a larger group.\n  That was one of the alleged problems with the pre-September 11 \ninvestigation into Zacarias Moussaoui. The FBI did not learn until \nafter September 11 that Moussaoui had links to al-Qaida and may have \nbeen the intended 20th hijacker.\n  As a result, the Government may have been reluctant to request a FISA \nwarrant because they did not think the intelligence they had could \nconnect Moussaoui to an international group or government.\n  So there is no question in my mind that we need to amend FISA to fix \nthis problem. And I applaud my colleagues, Senators Kyl and Schumer, \nfor working so diligently to solve it. But the Kyl-Schumer bill also \nredefines ``agent of a foreign power'' to include any non-U.S. \nindividual preparing to engage in international terrorism. In other \nwords, it essentially eliminates the foreign power requirement \naltogether.\n  This change would allow the Government to get a FISA search or \nwiretap order against any foreign individual in the United States who \nis preparing to engage in international terrorism, regardless of \nwhether the person is really an agent of a foreign government or terror \ngroup, and regardless of whether there is any potential to gather \nforeign intelligence.\n  Again, it is this foreign intelligence component that defines the \nvery purpose of FISA. As a result, I believe this change goes too far.\n  Under S. 113, for the first time ever, the Government will be able to \nuse FISA against any non-U.S. citizen preparing to engage in \ninternational terrorism--even individuals whom the Government knows \nhave no connection at all to anyone else engaged in international \nterrorism.\n  There would be no check at all on the Government's use of FISA \nagainst many common criminals who just happen to be noncitizens and, \ntherefore, the Government might be able to use this secret FISA court \nto obtain warrants that: (A) are easier to get; (B) last longer; and \n(C) are less subject to normal judicial scrutiny than criminal warrants \nunder title III or regular criminal statutes.\n  FISA wiretap orders, for instance, are good for 4 times longer than \nnormal criminal warrants--120 days versus 30 days--giving the \nGovernment a clear incentive to use this process even against common \ncriminals. These orders can be reauthorized indefinitely each year for \n1-year periods. The same is true for physical search orders under FISA, \nalthough these are good for 90 days, and 1-year extensions are subject \nto the requirement in current law that the judge find ``probable cause \nto believe that no property of any United States person will be \nacquired during the period.''\n\n  Under FISA, as modified by S. 113, the Government must show by \nprobable cause only that a foreign national is engaged in international \nterrorism or preparation thereof. You might listen to that and you \nmight think: What is wrong with that? We all want that. I want it, too. \nBut in many instances, this probable cause standard will be easier to \nmeet than the traditional criminal probable cause standard.\n  For example, for a title III wiretap, the Government must show that \nthere is probable cause to believe an individual is about to commit or \nhas committed an enumerated crime. To get a search order, the \nGovernment must show probable cause that the search will result in the \ndiscovery of offending items connected with the criminal activity. \nHowever, under S. 113, the Government need only show probable cause \nthat the person is engaging in ``activities in preparation'' for \ninternational terrorism. Many ``activities in preparation'' for \ninternational terrorism are not crimes.\n  For example, a foreign visitor who bought a one-way airline ticket \nand a box cutter would arguably qualify as a person engaging in \nactivities in preparation for international terrorism, even in the \nabsence of other evidence that he or she might be an international \nterrorist.\n  However, these two activities, taken alone, would clearly not \ndemonstrate probable cause that the person would commit a crime. These \nactivities may be entirely innocent. As a result--and I don't believe \nthis is anyone's intent--S. 113 could easily serve as a clarion call to \nall aggressive prosecutors who want to listen in on or search the homes \nof targets of investigation without ever having to prove that any crime \nmay be committed or that foreign intelligence may be gathered.\n  By allowing FISA to be used against all solo suspected international \nterrorists, S. 113 runs counter to the whole purpose of FISA, which is \nto allow the Government to get foreign intelligence by searching and \nwiretapping people\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\nworking for other countries and groups against U.S. interests.\n  S. 113 essentially eliminates any discretion the FISA court has to \nturn down a case--this is my big problem with it--thus enabling the \nGovernment to overreach. I am not saying that it will overreach. But \nbecause it is a secret process, the laws we pass have to prevent that \noverreach.\n  By nullifying the requirement that the target of an investigation has \nsome connection, any connection, to a foreign entity or government, \nthis legislation essentially makes the FISA court a rubberstamp. The \ncourt will be required to grant a FISA order, even if there is no \nprobable cause to indicate a connection to a foreign power; indeed, \neven if there is clear evidence that the individual is operating \ncompletely on their own. In fact, even if the Government admits that \nthe terrorist is operating alone and that there is no foreign \nintelligence to be gathered, the FISA court must still grant the order \nunder S. 113.\n  That is not what FISA is meant to be. Put simply: The \nlegislation goes too far.\n\n  Let me be clear: We who are sponsoring this amendment are not trying \nto protect international terrorists, and our amendment does nothing to \nprotect them. The vast resources of the Federal Government and the \npowerful tools of the criminal process remain available to target and \ninvestigate any terrorist against whom the Government is unable to get \na FISA order.\n  What our amendment will do is retain the original purpose of FISA--\nthe seeking of foreign intelligence. S. 113 would not.\n  Our amendment is simple. Rather than simply eliminating the foreign \npower requirement altogether, our amendment would allow the FISA court \njudge to presume that a foreign terrorist is also an agent of a foreign \npower, even if there is no evidence supporting that presumption. On the \nother hand, under our amendment, the FISA court could also refuse to \npresume this connection in troubling cases of Government overreach. \nThus, a FISA court judge would have some discretion.\n  What does this mean? In the Moussaoui case, for instance, even though \nthe Government did not yet have evidence that Moussaoui was acting as \nan agent of a foreign power, both our amendment and S. 113 would allow \nthe Government to get a warrant. The only difference is that our \namendment would allow the judge to carefully look at the case and, if \nthe court determined Moussaoui was clearly acting alone, the warrant \ncould be denied.\n  I know some will argue that this casts too much doubt upon the \noutcome of cases and that, as a result, FISA orders will be too hard to \nobtain. But in most cases, if you think about it, the outcome will be \nexactly the same, whether under our amendment or the underlying bill.\n  Others may argue that this amendment might give liberal judges too \nmuch power to deny FISA orders in every case or, as Senator Schumer put \nit today, ``inject gray into the statute.'' But in reality, I believe \nthese judges should have some discretion. This is an entirely secret \nprocess. By providing this presumption, we give judges that discretion. \nThat is, in fact, a good thing.\n  Liberal judges can always find ways to deny a FISA order, even under \nS. 113, if they are determined to do so. For instance, a judge could \nsimply decide there is no probable cause showing that an individual is \nengaged in international terrorism. That is a requirement in both S. \n113 and our amendment.\n  The bottom line is that we can and should preserve the foreign power \nrequirement of FISA without jeopardizing our security. Under either \napproach, the Government will be able to get FISA orders against \ninternational terrorists, even if the Government cannot meet the \nforeign power requirement.\n  Bottom line, again: The only difference between the two approaches is \nthat our amendment preserves some limited discretion so the FISA court \ncould stop the Government from overreaching against those individuals \nwho have no connection to a foreign conspiracy. Let me say, if they \nhave no connection to a foreign conspiracy, you can get the title III \ncriminal warrant.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and, therefore, support \nthe underlying purposes of FISA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield such time as the Senator from Vermont, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I will \nnot speak long.\n  In times of national stress there is an understandable impulse for \nthe government to ask for more power. Sometimes more power is needed, \nbut sometimes it is not.\n  After the September 11 attacks, we worked together in a bipartisan \nfashion and with unprecedented speed to craft and enact the USA PATRIOT \nAct, which enhanced the government's surveillance powers.\n  Now, as we consider S. 113--and we anticipate a possible sequel to \nthe USA PATRIOT Act--it is vital for us first to examine and understand \nhow Federal agencies are using the power that they already have. We \nmust answer two questions: First, is that power being used effectively? \nOur citizens want not only to feel safer, but to be safer. They need \nresults, not rhetoric.\n  Second, is that power being used appropriately, so that our liberties \nare not sacrificed, the openness of our society and our government are \npreserved, and our tax dollars are not squandered?\n  Unfortunately, the FBI and the Department of Justice have either been \nunwilling or unable to help us to answer these basic questions. \nMoreover, the information that we have gleaned on our own through our \nbipartisan oversight efforts has not inspired confidence.\n  In February, Chairman Grassley, Chairman Specter and I released a \ndetailed report based on the oversight that the Judiciary Committee \nconducted in the 107th Congress. That report distilled our bipartisan \nfindings and conclusions from numerous hearings, classified briefings \nand other oversight activities. Our oversight demonstrated the pressing \nneed for reform of the FBI. In particular, it focused on the FBI's \nfailures in implementing what is already in FISA.\n  The administration's response to our bipartisan oversight report has \nbeen to dismiss it as ``old news'' relating to problems that are all \nalready fixed. In short, ``everything is fine'' at the FBI and they \nplan to do nothing to respond to the systemic criticisms in the \nSpecter, Grassley, Leahy report. Predictably, however, Congress is \nasked yet again to expand the FISA statute.\n  The bill that we are considering, S.113, adopts a ``quick fix'' \napproach. With slick names like the ``Moussaoui fix,'' and the ``lone \nwolf'' bill, it is aimed at making Americans feel safer, but it does \nnothing to address the problems that actually plague our intelligence \ngatherers. It does nothing to fix the real problems that plagued the \nFBI before 9/11 and that continue at the FBI.\n  In private briefings, even FBI representatives have stated that they \ndo not need this change in the law in order to protect against \nterrorism. They are getting all the warrants they want under the \ncurrent law.\n  Sunset provisions, such as the one I helped add during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup, allow us to adopt such measures as S. 113 on a \ntemporary basis. The reporting requirement that is being added to the \nbill on the floor is another welcome improvement, which will help us to \nascertain whether this surveillance tool is working properly or not. \nThe reporting requirement is similar to those proposed in a bill I \nintroduced with Senators Grassley and Specter--S. 436, the Domestic \nSurveillance Oversight Act.\n  While there is little evidence that this bill is necessary, it does \ncreate significant problems. First, it tears FISA from one of its most \nbasic moorings. FISA was intended to assist in gathering intelligence \nabout foreign powers and their agents. The Kyl-Schumer proposal would \nsimply read that requirement out of the law for a whole class of FISA \ncases.\n\n  As introduced, the bill essentially said that a ``person'' is now a \n``foreign power,'' which makes little sense as a matter of logic or \npolicy. As reported by the Judiciary Committee, the bill's wording \nmakes more sense, but the fundamental policy problem remains.\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\n  Second, in the rare case of a true ``lone wolf,'' our federal law \nenforcement agents already have potent tools at their disposal, \nincluding the title III wiretap, the rule 41 search warrant, and the \ngrand jury subpoena. These provide ample means to combat isolated \ncriminal acts, but with more accountability and judicial supervision \nthan the FISA surveillance authorities.\n  Far from addressing a true problem, then, all that S.113 would do is \nencourage the use of the secret, unchecked FISA process for an entire \nclass of cases that are more appropriately handled as criminal matters.\n  To the extent that some believe that there is a problem that needs to \nbe addressed, I support the more measured and practical approach that \nSenator Feinstein developed, and that I was pleased to cosponsor. The \nFeinstein approach is to create a statutory presumption to assist the \nFBI in terrorism cases.\n  Using this approach, when the government shows probable cause to \nbelieve that a non-U.S. person is engaging in international terrorism, \nthe FISA Court may presume that the person is also an agent of a \nforeign power. This permissive presumption would allow law enforcement \nsome extra leeway in international terrorism cases, but without simply \nremoving the foreign power nexus from a huge class of FISA matters \naltogether.\n  I commend Senator Feinstein for her work on this amendment. I believe \nit is a constructive and reasonable compromise. It would give the FBI \nwhat it claims to need as a practical matter, to ensure that it can use \nFISA against individuals like Zacarias Moussaoui, whose ties to a \nforeign power may be difficult to prove.\n  At the same time, the amendment would preserve some discretion on the \npart of the FISA court to determine that an individual should not be \nsubject to surveillance because he is not, in fact, an agent of a \nforeign power. The FISA court should not become an automatic adjunct of \nthe executive branch. That would destroy the checks and balances that \nkeep us all free. Let's make sure they have the ability to act as a \ncourt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from California to \nyield me some time so I can speak in support of the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield as much time as the Senator \nrequires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from California \nthat S. 113 is the wrong way to fix the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. The approach taken in S. 113 would eliminate the \ncurrent requirement in FISA that the individual who is the target of a \nwarrant must be an agent of a foreign power. This means that S. 113 may \nvery well result in FISA serving as a substitute for some of the most \nimportant criminal laws we have in this country. Senator Feinstein's \npermissive presumption amendment would allow the Government to obtain \nFISA warrants against suspected lone wolf international terrorists \nwithout unnecessarily eliminating an essential element of FISA, and \nthat is the agent of a foreign power requirement.\n  FISA, as the Senator from California has very carefully and \neffectively pointed out, represents an important exception to \ntraditional constitutional restraints on criminal investigations, \nallowing the Government to gather foreign intelligence information \nwithout having probable cause that a crime has been or is going to be \ncommitted. I will repeat that. This is something the Government can do \nwithout having probable cause that a crime has been or is going to be \ncommitted. That is a major exception to our normal understanding about \nhow criminal proceedings should be conducted under our Constitution. \nThe courts have permitted the Government to proceed with surveillance \nin this country under FISA's lesser standard of suspicion because the \npower is limited to investigations of foreign powers and their agents.\n  Senator Feinstein ably pointed out the history behind this and the \ncareful balance that Attorney General Griffin Bell discussed at the \ntime, and how important that balance was for such an unusual exception \nto be made to our rules about criminal proceedings.\n  S. 113 writes out of the statute a key requirement necessary to the \nlawfulness of intrusive surveillance powers that would otherwise simply \nbe unconstitutional.\n  FISA's own appellate court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt of Review, discussed in a November 2002 decision why a FISA \nwarrant does not require a showing of probable cause of criminal \nactivity. The court stated that FISA is constitutional in part because \nit provides ``another safeguard . . . that is, the requirement that \nthere be probable cause to believe the target is acting `for or on \nbehalf of a foreign power.' '' So this is supposed to be about people \nacting in connection with a foreign power. S. 113, as currently \ndrafted, simply eliminates that safeguard.\n  Even if S. 113 survived constitutional challenge, it would mean that \nnon-U.S. persons could have either electronic surveillance and searches \nauthorized against them using the lesser standards of FISA, even though \nthere is no conceivable foreign intelligence aspect to their case. S. \n113 will then likely result in a dramatic increase in the use of FISA \nwarrants in situations that do not justify such extraordinary \nGovernment power.\n  I think Senator Feinstein's amendment is a thoughtful and reasonable \nalternative to make sure that FISA can be used against a lone wolf \nterrorist, which I commend the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom New York for trying to address. But at the same time her amendment \nmeans we can do this without eliminating the important agent of a \nforeign power requirement. The amendment would create a permissive \npresumption that if there is probable cause to believe a non-U.S. \nperson is engaged in or preparing to engage in international terrorism, \nthe individual can be considered to be an agent of a foreign power even \nif the evidence of a connection to a foreign power is not clear. The \nuse of a permissive presumption, rather than eliminating the foreign \npower requirement, maintains judicial oversight and review on a case-\nby-case basis on the question of whether the target of the surveillance \nis an agent of a foreign power. The permissive presumption would permit \nthe FISA judge to decide, in a given case, if the Government has gone \ntoo far in requesting a FISA warrant.\n  I want to be clear about one point that apparently came up this \nmorning. I understand the Senator from Arizona argued this morning that \nthis amendment would weaken or impact on the FISA law as a whole. That \nis just not true. This amendment applies only to the changes made in \nthe bill to address the lone wolf problem. It is a narrow, carefully \ndrafted, very important amendment to this bill.\n  Any concern that the FISA judges would not use their discretion \nwisely is, I think--as the Senator from California pointed out--\nmisplaced. What is the reason for any concern whatsoever about the \nproper use of this provision by judges? In the 23 years that the FISA \ncourt has been reviewing FISA applications, they have only declined to \nissue the warrant on one occasion. In that case, the decision of the \ncourt was reversed on appeal. The FISA judges clearly take their \nresponsibility seriously and execute it carefully. The experience of \nthe last two decades shows we can trust them not to the deny FISA \napplications too hastily. We should also be able to trust them enough \nto maintain their power to serve as a reasonable check on Government \noverreaching.\n  We are told that one of the inspirations for this bill was the case \nof Zacarias Moussaoui, the alleged 20th hijacker. One of the FBI's \nexcuses for not seeking a warrant to search Mr. Moussaoui's computer \nprior to September 11 was that they could not identify a foreign power \nor group with which Moussaoui was associated. In other words, they \ncould not meet the agent of a foreign power requirement to get a FISA \nwarrant. In the case of Moussaoui, a warrant application was never even \nsubmitted to the FISA court.\n\n  As Senator Specter pointed out, many legal observers think the FBI \nsimply misread the law, and it could and should have obtained a FISA \nwarrant against Mr. Moussaoui if it had tried.\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\n  No matter, in any event, Senator Feinstein's amendment would fix the \nso-called Moussaoui problem just as well as the current bill. The \npermissive presumption would still ensure that future investigators do \nnot need to show specific evidence of a particular foreign power or \ngroup for which the individual was an agent if they have other good \nevidence that the subject is preparing to engage in international \nterrorism, as they did in Moussaoui's case, but have not been able to \nidentify the specific agent of a foreign power.\n  At the same time, Senator Feinstein's formulation would put some \nlimit on the Government's ability to use this new power to dramatically \nextend FISA's reach. If the Government comes to a conclusion that an \nindividual is truly acting on his or her own, then our criminal laws \nconcerning when electronic surveillance and searches can be used, in my \nview, and I think in the view of many, are more than sufficient. True \nlone wolves can and should be investigated and prosecuted in our \ncriminal justice system.\n  Under this amendment, the FISA court could presume that any non-U.S. \nperson preparing to engage in international terrorism is an agent of a \nforeign power. At the time of the initial warrant application, and \nperhaps even later, this presumption makes sense. It is somewhat \ndifficult to envision a foreigner in the United States planning an \ninternational terrorist attack who is not an agent of a foreign power, \nwhich includes a terrorist organization. But one can envision a \nsituation where, at the time of a request for a reauthorization, a FISA \nwarrant is made, the Government has now determined that the suspect is \ntruly a lone wolf.\n  In those situations where the person is simply a lone wolf in every \nsense of the word and is not connected with a foreign power or \nterrorist organization, FISA should not apply. The Government should \nthen use all the tools of the criminal process because--and this is the \nkey issue--in that circumstance, the foreign intelligence rationale, \nthe entire basis for the creation of a FISA law, that entire rationale \nfor FISA's lesser standard no longer exists.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment retains FISA's agent of a foreign power \nrequirement, maintains the independence of the FISA court, and \npreserves judicial oversight of the abuse of the new power. It protects \nnational security by addressing the lone wolf problem, and it does not \nthreaten the constitutional freedoms we cherish.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from California for her leadership role \non this important amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis reasonable amendment that will simply make this a much better bill \nand, frankly, a bill that would cause many of us to feel comfortable \nsupporting the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues who are proponents of this bill to consider how \nimportant it is that we have as many Senators as possible support such \na bill. This goes right to the heart of the question of whether in \ntimes of crisis this Nation is going to get the balance right between \ncivil liberties and our Constitution and the important paramount issue \nof fighting terrorism. We need as many people supporting this to send a \nmessage to the American people that we are getting this right. The \nFeinstein amendment is a reasonable, modest attempt to achieve that \nkind of consensus. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in reluctant, but considered, opposition to the \namendment of my good friend from California. I thank her and the \nSenator from Wisconsin for their roles in this area. My colleague from \nCalifornia and I usually share many of the same views on law \nenforcement issues, and we work closely together. I say usually, it is \nthe other way around. I am on one side, and she is trying to put \ntogether the compromise. Now she is trying to put another compromise \ntogether. I respect her for that.\n  I say to the Senator from California and the Senator from Wisconsin, \nwho is a devout believer in the freedom and liberty this country \ncherishes and a constant watchdog on our committee, I have great \nrespect for both of them. This is a good debate because in our brave \nnew post-9/11 world, we have to balance liberty and security and, \nobviously, some adjustments have to be made.\n  The Founding Fathers knew that in times of war, in times of crisis, \nsecurity might gain a little. I do not think this is an issue of \nsecurity versus liberty, though. I do think it is an issue of the new \ntechnologies that are available and allows individuals or small groups \nof individuals unknown before to do real damage to America. Then 10 \nyears ago, you knew who was going to hurt you. It would be a nation. It \nwould be an established group of terrorists. But today, any small group \ncan pop up, even individuals, and do such damage. That is what has \ncaused the Senator from Arizona and I to change the law.\n  I think the Feinstein amendment is well-intentioned, and honestly it \nrecalibrates the balance in a little different way than I would. This \nis what the debate is about. My guess is, if Washington, Jefferson, or \nMadison were looking down on the Senate Chamber, they would want us to \nhave this debate. It is a good thing we are having this debate. I \nappreciate it.\n  I am going to be brief. I know we want to deal with this amendment.\n  My objection to the amendment of the Senator from California is that \nit does leave discretion in the hands of the judge--the very purpose of \nthe amendment. I do not think there ought to be discretion when there \nis probable cause that some individual or small group, whether they can \nbe connected to a terrorist group, a known terrorist group, a terrorist \norganization or not--I do not think there should be discretion in \ngetting that FISA warrant. Obviously, the judge will have discretion, \nso to speak, in determining if probable cause is there. So this is \nhardly a straitjacket, even the amendment we have proposed.\n  If the judge does not find probable cause to engage or prepare to \nengage in terrorist activity, there is not going to be a warrant.\n  The other point I want to stress, of course, and this matters to me--\nI know some in the civil liberties community say everyone who is \ndealing with American law should have the same rights. This does not \naffect citizens or those who hold green cards. I think it strikes a \nfair balance. The idea of giving the judge discretion, the so-called \npermissive presumption, in my judgment, goes too far.\n  One of the problems we had with the Moussaoui case was that the FBI \nwas unsure that they could seek a warrant. They did not think the law \nallowed them to seek a warrant. That is what brought up our amendment.\n\n  With the Feinstein amendment, they would still not have that \ncertainty. You also might get in the very same case a judge in \nCalifornia ruling one way and a judge in New York ruling another way. I \ndo not think we want confusion, differing opinions, judicial discretion \nwhen clearly probable cause is met.\n  I realize that my good friend from California seeks an ability to \ncheck on the abuse of FISA. I agree with her. I argue this is the wrong \nway to do it. Again, if probable cause is established, it should not \nmatter if it is a lone wolf or a known terrorist group or a known \nterrorist organization. To have different judges come to different \nconclusions about that I do not think helps move our law, move our \nsafety, or, for that matter, further protect our liberties.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. It is well \nintentioned. It does seek to understand the balance between liberty and \nsecurity, but it would do it in a way that I think is not advised, \nparticularly in our post-9/11 world. I urge my colleagues to vote down \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first let me address Senator Feingold. He is \ncorrect about the misstatement I made this morning. I do recall making \nthis statement that the Feinstein amendment would apply generally to \nthe section of law rather than just S. 113. The Senator from Wisconsin \nis correct. What I said was in error. It does not detract from my \nprimary argument, but that is correct, and I appreciate him pointing \nthat out.\n  I wish to respond to the three primary arguments we have heard. First\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\nof all, Senator Leahy primarily was making the point that we should see \nif the Patriot Act is working before we make the changes that Senator \nSchumer and I and others are trying to make.\n  First, I note that the vote in the Judiciary Committee was 16 to 0. \nIt was unanimous. I appreciate the bipartisan support from people such \nas Senator Leahy and would note that we have had that kind of \nbipartisan support from the very day that Senator--in fact, 2 years ago \nit was Schumer-Kyl, now it is Kyl-Schumer, for obvious reasons.\n  Secondly, this has nothing to do with the PATRIOT Act. The FISA law \nwas put into effect in 1978, I believe it was. So this is a law that \nhas been in effect for a long time. The problem with it is that a \nsignificant change has occurred on the international stage. As has been \npointed out, the law was originally intended to deal with Soviet spies, \nforeign powers, or international terrorist organizations such as the \nRed Brigade, the Baader-Meinhof gang and people like that.\n  In that day, it was a tight-knit group of people who actually worked \nas a terrorist organization. But today, as the testimony before the \nIntelligence Committee went into in detail, it is now a worldwide \nIslamic jihadist movement. It is about a cause rather than an \norganization.\n  The FBI Director, whose testimony I read this morning, went into a \ngreat deal about how, therefore, the people who work in this \ninternational cause are very different from the old members of the \ngangs or the Soviet spy network, and to try to pigeon hole a FISA \nwarrant against these individual people into the provisions of the law \nas it was originally drafted is really not possible. That is why the \nFBI would not go after a warrant for Zacarias Moussaoui. It is why \nAgent Rowley was very upset about it. But at the end of the day, \nheadquarters was probably right not to try to make out the case that \nZacarias Moussaoui was somehow connected to an international terrorist \norganization. They found some tenuous connections with some Chechen \nrebels but at the stage that the warrant was corrected they could never \ntie it into an international terrorist organization. We now know \nsubsequent to the issuance of the warrant that there were some ties to \nal-Qaida, but he may be a good example of the lone-wolf terrorist.\n  So that is why times have changed. The law has to change to keep up \nwith this. Otherwise, we would not be suggesting this rather modest \nchange in the law.\n  The people against whom we are now directing our surveillance with \nrespect to international terrorism are a very different group of \npeople. Much of the time they do not act in concert and sometimes they \nenact as lone wolves.\n  That gets me to the next point. As I understand it, Senator \nFeingold's primary argument is that we should have this kind of \nsurveillance against agents of foreign powers, but that we should not \nhave it against lone wolves. Of course, the Feinstein amendment \nprovides a presumption that the lone wolf is an agent of a foreign \npower.\n  That is not our point. We are not trying to prove the lone wolf is an \nagent of a foreign power. I do not want to have a presumption in there \nthat presumes something that we are not even alleging. Sometimes our \nU.S. Government is going to say, we do not have any reason to believe \nthis person is connected to an international terrorist organization or \na foreign power, country. We are not alleging that. We are alleging \nthat he is a person engaged in or about to engage in a terrorist \naction, we have probable cause to believe that. That standard remains \nthe same and, therefore, we want to, what, prosecute him? No, get a \nwarrant to see what else he is doing.\n  So this amendment does not match up with what we are trying to do. We \nare not trying to prove that they are agents of a foreign power. We are \nproviding the court with evidence that a non-U.S. person is engaging in \nor about to engage in activities involving terrorism against the United \nStates and, therefore, the court is warranted in allowing us to \ninvestigate it further. We do not want the presumption because in many \ncases that is not what we are trying to prove.\n  The important point is a point I would like to make in response to \nSenator Feingold and that is that there still has to be international \nterrorism involved. It is not as if we are going after people because \nwe do not like their nationality or something of that sort. We are \ndealing with a very sophisticated court that is not a kangaroo court; \nit is the FISA court, and they have not turned down warrants because \nthe Justice Department has been very careful to make sure they have all \nthe evidence that is needed.\n  I will tell my great friend Senator Feinstein and just make a \nfootnote--I said it this morning but I will say it again--I cannot \nremember a time that she and I disagreed on a matter involving \nintelligence or law enforcement activities. It just does not happen \nexcept this one time. I guess the exception proves the rule. There is \nnobody in the Senate with whom I have enjoyed working more on these \nmatters. Witness the fact that Senator Feinstein and I have been the \nchairman and ranking member alternately of the Terrorism, Technology, \nand Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee ever \nsince I came to the Senate. It has been a wonderful relationship, and \nthere is nobody in this body that I admire more.\n  So I want to answer this question very specifically, because if I \nunderstood one of her arguments, it was that we have changed the \nprobable cause standard, and we have absolutely not done that. In fact, \nin response, I think to a suggestion of one of our Democratic \ncolleagues, we had the language exactly tracked in the statute, and I \nwill read it precisely. This is in 50 United States Code, section 1801, \nthe definitions section under foreign power. I will not read the whole \nthing, but No. 4 is ``a group engaged in international terrorism or \nactivities in preparation therefor.''\n  Then, under ``agent of foreign power''--and, remember, this is where \nwe have the definition of a non-U.S. person. We had the third category. \nWe tracked the language precisely--``engages in international terrorism \nor activities in preparation therefor.'' It is the exact same language.\n  So the probable cause standard remains identical. In very simple \nterms, this is what the U.S. attorney would have to say: Judge, here is \nmy affidavit and what it says is that Joe Blow is a non-U.S. citizen. \nHere is the documentation for that, and here are the activities that we \nhave probable cause to believe he is engaging in.\n  So it is the probable cause standard. What would satisfy that test? \nLet me be very precise in the order that I present this.\n  Under this section of definitions--and our bill is the same as S. \n2568, which the Justice Department was referring to when it made this \ncomment, someone who is involved in terrorist acts:\n\n       That transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by \n     which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended \n     to coerce or intimidate, or the locale in which their \n     perpetrators operate or seek asylum.\n\n  This is quoting from 50 United States Code, section 1801(c)(3):\n\n       As a result, a FISA warrant would still be limited to \n     collecting foreign intelligence for the international \n     responsibilities of the United States, and the duties of the \n     Federal Government to the States in matters involving foreign \n     terrorism.\n\n  That is quoting from a court case that interpreted the provision.\n  Therefore, according to the Justice Department, the same interests \nand considerations that support the constitutionality of FISA as it now \nstands would provide the constitutional justification for S. 2568, \nwhich is the predecessor to S. 113, which is the bill before us.\n  So the definition is the same, the probable cause standard is the \nsame, and the nexus to international terrorism is the same. None of \nthat changes. The only thing that changes is that we add non-U.S. \nperson so you can get to the lone wolf and do not have to either assert \nthat the person is involved with an international terrorist \norganization or foreign power or presume that the individual is, \nbecause that person may well not be.\n  Finally, Senator Feinstein made the point that under proper \ncircumstances, S. 113 would allow the search of a solo international \nterrorist and the answer is, yes, that is exactly what it would allow. \nAnd especially with today's\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\nweapons, which allow even a solo terrorist to be able to cause enormous \ndestruction, the FBI should be able to monitor such a terrorist if it \ncan convince the court that probable cause exists that would otherwise \nbe the standard in any kind of FISA warrant request.\n  I think those are the answers to the allegations that have been made \nin support of the Feinstein amendment. I think it gets right down to \nwhat Senator Feingold said, which is that there is simply disagreement \nabout whether the lone wolf should be the subject of this \nstatute. Obviously, if the amendment were to be adopted, we have our \npurpose, which is to add the third category.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for his personal comments. He knows I have thoroughly enjoyed \nworking with him. It is unusual--as a matter of fact, I cannot remember \nin all these years when we have ever been on opposite sides of one of \nthese questions.\n  Let me state to the Senator my great fear. We all forget beneath the \nsurface this Government has tremendous power. When that power is \nexercised against a person in this country, alone as a visitor, has no \nrights, it is enormous what can happen. What my deep concern is that \noverzealous prosecutors will use this where they should use title III \nand get a criminal warrant instead of a FISA warrant because of the \nremoval of the agent of the foreign power. We keep the connection with \nthe basics of the FISA statute which is surveillance related to an \nagent of the foreign power. We keep that. That is the justification for \nFISA. We give the judge the ability to make that as a presumption--\nergo, giving the judge some discretion not to make it, and therefore \nthe individual seeks the warrant--an FBI agent or whoever it is--goes \nto title III and gets a criminal warrant.\n  Once you get a FISA warrant, the benefits from the law enforcement \nside of the FISA warrant are much greater than the title III warrant.\n  It is a small protection. I don't believe, in my heart of hearts--and \nif this were to pass and the Senator from Arizona showed me that it did \nin any way prevent the FISA court from exercising its discretion just \nas you want it to, I will change it. I would be the first one to come \nback.\n  It prevents this misuse of a prosecutor who should be getting a title \nIII warrant, who will come to the FISA court instead because the FISA \ncourt will be a rubberstamp, and because myself, a visiting Indian, \nPakistani, Muslim, Frenchman, Italian, anybody in Los Angeles who \nhappens to have in their pocket a one-way ticket and maybe a pocket \nknife--a box cutter may be out of date--and somebody has a suspicion, \nthey do not have to prove anything. And they can surveil me, they can \nwiretap me, they can exert all of the surveillance powers that are used \nunder FISA. They do not know whether I am going to commit a criminal \nact and they have no evidence of anything else. That is what title III \nis for. Title III has a little heavier cause burden, but as the Senator \nsaid, there is probable cause in both.\n  But the benefits of the FISA warrant are superior to the benefits of \nthe title III warrant in their duration. So you can do all this to \nsomebody for 90 days instead of 30 days and you do not have to come \nback and renew the warrant once every year. That is my concern.\n  As I read your legislation, there is no discretion. That is the \nproblem I have with it. This is such a slight change, it is kind of a \nlittle tweak that a judge can say, hey, now, let's wait and see what \nyou are doing here.\n  If the Senator would like to respond, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could, the Senator from California has been talking \nabout discretion, and I guess I begin by asking a question.\n  Does the Senator intend the presumption language would apply both to \nthe definition of the individual as an agent of a foreign power and \nrelative to the activities in which the individual is allegedly \nengaging?\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The presumption would be that the target or the \nindividual would be an agent of a foreign power. Otherwise, you could \nhave this against the Unabomber, Oklahoma City. Of course, they are \nAmerican citizens, so I understand that does not apply, but that same \nkind of situation.\n  Mr. KYL. There are two things the court will have to determine. \nFirst, that this is a warrant that should be issued, that there is \nprobable cause the underlying crime is being committed or activities \nengaged in for the preparation of a crime. And second, it lies against \na particular kind of person we are talking about. In regular title III \ncourt you do not have the second requirement, but in FISA court you \nhave to prove the person is either an agent of a foreign power or \nforeign intelligence organization, and we are adding this third \ncriteria.\n  So the court has to make a 100 percent determination in both of those \nmatters. If the court cannot find any evidence in the affidavit that \nthe individual is not a United States citizen, for example, the court \nwould have no discretion and have to deny the warrant. But if the court \nfound part of the warrant was satisfied, this person is clearly a non-\nUnited States citizen, then, number two is satisfied; go back to number \none, which is the question, Do we have probable cause to believe the \nperson is engaging in the kind of activities that the statute discusses \nhere.\n  That is not necessarily a matter of discretion so much as it is a \nmatter of a court weighing the affidavit presentation and determining \nwhether it is sufficient to meet the probable cause standard.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What I don't understand is why you do not want to \ngive the judge that small bit of discretion with a presumption. The \njudge can presume it. We both know the history and the history is 100 \npercent if you include the appeal of FISA judges in granting warrants. \nSo there will not be a problem there.\n  I am concerned about the overreach. I am concerned about the misuse. \nAnd the only way we could figure to counter that was to keep the agent \na foreign power, provide this presumption that a judge could use in \nthat one case.\n  Senator, neither you nor Senator Feingold nor I would ever know if \nthere was an overreach. That is what makes this far more dangerous, the \nfact that it is so secret.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could respond to the last point.\n  The matter about which the court has some degree of discretion is in \nthe way it weighs the affidavit presentation relative to the underlying \npredicate for the warrant, the activities that are being engaged in, \nthe purchase of the ticket, the presence of box cutters, all that \ninformation. The court weighs all that. It is presented in the \naffidavit, and the court makes a decision. It is enough or it is not \nenough. To some extent, you can say that is discretion. It is really \napplying the evidence to the probable cause test, weighing it and \ndetermining whether the evidence meets the case. In any event, that is \nwhere the court has some leeway to decide.\n  Where the court does not have any leeway is to something that is \neither a fact or it is not. That is, Does this person qualify or not? \nThat is to say, is the person an appropriate subject for the warrant or \nnot?\n  If you were asserting, for example, that the individual was a member \nof the Baader-Meinhoff gang, there would have to be evidence in the \naffidavit that is clear enough for the court to reach that conclusion \nor the court would say, sorry, this person does not qualify for a FISA \nwarrant. I cannot find enough evidence in here that he is a member of \nthe Baader-Meinhoff gang or a spy for the Soviet Union.\n  But with respect to whether this person is a non-United States \nperson, that is something that will either be fairly true or not. It is \neither going to be true or not. The court is either going to be faced \nwith a situation where the evidence is overwhelmingly clear in the \naffidavit and the United States attorney says it is very clear this \nperson is not a United States citizen, here is the evidence we have, \nand the court will say, I agree. Or the court will say, all you have \ndone is assert that the person is a non-United States citizen. I don't \nhave any basis to know that or not. Where is your evidence to know that \nhe is a non-U.S. citizen? So I am not going to grant the warrant. But \nthat is the basis on which the court is going to make that judgment.\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\n  The court is not going to say there is a provision here that says I \ncan presume that this individual is an agent of a foreign power and \ntherefore I can have some leeway here to decide whether or not the \nwarrant lies against this individual. The Government is either going to \nassert that the person is an agent of a foreign power or not. If the \nGovernment is saying no, we don't think this person is working for some \nforeign power, we think he is working on his own or at least we don't \nhave any evidence to suggest he is anything other than an international \nterrorist traveling all around the world training and picking up \ndifferent things and so on, but he is a dangerous guy and here is the \nreason we believe he is dangerous, a presumption at this point doesn't \nget you anywhere.\n  The court has no direction to go in. If you say there is a \npresumption that he is an agent of a foreign power and the Government \nis not trying to prove he is acting for a foreign power, what has this \ndefinition gained us? There are situations in which the Government \nsimply isn't going to allege that the person is an agent of a foreign \npower; it is only going to allege that he is a lone wolf, but look at \nall the bad things he has done or is doing. If they are sufficient to \ngrant a warrant, if there is probable cause there, the court can do it. \nIf the court says it is not quite sufficient yet, get some more \ninformation, then he will deny the warrant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will yield time, Mr. President, and I will be very \nhappy to have Senator Feingold in this.\n  I think this is really the kind of discussion that we should be \nhaving. I welcome the free flow.\n  If I knew a better way of solving the problem Senator Kyl mentioned, \nI would do it. But my view and what Intelligence staff and others have \nsaid to me is that the way it is worded creates a rubberstamp out of a \nFISA judge, once you take out that agent of a foreign power connection. \nI guess the reason they believe that is that it puts them into the \nother side, the title III side.\n  If I could think of another way, I would. But it is one added \nguarantee against an overreach. You and I have both known zealous \nprosecutors. You and I have both known people who would misuse this. \nThe question comes, How do we prevent misuse from happening?\n  I am happy to yield to Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for yielding time and for her leadership. I thank the \nSenator from Arizona. He is a person of great integrity, and the way he \nconcedes if he didn't say something exactly perfectly this morning is \nan example of exactly the kind of relationship I have with him on these \ndebates. They are good debates. I appreciate that.\n  It is also true the Senator from California and the Senator from \nArizona almost always agree on these kinds of issues. They are one of \nthe most formidable combinations here in the Senate, in a bipartisan \ncombination. I take great pride in the bipartisan work I have had a \nchance to do with people such as the other Senator from Arizona and the \nSenators from Maine.\n  So I take my hat off to them for having done that. I have often been \non the other side of their view, which is not easy because they are \nwell prepared and they are very dedicated and they like to get things \ndone.\n  I guess that is why I think this is kind of a significant moment, \nwhen Senator Feinstein and I actually agree on a point, when the two of \nyou so frequently agree. I think it is a sign that there is something \nthat needs to be fixed in this bill.\n  It is modest, but it is very important. I remind the Senator from \nArizona that I think I essentially said this: I voted for this in \ncommittee in the hope it would be fixed on the floor.\n  My goal here is not to kill this bill. I do know how to vote against \nbills I don't like. My goal is to fix it because I think there is a \nproblem with this issue. That is where we are with this amendment. This \nis an attempt to fix this bill on a very important point without, in my \nview, doing any serious harm at all to the goal of the Senator from \nArizona and the goal of the Senator from New York.\n  The way I understand this operates is that in these cases the FISA \ncourt is going to grant this warrant upfront, essentially every time in \nthe first request, because there will be the evidence or the \npresumption that there is a problem.\n  Where this, the Feinstein amendment, has a real impact is where they \ncome back later and they have to come back for a renewal. If after a \ncouple of years there is just no evidence at all or virtually no sign \nat all that the original belief about what this guy was about to do \nisn't bearing any fruit at all, in that case, and only in that case, \nshould this, in terms of our laws and our tradition, be returned to the \nregular criminal court--only in that circumstance.\n  In other words, yes, the Government was trying to protect the \nAmerican people, as they should. They had a person here who they \nbelieved might have a connection to a foreign power or be connected to \na terrorist organization. But it turns out after some period of time \nthat it just didn't happen to be one of those cases where that was \ntrue.\n  It is still a person who intended, perhaps, to do something very \nwrong. It is still a person who should be prosecuted. But it is a \nperson who deserves the protections of the laws of the United States--\nbecause I am sure the Senator from Arizona agrees with me, barring this \nunusual kind of circumstance that is the basis for the FISA law, \neveryone who commits a crime on our soil, whether an American citizen \nor not, is entitled to the protections of our Constitution and the Bill \nof Rights in a criminal proceeding.\n\n  The FISA law is only a narrow exception to that. So let's be very \nclear on the record. I do want to get at these lone wolves who may have \nsome connection to international actors, such as foreign powers, or to \nterrorist organizations. As the Senator from California pointed out, if \nit is simply a person committing a bad act on our soil, a person who is \nnot an American citizen, that is what our criminal courts are for. That \nis what title III is for. That is the foundation of our system.\n  This is really an incredibly narrow exception, a backstop, a \nsafeguard to make sure that the good intentions of what this bill is \nall about don't go too far. That is what the Senator from California \nsaid, so that there is not overreaching.\n  I have just one other point about what the Senator from New York \nsaid. He seemed to be setting up a scenario where there might be a \nconflict between the FISA judges, almost as if there were different \ncircuits like in the regular courts. That is not the way the FISA \ncourts are set up. There are different FISA judges, but together they \nconstitute the appeals courts. There would not be different areas of \nthe country that would have different laws of this kind of thing that \nwould present any kind of problem in terms of a conflict in the \ncircuits. I don't think this argument holds up.\n  Let me return to the point. The Senator from California has been so \ncareful in making sure this is just a safeguard down the line, when \nsomebody has been identified as a potential lone wolf and it does not \nreally pan out, that there is some discretion rather than a permanent \nwarrant into perpetuity for eavesdropping on somebody who certainly \nmaybe needs to be evesdropped upon, but for whom that authority should \nbe obtained through the normal criminal procedure, not on the basis of \na law that was crafted under the assumption that this is a foreign \nthreat to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Feingold for \nthe kind words he had for me and my colleague from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain. I just spoke with Senator Feinstein.\n  I don't think either of us has a whole lot more to say here. I think \nSenator Rockefeller may wish to speak and there may be others.\n  I urge anyone who would like to speak to this amendment to come to \nthe floor and speak because otherwise I think we are getting close to \nthe time when we could vote.\n  I inquire of the Chair, how much time remains on both sides on this \namendment?\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 98 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from California has 68 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. I think there is a little time left on the debate time as \nwell, but I am prepared to yield that back when we are done with this \namendment, as would Senator Schumer.\n  We could either note the absence of a quorum and wait a few minutes \nfor somebody else or I could yield the floor to someone?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I \nknow Senator Rockefeller is on his way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer. I thank the Senator from California whose amendment to S. 113 \nI rise to support. I am a cosponsor of her amendment.\n  We live in a time in which we can never feel completely safe. There \nare terrorists throughout the world and here at home who have sworn to \nkill Americans. That is what they are trained to do. That is what they \nwant to do. That is what they plan to do. We fight a war knowing that \nit may increase the terrorist threat against us. We buy duct tape and \nplastic sheeting. We plan escape routes for our families. We make \ndecisions about whether to go to public events or ride a subway, or do \nall kinds of things. Does it change our lives or not? We are not even \nsure of that yet.\n  In times such as this, we in Congress have a special responsibility. \nWe must be vigilant in our lawmaking and our oversight to make certain \nthat the executive branch, our intelligence, and law enforcement \nagencies have all the legitimate tools to do their jobs in an efficient \nand effective way.\n  But our responsibility does not end there. It is easy to write laws \nto remove obstacles to prevent the Government from obtaining \ninformation. We have done that. Our challenge is to write laws that \nstrengthen our security without undermining privacy and liberty. This \nis something our Nation has never faced before in the way which it is \nnow going to be facing for the next several years.\n  It is our responsibility to look very closely at every piece of \nlegislation related to fighting terrorism and ask: Do we need it? Does \nit make us feel safer? Yes. But do we really need it? Does it \naccomplish the goals we are seeking? And does it go too far?\n\n  I have cosponsored the Feinstein substitute amendment to S. 113 \nbecause I believe the language of the substitute is crafted carefully--\nvery carefully--to accomplish our goals in the fight against terrorism \nwithout going too far.\n  Mr. President, I would like to explain why I believe that.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 was designed to \nregulate the collection of foreign intelligence inside the United \nStates using electronic wiretaps. Later, physical searches were added \nto the law.\n  Before FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the executive \nbranch ran wiretaps for national security purposes without judicial \nreview, without approval of any sort. Such wiretaps were potentially \nunconstitutional and, because of that, threatened the viability of \nespionage prosecutions and raised serious questions regarding civil \nliberties.\n  The Congress enacted FISA with the recognition that our national \nsecurity required the collection of foreign intelligence in the United \nStates through intrusive means under different circumstances and using \ndifferent standards than in the criminal warrant context, and the \ncourts have upheld the constitutionality of FISA.\n  The purpose of FISA is the collection of foreign intelligence. The \nstandard used to distinguish between FISA collection and wiretaps \nrelated to criminal activity involves a determination that the target \nis a ``foreign power'' or linked to a ``foreign power.'' In the case of \nterrorists, the Government must show the target is an ``agent of a \nforeign power,'' a terrorist group operating overseas.\n  Both S. 113 and the Feinstein substitute address and solve the \nfollowing problem: What if you have a non-U.S. person in the United \nStates who is engaging in or preparing to engage in international \nterrorist activities, but the Government does not have enough evidence \nto link him to an overseas group?\n  Both S. 113 and the Feinstein substitute eliminate the requirement \nthat the Government produce to the FISA court evidence showing a direct \nlink between the target and a foreign terrorist group.\n  So why is the Feinstein substitute better?\n  Under S. 113, the Kyl-Schumer bill, a key principle of FISA is \neliminated. Even if the Government has actual evidence that the target \nis not connected to a foreign terrorist group, under Kyl-Schumer, the \nGovernment can still get a FISA wiretap order. This simply goes too \nfar, and it is not necessary, in the judgment of this Senator.\n  If we know for certain a person really has no foreign connections, if \nhe or she is a true ``lone wolf''--a foreign ``Unabomber,'' for \nexample--then it is a straightforward criminal investigation. There is \nno foreign intelligence to be gotten at all, and that person is not a \nvalid target under FISA.\n  The Feinstein substitute gets the Government everything it wants \nwithout changing FISA in a way that damages its basic premise; to wit, \nFISA is for the collection of foreign intelligence and should not be \nused when the only objective at hand is the collection of criminal \nevidence.\n  Mr. President, I commend the carefully crafted solution offered by \nthe Senator from California to a very difficult problem. As the vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, I am proud to cosponsor this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter dated April 30, 2003, to Chairman Orrin \nHatch from the Department of Justice relative to this legislation, and \nspecifically an analysis of the amendment proposed by Senator Feinstein \non pages 5 and 6.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your request for \n     the Administration's views on various proposed amendments to \n     S. 113, a bill that would amend the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit electronic surveillance \n     and physical searches of so-called ``lone wolf'' \n     international terrorists--i.e., non-United States persons who \n     engage in international terrorism or activities in \n     preparation therefor without any demonstrable affiliation \n     with an international terrorist group or other foreign power. \n     On March 5, 2003, the Administration sent a letter indicating \n     its support for S. 113 (copy attached). The Administration, \n     however, is greatly concerned that this important FISA \n     amendment would be subject to a sunset provision included in \n     the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. The Administration opposes the \n     sunset language, and looks forward to working with Congress \n     to ensure that this FISA amendment and those other portions \n     of the USA PATRIOT Act subject to the sunset provision are \n     addressed at the appropriate time. For reasons set forth \n     below, we oppose the proposed amendments to S. 113. In \n     particular, the Administration is concerned that the proposed \n     amendments would weaken the FISA as an important instrument \n     in the arsenal of the United States Government in combating \n     terrorism and the espionage activities of foreign powers.\n       Authority of the FISC and FISCR. The first proposed \n     amendment to S. 113, entitled ``Sec. 2. Additional \n     Improvements to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978,'' would add a provision to 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1803 to grant \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (``FISC'') \n     authority to ``establish such rules and procedures, and take \n     such actions, as are reasonably necessary to administer their \n     responsibilities under this Act.'' The Administration opposes \n     this grant of authority to a court that has an extremely \n     limited statutory function of approving or disapproving \n     applications made by the Government of orders with respect to \n     electronic surveillance and search. Granting rulemaking \n     authority by statute to the FISC and the FISCR--courts that \n     operate in secret and that are of\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\n     very limited jurisdiction that is specified in detail in the \n     FISA--is inappropriate.\n       Reporting Requirements. A second group of related \n     amendments would require additional reporting concerning the \n     use of FISA. Each is objectionable for reasons discussed \n     below.\n       a. The first reporting amendment would require public \n     disclosure of the number of United States persons targeted \n     under various provisions of FISA. Under current law, the \n     Department publicly reports the annual aggregate number of \n     FISA searches and surveillances, but does not disclose \n     publicly how many of those searches and surveillances \n     involved United States persons. See 50 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1807, \n     1826. The proposal also would require public disclosure of \n     the number of times the Attorney General authorized the use \n     of FISA information in a criminal proceeding--a statistic \n     that currently is reported to the Intelligence Committees as \n     part of a longstanding, carefully constructed, and balanced \n     accommodation between the Executive and Legislative branches \n     and in accordance with the FISA itself. See 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1808(a)(2)(A). Finally, the provision would require \n     disclosure of portions of FISA pleadings and orders that deal \n     with significant questions of law (not including discussion \n     of facts) ``in a manner consistent with the protection of the \n     national security of the United States.'' Each of these three \n     reporting requirements is addressed below.\n       We oppose a requirement to disclose publicly the number of \n     FISA targets that are United States persons. Congress has in \n     the past considered and rejected proposals to require \n     disclosure of this information to the general public rather \n     than to the Intelligence Committees. In 1984, the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence was ``asked by the American \n     Civil Liberties Union to consider making public the number of \n     U.S. persons who have been FISA surveillance targets.'' S. \n     Rep. No. 98-660, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 25 (1984). The \n     Committee rejected that proposal because ``the benefits of \n     such disclosure for public understanding of FISA's impact \n     would [not] outweigh the damage to FBI foreign \n     counterintelligence capabilities that can reasonably by \n     expected to result.'' Ibid. As the Committee explained, \n     ``[a]ny specific or approximate figure would provide \n     significant information about the extent of the FBI's \n     knowledge of the existence of hostile foreign intelligence \n     agents in this country. As in other areas of intelligence \n     oversight, the Committee must attempt to strike a proper \n     balance between the need for public accountability and the \n     secrecy required for effective intelligence operations.'' \n     Ibid. This analysis is at least as applicable to foreign \n     terrorist organizations today as for foreign intelligence \n     organizations and the Administration continues to support the \n     balance that was struck in 1978 and reaffirmed in 1984.\n       We also oppose a requirement to disclose publicly the \n     number of times the Attorney General has authorized the \n     disclosure of FISA information for law enforcement purposes. \n     This provision is problematic primarily because it is not \n     confined to cases in which FISA information is actually used \n     in a proceeding. Revealing the number of Attorney General \n     authorizations for such use--as opposed to the use itself--is \n     troubling because that information could involve \n     classified and non-public matters with ongoing operational \n     significance--e.g., an investigation that has not yet \n     resulted in a public indictment or trial, or in which no \n     indictment or trial ever will occur. Thus, these numbers \n     potentially could reveal information about the \n     Department's classified, operational efforts to protect \n     against the activities of foreign spies and terrorists.\n       Finally, we believe that the disclosure of FISA pleadings \n     and orders that deal with significant questions of law is \n     inherently inconsistent with ``the protection of the national \n     security of the United States.'' Virtually the entirety of \n     each application to the FISC discusses the facts, techniques, \n     or pleading of highly classified FISA operations. As we noted \n     in our letter of August 6, 2002, on predecessor legislation \n     in the 107th Congress, ``[a]n interpretation by the FISC of \n     the applicability of FISA to a technique or circumstance, no \n     matter how conceptually drawn, could provide our adversaries \n     with clues to relative safe harbors from the reach of FISA.'' \n     A copy of our earlier letter is attached for your \n     convenience.\n       b. A separate but similar proposal, entitled ``Sec. 2. \n     Public Reporting Requirements Under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978'' and proposed by Senator Feingold, \n     also would impose public reporting obligations. Instead of \n     requiring the Department to report the number of FISA targets \n     who are United States persons, it would require reporting of \n     the number who are not United States persons, broken out by \n     the type of FISA activity involved--e.g., electronic \n     surveillance and physical search. This proposal also would \n     require the Department to identify individuals who ``acted \n     wholly alone.'' Like the proposal discussed above, this \n     proposal would require the Department to report the number of \n     times the Attorney General authorized the use of FISA \n     information in a criminal proceeding, and portions of FISA \n     pleadings and orders that deal with significant questions of \n     law ``in a manner consistent with the protection of the \n     national security of the United States.'' The objections set \n     forth above apply equally to this proposal.\n       c. Finally, a very recent reporting proposal, also proposed \n     by Senator Feingold, would require an annual report on FISA \n     to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. The report \n     would include the classified statistical information \n     described above--including numbers of non-U.S. persons \n     targeted under each major provision of FISA--and would also \n     require submission of portions of FISA pleadings and court \n     orders. For reasons stated above and in our letter of August \n     6, 2002, we continue to oppose any requirement to submit \n     portions of FISA pleadings and orders. More broadly, we \n     strongly oppose the amendment because it threatens to upset \n     the delicate balance between the Executive and Legislative \n     Branches of government in the area of intelligence and \n     intelligence-related oversight and reporting.\n       The FISA statute prescribes the types of information that \n     must routinely be provided to the Judiciary Committees. Under \n     current law, the Department of Justice provides to the \n     Judiciary Committees and makes public ``the total number of \n     applications made for orders and extensions of orders'' \n     approving electronic surveillance and physical searches \n     under FISA, and ``the total number of such orders and \n     extensions either granted, modified, or denied.'' 50 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1807; see 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1826; 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1846 (similar reporting requirement for numbers of \n     pen-trap applications and orders); 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1862 \n     (similar reporting requirement for numbers of applications \n     and orders for tangible things). The Department has, of \n     course, consistently met these statutory requirements.\n       The FISA reporting obligations concerning the Intelligence \n     Committees are much broader. Under 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1808, the \n     Attorney General must ``fully inform'' the House and Senate \n     Intelligence Committees ``concerning all electronic \n     surveillance'' conducted under FISA, and under 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1826 he must do so ``concerning all physical searches'' \n     conducted under the statute. In keeping with this standard, \n     the Department submits extremely lengthy and detailed semi-\n     annual reports to the Intelligence Committees, including \n     specific information on ``each criminal case in which \n     information acquired [from a FISA electronic surveillance] \n     has been authorized for use at trial,'' 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1808(a)(2)(B), and ``the number of physical searches \n     which involved searches of the residences, offices, or \n     personal property of United States persons,'' 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1826(3). The reports also review significant legal and \n     operational developments that have occurred during the \n     previous six months. These classified reports are \n     painstakingly prepared in the Justice Department and are \n     obviously, from the questions and comments they generate, \n     closely scrutinized by the Intelligence Committees. See \n     generally S. Res. No. 400, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976); H.R. \n     Res. No. 658, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977).\n       The ``fully inform'' standard that governs Intelligence \n     Committee oversight of FISA is the same standard that governs \n     Congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community in \n     general. See S. Rep. No. 95-604, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 60-61 \n     (1977); S. Rep. No. 95-701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 67-68 \n     (1978); see also H.R. Rep. No. 95-1283, Pt. 1, 95th Cong., 2d \n     Sess. 96 (1978). The requirement to ``fully inform'' the \n     Intelligence Committees, rather than Congress as a whole, is \n     consistent with the long-standing legal framework and \n     historical practice for Intelligence Community reporting to, \n     and oversight by, Congress on matters relating to \n     intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     United States government. Consistent with the President's \n     constitutional authority to protect national security \n     information, Congress and the President established reporting \n     and oversight procedures that balance Congress' oversight \n     responsibility with the need to restrict access to sensitive \n     information regarding intelligence sources and methods. The \n     delicate compromise--embodied in FISA and more generally in \n     Title V of the National Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 413-415, and based on the preexisting practice of \n     providing only the intelligence committees with sensitive \n     information regarding intelligence operations--established \n     procedures for keeping Congress ``fully and currently \n     informed'' of intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities. Under these procedures, the Intelligence \n     Community provides general, substantive, and, often, \n     classified finished intelligence information to several \n     committees of Congress, but generally provides classified \n     operational information only to the Intelligence committees. \n     Even with regard to the Intelligence Committees, the Director \n     of Central Intelligence and the heads of other intelligence \n     agencies are, under Title V, to provide such information only \n     ``to the extent consistent with due regard for the protection \n     from unauthorized disclosure of classified information \n     relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods or \n     other exceptionally sensitive matters. 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 413a(a), 413b(b).\n       Senator Feingold's reporting proposals would, in sum, \n     distort and damage the effective, longstanding accommodation \n     between the President and Congress, and between the \n     Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, over the handling of \n     classified operational intelligence information within \n     Congress. It is noteworthy that the current leadership of \n     both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have expressed \n     their approval of the existing accommodation. In a press \n     release dated October 17, 2002, the Chairman of the House \n     Judiciary Committee stated that the existing accommodation \n     provides for ``reasonable, limited access, subject to \n     appropriate security procedures, to FISA information through \n     [the House Intelligence Committee].'' In addition, your \n     letter of February 27, 2003, to Senators Leahy, Grassley\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\n     and Specter on FISA matters stated that the existing \n     congressional oversight standards relating to FISA reflect a \n     ``careful balance between the need for meaningful oversight \n     and the need for secrecy and information security in the \n     government's efforts to protect this country from foreign \n     enemies.'' Moreover, you stated that your years of service on \n     both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence have led you to conclude that the \n     existing accommodation allows Congress to exercise \n     ``appropriate, vigorous, robust and detailed oversight of the \n     FISA process.''\n       Reporting on National Security Letters. The next proposed \n     amendment to S. 113, entitled ``Sec. 3. Improvement of \n     Congressional Oversight of Surveillance Activities,'' would \n     require additional reporting specifically addressing the use \n     of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2709(e) in the context of requests made to \n     schools and public libraries. We are concerned that a \n     reporting requirement at this level of formality and \n     specificity would unduly increase the risk of public exposure \n     of the information, thereby jeopardizing our \n     counterintelligence and counterterrorism efforts.\n       Presumption. Another proposal is presumably intended as a \n     substitute for S. 113 and would create a ``presumption that \n     certain non-United States persons engaging in international \n     terrorism are agents of foreign powers for purposes of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.'' Under the \n     proposal, the FISC would be instructed that it ``may \n     presume'' that a non-United States person engaged in \n     international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor \n     ``is an agent of a foreign power'' as defined in FISA.\n       By providing that the FISC ``may presume'' the target is \n     acting for or on behalf of an international terrorist group, \n     the proposal would confer discretion on the FISC without any \n     standards to guide the exercise of that discretion. \n     Accordingly, the effect of the proposal is uncertain. It is \n     conceivable that the FISC (or a reviewing court) would \n     indulge the presumption only where the Government had \n     established probable cause or something near to probable \n     cause that the target in fact was working for or on behalf of \n     a terrorist group. In that event, the proposal would be \n     useless or nearly useless. The unpredictability inherent in \n     the proposal also would significantly reduce its value even \n     if, in the end, the FISC and later courts interpreted it more \n     expansively in any particular case.\n       Nor do we believe that there is a reason to use a \n     presumption--even a mandatory presumption--instead of the \n     straightforward approach of S. 113 itself. In particular, we \n     see no constitutional benefit likely to arise from the use of \n     a presumption. Our letter of July 31, 2002 (copy attached), \n     which explained the constitutionality of an earlier version \n     of S. 113 (which would have made a lone-wolf terrorist a \n     ``foreign power'' rather than an ``agent of a foreign \n     power'') applies equally to the current version of S. 113. We \n     do not believe that the use of a presumption significantly \n     changes the constitutional analysis, nor adds any significant \n     protection to civil liberties, except to the extent that the \n     presumption is read narrowly to mirror current law, in which \n     case the presumption is of little or no value for reasons \n     explained in the previous paragraph.\n       Discovery. The next proposal would change the standards \n     governing discovery of FISA materials in suppression \n     litigation arising from the use of FISA information in a \n     legal proceeding such as a criminal trial. We strongly object \n     to this proposal. The proposal could harm the national \n     security by inhibiting cooperation between intelligence and \n     law enforcement efforts to stop foreign spies and terrorists. \n     It could deter the Government from using information obtained \n     or derived from FISA in any proceeding--civil, criminal, \n     immigration, administrative, or even internal Executive \n     branch proceedings. These overwhelming and potentially \n     catastrophic costs would be incurred for very little benefit, \n     because current law amply protects individual rights.\n       It may be helpful to begin by reviewing current law in this \n     area and the ways in which it protects individual rights. \n     Currently, FISA requires high-level approval from the \n     Executive and Judicial branches before the Government \n     conducts a search or surveillance. Each FISA application must \n     contain a certification signed individually and personally by \n     the Director of the FBI (or another high-ranking official \n     accountable to the President) and must be individually and \n     personally approved by the Attorney General or the Deputy \n     Attorney General. 50 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1804(a), 1823(a), \n     1801(g). Under the statute, the Government must apply to a \n     judge of the FISC for approval before conducting electronic \n     surveillance or physical searches of foreign powers or agents \n     of foreign powers inside the United States. 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1804-1805 (electronic surveillance), 1823-1824 \n     (physical searches). Judges of the FISC are selected by the \n     Chief Justice from among the judges on United States District \n     Courts, who as United States district judges are protected \n     by Article III of the Constitution. 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1803(a), 1822(c).\n       A second round of judicial review occurs before the \n     Government may use FISA information in any proceeding. The \n     Government must provide notice to the FISA target or other \n     person whose communications were intercepted or whose \n     property was searched before using any information obtained \n     or derived from the surveillance or search in any proceeding \n     against that person ``before any court, department, officer, \n     agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United \n     States.'' 50 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1806(c), 1825(d). After \n     receiving notice, the person may file a motion to suppress in \n     a United States District Court and may seek discovery of the \n     FISA applications filed by the Government and the \n     authorization orders issued by the FISC. 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1806(e)-(f), 1825(f)(g). Discovery may be granted \n     freely unless the Attorney General personally files an \n     affidavit under oath asserting that discovery would harm the \n     national security. If the Attorney General files such an \n     affidavit, as he has in every case litigated to date, the \n     district judge must review the FISA application and order in \n     camera, without granting discovery, unless ``disclosure is \n     necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality'' \n     of the search or surveillance. 50 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1806(f), \n     1825(g). If discovery is granted, the court must impose \n     ``appropriate security procedures and protective orders.'' \n     Ibid. No court has ever ordered disclosure.\n       Congress established this standard for discovery after \n     extensive and careful deliberation in 1978. See H.R. Rep. No. \n     1283, Part I, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1978) (hereinafter \n     House Report); S. Rep. No. 604, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 57-59 \n     (1977) (hereinafter Senate Judiciary Report); S. Rep. No. \n     701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 62-65 (1978) (hereinafter Senate \n     Intelligence Report). As the 1978 conference report on FISA \n     explains, ``an in camera and ex parte proceeding is \n     appropriate for determining the lawfulness of electronic \n     surveillance in both criminal and civil cases . . . [and] the \n     standard for disclosure . . . adequately protects the rights \n     of the aggrieved person.'' H.R. Rep. No. 1720, 95th Cong., 2d \n     Sess. 32 (1978) (hereinafter Conference Report). As the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee explained in 1978: ``The Committee \n     views the procedures set forth in this subsection as striking \n     a reasonable balance between an entirely in camera proceeding \n     which might adversely affect the defendants's ability to \n     defend himself, and mandatory disclosure, which might \n     occasionally result in the wholesale revelation of sensitive \n     foreign intelligence information.'' Senate Judiciary Report \n     at 58.\n       The proposal would replace FISA's current standard with a \n     new one under which discovery is required unless it ``would \n     not assist in determining any legal or factual issue'' in the \n     litigation. The ``would not assist'' standard is \n     inappropriate for use in FISA, in particular, because it is \n     lower than the standard for disclosure of informants' names \n     in ordinary criminal cases. That standard at least requires a \n     balancing of the public interest in confidentiality against \n     the individual defendant's interest in disclosure. As the \n     Supreme Court explained in McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, \n     311 (1967), extending its earlier decision in Roviaro v. \n     United States, 353 U.S. 53, 60-61 (1957), ``this Court was \n     unwilling to impose any absolute rule requiring disclosure of \n     an informer's identity even in formulating evidentiary rules \n     for federal criminal trials [in Roviaro]. Much less has the \n     Court ever approached the formulation of a federal \n     evidentiary rule of compulsory disclosure where the issue \n     is the preliminary one of probable cause.'' Indeed, the \n     ``would not assist'' standard is lower even than the \n     standards that govem various civil privileges, all of \n     which require some kind of balancing of the interests in \n     disclosure against the interests in confidentiality. See, \n     e.g., In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 738 (D.C. Cir. \n     1997). In effect, the ``would not assist''' standard is \n     the appropriate standard for discovery of unclassified and \n     non-privileged information, because no discovery of any \n     kind is justified unless it would assist the litigation.\n       The ``would not assist'' standard could have very dangerous \n     consequences for the national security. At the outset, we are \n     concerned that the standard could lead to discovery being \n     granted in nearly every case, because it is extremely hard to \n     prove the negative fact that disclosure ``would not assist'' \n     in any way. Such routine disclosure could be catastrophic: \n     FISC applications contain some of the Government's most \n     sensitive national security information, including \n     information concerning human intelligence sources, \n     sophisticated technical collection methods, and the details \n     of ongoing investigations. Given the enormous sensitivity of \n     that information and the details of ongoing investigations. \n     Given the enormous sensitivity of that information, when the \n     Attorney General personally files an affidavit under oath \n     asserting that disclosure would harm the national security, \n     ordering disclosure unless it ``would not assist'' in any way \n     is inappropriate. In view of the protections in FISC and the \n     requirement of an affidavit filed personally by the Attorney \n     General, the ``necessary'' standard of current law should be \n     retained.\n       Indeed, precisely because it may lead to discovery in \n     virtually every case, the proposal would create an incentive \n     for the Government to withhold sensitive information from its \n     FISC applications. Under the ``would not assist'' standard, \n     the Government might have to choose between excluding \n     sensitive information from an application and risking a \n     denial of search and surveillance authority from the FISC, or \n     including the sensitive information and risking public \n     disclosure of that information. Thus, the proposal could \n     fundamentally alter the relationship between the Government \n     and the FISC and could eviscerate the significance of the \n     FISC's careful information security procedures, which are \n     designed to give the Government confidence that full \n     disclosure to the FISC will not result in a compromise of \n     sensitive information.\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\n       Since the Government can never completely sanitize a FISC \n     application, the ``would not assist'' standard would also \n     create strong incentives to avoid suppression litigation and \n     the expanded risk of discovery. That means the Government \n     would lean away from prosecution of a FISC target, even where \n     that was the best way to protect the country. It would \n     thereby reduce the Government's ability to keep the country \n     safe, distorting the vital tactical judgments that must be \n     made. Indeed, the proposal would inhibit more than just \n     prosecutions. In keeping with the scope of FISC's suppression \n     remedy, the proposal would limit the use of FISC information \n     in any proceeding, including immigration proceedings, or even \n     in intemal adjudications of security clearances under \n     Executive Order 12968. Here again the Government would face a \n     difficult choice between using FISC information to protect \n     national security and risking disclosure of the information \n     as the cost of doing so.\n       We appreciate your continuing leadership in ensuring that \n     the Department of Justice and other Federal agencies have the \n     authority they need to combat terrorism effectively. Please \n     do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     us that from the perspective of the Administration's program, \n     there is no objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jamie E. Brown,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Feinstein's \namendment. While I appreciate the efforts by Senator Feinstein to draft \na fix to the lone wolf terrorist problem under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978, referred to as ``FISA'', the amendment simply \nwill not do the job and will continue to expose our country to great \nnational security risks. I will not and cannot accept such risks.\n  Let me be more specific as to my concerns. First, as drafted, the \namendment would create only a permissive presumption to authorize a \ncourt to approve a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, ``FISA'', \napplication when presented with a lone wolf situation. As drafted, the \nproposal would provide only that the court ``may'' find the existence \nof a ``presumption'' that a non-U.S. person engaged in sabotage or \ninternational terrorism is an agent of a foreign power under FISA.\n  A permissive presumption creates a significant risk that the FISA \ncourt may not be authorized--or may feel constrained to exercise its \ndiscretion--to approve a FISA application when presented with a lone \nwolf terrorist who would otherwise be covered by the Kyl-Schumer-Biden-\nDeWine approach.\n  Second, the amendment does not clearly delineate how a permissive \npresumption would be applied by the FISA court. Assuming that the FISA \ncourt exercises its discretion and makes a finding that the presumption \napplies, the FISA court would then have to consider additional evidence \nin order to grant the application.\n  The amendment does not specify beyond the permissive presumption what \nspecific evidence or what other findings would have to be made in order \nfor the FISA court to approve the application.\n  In sum, by injecting a significant level of uncertainty into the FISA \nprocess, the amendment simply creates or even exacerbates the problem \nwhich it is intended to fix. We simply cannot take such a risk given \nthe potential devastating consequences posed by the lone wolf \nterrorist.\n  I would note here that in a letter dated April 30, 2003, the \nadministration opposed this proposal, citing the fact that the effect \nof the proposal was unclear and that the proposal did not provide any \nstandards to the FISA court to guide the exercise or its discretion.\n  In contrast, the Kyl-Schumer-Biden-DeWine proposal creates clear \ndefinitions and would minimize uncertainty in an area where ambiguity \ncould have devastating consequences--that is, where we are in danger of \na terrorist attack by a lone wolf.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the Feinstein amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the proponents of the bill urge our \ncolleagues to vote against the Feinstein amendment. And from our \nperspective, I think we are ready to have that vote.\n  I ask Senator Feinstein if she is ready, as well?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair, I think we can yield back the \nremainder of our time, I say to the Senator, and hold the vote, if \neverybody so desires.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time on both \nthe amendment and on the bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 537.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support final passage of S. \n113, a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, \nto provide needed tools to detect and combat terrorists bent on \nattacking this Nation and killing our citizens. First, let me commend \nmy colleagues, Senators Kyl and Schumer, for their relentless efforts \nin bringing this important issue to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Since \nthe tragic events of September 11, all of us have tried to turn a \ncritical eye toward our laws and the workings of government to discern \nhow we might avert such a dreadful attack in the future. That attempt \nto fix what may be wrong with our existing system of intelligence-\ngathering and law enforcement is perhaps the greatest tribute we can \noffer to the victims of that fateful day and their families.\n  This bill, as amended, is a good example of how we can make basic, \ncommon-sense changes to existing law that will have a tremendous impact \non our fight against terrorism. I was proud to be one of the authors of \nFISA in 1978. We worked long and hard to strike the right balance \nbetween protecting civil liberties on the one hand and deterring \nterrorist acts on the other. Since FISA permits the physical and \nelectronic surveillance of suspected foreign agents, in some instances \nunder a more generous standard than that allowed in Title III \nsurveillances, an amendment to FISA should be carefully tailored to \nmaintain its careful balance. I do not take lightly amending FISA, but \nbelieve that this bill does so in a manner that is both constitutional \nand narrowly tailored.\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n  I want to thank the sponsors of this legislation for their \nwillingness to work with me to improve their original bill. I proposed \ntwo amendments, both of which were accepted by Senators Kyl and \nSchumer--and which the Judiciary Committee adopted without a dissenting \nvote on April 29, 2003. I believe my amendments improve S. 113 in three \nways:\n  First, the original legislation--which would have amended FISA to \nexpand the definition of ``foreign power'' under 50 U.S.C. \nSec. 1801(a)(4) to include non-U.S. persons who are engaged in \ninternational terrorism--would have allowed the government to extend \nthe initial surveillance order for a period up to 1 year. The 1-year \nperiod constitutes the maximum period allowed under the statute and is \nonly invoked under certain circumstances typically limited to groups \nand entities. More commonly, an order to conduct surveillance of \nindividuals is only extended for a period up to 90 days. Instead, the \namendment we offered on April 29, 2003, amended the definition for \n``agent of a foreign power'' by creating a new 50 U.S.C. \nSec. 1801(b)(1)(C). This amendment would apply the default 90-day \nperiod to this new category of surveillance targets, which is far more \nsensible and consistent with the way we treat other individual targets, \nas opposed to groups, under the statute.\n  Second, by amending 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1801(a), the original legislation \nwould have precluded individuals who are improperly subjected to \nsurveillance or about whom surveillance information has been \ninappropriately disclosed from filing suit. My amendment, on the other \nhand, allowed aggrieved individuals who are improperly targeted under \nthis new provision to seek redress in the courts and, where \nappropriate, recover damages. This modification to Senator Kyl's \noriginal bill is consistent with the typical and intended treatment of \nindividuals under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1801(b). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-1283, at \npt. 1, 98 (1978) (noting that the only aggrieved persons ``barred from \nthe civil remedy will be primarily those persons who are themselves \nimmune from criminal or civil liability because of their diplomatic \nstatus'').\n  Third, my amendment added a sunset provision to the legislation, \nforcing Congress to re-visit this issue no later than December 31, \n2005. The USA Patriot Act (which the Senate overwhelmingly passed a \nyear and a half ago) includes a similar sunset provision for the FISA \nprovisions contained therein. My amendment simply insures that this \nbody will reevaluate the FISA measure on which we are voting today, in \nthe context of its broader re-consideration of those other FISA \nprovisions. Such a review is consistent with our oversight function \nand, plainly put, ensures that our actions are thoughtful and informed.\n  Again, I am pleased that Senators Kyl and Schumer accepted these \nimportant revisions to the original text and, on that basis, am happy \nto support the amended bill that is before the Senate today.\n  I also would like to commend my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for her \nefforts to engage this issue responsibly and thoughtfully. She has \nproposed an alternative, which makes an important contribution to the \ndebate but with which I happen to disagree, for several reasons.\n  First, my good friend from California asserts that criminal \nprosecutors will abuse the FISA process by securing FISA surveillance--\nwith its lower burdens of proof--against garden variety criminal \ntargets, rather than pursuant to Title III. I am simply not persuaded \nthat this will be the case. It should be noted that the new section \ncreated in this bill has a very high standard, higher indeed than that \nrequired by Title III. That is, the government must show probable cause \nthat the FISA target has engaged in acts of ``international \nterrorism,'' which the statute defines as acts which (i) are a \nviolation of the criminal law under the laws of the United States or \nany state; (ii) appear intended to influence our government or \nintimidate our citizens; and (iii) which occur outside the United \nStates or transcend national boundaries. Thus, I doubt that a \nprosecutor would ever be able to seek a FISA warrant under this section \nwhere he would not also be able to obtain a Title III warrant. Morever, \nI am not convinced that a prosecutor would seek a FISA warrant where \ntheir real interest is, not obtaining foreign intelligence information, \nbut rather the eventual prosecution of the FISA target. Given the \nstrict exclusionary rules FISA imposes, prosecutors would be loathe to \never seek a FISA warrant for a target they seek to prosecute out of \nfear that the judge would suppress the surveillance in a criminal \nprosecution which was improperly ``boot-strapped'' from a FISA \ninvestigation.\n  Second, the Feinstein amendment asserts that, under the Kyl-Schumer \nbill, a judge would be a mere ``rubber-stamp'' for a governmental \nrequest for a FISA warrant. The amendment presumes that judges do not \nnow have discretion to refuse the government's request, which is not \ntrue. Under current law, the judge still must determine that probable \ncause exists that the individual is an agent of a foreign power engaged \nin, or in preparation for, acts of international terrorism. S. 113 does \nnothing to alter that existing requirement. Rather, it makes it clear \nthat any non-U.S. citizen who engages in terrorism or is preparing to \nengage in terrorism would fall within the definition of an ``agent of a \nforeign power.'' Nothing in this bill would curtail a judge's ability \nto second-guess, or look behind, the assertions advanced by the \ngovernment in its application for a warrant. If there is no basis to \nbelieve that probable cause exists, the application would be properly \ndenied. Indeed, we rely on judges for this very purpose--namely, to \nascertain the veracity of the facts presented by the government.\n  As opposed to clarifying the definition of ``agent of a foreign \npower,'' as the Kyl-Schumer bill does, the Feinstein amendment would \nallow--but not require--a judge to ``presume'' that an individual is \nsuch an agent, which in my view creates a difference without a real \ndistinction. Rather than afford individual targets any added \nprotections, the Feinstein amendment would inject a considerable amount \nof murkiness into an otherwise certain process and may result in \ninconsistent rulings by different judges. Likewise, FISA judges may \nsimply decline to apply the presumption in cases where the government \ncannot show much, if any, link between the non-U.S. citizen and a \nforeign power. There has been considerable disagreement over whether \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation had sufficient evidence to show \nthat Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called ``20th Hijacker,'' was an agent \nof a foreign power. Yet, I am concerned that a FISA judge might decline \nto exercise the ``permissive presumption'' in Senator Feinstein's \namendment, and hence deny a FISA warrant, in the case of a true ``lone-\nwolf'' terrorist who cannot be shown to have any links to a foreign \npower. As such, the FISA ``loophole'' S. 113 seeks to close would be \nleft open. On that basis, I am forced to vote against the amendment.\n  That is not to say, however, that there is not much more work to be \ndone in this area. We must search for creative ways to give \ninvestigators the tools they need to gather information and seek out \nterrorists living among us, while at the same time vigilantly protect \nimportant civil rights and liberties. Toward that end, I welcome the \noversight hearings that my friend Senator Hatch, chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, has pledged to convene on the implementation of \nFISA and offer my continued service.\n  It is my hope that the Senate's action today will assist our \ngovernment in its effort to detect and root out foreign terrorists bent \non violent acts against this great country. I support this bill and \nurge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend Senators Kyl, Schumer, Biden and \nDeWine for their bipartisan cooperation in supporting S. 113. This bill \nwill provide a critical tool needed by law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies to fight the war against terrorism. Specifically, S. 113 will \naddress a glaring omission in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nof 1978 referred to as FISA, to authorize the gathering of foreign \nintelligence information relating to a lone-wolf terrorist, that is, a \nnon-U.S. person who is engaged in international terrorism or \npreparation thereof. In recognition of the critical need to support law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies in\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nthe war against terrorism, the Judiciary Committee passed S. 113 by a \nbipartisan, unanimous vote of 19 to 0.\n  This bipartisan proposal will enhance the ability of the FBI and \nintelligence agencies to investigate, detect, and prevent terrorists \nfrom carrying out devastating attacks on our country. Specifically, S. \n113 will amend the Foreign Intelligence Survelliance Act to include \nlone-wolf terrorists who engage in international terrorism or \nactivities in preparation thereof without a showing of membership in or \naffiliation with an international terrorist group. A significant gap in \nthe current statute exists with respect to application of the foreign \npower requirement to lone-wolf terrorists. S. 113 would authorize FISA \nsurveillance or searches when law enforcement and intelligence agents \nidentify an individual involved in international terrorism but cannot \nlink the terrorist to a specific group.\n  The administration strongly supports amending FISA to include non-\nU.S. lone-wolf terrorists. On March 4, 2003, at a Judiciary Committee \nhearing examining the war on terrorism, both Attorney General Ashcroft \nand FBI Director Mueller indicated their strong support for fixing this \nglaring omission in the FISA statute. In fact, Director Mueller \ntestified, both before the Judiciary Committee and previously before \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, there is an increasing \nthreat of lone extremists who have the motive and ability to carry out \ndevastating attacks against our country.\n  We need to provide law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the \ntools needed to protect our country from deadly terrorist attacks. With \nour recent success in the war against Iraq, the risk of terrorist \nattacks against our country may well rise. We need to ensure that our \ncountry has the ability to investigate and prevent such attacks if \ncarried out by a lone extremist.\n  While some interest groups that oppose this measure suggest that such \na fix is not needed or claim that the FBI failed to properly apply the \nlaw in the Moussaoui investigation, that is simply beside the point: \nThe September 11 attack against our country highlighted the need to \nfill in this gap in the FISA statute.\n  FISA provides that electronic surveillance or physical searches may \nbe authorized when there is probable cause to believe that the target \nis either an agent of, or is himself, a ``foreign power''--a term that \nis currently defined to include only foreign government or \ninternational terrorist organizations. Requiring a link to government \nor international terrorist organizations may have made sense when FISA \nwas enacted in 1978; in that year, the typical FISA target was a Soviet \nspy or a member of one of the hierarchical, military-style terror \ngroups of that era.\n  Today the United States faces a much different threat. We are \nprincipally confronted not by specific groups or governments, but by a \nmovement of Islamist extremists which does not maintain a fixed \nstructure or membership list, and its adherents do not always advertise \ntheir affiliation with this cause. Moreover, in response to our \ncountry's efforts to fight terrorism worldwide, terrorists are \nincreasingly operating in a more decentralized manner, far different \nfrom the terrorist threat that existed in 1978. The threat posed by a \nlone terrorist may be very real and may involve devastating \nconsequences, even beyond those suffered by our country on September \n11. Given this increasing threat, we have to ensure that intelligence \nand law enforcement agencies have sufficient tools to meet this new--\nand even more dangerous--challenge.\n  While I support S. 113, as passed by the Judiciary Committee, I wish \nto note my concerns about the amendment offered by Senator Feingold, \nwhich has been agreed to, as part of consideration of this matter.\n  The Feingold amendment would impose new FISA reporting requirements \non the Justice Department, and require: (1) reports on the number of \nU.S. persons targeted by FISA order, by specific categories of \nsurveillance, for example, electronic surveillance, physical searches, \npen registers, and access to records; (2) identification of individuals \nwho ``acted wholly alone;'' (3) disclosure of the number of times FISA \nmaterial was used in a criminal proceeding; and (4) disclosure of \nportions of FISA pleadings and orders that deal with significant \nquestions of law ``in a manner consistent with the protection of the \nnational security of the United States.''\n  As I have indicated on other occasions, I support reporting \nrequirements when necessary for Congress to exercise responsible \noversight. We have a duty to conduct meaningful oversight of the FISA \nprocess, and I am committed to such oversight and ensuring proper \nreporting requirements are imposed on the Justice Department.\n  My concern with the Feingold amendment is that the operation of the \namendment is unclear and may create confusion rather than bringing \nclarity to the issue. I would have preferred that we conduct a more \ndeliberate examination of this issue to ensure that the reporting \nrequirements are not harmful and will not create any significant risk \nof harm to sensitive law enforcement and intelligence operations \nagainst terrorists.\n  More significantly, I am concerned that the Feingold amendment will \nalter well-established procedures for Congress's review and handling of \nclassified operational intelligence information, in contrast to \nCongress's review and handling of ``finished'' intelligence \ninformation. For many years, and in fact the reason for the creation of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was to establish a \nprofessional, dedicated Intelligence Committee staff which would handle \nsensitive operational intelligence information. Congress did so to \nminimize the potential risk of harm to foreign counterintelligence \noperations. The accidental or inadvertent disclosure of such material \ncould have a devastating impact on extremely sensitive CIA or FBI \ncounterintelligence operations.\n  Further, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence rejected a \nsimilar reporting proposal in 1984 because ``the benefits of such \ndisclosure for public understanding of FISA's impact would not outweigh \nthe damage to FBI foreign counterintelligence capabilities that can be \nreasonably expected to result.''\n  The FISA statute already sets forth detailed and specific \nrequirements for the reporting of information to the Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees, and there is simply no need to disrupt long-\nestablished processes and procedures for FISA reporting between the \nexecutive branch and the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees relating \nto the handling of classified operations intelligence information.\n  While I have these concerns about the Feingold amendment, on balance, \nI believe that fixing the FISA statue to address the long-wolf \nterrorist problem is more important than remedying the deficiencies in \nthe Feingold amendment. The potential harm to our country from a lone-\nwolf terrorist attack is significant and we must act--and act now by \npassing A. 113.\n  Again, I commend Senators Kyl, Schumer, Biden, and DeWine for this \nimportant piece of legislation which reflects our bipartisan commitment \nto ensuring the safety of our country and the need to be vigilant in \nprotecting our country from deadly and devastating terrorist attacks. I \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 113.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

ROBERTS, JR., OF MARYLAND, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of John \nRoberts, to be a circuit judge for the DC Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering the \nnomination of John Roberts, who has been nominated by President Bush to \nserve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia.\n  Mr. Roberts was first nominated to this post by President George H.W. \nBush in 1992. He has been nominated for this post by two different \nPresidents on three separate occasions, and has waited more than 11 \nyears for his confirmation, so I am glad to see that this day has \nfinally come when we can expect a vote by the full Senate on his \nnomination.\n  Mr. Roberts has exceptional experience as a Supreme Court and \nappellate advocate. He has argued an astounding 39 cases before the \nSupreme Court and has argued in every Federal circuit court of appeals. \nHis Supreme Court practice consists of seeking and opposing Supreme \nCourt review, preparing amicus curiae briefs, and helping to prepare \nother counsel to argue before the Court. His clients have included \nlarge and small corporations, trade organizations, nonprofit \norganizations, States, and individuals.\n  Mr. Roberts is one of the most accomplished and brilliant legal minds \nthat I have seen in my 27 years as a member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Not surprisingly, the ABA awarded him its highest possible \nrating of unanimously well-qualified. He is widely regarded as one of \nthe best appellate attorneys of his generation. After reviewing his \nlegal accomplishments it is easy to see why his colleagues have such \nrespect and admiration for him. I would like to read excerpts from a \nfew of the many letters his colleagues have sent the committee \ndiscussing his professionalism, character, and open-mindedness.\n  The first letter is from 156 members of the Bar of the District of \nColumbia, including such legal powerhouses as Boyden Gray, who was \ncounsel to the first President Bush, and Lloyd Cutler, who was counsel \nto President Carter and Clinton. The letter states:\n\n       Although, as individuals, we reflect a wide spectrum of \n     political party affiliation and ideology, we are united in \n     our belief that John Roberts will be an outstanding federal \n     court of appeals judge and should be confirmed by the United \n     States Senate. He is one of the very best and most highly \n     respected appellate lawyers in the nation, with a deserved \n     reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate. He is \n     also a wonderful professional colleague both because of his \n     enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity and \n     fair-mindedness. In short, John Roberts represents the best \n     of the bar and, we have no doubt, would be a superb federal \n     court of appeals judge.\n\n  The committee also received a letter signed by 13 of his former \ncolleagues at the Office of the Solicitor General. The letter states:\n\n       Although we are of diverse political parties and \n     persuasions, each of us is firmly convinced that Mr. Roberts \n     would be a truly superb addition to the federal court of \n     appeals. As the Committee will doubtless hear from many \n     quarters, John is an incomparable appellate lawyer. Indeed, \n     it is fair to say that he is one of the foremost appellate \n     lawyers in the country. . . . The Office then, as now, \n     comprised lawyers of every political affiliation--Democrats, \n     Republicans, and Independents. Mr. Roberts was attentive to \n     and respectful of all views, and he represented the United \n     States zealously but fairly. He had the deepest respect for \n     legal principles and legal precedent--instincts that will \n     serve him well as a court of appeals judge.\n\n  Now I would like to make a few comments about Mr. Roberts's \nimpressive background. He entered Harvard College with sophomore \nstanding, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history, summa cum \nlaude, then a law degree, magna cum laude. While in law school, he was \nan editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n  Following graduation, Mr. Roberts clerked for Judge Henry Friendly on \nthe Second Circuit and for then-Justice William Rehnquist on the \nSupreme Court. His public service career included terms as Associate \nCounsel to President Reagan and Principal Deputy Solicitor General. He \ncurrently heads the appellate practice group for the prestigious DC law \nfirm Hogan and Hartson, where his practice has focused on Federal \nappellate litigation.\n\n  Mr. Roberts has been involved with a variety of high-profile and \nsignificant legal cases. He has argued on different sides of a variety \nof different issues, firmly establishing his reputation as a lawyer's \nlawyer.\n  Beyond being considered by many to be one of the premier Supreme \nCourt litigators of his generation, the record of John Roberts \nestablishes that he is undeniably mainstream and fair. In fact, while \nin private practice Mr. Roberts has repeatedly been hired by Democratic \npublic officials and has repeatedly argued what many consider to be the \nso-called liberal side of cases.\n  In protecting the environment during the 2002 case of Tahoe-Sierra \nPreservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, Mr. Roberts \nsuccessfully argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, on behalf of a State \nregulatory agency, in favor of limits on property development and in \nsupport of protection of the pristine Lake Tahoe Basin area. \nEnvironmental groups hailed the majority decision, saying it would help \nprotect America's countryside from suburban sprawl.\n  In supporting consumer rights during the 2001 landmark Microsoft \nantitrust case, Mr. Roberts argued on behalf of the Clinton Department \nof Justice and a group of primarily Democratic State attorneys general \nthat Microsoft's business practices violated the Sherman Act.\n  In addition, Mr. Roberts has devoted much of his time to pro bono \nwork. For instance, he represented a class of District of Columbia \nresidents receiving welfare benefits, arguing that a particular change \nin eligibility standards that resulted in a termination of welfare \nbenefits without an individual hearing denied class members procedural \ndue process.\n  In another pro bono case, United States v. Halper, Mr. Roberts was \ninvited by the Supreme Court to represent Mr. Halper, who had been \npreviously convicted under Federal criminal law for filing false \nMedicaid claims.\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nHe successfully argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the \nimposition of civil penalties under Federal law against an individual \nwho had been convicted and punished under criminal law for the same \nconduct.\n  Mr. Roberts also participates extensively in the pro bono program of \nhis firm, assisting his colleagues prepare pro bono appeals on matters \nsuch as termination of parental rights, minority voting rights, noise \npollution at the Grand Canyon, and environmental protection of Glacier \nBay.\n  I have every confidence that Mr. Roberts will make a great addition \nto the DC Circuit. He is an exceptionally well-qualified jurist who has \ndistinguished himself as one of the best in the legal profession. I am \nconfident that Mr. Roberts will serve with distinction on the DC \nCircuit, and I ask for my colleagues' full support of his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                             THE JUDICIARY\n\n       John G. Roberts, Jr., of Maryland, to be United States \n     Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that this judge has waited about 10 \nyears. He has been nominated several times.\n  Mr. HATCH. He has waited 12 years, through three nominations, by two \ndifferent Presidents.\n  Mr. REID. He is the 124th judge we have approved for the Bush \nadministration. The record is 124 to 2.\n  Mr. HATCH. Keep in mind, as of tomorrow, those two will be waiting \nfor 2 solid years. We need to get them done, too. I call on my \ncolleagues on the other side to get rid of their wicked and evil ways \nand allow these people to have votes up and down.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. I heard an objection from the other side.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5929-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ARMING PILOTS AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed measures that \n     would have armed pilots of cargo aircraft.\n       (B) Cargo aircraft do not have Federal air marshals, \n     trained cabin crew, or determined passengers to subdue \n     terrorists.\n       (C) Cockpit doors on cargo aircraft, if present at all, \n     largely do not meet the security standards required for \n     commercial passenger aircraft.\n       (D) Cargo aircraft vary in size and many are larger and \n     carry larger amounts of fuel than the aircraft hijacked on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (E) Aircraft cargo frequently contains hazardous material \n     and can contain deadly biological and chemical agents and \n     quantities of agents that caused communicable diseases.\n       (F) Approximately 12,000 of the Nation's 90,000 commercial \n     pilots serve as pilots and flight engineers on cargo \n     aircraft.\n       (G) There are approximately 2,000 cargo flights per day in \n     the United States, many of which are loaded with fuel for \n     outbound international travel or are inbound from foreign \n     airports not secured by the Transportation Security \n     Administration.\n       (H) aircraft transporting cargo pose a serious risk as \n     potential terrorist targets that could be used as weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (I) Pilots of cargo aircraft deserve the same ability to \n     protect themselves and the aircraft they pilot as other \n     commercial airline pilots.\n       (J) Permitting pilots of cargo aircraft to carry firearms \n     creates an important last line of defense against a terrorist \n     effort to commandeer a cargo aircraft.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a \n     member of a flight deck crew of a cargo aircraft should be \n     armed with a firearm to defend the cargo aircraft against an \n     attack by terrorists that could result in the use of the \n     aircraft as a weapon of mass destruction or for other \n     terrorists purposes.\n       (b) Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism.--Section 44921 \n     of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``passenger'' in subsection (a) each place \n     that it appears;\n       (2) by striking ``or,'' and all that follows in subsection \n     (k)(2) and inserting ``or any other flight deck crew \n     member.''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end of subsection (k) the following:\n       ``(3) All-cargo air transportation.--For the purposes of \n     this section, the term air transportation includes all-cargo \n     air transportation.''.\n       (d) Implementation.--\n       (1) Time for implementation.--The training of pilots as \n     Federal flight deck officers required in the amendments made \n     by subsection (b) shall begin as soon as practicable and no \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Effect on other laws.--The requirements of subparagraph \n     (1) shall have no effect on the deadlines for implementation \n     contained in section 44921 of title 49, United States Code, \n     as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 13. REPORT ON DEFENDING AIRCRAFT FROM MAN-PORTABLE AIR \n                   DEFENSE SYSTEMS (SHOULDER-FIRED MISSILES).\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue a \n     report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure on how best to defend turbo \n     and jet passenger aircraft from Man-Portable Air Defense \n     Systems (shoulder-fired missiles). The report shall also \n     include actions taken to date, countermeasures, risk \n     mitigation, and other activities. The report may be submitted \n     in classified form.\n\n\n                     Committee Amendments Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 538\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send a substitute amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. McCain, \n     Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 538.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 165, the Air Cargo Security Act. When Congress acted in \nthe aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, its focus was on \npassenger screening. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act set \nout a template for the screening of passengers and baggage. We deferred \ndealing with cargo carried on passenger airlines and on all-cargo \naircraft until a review of cargo security could be undertaken. S. 165 \nis designed to bolster air cargo security and provides further guidance \nand authority to the Transportation Security Administration--TSA--to \nensure continued improvement in these areas.\n  Let me say at the outset that Senator Hutchison has worked very hard \non this bill and deserves a great deal of credit. Although this issue \nwas one that everyone believed was very important, she and Senator \nSnowe introduced cargo security bills during the second session of last \ncongress. Those bills became a base for the cargo security provisions \nin last year's S. 2949, the Aviation Security Improvement Act, which \npassed the Senate, but was not passed by the House. Senator Hutchison \nand Senator Feinstein reintroduced the air cargo provisions from last \nyear as a stand alone bill this year.\n  Cargo security is one area in which we can and should be proactive to \naddress potential problems and vulnerabilities head on. I note that TSA \nis already looking at improving cargo security under its mandate in \nATSA.\n  S. 165 requires the TSA to develop a strategic plan to ensure that \nall air cargo is screened, inspected, or otherwise made secure. Up \nuntil now, there has been no consistent oversight in this area and this \nplan will ensure the continued safety of air cargo.\n  In addition, TSA is to develop a system for the regular inspection of \nair cargo shipping facilities. This will ensure that all regulations \nare being followed and that these shipping facilities are meeting all \nof their federal security requirements.\n  TSA is required to establish a database of known shippers in order to \nfurther improve the Known Shipper Program. This is in response to \nconcerns expressed by the DOT Inspector General that the existing Known \nShipper Program needed some revisions to ensure the continued safety in \nair cargo.\n  S. 165 also requires that the existing Federal security plans for \nindirect air carriers is reviewed and it gives TSA the power to take \nenforcement actions against indirect air carriers if TSA finds that \nthey are not adhering to security laws or regulations. This enforcement \npower will ensure that these freight forwarders have the appropriate \nsafeguards in place and are meeting them.\n\n  S. 165 also requires all-cargo carriers to develop a security plan \nthat is subject to approval by TSA to ensure that air cargo carried on \nthese carriers is properly screened and protected from tampering. As a \npart of this requirement, TSA is to develop a security training program \nfor persons who handle air cargo.\n  Finally, the managers' amendment to S. 165 makes a couple of changes \nto the bill approved by the Commerce Committee. At the time of \nCommittee consideration, we were working with the TSA on a number of \ntheir technical comments. We were unable to complete these efforts \nprior to the markup. These have now been worked-out and are included.\n  The Commerce Committee also adopted an amendment offered by Senator \nNelson of Florida that extends the Federal Government's oversight of \nforeign students receiving flight training in the United States. Some \nmembers of the committee expressed concern that the requirements of the \namendment would be too onerous on flight schools and Senator Nelson \nagreed to work on these issues. A compromise has been developed that \nmet the concerns of both sides and is included in the amendment.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this bill that will strengthen the \nsecurity of our cargo aviation system.\n  I also note my friend, Senator Boxer from California, continues to be \nheavily involved in the issue of protecting\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nour airliners from the possibility of a missile attack. I thank her for \nher efforts in that direction. I am encouraged by the information she \nhas given to me that the TSA apparently is very serious in working on \nthis threat to the security of aviation.\n  I again thank my friend from Texas for her outstanding work on this \nissue and I think it lays out a very reasonable but very important \ntemplate for ensuring the security of our cargo aircraft, the same way \nas we worked together on that of commercial airliners.\n  I thank my colleague, I thank all who were involved in this very \nimportant issue, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Hollings asked me if I would be \nthe Democratic manager here. I want to say to Senator Hutchison, thank \nyou so much for all your hard work. I also thank Senator Hollings and \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Wyden--frankly, the whole committee. This \nis one committee that does work on a bipartisan basis and it is very \nrefreshing, I might say.\n  S. 165 takes needed steps to respond to concerns that have been \nraised about the status of air cargo security in the U.S., and will act \nto close a loophole that has left our aviation system vulnerable to a \nterrorist attack.\n  Last year, Admiral James Loy, the Under Secretary of Transportation \nfor Security, expressed his concern, in testimony before the Senate \nCommerce Committee, that air cargo security needed to be strengthened \nor it would remain a potential backdoor open for terrorists to exploit. \nThese concerns are well-founded as, prior to September 11, 2001, the \nDepartment of Transportation Inspector General's--DOT IG--Office had \nconfirmed that it was possible to ship dangerous items on aircraft \nwithout ever having the contents of packages screened. Since the \nterrorist attacks of 9-11, significant changes have occurred to the \ncargo industry in response to this security loophole, but more must be \ndone. Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive cargo security bill, \nbut time ran out on the 107th Congress before the House could properly \nconsider it. We need to pass S. 165 now, and make certain the \nfoundation for addressing this matter is put into law.\n  S. 165 will instruct the Transportation Security Administration--\nTSA--to establish an inspection program for all cargo that is \ntransported through the Nation's air transportation system. The bill \nincludes language from the legislation which passed in the Senate last \nyear requiring the creation of an industry-wide database of known \nshippers of cargo on passenger aircraft and an assessment of the \ncurrent indirect air carrier program, random inspections of indirect \nair carrier facilities, and a report to Congress on the random audit \nsystem. In addition, S. 165 authorizes the appropriation of necessary \nsums for TSA to carry out an air cargo security program, and mandates \nthe development of a training program for all air cargo handlers.\n  We have come close to closing the loopholes in cargo security before, \nbut the process must be completed. This issue is critical to the future \nof aviation security, air travelers and our economy. Congress should \nact now to pass this legislation before a tragic, avoidable incident \nforces our hand.\n  I close by thanking the committee for adding actually four amendments \nthat we worked on. I thank my staff for working so hard on this as \nwell.\n  First of all, we have in this bill made sure the cargo pilots have \nthe same opportunity to protect the cockpit as pilots in commercial \nplanes. They are going to be part of this program now. I am very \npleased about that.\n  Second, there is a study in here on the best way to proceed on blast-\nresistant containers. I have seen Kevlar material which will contain a \nbomb blast so that it doesn't wreak havoc and cause a horrible tragedy. \nSo we are looking at that.\n  Third, something that Senator McCain mentioned, we have included a \nstudy to look at the best defense for shoulder-fired missiles. During \nthe break, I went to San Diego and I stood on the roof of a parking \ngarage at the airport and, believe me, I felt like I could touch the \naircraft as they came in for a landing. I looked around and realized \nthis is a great vulnerability. Many terrorist groups have these \nshoulder-fired missiles, or they can buy them for as little as $8,000. \nWe have defenses we have on Air Force One, on military planes, with \nwhich El Al has their fleet protected. We need to protect our fleet.\n  We have a study in this particular bill just in case the study that \nis going on via the supplemental emergency bill gets bogged down. So it \nis a backup.\n  Last, I was very concerned to learn fake IDs are very easy to use, \nwhen you check into an airport. We have a study here to come up with a \nplan on how to use high technology to spot a fake ID.\n  I am very pleased to be here. Again, I thank Senator Hollings for \ngiving me this honor to express my support. I believe we are going to \nhave a voice vote. I am very happy about it and I look forward to \nseeing this bill become law.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I know my friend from Texas, the author \nof this bill, has a good deal to say about this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Air Cargo Security Act will make \nsuch a difference in our Nation's air security. I think we have done a \nlot since\n9/11. Since the 9/11 attacks, we have made tremendous progress in \ntransportation security. We have created a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We have established the Transportation Security Agency and \ninvested heavily in personnel and equipment. However the one thing we \nhave not done in the same way that we have protected the top of the \nairplane and the airport, is that we have not yet secured the belly of \nthe aircraft. This is where the cargo is shipped. That is what the bill \nwe are passing today would do.\n  The Air Cargo Security Act would establish a reliable known-shipper \nprogram, mandate inspections of cargo facilities, direct the \nTransportation Security Agency to work with foreign countries to have \nregular checks at facilities that bring cargo into the United States. \nThe legislation develops a training program for air cargo handlers, and \ngive TSA the power to revoke the license of a shipper or freight \nforwarder whose practices are unsound.\n  As the Senator from California mentioned, her amendment will allow \ncargo pilots to participate in the same security training as airline \npilots and the legislation will require background checks for all \nnoncitizens who would undergo flight training. These are just a few of \nthe provisions that I think will go a long way to securing the entire \naircraft and our country.\n  I think we have seen a dramatic improvement in the safety of our \naircraft and our airports.\n  I want to make sure that America has the safest aviation system in \nthe world. I think we can do it. This air cargo bill will make a \ndifference. This bill passed the Senate last year, and I hope very much \nthat the House will pass the bill this year and the President will sign \nit. Then we will give TSA the authority it needs to do this very \nimportant work.\n  Today, there is no doubt in my mind that the traveling public is \nconsiderably safer than we were on September 10, 2001. That is \nimportant to recognize. Our screeners undergo background checks, \ntraining and testing. Checked bags are scrutinized. Flight crew \ntraining has been improved. We all are traveling under a more secure \nsystem.\n  While our efforts in the 107th Congress have dramatically enhanced \nsecurity, we in the 108th must continue to strive for seamless \noperations. This responsibility includes closing the cargo security \nloophole. It makes no sense to inconvenience airline passengers with \nsecurity screening and baggage checks if we do not establish controls \nover the cargo traveling in the belly of the same plane. Currently, \ntwenty-two percent of all air cargo in the U.S. is carried on passenger \nflights, only a tiny fraction of which is inspected. That is \ninexcusable.\n  Last year, Senator Feinstein and I commissioned a GAO report on the \nsecurity of our existing air cargo system, and the Commerce Committee \nheld a closed hearing on this issue. The report reveals some very \ntroubling facts. Security considerations prevent the report from \ngetting too specific. But the GAO found that air cargo is vulnerable to \ntheft and tampering while it is in\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\ntransit, and while it is in supposedly secure cargo facilities.\n\n  According to the report, identification cards used by cargo workers \nare generally not secured with fingerprints or other biometric \nidentifiers. They can be counterfeited. Background checks for cargo \nemployees are inadequate.\n  Perhaps the weakest link in the cargo security chain is the freight \nforwarder. These are the middlemen who collect cargo from shippers and \ndeliver it to the air carrier. Regulations governing these companies \nare lax, and the TSA is finding security violations as it conducts \ninspections. Under current law, however, TSA lacks the authority to \nrevoke the shipping privileges of freight forwarders that repeatedly \nviolate security and procedural rules. The Air Cargo Security Act gives \nTSA that power.\n  Air cargo security is not a new problem. In 1988, Pan Am 103 went \ndown over Lockerbie, Scotland because of explosives planted inside a \nradio in the cargo hold of a passenger airplane. The 1996 Valujet crash \nin the Everglades was caused by high-pressure tanks that never should \nhave been place aboard a passenger aircraft.\n  This legislation will strengthen air cargo security on all commercial \nflights. Specifically, this bill establishes a more reliable known \nshipper program by requiring inspections of facilities, creating an \naccessible shipper database, and providing for tamper-proof \nidentification cards for airport personnel. It also gives the TSA the \ntools required to hold shippers accountable for the contents they ship \nby allowing the administration to revoke the license of a shipper or \nfreight forwarder engaged in unsound or illegal practices.\n  This Air Cargo Security Act also requires the TSA to develop a \ncomprehensive training program for cargo professionals as well as an \napproved cargo security plan. The rules and procedures in this bill \nwere developed in consultation with the TSA, the airlines, and the \ncargo carriers to ensure that the requirements are aggressive, but will \nnot cause hardship to an already-stressed industry. In 2001, cargo \naccounted for about $13 billion, or 10 percent, of the passenger \nairlines' total revenue.\n\n  I helped craft the assistance package set forth in the recent \nSupplemental Appropriations bill, and I applaud the way the unions have \nstepped to the plate and engaged in good faith negotiations to relieve \nfinancial stress on the carriers. I will fight to protect the one \nmillion aviation-related jobs nationwide. However, the aviation \nindustry can never afford another 9/11. Air cargo is the largest \nloophole left in our aviation security network. It must be closed.\n  We will oversee the bill's implementation to ensure that it is \naccomplished with a minimum of expense to our critical, yet endangered \naviation industry.\n  To strengthen air cargo security and passenger safety, I urge my \ncollegues to support the Air Cargo Security Act.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their support. I thank the chairman \nof the committee, Mr. McCain, and all of those who worked with me on \nthis. I think we are doing a great job. Senator Lott, the chairman of \nthe Aviation Subcommittee, has worked with me on this. We have worked \nwith the airlines. We don't want to burden the airlines at this time \nbecause they have had many shocks to their system. So we have worked \nwith them to make sure that the actions we take are done in a \nresponsible way.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before she leaves the floor, let me commend \nour colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, who has spent an enormous \namount of time on this issue. It has been particularly helpful to this \nSenator as I worked on some of the privacy issues I will be discussing. \nI thank my colleague for all of her good work.\n  Earlier this year I spoke on the floor about what I think has been \nthe most important privacy issue of our time. That is the proposal for \nwhat is known as the Total Information Awareness Program. This would \nconstitute the biggest surveillance program in American history. In the \nU.S. Senate, Senators Inouye, Stevens, and Feinstein have been working \non a bipartisan basis with our colleagues in both political parties. We \nput in place sensible restrictions so as to ensure accurate \ncongressional oversight.\n  What we called for was a requirement that first there be a report by \nthe proponents of the program and the agencies involved on how the \nprogram would work.\n  Second, there is a requirement that to deploy any of the technology \nunder the Total Information Awareness Program, there would have to be \nexplicit congressional approval. This was a momentous step for the \nSenate to pass this legislation unanimously.\n  I am rising today to discuss what I think is yet another very \nsignificant privacy question which is an issue that needs debate in \ncommittee on this particular bill: the air cargo security legislation. \nThe air cargo security legislation includes a proposal that I offered \nregarding what is known as CAPPS II, the passenger prescreening system \nthat the Transportation Security Administration is developing. This \nprogram would do a computer search on each airline passenger to \ndetermine who should be subject to more careful security screening and, \nin some cases, who shouldn't be allowed to get on a plane.\n  All of us in the U.S. Senate understand that it is critically \nimportant to protect the security and safety of those who fly, and we \ncertainly want to look at ways to do it that are smart and, \nparticularly, target resources in an efficient way. But to set up a \nsystem that seeks information on each and every aircraft traveler and \nuses that system to assign scores to every individual--a score as to \nwho might possibly be a threat--does raise some very significant \nprivacy questions for the Senate.\n  The American people will want to know whether that system is narrowly \nlimited for a specific purpose or whether it would become an all-\npurpose electronic snooping system. The public wants to know whether \nthere are accurate safeguards to be sure the system won't be abused and \nsound procedures to provide passengers with the means to address \nmistakes.\n  Verbal assurances that these technologies will be used only on \n``lawfully collected information'' are not enough. For one thing, \n``lawfully collected information'' can include almost anything--my \nmedical information, financial information, the books I have read, \nplaces I have visited. This same information--for each of my \ndistinguished colleagues and millions of law-abiding citizens--can also \nbe ``lawfully collected.''\n  In order to protect our civil liberties and right to privacy, \nCongress must be fully and publicly briefed on these types of new \ntechnological efforts.\n  As the New York Times editorial page said earlier this year, \nidentifying travelers who may pose a terrorist threat is ``a worthy \ngoal'' but also ``raises serious privacy and due process concerns, \nwhich the government needs to address in a forthright manner.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 11, 2003]\n\n                       The New Airport Profiling\n\n       Having successfully fielded thousands of newly minted \n     federal agents to screen air travelers and their luggage, the \n     Transportation Security Administration is now turning to a \n     far more controversial endeavor. The agency is developing a \n     sophisticated screening system designed to identify travelers \n     who may pose a terrorist threat.\n       It is a worthy goal--one ordered up by Congress--but the \n     creation of a highly intrusive federal surveillance program \n     raises serious privacy and due process concerns, which the \n     government needs to address in a forthright manner.\n       The notion of electronic profiling is not new. Using such \n     criteria as whether a passenger paid cash for a ticket, a \n     rudimentary system designed in the mid-1990's helped airlines \n     flag passengers deserving heightened scrutiny. What that \n     usually meant was that their checked luggage was carefully \n     inspected. Some of the Sept. 11 hijackers were reported to \n     have been picked out by that system, but it did little good \n     since they did not check any bags.\n       The new profiling system is a quantum leap. In addition to \n     evaluating certain travel-related behavior and looking for \n     passenger names on watch lists, the new system will give the \n     transportation agency access to numerous public and private \n     databases the moment a passenger books a flight. Exactly \n     which ones has not yet been determined, but\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\n     they may include the records of Department of Motor Vehicle \n     offices, banks and credit-rating agencies.\n       After the program is in place, which could be as early as \n     the end of this year, the Transportation Security \n     Administration will assign each passenger a risk level: \n     green, yellow or red. Travelers will not be informed of their \n     designations, which will be encrypted onto their boarding \n     passes. The T.S.A. says it is mindful of the obvious privacy \n     concerns raised by such a system, though it points out that \n     it will not be amassing new databases, but rather mining ones \n     already used routinely to profile consumers. The agency says \n     it is not interested in knowing whether you bounced a check \n     five years ago, or whether you have paid your parking \n     tickets, but in authenticating your identity.\n       Privacy principles are not necessarily sacrosanct, but this \n     plan runs the risk of overreaching. For one thing, it could \n     quickly lead to mistaken actions based on inaccurate \n     information.\n       More worrisome is the possibility that this system could \n     grow into a runaway vacuum cleaner, sweeping up all manner of \n     data that can then be misused by the government. Congress \n     recently put the brakes on the Pentagon's Total Information \n     Awareness project, a dangerously uncontrolled program that \n     was designed to track the activities of millions of \n     Americans. Lawmakers must ensure that the transportation \n     agency's profiling system does not become an all-purpose \n     equivalent.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this article identifies the issue with \nrespect to travelers. I spoke about those who may pose a terrorist \nthreat. It is a worthy goal. But I also said that this issue raises \nserious privacy concerns which the government needs to address in a \nforthright way, and addressing privacy concerns in a forthright manner \nis what the legislation now does as a result of the amendment involving \nthis passenger prescreening program.\n  What you are going to have under the legislation now is a chance to \nget the key questions answered with respect to how this program would \nwork. It is my intention that the information with respect to how this \nprogram would work would be available for public scrutiny as well.\n  I met with those at the TSA who spearhead this passenger prescreening \nprogram. They certainly raise a number of issues with respect to \nprivacy protections which they would like to include. But at this \npoint, the only written information that we have on CAPPS II was \npublished in the Federal Register on January 15 of this year.\n  That program outlines a broad-based initiative that would house \nrecords such as ``risk assessment reports,'' financial and \ntransactional data, public source information, proprietary data, and \ninformation from law enforcement and intelligent sources.\n  This broad array of information may then be disclosed to ``Federal, \nState, territorial, tribal, local, international, or foreign \nagencies.'' Suffice it to say, based on the Federal Register \ndescription on January 15, 2003, the public is concerned about how this \nkind of program is going to work.\n  Clearly, our country wants to fight terrorism ferociously. We want to \ntake the steps necessary to protect our airline passengers. But \nsomething which is as sweeping and as broad as the proposal that was \noutlined in the Federal Register for screening airline passengers \ncertainly ought to give the American people and the U.S. Senate pause.\n  I think it is important that the public not be kept in the dark on \nthis issue. That is why the legislation on the program which I was able \nto include in the air cargo security bill is important. It is going to \nbring some sunshine to this issue--some long overdue sunshine.\n  I hope my colleagues will continue to work with me and others in a \nbipartisan basis on the privacy issues. We made very significant \nprogress with respect to the limitations that were put on the Total \nInformation Awareness Program. The effort that is now underway with \nrespect to screening airline passengers presents some other very \nsignificant privacy issues. We ought to continue to make sure that as \nwe take steps to protect the public safety, we remember that it is \ncritically important to protect privacy rights and civil liberties. We \nnow are making an effort to do that in the air cargo security \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 538) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 165, the Air \nCargo Security Improvement Act. This legislation is another critical \npiece in our ongoing efforts to increase the security of our aviation \nsystem. I commend my colleagues, Senator Hutchison and Senator \nFeinstein, for their continued leadership on this critical issue.\n  Over the past 18 months, we have worked every day to improve security \nin our airports and on our airplanes. While we set in place \nunprecedented improvements in aviation security, clear gaps remain. \nToday's legislation is aimed at filling security gaps in the vast and \neconomically vital air cargo network by providing the Transportation \nSecurity Administration and related security agencies with the \nauthority and resources they need to implement new air cargo security \nrequirements.\n  This important legislation, which passed the Senate last year as part \nof S. 2949, the Aviation Security Improvement Act, requires TSA to \nestablish a system to screen, inspect, or otherwise ensure security of \nall cargo transported by air and to establish a system for regular \ninspection of airport and cargo shipping facilities. Unfortunately, the \nHouse of Representatives did not act on this legislation last year. \nImproving the security of our nation's air cargo system must be \naddressed this year, and I am pleased that the Senate has acted quickly \nto pass this vital legislation again in the 108th Congress.\n  The Air Cargo bill would take several steps to improve the security \nof air cargo. The bill requires the Transportation Security Agency, \nTSA, to develop a strategic plan to ensure that all air cargo is \nscreened, inspected, or otherwise made secure. TSA would also be \nrequired to develop a system for the regular inspection of air cargo \nshipping facilities, the establishment of a database of known shippers, \ncompanies and persons that regularly ship cargo, in order to bolster \nthe Known Shipper Program, and review and assess the existing federal \nsecurity program for freight forwarders, companies that accept and \nconsolidate freight and tender it to an all cargo or passenger carrier \nfor air shipment. The bill allows TSA to revoke the certificates of \nfreight forwarders if the agency finds that they are not adhering to \nsecurity laws or regulations.\n  The legislation also mandates that TSA develop a security training \nprogram for persons who handle air cargo and all cargo carriers would \nbe required to develop security plans that would be subject to approval \nby TSA.\n  During the Commerce Committee's consideration of the legislation a \nnumber of important amendments offered by Senators Wyden, Boxer, and \nBill Nelson were adopted that strengthened the bill.\n  These provisions included requiring Secretary of Homeland Security to \nreport to Congress on the impact on the privacy and civil liberties of \nthe Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System, requiring \nbackground checks of alien flight school applicants to include \napplicants for flight training of planes below 12,500 pounds, and to \ntransfer these responsibilities from the Department of Justice to the \nTransportation Security Administration, and requires guidelines for \nverifying passenger identification.\n  The Committee also adopted provisions to have the FAA and TSA conduct \na study on blast-resistant cargo containers, allowing cargo pilots to \nparticipate in the Federal Flight Deck Officer program, and requiring \nthe Department of Homeland Security to issue a report on how best to \ndefend passenger aircraft from shoulder-fired missiles.\n  The Air Cargo Security Improvement Act is another important step in \nour efforts to improve our nation's aviation security network, but it \nis by no means the final step. I spend countless hours each week as \npart of my duties on the Intelligence Committee and we all recognize \nthat the changing nature of threats will require continued vigilant \noversight and modifications to our security network. There are no \nguarantees, but we can and must continue to work every day to make sure \nthat the people who fly and the places they fly from are safe.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 165 the \nAir Cargo Security Improvement Act.\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n  This legislation is another important step toward fully protecting \nthe United States and all Americans from terrorists who intend to use \nour aviation system to commit future attacks.\n  Among other provisions, including the creation of a security program \nto protect our air cargo from terrorist attacks, this bill mandates \ncrucial studies on blast resistant cargo containers, the Transportation \nSecurity Administration's passenger screening program known as CAPPS \nII, and most importantly, how to defend our airliners from shoulder \nmissile attacks similar to the attack last December on an Israeli \ncharter jet in the skies over Kenya.\n  We must continue to be vigilant in protecting our Nation. This \nlegislation addresses a deep concern of mine regarding foreign citizens \ncoming to the United States to receive pilot training on all sizes of \naircraft. Unfortunately, we have seen what can happen when people come \nto our country with the specific intent to do us great harm. Many of \nthe September 11 hijackers learned to fly the planes they used as \ndeadly weapons at flight schools here in the United States.\n  Section 113 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which \nwas enacted in the 107th Congress, requires background checks of all \nforeign flight school applicants seeking training to operate aircraft \nweighing 12,500 pounds or more. While this provision should help \nprevent September 11th-style attacks by U.S.-trained pilots using \nhijacked jets in the future, it does nothing to prevent different types \nof potential attacks against our domestic security. To rectify this \nproblem, I introduced S. 236 together with Senators Corzine, Enzi, \nFeinstein, and Thomas earlier this year.\n  The FBI has issued terrorism warnings indicating that small planes \nmight be used to carry out suicide attacks. Small aircraft can be used \nby terrorists to attack nuclear facilities, carry explosives, or \ndeliver biological or chemical agents. For example, if a crop duster \nfilled with a combination of fertilizers and explosives were crashed \ninto a filled sporting event stadium, thousands of people could be \nseriously injured or killed. We cannot allow this to happen. We need to \nensure that we are not training terrorists to perform these activities. \nWe cannot allow critical warnings to go unheeded.\n  This bill will close an important loophole and answer the critical \nwarnings issued by the FBI by extending the background check \nrequirement to all foreign applicants to U.S. flight schools, \nregardless of the size aircraft they seek to learn to fly. It also \ntransfers the entire security background check program from the \nDepartment of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security, \nspecifically to the Transportation Security Administration. It is my \nexpectation that the Transportation Security Administration, which \nprovided excellent advice in the fine tuning of this legislation, will \napply a stringent level of background screening to all foreign \nnationals who seek flight training here in the United States. We cannot \nallow anyone to slip through the cracks. We cannot aid anyone who \nintends to do harm to Americans and to our Nation.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senators McCain and Hollings, and their staffs, for working \nwith me to ensure inclusion of this provision in the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hutchison for her work \non the Air Cargo Security Act. Last year this bill passed the Senate \nand I look forward to passing this legislation again today. Hopefully \nthe House will take up this legislation promptly and send it to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Earlier this year Senator Hutchison and I released a report from the \nGeneral Accounting Office that demonstrates why the Congress and the \nTransportation Security Administration must--together--move quickly to \nshore up our vulnerabilities to protect against another terrorist \nattack.\n  I strongly believe that we must increase our defenses across the \nboard to anticipate the next attack, not just correct the \nvulnerabilities that were already exploited by terrorists on September \n11.\n  After September 11, Congress moved quickly to federalize the airport \nsecurity screening workforce to prevent more hijackings, but we have \nnot done enough to increase our air cargo security.\n  The General Accounting Office report shows that Congress must require \nthe TSA to develop a strategic plan to screen and inspect air cargo to \nprotect our Nation's air transportation system. According to this \nreport, our air cargo system remains vulnerable to a terrorist attack \nbecause:\n  First, there aren't enough safeguards in place to ensure that someone \nshipping air cargo under the ``known shipper'' program has taken the \nproper steps to protect against use by terrorists;\n  Second, cargo tampering is possible at various points where cargo \ntransfers from company to company;\n  Third, air cargo handlers are not required to have criminal \nbackground checks, and they do not always have their identification \nverified;\n  Fourth, and most importantly, most cargo shipped by air is never \nscreened.\n  To address these problems, the GAO recommends that the Transportation \nSecurity Administration develop a comprehensive plan for improving air \ncargo security.\n  The air cargo legislation we are passing today, directs the TSA to: \nDevelop a strategic plan to ensure the security of all air cargo; \nestablish an industry-wide pilot program database of known shippers; \nset up a training program for handlers to learn how to safeguard cargo \nfrom tampering; and inspect air cargo shipping facilities on a regular \nbasis.\n  The Aviation Security Act Congress passed after September 11 required \nthe Transportation Security Administration to screen and inspect air \ncargo ``as soon as practicable.'' The GAO report shows we cannot wait \nany longer. The time is now for the Senate to again take up this \nlegislation, again pass this legislation, and for the TSA to prevent \nterrorists from tampering with the cargo loaded into the underbelly of \nour airplanes.\n  The General Accounting Office recommends that the Under Secretary for \nTransportation develop a comprehensive plan for air cargo security that \nincludes priority actions identified on the basis of risk, costs, \ndeadlines for completing those actions, and performance targets.\n  The TSA has a great deal of options at its disposal. The TSA could: \nScreen air cargo for explosives; secure cargo with high-tech seals; \ncontrol access to holding areas containing cargo; use cargo tracking \nsystems; install more cameras in cargo areas at airports; use blast \nresistant containers; have more bomb-sniffing dogs; put cargo in \ndecompression chambers before loading it onto an aircraft; require the \nidentity of people making air cargo deliveries to be checked; establish \nan industrywide computer profiling system; require criminal background \nchecks for employees at freight forwarders and consolidators; and \nrequire third party inspections.\n  We do not expect the TSA to X-ray and scan all cargo for explosives \nbecause shippers and carriers would be able to process only 4 percent \nof cargo received daily, which would severely disrupt the air cargo \nindustry. However, the Federal Government can deploy a combination of \nthe techniques I have listed to implement a comprehensive security plan \nfor air cargo.\n  Since one half of the hull of each passenger aircraft is typically \nfilled with cargo and 22 percent of all cargo transported by plane is \nloaded on passenger flights, I believe air cargo security is just as \nimportant as passenger security. In fact, you cannot keep passengers \nsafe without stronger air cargo security.\n  Each time there is a major jet crash or bombing, we reexamine our \naviation security. I hope it will not take another accident or attack \nfor us to finally pass this legislation into law.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings for \ntheir leadership on this issue of transportation security, and I look \nforward to this bill being signed into law.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nbefore the Senate that addresses what I feel is one of the most glaring \nloopholes in our homeland security net: that of the lax air cargo \nsecurity infrastructure in our country.\n  In 2001, with the passage of the Aviation and Transportation Security \nAct,\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nwe reinvented aviation security. We overturned the status quo, and I am \nproud of the work we did. We put the Federal Government in charge of \nsecurity and we have made significant strides toward restoring the \nconfidence of the American people that it is safe to fly. We no longer \nhave a system in which the financial ``bottom line'' interferes with \nprotecting the flying public. We also addressed the gamut of critical \nissues, including baggage screening, additional air marshals, cockpit \nsecurity, and numerous other issues.\n  There is more work to be done. We must not lose focus, and we must \nmaintain a continuity of commitment. If we are to fulfill our \nobligations to confront the aviation security challenges we face in the \naftermath of September 11, we must remain aggressive. We need a ``must-\ndo'' attitude, not excuses about what ``can't be done,'' because we are \nonly as safe as the weakest link in our aviation security system.\n  I am a strong supporter of legislation that we are considering today, \nthe Air Cargo Security Act, a bill intended to strengthen the air cargo \nsecurity system in this country. According to the GAO, a full 22 \npercent of all the cargo shipped by air in this country in 2000 was \nshipped on passenger flights--and half of the hull of a typical \npassenger plane is filled with cargo. The Department of Transportation \nInspector General has recommended that current air cargo controls be \ntightened, particularly the process for certifying freight forwarders \nand assessing their compliance with security requirements, and has \nwarned that the existing screening system is ``easily circumvented.'' \nThis must not be allowed to stand.\n  Moreover, according to a Washington Post report last year, internal \nTSA documents warn of an increased risk of an attack designed to \nexploit this vulnerability because TSA has been focused primarily on \nmeeting its new mandates to screen passengers and luggage. This is \nclear evidence that cargo security needs to be bolstered. And time is \nnot on our side.\n  At many of the Senate Commerce Committee's aviation security hearings \nsince 9/11, I have expressed concern about the significant outstanding \nair cargo security issues that we face. On January 23, I introduced \nlegislation which would require TSA to put together a comprehensive air \ncargo security plan. And while TSA was developing their plan, my bill \nmandated that interim security measures be put into place, which \ninclude random cargo screening, greater scrutiny of shippers and a \ntraining regime for air cargo handlers.\n  The bill before us today, the Air Cargo Security Act, incorporates \nmany of the provisions of my bill. First of all, it would require TSA \nto establish a system to ensure the security of all cargo transported \nin the U.S. on both passenger aircraft and cargo aircraft, which must \nbe finalized within 6 months of enactment. It is essential that TSA \nhave a comprehensive plan in place as soon as possible, so that they \ncan go after the most glaring security loopholes in the air cargo \nsystem. Secondly, the bill includes language I authored establishing a \npilot program would be to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ntest various techniques for screening cargo being loaded onto passenger \nplanes including random physical screening. Today, virtually no cargo \nloaded onto airliners is screened, and it is vital that TSA settle soon \non the best method of cargo screening with an eye towards deploying \nthose methods in airports around the country.\n  Also, in response to concerns that I had raised about security at \nforeign cargo facilities that ship to the U.S. by air, the legislation \nincludes a provision requiring TSA to work with foreign countries to \nconduct regular inspections at facilities transporting air cargo to the \nU.S. Finally, the bill also includes a provision from my bill to \ndevelop a detailed training program for all persons that handle air \ncargo. This will ensure that the cargo is properly handled and safe-\nguarded from security breaches.\n  The Air Cargo Security Act would also require TSA to establish an \nindustrywide database of shippers who ship on passenger planes. I know \nthat the TSA has already been working on this database. The bill also \nseeks to greatly increase oversight of indirect air carriers, ``freight \nforwarders,'' complete with a system of random TSA inspections.\n  On last September 11, terrorists exposed the vulnerability of our \ncommercial aviation network in the most horrific fashion. The landmark \naviation security legislation was a major step in the right direction, \nbut we must always stay one step ahead of those who would commit \nvicious acts of violence on our soil aimed at innocent men, women, and \nchildren.\n  The bill before us works towards that goal, and therefore I am \npleased to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ARMING PILOTS AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed measures that \n     would have armed pilots of cargo aircraft.\n       (B) Cargo aircraft do not have Federal air marshals, \n     trained cabin crew, or determined passengers to subdue \n     terrorists.\n       (C) Cockpit doors on cargo aircraft, if present at all, \n     largely do not meet the security standards required for \n     commercial passenger aircraft.\n       (D) Cargo aircraft vary in size and many are larger and \n     carry larger amounts of fuel than the aircraft hijacked on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (E) Aircraft cargo frequently contains hazardous material \n     and can contain deadly biological and chemical agents and \n     quantities of agents that caused communicable diseases.\n       (F) Approximately 12,000 of the Nation's 90,000 commercial \n     pilots serve as pilots and flight engineers on cargo \n     aircraft.\n       (G) There are approximately 2,000 cargo flights per day in \n     the United States, many of which are loaded with fuel for \n     outbound international travel or are inbound from foreign \n     airports not secured by the Transportation Security \n     Administration.\n       (H) aircraft transporting cargo pose a serious risk as \n     potential terrorist targets that could be used as weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (I) Pilots of cargo aircraft deserve the same ability to \n     protect themselves and the aircraft they pilot as other \n     commercial airline pilots.\n       (J) Permitting pilots of cargo aircraft to carry firearms \n     creates an important last line of defense against a terrorist \n     effort to commandeer a cargo aircraft.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a \n     member of a flight deck crew of a cargo aircraft should be \n     armed with a firearm to defend the cargo aircraft against an \n     attack by terrorists that could result in the use of the \n     aircraft as a weapon of mass destruction or for other \n     terrorists purposes.\n       (b) Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism.--Section 44921 \n     of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``passenger'' in subsection (a) each place \n     that it appears;\n       (2) by striking ``or,'' and all that follows in subsection \n     (k)(2) and inserting ``or any other flight deck crew \n     member.''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end of subsection (k) the following:\n       ``(3) All-cargo air transportation.--For the purposes of \n     this section, the term air transportation includes all-cargo \n     air transportation.''.\n       (c) Implementation.--\n       (1) Time for implementation.--The training of pilots as \n     Federal flight deck officers required in the amendments made \n     by subsection (b) shall begin as soon as practicable and no \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Effect on other laws.--The requirements of subparagraph \n     (1) shall have no effect on the deadlines for implementation\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\n     contained in section 44921 of title 49, United States Code, \n     as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 13. REPORT ON DEFENDING AIRCRAFT FROM MAN-PORTABLE AIR \n                   DEFENSE SYSTEMS (SHOULDER-FIRED MISSILES).\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall issue a report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on how best to \n     defend turbo and jet passenger aircraft from Man-Portable Air \n     Defense Systems (shoulder-fired missiles).\n       (b) Issues To Be Addressed.--The report shall include an \n     analysis of--\n       (1) actions taken to date, countermeasures, risk \n     mitigation, and other activities;\n       (2) existing military countermeasure systems and how those \n     systems might be adapted to commercial aircraft applications;\n       (3) means of reducing the costs of military countermeasure \n     systems by modifying them for use on commercial aircraft; and\n       (4) the extent of the threat and the need for \n     countermeasures.\n       (c) Report Format.--The report may be submitted in \n     classified form.\n\n     SEC. 14. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this Act and sections 44901(f), 44922, and 44923 of title 49, \n     United States Code, for fiscal years 2004 through 2008.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, this coming Sunday is Mother's Day. For a \nfew short hours, families will dust off a rarely used pedestal and \nattempt to pay homage to a woman who likely will hop right back off \nthat pedestal in order to straighten her husband's tie, or apply a \nbandage to a skinned knee, or do one of the countless other small tasks \nthat keep a mother's hands in perpetual motion.\n  This Sunday, families may try to still those busy hands by serving \nmom a homemade breakfast in bed or taking her to a nice restaurant for \nbrunch. They will shower her with cards, and flowers, and presents in \nan attempt to say ``thank you, Mother'' for all of the hours that she \nhas labored over them. The cards that are smudged with small blurry \nfingerpainted handprints will be especially savored, as will the \nbouquets of short-stemmed, wilting flowers plucked forcibly from weeds \nand beds in the backyard by loving and determined children, and \npresented in lumpy homemade vases painted with the wild abandon of \nchildhood joy. Each gift and each gesture, whether suggested to a \nyoungster by a loving husband or father or proffered by an awkward \nteenager who otherwise prefers his connection to the family be kept \nsecret, will bring smiles, even tears, of gratitude.\n  On Sunday, mothers will revel in each moment, delight over each \nexpression of caring, and give back tenfold, as they always do, the \nlove offered from their most precious charge, their families.\n  It does not matter whether she is a business executive, an hourly \nlaborer, or an unpaid stay-at-home mom--the best mothers invest the \nbest of themselves in their families. They are high stakes brokers and \nwe, their families, are the stocks on their exchange. They may spend \nmany hours at work, but they still manage to make their children feel \nloved. They still manage to make each house a home. They still manage \nto create and sustain the traditions and customs that make each family \nunique. They enforce discipline on homework and at bedtime. They ice \nthe birthday cakes and pack the lunches. They cool fevered brows and \nbeam at graduations. They set high standards and higher expectations. \nThey glory in our successes and consol us in our defeats. Like ripples \nin a pond, their investment spreads across the generations. The \nmemories deep within each of us that connect us to our families are \noften closely linked to our mothers. From the food dishes that make \neach holiday special, to customs that range from the right way to fold \nclothes to the way we choose to raise our own children, our mother \nlives on in us. It is up to us to live up to our mother's expectations, \nto be the kind of adults she always believed we could be and would be. \nAnd if we simply try our best, she will consider the return on her \ninvestment to be well met.\n\n  I still remember, from growing up in a time when children memorized \nand recited poetry, particularly poetry that taught a lesson, the \nfollowing poem by Margaret Johnston Grafflin:\n\n                         Like Mother, Like Son\n\n     Do you know that your soul is of my soul such a part,\n     That you seem to be fibre and core of my heart?\n     None other can pain me as you, dear, can do,\n     None other can please me or praise me as you.\n\n     Remember the world will be quick with its blame,\n     If shadow or stain ever darken your name.\n     ``Like mother, like son'' is a saying so true,\n     The world will judge largely the ``mother'' by you.\n\n     Be yours then the task, if task it shall be,\n     To force the proud world to do homage to me.\n     Be sure it will say, when its verdict you've won,\n     ``She reaped as she sowed. Lo! This is her son.''\n\n  An old adage avers that ``As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.'' \nCountless studies have demonstrated the essential role that mothers \nplay in family life, and their role in shaping the personality of their \nchildren, for good or for ill. I know from personal experience that a \nmother's influence reaches even beyond the grave. My own sweet mother \ndied when I was just a year old, leaving me to be raised by my aunt and \nuncle. But my mother's serene face shone, and still shines, from a \nphotograph that I keep in my office. Ada Kirby Sale: I have always felt \nher gentle presence, her soft urging to do my best to make her proud, \nto live the lesson of that poem.\n  She died of influenza in 1918, during the great pandemic that took \nmany millions of lives worldwide, her final struggle that of ensuring \nher baby's fate, my fate. It was her wish that a particular aunt and \nuncle take me to raise. I had three older brothers and sister, but she \nwanted the Byrds, Titus Dalton and Vlurma Byrd, to have the baby, \nRobert. At that time my name was Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr.\n  As concerns of a SARS epidemic sweeping the globe make today's \nheadlines, I fear that other children may also be similarly orphaned. \nIf that is the sad case, I hope that these children may also be able to \nkeep their mother's memory and influence with them throughout their \nlives, as I have been fortunate to do.\n  You see, I do not remember ever having seen that mother. But it is as \nthough she were there beside me often. I feel that I am here because of \nthat mother's wish, and I feel that she is watching today. I hope that \nother members of their families will be so willing to take them in and \nraise them as their mothers would have wished, as my Aunt Vlurma and my \nUncle Titus Dalton Byrd did for me. They took me in. They gave me a new \nname to share with them and to be proud of, and they brought me to the \nland of my heart, if not my birth, West Virginia.\n  West Virginia is the birthplace of my wife, Erma Ora Byrd. As I have \nsaid before, and I am happy to say again and again, she is a wonderful \nmother, a wonderful grandmother and great-grandmother. The ripples of \nher influence have spread now to the third generation. Erma and I are \nproud parents, grandparents, and now great-grandparents of a brood of \nfine people, individuals that distinguish any group. Erma's investment \nin her family has paid off a hundredfold.\n  Good mothers are so special--you know that; you know that; you know \nthat--so essential to our families and our society that I am especially \ngratified that the U.S. national celebration of mothers has its own \norigins in the town of Grafton in Taylor County, WV. The only surprise \nis that it is such a recent holiday, first established in 1907, when \nMs. Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia persuaded her mother's church, which \nwas in Grafton, WV, to celebrate Mother's Day on the second anniversary \nof her mother's death on the second Sunday in May. By the next year, \nMother's\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nDay was also being celebrated in Philadelphia.\n  By 1911, thanks to the efforts of Anna Jarvis and her supporters, \nMother's Day was being celebrated in almost every State--there were \nonly 46 of them in 1911. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson made the \nofficial announcement proclaiming Mother's Day a national holiday, to \nbe held on the second Sunday in May each year. It is a tribute to Anna \nJarvis's mother that her daughter was so inspired and so persevering. \nIt is an equal tribute to countless other wonderful mothers that Anna \nJarvis's good idea spread so quickly. Today, Mother's Day is celebrated \nthroughout the United States and in many other nations as well.\n  Mother's Day sprang from a loving and loyal heart, not from the \navarice of any executive of the greeting card industry, the floral \ndelivery service, the chocolate candy manufacturers, or the restaurant \nbusiness. And despite all of the advertising these days aimed at \ngetting grateful families to spend money on ever-more extravagant gifts \nfor Mother's Day, the warm and caring feelings that inspired the day \nremain central to the observance. I know economists would like to see \nmore spending to boost the economy, but I am also sure that for most \nmothers, the best part of the day is the time spent with their \nfamilies. The hugs and laughter of her children, the pride in them that \nshe shares with her husband--these are the gems in the mother's crown \nand the gold in mother's vault.\n  This Sunday, as each of us calls or visits our mother, or pauses to \nhold close her dear memory, we can savor the warmth and caring of her \nhugs and the special accolade that was her smile of pride.\n  I close with another old poem, by Elizabeth Akers Allen, that for me \nis forever linked with Mother's Day: ``Rock Me to Sleep.'' I will offer \nit up to my own angel mother and to all other mothers who are angels as \nwell.\n\n                            Rock Me to Sleep\n\n     Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,\n     Make me a child again just for to-night!\n     Mother, come back from the echoless shore,\n     Take me again in your heart as of yore;\n     Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\n     Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\n     Over my slumbers your loving watch keep:--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of the years!\n     I am so weary of toil and of tears--\n     Toil without recompense, tears all in vain--\n     Take them, and give me my childhood again!\n     I have grown weary of dust and decay--\n     Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away;\n     Weary of sowing for others to reap;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\n     Mother, O Mother, my heart call for you!\n     Many a summer the grass has grown green,\n     Blossomed and faded, our faces between:\n     Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain,\n     Long I to-night for your presence again.\n     Come from the silence so long and so deep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Over my heart, in the days that are flown,\n     No love like mother-love ever has shone;\n     No other worship abides and endures--\n     Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:\n     None like a mother can charm away pain\n     From the sick soul and the world-weary brain.\n     Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,\n     Fall on your shoulders again as of old;\n     Let it drop over my forehead to-night,\n     Shading my faint eyes away from the light;\n     For with its sunny-edged shadows once more\n     Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;\n     Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Mother, dear Mother, the years have been long\n     Since I last listened your lullaby song:\n     Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seen\n     Womanhood's years have been only a dream.\n     Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,\n     With your light lashes just sweeping my face,\n     Never hereafter to wake or to weep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5940-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5940-S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE 2003 AAA SCHOOL SAFETY PATROL LIFESAVING MEDAL AWARD \n           WINNERS AND THE AAA NATIONAL PATROLLER OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate \ntoday the names of the young men and women who were selected to receive \nspecial awards from the American Automobile Association. Four safety \npatrollers received the 2003 AAA School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Medal \nAward, the highest honor given to members of the school safety patrol. \nAnother safety patroller received the special honor of the AAA National \nPatroller of the Year. They received their awards this past Sunday, May \n4, and I wanted to say how proud we are of them\n  There are roughly 500,000 members of the AAA School Safety Patrol in \nthis country, helping in over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young \npeople ensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, \nand back home in the afternoon.\n  Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But, on \noccasion, these volunteers must make split second decisions, placing \nthemselves in harm's way to save the lives of others. The heroic \nactions of this year's recipients exemplify this selflessness.\n  The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from Deshler, OH. Her \nname is Sadie Peters.\n  On the afternoon of May 2, 2002, Sadie, age 12, was on patrol \nassisting fellow students with crossing a busy intersection at Deshler \nElementary School.\n  Kaydi McGill, a three-year old girl, was with her grandmother at the \nintersection when Kaydi wandered away from the older woman into the \npath of an oncoming semi-truck. Seeing that Kaydi was in danger, Sadie \nimmediately threw down her patrol flag and sprang toward Kaydi, \ngrabbing her from in front of the semi-truck.\n  This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Lancaster, \nOH.\n  Cody Byers, age 13, was on morning duty at Fairfield Christian \nAcademy on January 22 overseeing a crosswalk with heavy pedestrian \ntraffic. The two traffic lanes in front of the school were filled with \ncars dropping off students for class.\n  Cody's safety patrol advisor, Mark Zeitman, saw a first grade student \nrace out of the school and head into traffic. he called out to Cody, \nwho took off after her and grabbed the youngster by the coat collar \njust before she ran into the street.\n  The next AAA Lifesaving Medal winners come from Burke, VA.\n  On the morning of November 1, 2002, Michael Butters, age 12, was at \nhis post at Holy Spirit School, monitoring a busy traffic circle where \nchildren are dropped off. Suddenly, Michael heard a teacher yell, ``Get \nher!''\n  A little girl had been playing a game of chase with her friends when \nshe broke away from the group. Not looking where she was running, she \nheaded right for the drop off area. Without hesitating, Michael ran to \nthe little girl and grabbed her backpack, saving her from being hit by \na car.\n  In addition to honoring safety patrollers with the Lifesaving Medal \nAward, AAA also recognizes the School Safety Patroller of the Year. \nThis award is presented to patrollers who perform duties above and \nbeyond their normal responsibilities and demonstrate outstanding \nleadership, dependability, and academic strength.\n  This year, the Safety Patroller of the Year goes to Kaaren Hatlen, \nage 11, Safety Patrol Captain at Bear Creek Elementary in Woodinville, \nWA.\n  Kaaren has been a member of the Bear Creek Elementary School Safety \nPatrol for the past 2 years. She established herself as a leader early \non and this year was selected as a captain of her safety patrol. She \nwas also selected for several leadership responsibilities, including \nthe newly created post of captain of Kindergarten Duty and team leader \nfor the sixth grade salmon tank.\n  Kaaren is always the first to volunteer to fill in for absent patrol \nmembers, even in the worst weather. She looks for potentially dangerous \nsituations and corrects problem before trouble can occur.\n  Kaaren is involved in school volleyball, math olympiad, chorus,\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\nband and the drama club. She participates in caroling at nursing homes, \nand makes crafts, food and toy drives for Hopelink, a local nonprofit \norganization. She is very active in the reading tutoring program, often \ngiving up her lunch recess to help others learn to be successful \nreaders. Kaaren is also an active member of her church and local Girl \nScout Troop and enjoys playing soccer, softball, basketball and \nswimming.\n  She and all of the other AAA winners deserve our thanks and applause.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I extend congratulations and thanks to these \nyoung men and women. They are assets to their communities, and their \nfamilies and neighbors should be very proud of their courage and \ndedication.\n  I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association \nfor providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety \npatrol on duty nationwide.\n  Since the 1920s, AAA clubs across the country have sponsored student \nsafety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against traffic \naccidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange safety belt \nand shoulder strap, safety patrol members represent the very best of \ntheir schools and communities. Experts credit school safety patrol \nprograms with helping to lower the number of traffic accidents and \nfatalities involving young children.\n  We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that \nour Nation's children arrive to and from school safe and sound. And we \nowe our thanks to these exceptional young men and women for their \nselfless actions. The discipline and courage they displayed deserves \nthe praise and recognition of their schools, their communities and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5941-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GAMING LAW POLICY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last month I had the wonderful opportunity \nto speak to students in a gaming law policy class at the William S. \nBoyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. As I am sure \nyou are aware, yesterday the Senator from Arizona reintroduced \nlegislation that would make it illegal to wager on college sports in \nNevada, where it is legal and heavily regulated. The legislation will \nnot solve the problems the sponsors of the legislation seek to solve. \nRecently, I received a letter from several students in the class who \nhave done a great deal of research on the subject. I share the views \nthey have, and I ask unanimous consent to print their letter in today's \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                    William S. Boyd School of Law,\n\n\n                             University of Nevada at Las Vegas\n\n                                    Las Vegas, NV, April 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: We write to you as members of the Gaming \n     Law Policy Class at the William S. Boyd School of Law at the \n     University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Our class includes \n     students from states that have no legal gaming, such as \n     Hawaii. One of the topics that our class has researched this \n     semester, under the direction of Adjunct Professors Tony \n     Cabot and Bob Faiss, is congressional legislation that would \n     outlaw collegiate sports wagering in Nevada casinos. After \n     researching this matter in detail, we have come to the \n     conclusion that such legislation would not effectively \n     address the problem that its proponents are trying to \n     correct.\n       We recognize this is the conclusion that you and the other \n     members of Nevada's congressional delegation have also \n     reached in your consideration of this subject. We have \n     reviewed the legislation that you co-sponsored with Senator \n     John Ensign during the last Congress and agree that this \n     approach would do much more to eradicate the problems created \n     by illegal sports wagering on college campuses.\n       Based on our in-depth analysis of this subject, we felt \n     compelled to send this formal expression of support for your \n     efforts. Our letter is not to be considered an official \n     expression of the law school. We have prepared it as \n     individuals sharing a common view.\n       Our examination of this subject has led us to the following \n     conclusions:\n       1. Banning collegiate sports wagering in Nevada would do \n     nothing to eradicate or reduce illegal collegiate sports \n     wagering. Banning gambling in Nevada is unlikely to end any \n     illegal gambling on college athletics. The amount of wagering \n     that takes place on collegiate sport wagering in Nevada is a \n     minuscule fraction of the overall amount of wagering that \n     takes place nationally. The money wagered in Nevada on \n     college athletics would flow to the domestic black market or \n     to offshore Internet gaming companies.\n       2. Nevada casinos actually assist law enforcement in \n     exposing illegal gambling schemes. Nevada sports books have a \n     proven record of uncovering suspicious gambling activity. \n     Absent the scrutiny of Nevada sports books, law enforcement \n     would have no real-time monitor on unusual wagering trends.\n       3. Nevada collegiate sports wagering is not the problem. \n     The money that is legally wagered in Nevada on college \n     athletics is only two percent of the estimated total amount \n     waged on college athletics across the country. The proponents \n     of legislation to outlaw collegiate sports wagering in Nevada \n     have presented no credible evidence that legal wagering in \n     Nevada is the cause of the problems such legislation is \n     attempting to correct.\n       4. The idea that Nevada encourages illegal wagering \n     throughout the rest of the country is without any factual \n     support. As stated, such wagering in Nevada comprises a very \n     small percentage of the total amount of wagering that occurs. \n     Newspapers, including USA Today, are on record as stating \n     that they will publish betting odds and point-spreads \n     regardless of whether wagering on college athletics is legal. \n     Offshore Internet sites would also continue to publish \n     betting odds and point-spreads.\n       5. Nevada sports book operators are highly regulated and \n     subject to intense scrutiny. Nevada sports book operators \n     have never been involved in a point-shaving scandal.\n       In conclusion, our research shows that banning regulated \n     wagering on college athletics in Nevada will not address the \n     problem of the influence of illegal wagering on student-\n     athletes and will, in fact, remove a tool that law \n     enforcement has to expose illegal betting schemes.\n       We therefore hope that others members of the Congress will \n     support the common-sense approach taken by you and the other \n     members of the Nevada delegation to address the problem of \n     illegal wagering on college athletics.\n           Respectfull,\n         Jeremy Aguero, Kevin Bumstead, Anthony Celeste, Zachary \n           Fritz, Edward Magaw, Nathan Miller, Shannon Okada, \n           Jennifer Stallard, Douglas Walker, Members of the 2003 \n           Gaming Law Policy Class.\n         Anthony Celeste, Nathan Miller, Student Project Chairmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5941-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5941-S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American, a \ngreat patriot, a courageous Airman, husband and father, LTC William \nWatkins III of Halifax County, VA.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Watkins fought so that our families--all \nAmericans--could lead our lives and freedoms in greater security. His \nmission was noble--and embodies the absolute greatest of the American \nideas.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Watkins' F-15 went down on April 7 near Tikrit, \nIraq. His courageous actions contributed to the success of our \nmission--the prevention of the spread of weapons of mass destruction, \nand the permanent removal of the heavy boot of oppression from the \nthroats of the Iraqi people.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Watkins left his home and family to travel around \nthe world to liberate an oppressed people--most whom he had never met. \nThere was no personal benefit, there was no monetary reward.\n  When Lieutenant Colonel Watkins was called to action, he knew the \nmission, the purpose and the goal was larger than one man. He answered \nhis country's call with a simple, ``yes sir''--steady in his love for \nthe cause of freedom.\n  Shortly after Lieutenant Colonel Watkins death, The Danville Register \nand Bee, his hometown paper, aptly noted:\n\n       We live in a safe, free and prosperous country because men \n     like Watkins have always been willing to sacrifice their \n     lives to protect the birthright of every American. It is a \n     sacrifice made on behalf of millions of people who don't have \n     to risk anything . . . Watkins' sacrifice on behalf of \n     freedom will help protect many lives in the future. The world \n     was better with Watkins in it, and it is safer because he was \n     willing to fight to make it that way.\n\n  Truer words were never written.\n  William Watkins was recently promoted to lieutenant colonel. A \npromotion well deserved. He graduated from the U.S. Naval academy in \n1989 and served as a flight officer in the Navy for 12 years. In 2001, \nhe transferred to the Air Force to continue his service to his \ncountry--where he served as a weapons system officer. He loved this \ncountry.\n  Serving our country wasn't something Lieutenant Colonel Watkins \n``did.'' It was something he lived. His wife, Major Melissa Watkins, \ncontinues to serve our country as an intelligence officer. And while we \nwill never know\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\nher and her children's loss or pain, we continue to hold them in prayer \nand support them in all ways possible.\n  No tribute, no speech will replace Lieutenant Colonel Watkins. His \nchildren will grow up never knowing this truly great American. He will \nbe missed. And, while it certainly does not fill the void left by his \ndeath, the greatest tribute to his life can be summed up by one act, \none moment that will live in each of our memories forever.\n  It is the moment that a free Iraqi people, liberated from the chains \nof oppression, gathered in central Baghdad, breathed their first \nbreaths of freedom and tore down the statue of the vile, ruthless \ndictator Saddam Hussein.\n  So, each time we see that footage of that historic event, each time \nwe hear of the end of Saddam's ruthless, torturous regime, each time an \nIraqi speaks their mind, we should, we must, remember the sacrifices of \ngreat, giving American servicemen and women like LTC William Watkins.\n  May he rest in peace, knowing how grateful we are and that we will \nsupport his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5942-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REQUEST FOR SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL--S. 1035\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

A 30 year-old Muslim man was assaulted by a group \nof six to eight men. The attackers shouted anti-Arab insults and pelted \nhim with stones. The attackers fled before authorities could apprehend \nthem.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5942-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nNurses Week, celebrated this year from May 5 through May 12. Our annual \ntribute to the women and men who give comfort to the ill and injured \nacross the country reminds us that nurses stand daily on the front \nlines of the health care profession. This year, however, we should also \nbe reminded of the brave nursing professionals who serve on and behind \nthe front lines of battle: America's military nurses. With our campaign \nin Iraq coming to a close, it is fitting to honor the patriots who mend \nand support our Armed Forces in the field, in addition to those who \nkeep us healthy at home.\n  The first official military nurse corps in the United States was \nestablished in the Army at the turn of the last century. American \nwomen, however, had served as combat nurses in every major conflict \nsince the Revolutionary War and, until the creation of the Army Nurse \nCorps, did so without recognition and as volunteers. In grade school we \nlearned the story of Clara Barton and the gracious care she gave to \nsoldiers wounded in the Civil War. But there were many women throughout \nAmerican history--quite often the wives, mothers, daughters, and \nsisters of military men--who took up the role of nurse and treated the \ninjured. They were compelled by genuine concern, kindness, and \npatriotism, and they used whatever supplies were available to them in \ntheir homes and neighborhoods.\n  In the First and Second World Wars, nursing was the predominant \nservice women were allowed to perform as participating members of the \nmilitary. During these wars and in conflicts since, nurses have \nsacrificed their safety and, at times, their lives in serving overseas \nas medical professionals. Here in our Nation's Capital, as part of the \nVietnam Memorial on the National Mall, there is a very poignant statue \ndedicated to the nurses who joined our troops in Southeast Asia. The \nimage illustrates the important integration of medical care givers in \nsuccessful military operations and the strength of these women who \ntraveled to Vietnam and faced the same dangers and perils our soldiers \ndid. In the gulf war, Afghanistan, and Iraq, military nurses have \ncontinued to exhibit this resolve and calm while tending to our Armed \nForces. For a wounded soldier abroad, I can imagine no greater comfort.\n  My appreciation for those who serve our communities and our Nation \nthrough the nursing profession stems from my experiences growing up on \nthe campus of a Veterans Administration, VA, hospital. Additionally, my \nmother, sister, and wife all have nursing backgrounds and I have \nwitnessed their commitment to quality health care and to their patients \nthroughout my life. As we honor the women and men who are dedicated to \nthis profession in clinics, hospitals, and VA facilities across\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\nthe country, we also honor those nurses who are themselves veterans. \nThey are soldiers of a different, yet equally brave, stripe and they \nare certainly heroes to the wounded troops they help to bring home. I \nhope my Senate colleagues will join me in recognizing and thanking \nAmerica's nurses, military and civilian, for the incredible, \nindispensable, and courageous work they do.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I commend the 20,000 registered nurses \nworking in Nebraska as we celebrate National Nurses Week. From May 6-\n12, we recognize the diverse ways in which registered nurses, the \nlargest health care profession, are working to improve health care. \nFrom bedside nursing in hospitals and long-term care facilities to the \nhalls of research institutions, State legislatures, and Congress, the \ndepth and breadth of the nursing profession is meeting the expanding \nhealth care needs of American society.\n  I also urge more Nebraskans to consider nursing as a career. Although \nnursing is one of the most noble professions, more nurses are \ndesperately needed. The Department of Health and Human Services \npredicts that the number of nursing vacancies nationwide will rise from \nits current total of 126,000 to 275,000 in 2010. The shortage of nurses \nin Nebraska is also reaching epidemic proportions, with one in 10 \nnursing positions unfilled.\n  My colleagues and I want to provide more educational opportunities \nfor people who want to become nurses. In response to the national \nnursing shortage, the Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 was signed into \nlaw in August 2002. The Nurse Reinvestment Act provides scholarships to \nnursing students who agree to provide 2 years of service in a health \ncare facility with a critical nursing shortage. It also allows for the \ncanceling of up to 85 percent of a student's graduate studies loans if \nthey later teach at a school of nursing. The act also provides grants \nto improve nurse education, practice, and retention as well as a \nprogram for training and education in geriatric care that will enable \nnurses to better serve the growing population of older Americans. State \nand national public service announcements will promote nursing and \nraise awareness of the financial assistance that is available.\n  A loan forgiveness program is also available. The Nurse Education \nLoan Repayment Program will pay 60 percent, or up to $30,000, of an \nRN's student loan balance in exchange for 2 years of service. If an \neligible participant elects to stay for another year, an additional 25 \npercent of the loan, or up to $7500, will be repaid.\n  Nebraska also has a loan forgiveness program for nursing students. A \nlimited amount of $1,000 loans are awarded each year. The loan is \nforgiven if the graduate practices nursing in Nebraska for at least 1 \nyear following graduation.\n  Again, I commend the work of Nebraska's nurses and send my best \nwishes during National Nurses Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5943-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FLORIDA VETERANS MOBILE SERVICE CENTER COMES TO THE HILL\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I am enormously proud that on \nTuesday, the Florida Veterans Mobile Service Center came to Capitol \nHill as part of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans Annual \nMembership Meeting and Conference.\n  The Florida Veterans Mobile Service Center is a 40-foot van equipped \nwith two exam rooms, as well as facilities for dental care. The Center \ntravels the State of Florida providing care to homeless veterans who \nlive in rural encampments. The unit offers homeless veterans immediate \nassistance of food and clothing, health screening and assessment, VA \nbenefit determination and counseling, as well as assessment of housing, \nmental health, substance abuse, employment, educational and vocational \nneeds. That the Center is mobile, allows its team--comprised of staff \nfrom Volunteers of America and Department of Veterans Affairs--to go \nwhere their assistance is most needed.\n  This community service provider offers homeless veterans a unique way \nto receive quality care while still ensuring their sense of dignity and \nrespect. I take pride in the fact that my State offers this initiative, \neffective source of help to our Nation's veterans. We all owe those who \nrisked their lives defending this country a debt of gratitude, and I am \nso thankful to the Center's hardworking, compassionate team for doing \ntheir part in paying that debt.\n  I especially want to point out the dedication of Scott Martin, who \ndrove more than 900 miles to bring the Florida Veterans Mobile Service \nCenter from Tampa, FL, to Washington, DC. I also would like to thank \nKathryn Spearman, president and CEO of Volunteers of America of \nFlorida, Ray Tuller, chief financial officer of Volunteers of America \nof Florida, and Ed Quill, director of external affairs for Volunteers \nof America of Florida, all of whom joined Scott here in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5943-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5943-S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARLENE PERLING\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask that the following article \nrecognizing the generosity of Marlene Perling toward Zachary Wood and \nhis family be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Duluth News Tribune, May 8, 2003]\n\nA Stranger . . . a Boy . . . a Gift; a Widow's Offer to the Family of a \n    Disabled 10-year-old Fulfills Her Wish and Zachary Wood's Dream\n\n                          (By Chuck Frederick)\n\n       International Falls, Minn.--Fourth-grader Zachary Wood and \n     his family are still numb, perhaps from pinching themselves \n     so much.\n       Two weeks ago, Zachary's dad, Terry Wood, was raking the \n     yard when a neighbor dropped by, wondering if the family was \n     interested in a used van with a wheelchair lift. Zachary has \n     spina bifida and has used a wheelchair since he was a \n     toddler. A new van with a lift was definitely in the family's \n     future--perhaps next year, Terry Wood thought, when their \n     current car was paid off.\n       The neighbor leaned in.\n       ``You really should take a look at this van,'' he said. ``I \n     think you can get a really good deal.''\n       So Terry Wood hoisted Zachary, 10, into the family car as \n     his wife, Tammy, and 15-year-old daughter, Jenna, hopped in. \n     They motored to nearby Rainy Lake. It was a nice van--full-\n     size Ford, motorized lift, low miles and no rust.\n       ``I'm supposed to show you the pontoon boat and house, \n     too,'' said the Woods' neighbor, a cousin of the home's \n     owner.\n       ``Uh, sure,'' said the Woods, a bit puzzled. But they \n     decided not to pass up a chance to check out a beautiful \n     lakefront property.\n       The boat and the house were, like the van, equipped with \n     ramps and sturdy, level surfaces that made it easy for \n     Zachary to get around. He wheeled across wide decks with \n     breathtaking lake vistas. Inside, he rolled under knotty pine \n     ceilings. The house even had an elevator.\n       ``It's fantastic. Thanks for the tour,'' Terry Wood said. \n     He started to ask about the van and its price, but the \n     neighbor interrupted.\n       ``Now, couldn't you kids just picture yourself living \n     here?'' he asked.\n       ``Yeah, right, in our dreams,'' said Terry Wood, an \n     International Falls police officer for 13 years.\n       ``Maybe if we win the lottery,'' said Tammy Wood, who works \n     at Rainy Lake Community College.\n       The both laughed, but sometimes dreams come true.\n\n\n                          summers on the lake\n\n       David Perling was born in International Falls and grew up \n     in Iowa. When he was 15, he and some buddies were goofing \n     around on a wagon, throwing hay at each other. Perling weaved \n     to the side to avoid an attack, but lost his balance and \n     crashed to the ground. The wagon rolled over him twice, \n     paralyzing him.\n       He went on to become an electrical engineer. Six years ago, \n     he and his wife decided they wanted to spend summers back in \n     his hometown and on Rainy Lake. His late uncle's place was \n     available. It would be perfect for escaping the triple-digit \n     heat in Arizona, where David and Marlene Perling lived for \n     more than three decades.\n       They lived at Rainy Lake for six straight summers. It was \n     their place. The sun rises over Canada. The loons call.\n       They planned to return this summer, too. But in January, \n     David Perling suffered a stroke and died. He was 61.\n       A Rainy Lake neighbor called Marlene Perling in the spring \n     about buying the lakefront place. She didn't know what to \n     say.\n       ``I can never put a price on this house. To me it's just \n     priceless,'' she said. ``But I also know that I could never \n     come up without David. I cried a ton of tears. I knew I just \n     couldn't sell this place.''\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\n       She prayed for an answer. And then it came to her.\n       ``I decided I wanted to give it to a family who could \n     benefit from it, who could enjoy it as much as David and I \n     enjoyed it those six years,'' she said. ``That's what I \n     decided I wanted to do. It was all a very sudden thing, but \n     it's also the right thing.''\n       Marlene Perling's cousin Dorlyn Desens of International \n     Falls heard of her intentions. He immediately thought of the \n     nice family living across the street. How many times had he \n     seen the father lift the little boy from his wheelchair to \n     place him in the car? How much longer could his back tolerate \n     the strain?\n       Desens spotted Terry Wood outside raking. He went over to \n     chat.\n\n\n                           DREAM BECOMES REAL\n\n       At the lake house two weeks ago, Desens put Terry and Tammy \n     Wood on the phone with his cousin.\n       ``How do you like the van?'' Marlene Perling asked.\n       ``The rest of the conversation is a blur to me,'' Terry \n     Wood said Tuesday. He agreed it went something like this:\n       The Woods: ``Very nice. But we're not sure we can buy it \n     right now. We're still paying off our car and we just built a \n     house.'' Their house in town is 2\\1/2\\ years old.\n       Perling: ``Well then, just take it.''\n       The Woods: ``What do you mean? Just take the van?''\n       Perling: ``Take it all. The house. The boat. The van. It's \n     all free. I just want you to enjoy it. Please enjoy it.''\n       ``That's when our knees started shaking and Tammy started \n     crying,'' Terry Wood said. ``It's a pretty incredible story, \n     huh? We're still floating.''\n       ``I know it's meant to be,'' Perling said. ``God \n     orchestrated this whole thing. He took me step by step. He \n     led me to this family. I asked God to show me a family who \n     could benefit from this. They are all that and more.''\n\n\n                           ZACHARY CAN'T WAIT\n\n       Zachary is most eager to go fishing with his grandfather. \n     The boy has had 29 surgeries since birth. His spinal cord \n     never developed completely. He suffers respiratory problems, \n     and his vocal cords are paralyzed.\n       His prognosis is good, however; he's expected to lead a \n     full life, his parents said.\n       But he has never been able to get in a boat with his \n     grandfather until now.\n       On Monday, Marlene Perling and the Woods gathered in a \n     lawyer's office in International Falls. She signed over the \n     deed. She even decided to leave behind all the leather and \n     woodsy moose-motif furniture. It was too much of a hassle to \n     take back to Arizona, she said; the moving company wanted \n     more than $7,000.\n       The Woods plan to move into their new home after school \n     lets out. With the place fully furnished, they plan to keep \n     only their most cherished possessions.\n       The rest?\n       ``Give it away,'' Tammy Wood said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5944-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Oregonian \nLaure Trickel, a coronary care nurse who is saving the lives of Oregon \nteenagers through her Heart Ready High Schools Program. Because Laure \nsaw an impending health threat in Oregon schools, envisioned a solution \nand made every effort to implement her plan, she is an Oregon ``Health \nCare Hero.''\n  Over the past few years, Oregonians have seen several cardiac events \nthreaten the lives of Oregon teenagers during school-sponsored sporting \nevents. Tragically, we have lost more than one treasured teen to an \nunexpected heart attack on the fields and courts of our schools.\n  Two cardiac events occurred at Ashland High School in Laure Trickel's \nsouthern Oregon hometown. As a coronary care nurse, Laure quickly saw \nthat high schools were simply not prepared to deal with these events, \nwhere time is of the essence and technology is critical to saving \nlives. In Laure's own words, ``Although a high school could be as \nprepared as possible for a person with a weapon of violence, it was not \nat all prepared for the number one killer of Americans: heart disease \nand sudden cardiac arrest.''\n  In response, Laure created the Heart Ready High Schools Program, \nasking local hospitals to donate automated external defibrillators, \nAED, to local high schools. She also asked the hospitals to provide \ntraining for staff and students, to ensure that the school would be \nready to effectively respond in an emergency should another tragedy \noccur.\n  After the first donation by Ashland Community Hospital, several other \nOregon hospitals caught Laure's vision and decided to help. I join the \nparents of students at Ashland, Crater, Eagle Point, Butte Falls, and \nProspect high schools in thanking Ashland Community Hospital, Rogue \nValley Medical Center, the Children's Miracle Network, Providence, and \nMedford Medical Center for making these lifesaving devices and training \navailable. Since that time, Merle West Medical Center and the KMSB \nFoundation have provided similar equipment and skill training to three \nKlamath Falls high schools, spreading this critical program further \nacross our State.\n  These are difficult financial times for both schools and hospitals, \nand I applaud these community hospitals for responding to this great \nneed with their time and limited funds. Many Oregon students will owe \ntheir lives to the quick emergency treatment they will receive should a \ncardiac event occur.\n  Most of all, I am grateful to Laure Trickel for finding a way to \nprevent needless death among Oregon students. Making a difference \nrequires vision, great courage, a willingness to ask for help, and \nfollowing through. Laure has done all these things, and we owe her our \ngreat thanks. She is a true ``Health Care Hero'' for Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5944-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5944-S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVLON RUN/WALK FOR WOMEN IN \n                              LOS ANGELES\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \nefforts of the more than 60,000 men, women, and children who will be \nmeeting at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at Exposition Park on \nSaturday, May 10, 2003, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Revlon \nRun/Walk and to raise funds for women's cancers. The largest 5K event \nin the Nation, the Revlon Run/Walk, presented by the Entertainment \nIndustry Foundation, EFT, and cochaired by Ellen Barkin, Ronald O. \nPerelman and Lilly Tartikoff, will raise funds to target research that \nwill contribute to the development of important new therapies, such as \nHerceptin to treat breast cancer, the first in the wave of new targeted \ncancer treatments.\n  To date, the Revlon Run/Walk in Los Angeles and New York has raised \nmore than $27 million since its beginning in Los Angeles a decade ago. \nThe Revlon Run/Walk in Los Angeles will be hosted by Debra Messing and \nBilly Crystal along with Revlon spokespersons Karen Duffy and Jaime \nKing.\n  The Los Angeles area beneficiaries for 2003 include: The Revlon/UCLA \nWomen's Cancer Research Program, National Women's Cancer Research \nAlliance (NWCRA), the Wellness Community, WIN Against Breast Cancer, \nUSC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital Ovarian & Breast \nCancer Program, the UCLA Digital Mammography Program, T.H.E., The Help \nEveryone, Clinic, Inc., Los Angeles Breast Cancer Alliance, John Wayne \nCancer Institute, Breast Cancer Research Program, Women of Color Breast \nCancer Survivors Support Program, Team Survivor Los Angeles, Providence \nSaint Joseph Foundation, Art of Healing--Women's Health, Gilda Radner \nOvarian and Breast Cancer Detection Program at Cedars Sinai Medical \nCenter, Asian Pacific Health Care Venture, Inc. (ACPHCV), and weSpark.\n  Today, 1 in 27 American women will die of breast cancer. According to \nthe American Cancer Society, every 2.5 minutes a woman is diagnosed \nwith breast cancer, every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer, and \nthis year alone 54,100 women will lose their lives to breast and \novarian cancer. For a woman with ovarian cancer today, there is still \nno method of early detection.\n  In my home State of California, the American Cancer Society is \npredicting this year that more than 26,300 women will be diagnosed with \nbreast and other women cancers and more than 5,500 grandmothers, \nmothers, wives, daughters, sisters, cousins, and friends will die.\n  The facts serve as a reminder that there is still so much to be done. \nMammograms are a proven method of early detection. Unfortunately a \nlarge portion of women are not getting screened.\n  The continuing fight requires many levels of commitment and I want to \ncongratulate all those individuals involved in this worthwhile event as \nthey celebrate both Mother's Day and the 10-year anniversary of the \nRevlon Run/Walk. The thousands running in Los\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nAngeles represent the millions hoping for an end to cancer.

Mr. President, today, I rise to speak about the \nimportance of the Asian-Pacific American experience in my home State of \nMinnesota. During this month, designated Asian-Pacific American \nHeritage Month, we are proud to celebrate the many ways in which the \nculture of our Asian citizens enriches us as Minnesotans and Americans.\n  In Minnesota, we celebrate with a myriad of public events throughout \nthe State, including a Burmese cultural exhibition, dance workshops, \nmusical performances, picnics, banquets, flea markets, and festivals. \nFor this year's theme, the Minnesota State Council on Asian-Pacific \nMinnesotans has chosen ``Experience Freedom,'' a thread which runs \nthrough the stories of so many Asian Americans.\n  Each generation of immigrants to this country has pursued a freedom \nnot known in their homelands. Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino settlers \nsought out Minnesota in the late 19th century, hoping to find broad \neconomic opportunities. This same goal motivated Korean and other Asian \nimmigrants who left their countries to find unparalleled opportunities.\n  More recently, Asians have come to Minnesota seeking refuge from war. \nTibetans, Hmong, Vietnamese, and Cambodians escaped from a country \nravaged by war and unrest. Here, they found freedom, peace, and new \navenues for fulfillment, and achievement. I am especially proud to say \nthat with the recent election of State Representative Cy Thao, \nMinnesota now has two legislators of Hmong descent.\n  Thanks to the infusion of Asian-Pacific influences, Minnesota \nvirtually vibrates with new ideas, philosophies, and folkways. \nIndividually and collectively, Asian-Pacific citizens have made \nsignificant contributions to their communities, accomplishments which \nthe State Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans recognizes by conferring \nfour Annual Leadership Awards. I am pleased to join in honoring these \noutstanding individuals and organizations.\n  Jasmine Dinh has received the Professional Leadership and Community \nService Award. Her commitment to public service has led her to cofound \nAsian Women United of Minnesota, a nonprofit organization devoted to \nending violence against Asian women; to create a battered women's \nshelter in Minneapolis, one of the few focused on Asian American women; \nto serve on the staff of United States Representative Bill Luther; and \nto become deeply involved in the Vietnamese Community of Minnesota \nOrganization. Recently, she opened her own business, Jasmine's Coffee \nand Tea House, while still working full time as a senior program \nmanager for the Minnesota Partnership for Action Against Tobacco.\n  Jodie Tanaka has been recognized with the Professional Leadership \nAward. The owner, CEO, and president of Tanaka Advertisting, a business \nestablished by her father, Jodie developed the company into the highly \nsuccessful entity it is today. Among her clients, she counts other \nnotable Minnesota companies, including U.S. Bank, the Minnesota Twins, \nNorthwest Airlines, and Davanni's. Her hard work and excellence in her \nfield have consistently been acknowledged by awards from Minnesota's \ncommunity of business professionals.\n  Dragon Festival Planning Committee is this year's Community Service \nAward winner. The committee has built on the original Asian American \nFestival, a lively and popular annual event since 1997. The newly named \nDragon Festival has grown to include not only a parade but also a \ndragon boat race.\n  Kogen Taiko, players of traditional Japanese drums, have received \nthis year's award for community service and excellence in the arts. The \noldest taiko drumming ensemble in Minnesota, Kogen Taiko, preserves \nJapanese drumming techniques while also incorporating multiple American \nrhythms. The result is original Japanese-American music. The group's \nperformances have movingly affirmed the sometimes painful Japanese \nexperience in America. In addition, they are extensively involved in \nthe community, having used proceeds from a benefit concert to help pay \nmedical bills for a deceased friend and to establish an education fund \nfor his children.\n  In addition to these distinguished Leadership Award winners, I would \nlike to pay tribute to two other remarkable people.\n  Adeel Lari served as president of the Council on Asian-Pacific \nMinnesotans from 1994 to 2002. Thanks to his leadership, the council \nhas become a driving force in educating the larger community about \nmatters important to Asians in Minnesota. Adeel has also spent the past \n28 years at the Minnesota Department of Transportation. His dedication \nto his community is exemplary.\n  Minneapolis Police Officer Duy Ngo has served the department \nhonorably for over 5 years and was recently assigned to the Minnesota \nGang Strike Force, helping to curb gang membership and violence in our \nState.

However, our national leaders in times of stress \n     have called upon our belief and trust in a superior being to \n     see this nation through difficult times, and have \n     acknowledged the continuous presence of our God by inscribing \n     on our currency the reassuring phrase ``In God we trust'' and \n     by including the phrase ``one Nation under God'' in our \n     pledge of allegiance; and\n       Whereas, the strength of a nation can be measured in its \n     citizens' desire for domestic tranquility and in their \n     abiding belief in a supreme being. Accordingly, it is urged \n     upon the Congress of the United States that this basic \n     requirement of a great nation be recognized by amending our \n     constitution as follows: ``Resolved by the Senate and House \n     of Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring \n     therein), that the following article is proposed as an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which \n     shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the \n     Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-\n     fourths of the several states within seven years after the \n     date of its submission for ratification:\n       Section 1. The first amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States shall not be construed to prohibit the \n     recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, which \n     shall be, `I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United \n     States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, \n     one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice \n     for all.'\n       Section 2. The first amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States shall not be construed to prohibit the \n     recitation or use of the national motto, which shall be, `In \n     God we trust' ''; and\n       Whereas, we urge Congress to pass this Constitutional \n     Amendment and to send it on to the individual states for \n     their approval: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to seek a \n     constitutional amendment to protect the pledge of allegiance \n     and our national motto; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be directed to \n     provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President \n     of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     of the United States Congress and to each member of the \n     Kansas Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-95. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Delaware relative to Free \n     Trade; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, the United States should promote the values of \n     freedom, democracy, and a commitment to open markets and the \n     free exchange of both goods and ideas at home and abroad; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of China on Taiwan shares these \n     values with the United States and has struggled throughout \n     the past 50 years to create what is today an open and \n     thriving democracy; and\n       Whereas, the United States must continue to support the \n     growth of democracy and ongoing market opening in Taiwan if \n     this relationship is to evolve and reflect the changing \n     nature of the global system in the 21st Century; and\n       Whereas, despite the fact that Taiwan only recently became \n     a member of the World Trade Organization and that it has no \n     formal trade agreement with the United States, Taiwan has \n     nevertheless emerged as the United States' eighth largest \n     trading partner; and\n       Whereas, American business and workers have benefited \n     greatly from this dynamic trade relationship, most recently \n     in the computer and electronics sector; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is a gateway to other Pacific Rim markets \n     for United States exports, helping to preserve peace and \n     stability within the entire region; and\n       Whereas, United States agricultural procedures have been \n     particularly under represented in the list of United States \n     exports to the region, despite the importance of the markets \n     for growers of corn, wheat, and soybeans; and\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement would not only help \n     Taiwan's economy dramatically expand its already growing \n     entrepreneurial class, but it would also serve an important \n     political function; and\n       Whereas, the United States needs to support partner \n     countries that are lowering trade barriers; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has emerged the past two decades as one of \n     the United States' most important allies in Asia and \n     throughout the world; and\n       Whereas, in the interest of supporting, preserving and \n     protecting the democratic fabric of the government of Taiwan, \n     it is made clear that the United States supports the \n     withdrawal of missiles deployed as a threat again Taiwan by \n     the People's Republic of China; and\n       Whereas, it is in the interest of the United States to \n     encourage the development of both these institutions; and\n       Whereas, the United States has an obligation to its allies \n     and it its own citizens to encourage economic growth, market \n     opening, and the destruction of trade barriers as a means of \n     raising living standards across the board; and\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement with Taiwan would be a \n     positive step toward accomplishing all of these goals: Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the 142nd \n     General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the Senate \n     concurring therein, That the Bush Administration be \n     encouraged to support a free trade agreement between the \n     United States and Taiwan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States policy should include the \n     pursuit of some initiative in the World Trade Organization \n     which will give Taiwan meaningful participation in a manner \n     that is consistent with the organization's requirements; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the United States Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Government of \n     Taiwan, the World Trade Organization, and the members of \n     Delaware's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-96. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia relative to nitrogen reduction \n     technology; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 424\n\n       Whereas, the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are \n     national treasures that play a vital role in many sectors of \n     Virginia's economy including the commercial seafood, \n     recreational fishing, and tourism industries; and\n       Whereas, while significant progress has been made in \n     restoring the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, they remain \n     in a significantly degraded condition; and\n       Whereas, nitrogen pollution, the most serious problem \n     facing water quality in the Bay today, results in excessive \n     algae growth that clouds water, depletes oxygen, and severely \n     impacts vital bay grasses, young fish, and crabs; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth is a signatory to the Chesapeake \n     2000 Agreement, in which Virginia pledged to significantly \n     reduce nitrogen pollution sufficient to remove the Chesapeake \n     Bay from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's \n     impaired waters list by 2010; and\n       Whereas, upgrading sewage treatment plants, which currently \n     contribute 61 million pounds of nitrogen annually to the Bay, \n     is one of the most cost-effective steps that can be taken to \n     significantly reduce nitrogen pollution; and\n       Whereas, sewage treatment plants in Virginia discharge up \n     to 25 milligrams of nitrogen per liter of wastewater, while \n     current technology allows the nitrogen content of treated \n     wastewater to be reduced to only three milligrams per liter; \n     and\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\n       Whereas, United States Senators of Virginia and the United \n     States House of Representatives from the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, \n     8th, 10th, and 11th Virginia Congressional Districts have \n     introduced legislation to provide cost-share grant funding to \n     allow Bay watershed sewage treatment plants to substantially \n     reduce their nitrogen pollution by installing NRT: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to adopt \n     legislation in support of funding for nitrogen reduction \n     technology (NRT) in the 108th Congress; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     and the members of the Virginia Congressional Delegation so \n     that they may be apprised of the sense of the General \n     Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-97. A resolution adopted by the Chemung County \n     Legislature of the State of New York relative to the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n       POM-98. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan relative to the \n     Funding of Transportation Initiatives by the Federal \n     Government; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, for several decades, Michigan has sent much more \n     federal highway tax money to Washington than it has received \n     in return. This imbalance has helped our nation build the \n     country's highway infrastructure. With the national \n     infrastructure largely completed, the continuation of the \n     imbalance has created a serious challenge for Michigan and \n     other ``donor states''; and\n       Whereas, Michigan, which typically loses between $150 \n     million and $400 million each year by sending more to \n     Washington than it receives, is severely hampered. The unfair \n     practice of contributing hundreds of millions of dollars \n     beyond the amount we receive to fund projects in other parts \n     of the country makes it far more difficult for Michigan to \n     maintain the quality of its highways. The loss of funding \n     also represents a serious loss of economic activity; and\n       Whereas, the chairman of the House Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee and the chairman of the Senate \n     Environment and Public Works Committee in Congress have \n     proposed a major change in how federal highway funds are \n     distributed. They have called for a funding formula that \n     would guarantee that all states receive a minimum of 95 \n     percent of what they each contribute to the federal highway \n     program; and\n       Whereas, the potential impact for Michigan of a guarantee \n     of at least 95 percent of this funding would be very \n     significant. Even as the economy calls for more careful \n     public expenditures, this proposed policy change would help \n     Michigan and bring greater fairness to the issue of \n     transportation spending. Citizens, visitors, and businesses \n     of this state would benefit enormously from this long overdue \n     policy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact legislation to provide that all states \n     receive a minimum of 95 percent of transportation funds sent \n     to the federal government and to urge Congress to make the \n     return of transportation money to the states a higher \n     priority within existing federal revenues; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-99. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan relative to \n     reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, the Interstate Traveler Project is an elevated \n     maglev (magnetic levitation) rail mass transit system that is \n     based upon a conduit cluster concept powered by hydrogen and \n     solar power. The project promises to provide travelers with a \n     clean, quiet, safe, reliable mode of transportation. The \n     intent of the project is to create the world's first \n     switchable maglev rail network that will provide inter-urban/\n     inter-city pedestrian, automobile, and light freight transit \n     services. The project will simultaneously produce, store, and \n     distribute hydrogen, which will not only serve as an \n     alternative energy resource, but also will give Michigan's \n     automakers the incentive to produce hydrogen internal \n     combustion engines, fuel cell cars, and the manufacturing \n     opportunity to build maglev rail cars; and\n       Whereas, by fully integrating with the interstate highway \n     system, existing transportation infrastructure, and mass \n     transmit systems, the Interstate Traveler Project seeks to \n     reduce traffic congestion and air pollution while improving \n     traffic safety and efficiency. The Interstate Traveler \n     Project substations will utilize the existing interstate \n     highway system's entrances and exits, providing a seamless \n     link of private automobiles, pedestrian traffic, existing \n     municipal bus routes, and tax services. These substations \n     will also support the hydrogen distribution system, as well \n     as fiber optics, water, electricity, and other utilities. \n     Although the Interstate Traveler Project is ideally suited \n     for the interstate highway, system, it may also be integrated \n     with existing and abandoned railroad right-of-ways or along \n     other appropriate lands; and\n       Whereas, the Interstate Traveler Project is consistent with \n     the 2003 State-of-the-Union address which called on Congress \n     to appropriate $1.2 billion for hydrogen fuel cell \n     technology: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to enact legislation to support \n     research, development, and construction of the Interstate \n     Traveler Project through the reauthorization of the \n     Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century (TEA-21) and/or \n     other related federal programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-100.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to carry out a \nprogram, known as the Northern Border Prosecution Initiative, to \nprovide funds to northern States to reimburse county and municipal \ngovernments for costs associated with certain criminal activities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today my colleagues and I introduce the \nNorthern Border Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative. This bill \noutlines an important initiative that would give our northern border \nStates and counties financial assistance in prosecuting criminal and \nimmigration-related cases that arise because of proximity to the \nborder. I thank my fellow northern border Senators and cosponsors, \nSenators Crapo, Murry, Murkowski, Leahy, Clinton and Schumer for \njoining with me to introduce and work to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  This initiative is modeled on a successful program already in place \nfor southern border States. The Southern Border Prosecution Initiative \nallows States and counties to apply for reimbursement of costs incurred \nin any federally initiated or declined-referred criminal case. The \nprogram is targeted at immigration-related cases, but is not limited \nonly to cases involving immigration charges. Cases arising out of \nimmigration issues but ranging from a misdemeanor property charge to a \nfelony drug conviction are eligible for reimbursement under the \nsouthern border program. The program proposed in the legislation \nintroduced today would be operated in the same way.\n  Federal agencies--such as the Border Patrol and INS--have ongoing \nefforts to police the Nation's borders, resulting in hundreds of \narrests each year. For many reasons, some of those cases are not \npursued by Federal law enforcement authorities and instead are handed \noff to State or county officials for further prosecution. Instead of \nasking States to absorb those costs--likely at the expense of other \nimportant local law enforcement initiatives--the Northern Border \nProsecution Reimbursement Initiative allows States and counties to \nreceive compensation for pursuing these immigration-related cases.\n  The Northern Border Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative would be \nadministered by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice \nAssistance. States and counties would be able to apply for \nreimbursement during an annual application period, with no limit on the \nnumber of cases submitted. Under the act, funds distribution is not \nbased on the size or population of a northern border State, but upon \nthe number of eligible cases submitted by each jurisdiction. It is \npossible for reimbursement to equal 100 percent of costs, though money \nis distributed on a pro rata basis if applications exceed available \nrevenues. Each of the 14 States along the northern border would be \neligible for the reimbursement program: Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.\n  Last year, $40 million was provided to southern border States \nArizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, offsetting the costs of \nprosecuting immigration-related cases. For 2002, $50 million was \nallocated to the program. My legislation simply authorizes $28 million \nfor Fiscal Year 2004 be made available to northern border states for \nthe same purpose.\n\n  In the years leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, activity along the \nnorthern border had shifted primarily from a focus on immigration \nissues to those related to\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\ntrade and commerce. However, homeland security has grown into a \nparamount concern in the wake of the 2001 terror attacks, and our \nStates and local governments are increasingly bearing an unfair \nfinancial burden in protecting and patrolling our national borders. \nThere are hundreds of crossings along the 4,000 mile long northern \nborder between the United States and Canada, and though improvements \nhave been made to tighten security, the northern border has yet to \nreceive the resources it needs to adequately enforce our Nation's \nimmigration laws and border restrictions.\n  The need for greater enforcement efforts along the northern border \nbecame glaringly evident in 1998 when Ahmed Ressam, a terrorist trained \nat one of Osama bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan, was arrested \nshortly after crossing the Canadian border into Washington State. \nExplosives and other bomb-making materials were found in the trunk of \nRessam's car. This frightening incident made clear the vulnerabilities \nwe face along the porous northern border, vulnerabilities that became \neven more concerning after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n  In the last two years, the Senate has taken steps to improve northern \nborder security. I have worked with Senators from the 14 States that \ncomprise the northern border--including my colleagues who join me as \ncosponsors on this legislation today--and we have successfully devoted \nmore resources to northern border security efforts. The 2001 Department \nof Defense Appropriation's bill included $55.8 million for 500 \nadditional Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors along the \nnorthern border--a 105 percent increase in staffing levels. That \nlegislation also provided $23.9 million to transfer 100 border patrol \nagents and hire 100 new agents. Working to protect our northern border \nhas been a bipartisan effort, enjoying cooperation from senators across \nthe aisle and across the country. Now it is time to take another step \ntoward greater border and national security and approve the Northern \nBorder Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative.\n  The costs of homeland security are increasingly being borne by States \nand local governments, an issue that this legislation tackles head-on. \nWithout giving States and counties the necessary resources to pay for \ncases initiated by Federal authorities, other important local law \nenforcement initiatives will undoubtedly be shortchanged. States and \nthe Federal Government must work together if our borders are to be \ntruly safe. The Northern Border Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative is \na mechanism by which all of the resources of the criminal justice \nsystem--local, State, and Federal--can work in harmony.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Older \nAmericans Tax Fairness Act of 2003. My bill would completely eliminate \nthe unjust taxation of Social Security benefits once and for all. The \nunderlying premise of my legislation is simple: Social Security \nbenefits were never intended to be taxed. At its inception and \ncontinuing on for the next fifty years, Social Security benefits were \nexempt from taxation. Budgetary shortfalls in 1984 and 1993, however, \nled to the taxation of these benefits.\n  Because of the rising cost of living, many of our seniors are forced \nto work past age 65. To these Americans, every penny counts in \ndetermining whether they are able to pay for food, heating, and \nhealthcare. However, by taxing Social Security benefits, we make it \nincreasingly impossible for millions of older Americans to make ends \nmeet. In effect, then, taxation of Social Security benefits forces many \nAmericans to endure stressful situations in what should be the golden \nyears of their lives.\n  Taxation of Social Security benefits is also wrong because it changes \nthe rules in the middle of the game. When seniors contributed to Social \nSecurity through the payment of payroll taxes, they did so with the \nunderstanding that they would one day receive those benefits tax-free. \nUnfortunately, because of runaway spending, many in the government have \nviewed Social Security taxation as a way to make up the shortfall \nbetween Federal spending and revenue. Such a decision was wrong then \nand it is even more wrong now as seniors face rising living costs.\n  In addition to being fundamentally unfair, I believe that taxing \nSocial Security benefits once seniors pass certain income thresholds \ndiscourages them from working. I firmly believe that senior citizens \nadd a wealth of knowledge and experience to the workplace. As such, we \nmust make sure that our American workforce is not deprived of these \nvaluable assets. Our laws should encourage older Americans with a \ndesire to work to continue contributing to our society. Unfortunately, \nour laws do just the opposite.\n  Every year my office receives hundreds of letters and calls from \nolder Americans throughout the country and Alabama describing the \nhardship that Social Security taxation has placed on their lives. The \nsolution to this situation is simple--repeal the unfair taxation of \nthese benefits. I therefore urge my colleagues to listen to their \nconstituents and join me in support of my bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN:\n  S. 1029. A bill to enhance peace between the Israelis and \nPalestinians; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Israeli-Palestinian Peace \n     Enhancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The security of the State of Israel is a major and \n     enduring national security interest of the United States.\n       (2) A lasting peace in the Middle East region can only take \n     root in an atmosphere free of violence and terrorism.\n       (3) The Palestinian people have been ill-served by leaders \n     who, by resorting to violence and terrorism to pursue their \n     political objectives, have brought economic and personal \n     hardship to their people and brought a halt to efforts \n     seeking a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\n       (4) The United States has an interest in a Middle East in \n     which two states, Israel and Palestine, will live side by \n     side in peace and security.\n       (5) In his speech of June 24, 2002, and in other \n     statements, President George W. Bush outlined a comprehensive \n     vision of the possibilities of peace in the Middle East \n     region following a change in Palestinian leadership.\n       (6) The Palestinian state must be a reformed, peaceful, and \n     democratic state that abandons forever the use of terror.\n       (7) On April 29, 2003, the Palestinian Legislative Council \n     confirmed in office, by a vote of 51 yeas, 18 nays, and 3 \n     abstentions, the Palestinian Authority's first prime \n     minister, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and his cabinet.\n       (8) In his remarks prior to the vote of the Palestinian \n     Legislative Council, Mr. Abbas declared: ``The government \n     will concentrate on the question of security . . . The \n     unauthorized possession of weapons, with its direct threat to \n     the security of the population, is a major concern that will \n     be relentlessly addressed . . . There will be no other \n     decision-making authority except for the Palestinian \n     Authority.''.\n       (9) In those remarks, Mr. Abbas further stated: ``We \n     denounce terrorism by any party and in all its forms both \n     because of our religious and moral traditions and because we \n     are convinced that such methods do not lend support to a just \n     cause like ours but rather destroy it.''.\n       (10) Israel has repeatedly indicated its willingness to \n     make painful concessions to achieve peace once there is a \n     partner for peace on the Palestinian side.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to express the sense of Congress with respect to United \n     States recognition of a Palestinian state; and\n       (2) to demonstrate United States willingness to provide \n     substantial economic and humanitarian assistance, and to \n     support large-scale multilateral assistance, after the \n     Palestinians have achieved the reforms outlined by President \n     Bush and have achieved peace with the State of Israel.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) peace between Israel and the Palestinians cannot be \n     negotiated until the Palestinian system of government has \n     been transformed along the lines outlined in President Bush's \n     June 24, 2002, speech;\n       (2) substantial United States and international economic \n     assistance will be needed after the Palestinians have \n     achieved the reforms described in section 620K(c)(2) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by section 1506 of \n     this Act) and have made a lasting and secure peace with \n     Israel;\n       (3) the Palestinian people merit commendation on the \n     confirmation of the Palestinian Authority's first prime \n     minister, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and his cabinet;\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\n       (4) the new Palestinian administration urgently should take \n     the necessary security-related steps to allow for \n     implementation of a performance-based road map to resolve the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict;\n       (5) the United States Administration should work vigorously \n     toward the goal of two states living side-by-side in peace \n     within secure and internationally-recognized boundaries free \n     from threats or acts of force; and\n       (6) the United States has a vital national security \n     interest in a permanent, comprehensive, and just resolution \n     of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and particularly the \n     Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the terms of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.\n\n     SEC. 5. RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n        It is the sense of Congress that a Palestinian state \n     should not be recognized by the United States until the \n     President determines that--\n       (1) a new leadership of a Palestinian governing entity, not \n     compromised by terrorism, has been elected and taken office; \n     and\n       (2) the newly-elected Palestinian governing entity--\n       (A) has demonstrated a firm and tangible commitment to \n     peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel and to ending \n     anti-Israel incitement, including the cessation of all \n     officially sanctioned or funded anti-Israel incitement;\n       (B) has taken appropriate measures to counter terrorism and \n     terrorist financing in the West Bank and Gaza, including the \n     dismantling of terrorist infrastructures and the confiscation \n     of unlawful weaponry;\n       (C) has established a new Palestinian security entity that \n     is fully cooperating with the appropriate Israeli security \n     organizations;\n       (D) has achieved exclusive authority and responsibility for \n     governing the national affairs of a Palestinian state, has \n     taken effective steps to ensure democracy, the rule of law, \n     and an independent judiciary, and has adopted other reforms \n     ensuring transparent and accountable governance; and\n       (E) has taken effective steps to ensure that its education \n     system promotes the acceptance of Israel's existence and of \n     peace with Israel and actively discourages anti-Israel \n     incitement.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n       Chapter 1 of part III of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2351 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating the second section 620G (as added by \n     section 149 of Public Law 104-164 (110 Stat. 1436)) as \n     section 620J; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 620K.

A bill to expand the number of individuals and families with \nhealth\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\ninsurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the first part \nof a series of proposals to protect and strengthen our nation's health \ncare safety net. That bill, the ``Strengthening Our States'' or SOS Act \nof 2003,'' seeks to protect and improve the Medicaid program--a \ncritical component of our country's health system. To repeat the words \nof Diane Rowland and Jim Tallon of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid \nand the Uninsured, ``Medicaid is the glue that helps hold our health \nsystem together and takes on the highest-risk, sickest, and most \nexpensive populations from private insurance and Medicare.\n  Like a waterfront community that seeks to set up barricades against a \nrising river, defending the Medicaid program from attacks, such as the \nidea of a block grant, is a top priority.\n  However, once that is assured, we must also take the next step and \nconfront the fact that an estimated 41.2 million people, or almost 15 \npercent of the population, was without health insurance during the \nentire year of 2001, which was an increase of 1.4 million people over \n2000.\n  Moreover, the numbers in 2002 and this year have undoubtedly \nworsened. A report by the National Coalition on Health Care says, ``The \nconfluence of powerful economic forces, fueled by the terrorist attacks \non September 11, have unleashed a `perfect storm' that could increase \ndramatically the number of uninsured in the U.S.--with as many as 6 \nmillion people in total losing their coverage in 2001 and 2002.''\n  The number in New Mexico are staggering. New Mexico leads or ranks \nsecond only to Texas in the percentage of its citizens who are \nuninsured. In fact, New Mexico is the only state in the country with \nless than half of its population having private health insurance \ncoverage.\n  A rather shocking statistic, which also continues to worsen, is that \none out of every three Hispanic citizens are uninsured. In fact, less \nthan 43 percent of the Hispanic population now has employer-based \ncoverage nationwide, which is in sharp comparison to the 68 percent of \nnon-Hispanic whites who have employer-based coverage.\n  To address this growing crisis, I have worked closely with the \nAmerican College of Physicians since last fall on the legislative \nproposal, which I call the ``Health Coverage, Affordability, \nResponsibility, and Equity Act'' or the ``HealthCARE Act of 2003.'' The \nproposal seeks to: First, build upon programs that currently work, \nincluding Medicaid, employer coverage, and the private market; second, \nprovide choices for uninsured individuals, states, and small businesses \nwhile rejecting either employer or individual mandates; third, use \nmethods that have bipartisan support by borrowing the best ideas from \nDemocratic and Republican proposals; and, fourth, simplify rather than \ncomplicate coverage.\n\n  This is in sharp contrast, in a number of ways, to past efforts to \ncreate untried schemes or to impose mandates upon either businesses or \nthe individual. It also seeks to bridge the divide between Democrats \nand Republicans. This has certainly not been easy to put together and \nnor will it be easy to pass. On the other hand, we have tried to start \nwith the tools and principles more likely to get beyond the partisan \ndivide.\n  As Julie Rovner of the National Journal recently wrote, ``If \nreforming the nation's healthcare system was easy, the old saw goes, it \nwould have been done long ago. But for the moment, those who care about \nthe issue seem to be succeeding only in butting each other's heads. \nRepublicans keep pushing market-oriented reforms while Democrats want \nto expand existing public programs. And each party continues to reject \nthe other's ideas. . . .''\n  The ``Health CARE Act'' seeks to break that partisan gridlock. First, \nit adopts and builds upon the notion of many Republicans to offer tax \ncredits for the uninsured. As such, the bill would enact a new health \ninsurance tax credit that is both refundable and advanceable to \nuninsured Americans with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level \nto purchase health coverage through a variety of options, including \nemployer-coverage, State purchasing pools, or even the individual \nmarket--something pushed by a number of Republicans for many years but \nrejected by many Democrats.\n  Second, the legislation expands coverage through a State option with \nFederal financial support through the Medicaid program to anyone up to \n100 percent of the poverty level. Medicaid has been a tried and tested \nprogram for low-income Americans over the years and is a far better and \nmore viable option to people with incomes below the poverty level than \na tax credit would be. Furthermore, few beneath the poverty level have \nthe option of employer-coverage. Therefore, public programs, such as \nMedicaid, for low-income Americans makes far more sense than a tax \ncredit.\n  Furthermore, through the strengthened and improved state purchasing \npools provided for in the legislation, individuals and small businesses \nwould be afforded better options to get coverage with a choice of plans \nthat is typically not available to them with, what we believe will be, \nlower costs due to the ability to purchase coverage as a group.\n  Consequently, this approach attempts to build upon the ideas of both \npolitical parties, as it has both public program and tax credit aspects \nto it. Our hope is that people will see the things both parties like in \nit rather than focusing on what they do not like. In fact, we have also \nadded the creation of an on-going expert health commission to make \nrecommendations for further reforms and mid-course corrections in the \nfuture.\n  This bill is introduced in the spirit of compromise. To those on the \nright, I recognize your concern about the expansion of Medicaid as not \nbeing as market-oriented as you might prefer, but would point out that \ntax credits are virtually unworkable and employer-sponsored coverage \noften unavailable for people below the poverty level and that Medicaid \nis largely contracted out to private health plans--the same that many \nof you are enrolled in.\n  To those on the left, I recognize your concerns about tax credits and \nthe potential for adverse selection with people buying coverage through \nthe individual market, but I say to you that these are tax credits for \nlow-income people and that we have taken steps in the legislation to \nmitigate problems that the added options in the bill create with \nrespect to adverse selection. I would add that any expansion of \ncoverage to people without health insurance is a good thing.\n  The most important message that I hope this bill carries is that we \nmust stop having the perfect be the enemy of the good. This proposal is \ncertainly not perfect but we hope it makes a very good start.\n  I would like to thank the American College of Physicians, or ACP, for \ntheir outstanding leadership and help in putting this legislation \ntogether. ACP has been a long-standing advocate for expanding health \ncoverage and has authored landmark reports on the important role that \nhealth insurance has in reducing people's morbidity and mortality. In \nfact, to cite the conclusion of one of those studies, ``Lack of \ninsurance contributes to the endangerment of the health of each \nuninsured American as well as the collective health of the nation.''\n  I would also like to thank the many people at the Economic and Social \nResearch Institute, or ERSI, on their forethought, advice, and counsel \nas we refined the proposal over the past number of months. Their non-\npartisan approach and expertise have been invaluable to making the bill \na workable and well-reasoned reality.\n  It should also be noted that the ideas put forth in the bill are \nbased upon much of the expert work commissioned by ESRI, funded by the \nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Task Force on the Future of \nHealth Insurance, funded by the Commonwealth Fund. As a result, the \nwork of a number of other experts is reflected in the legislation and \nwe thank you as well.\n  Among the endorsing organizations for this legislation are all of the \nleading primary care physician groups in our country. In addition to \nthe American College of Physicians, the bill has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, and the American Geriatrics Society.\n  As a practicing physician in New Mexico, Dr. Robert Strickland sums \nit up well. As he wrote in an editorial\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\npublished in the Albuquerque Journal about this legislation yesterday, \n``As a New Mexico internist for 31 years, I have seen many uninsured \npeople go without care until it is too late for me to do much to help \nthem. The HealthCARE Act offers the potential of breaking the political \ngridlock that has allowed this crisis in health care to go on for far \ntoo long.''\n  I hope we can break the gridlock and urge my colleagues to heed the \ncall of our nation's primary care doctors to support this legislation.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that letters of endorsement from the \nAmerican College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family \nPhysicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Geriatrics \nSociety, and Families USA, and the text of the legislation printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no ojection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               American College of Physicians,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, 703 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: on behalf of the American College of \n     Physicians (ACP), I am pleased to express our strong support \n     for the Health Coverage, Affordability, Responsibility and \n     Equity Act of 2003 (HealthCARE Act of 2003). ACP is the \n     largest medical specialty society in the United States, \n     representing 115,000 doctors of internal medicine and medical \n     students.\n       We very much appreciate the opportunity you have given us \n     to translate many of the ideas in ACP's proposal to provide \n     health insurance coverage to all Americans by the end of the \n     decade into the HealthCARE Act of 2003. Specifically:\n       States will be given new options to extend health insurance \n     coverage to low-income working Americans, without imposing \n     unfunded mandates on financially strapped state treasuries.\n       Advance, refundable tax credits will be made available to \n     uninsured working Americans with incomes up to 200 percent of \n     the federal poverty level.\n       The tax credit will provide a premium subsidy equal to what \n     the Federal Government now provides to its own employees.\n       Tax credit recipients will have the options of buying \n     coverage through state purchase group arrangements modeled \n     after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, giving \n     them the same types and variety of health plan options now \n     available only to federal employees, or from qualified non-\n     group insurers.\n       Small employers will have new options for obtaining \n     coverage, including having access to the variety and types of \n     health plans offered to federal employees.\n       An expert advisory commission will recommend essential \n     benefits that participating health plans will be encouraged \n     to offer, as well as ways to expand coverage to those with \n     incomes above 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n       ACP is confident that this framework can succeed where \n     other health reform proposals have failed. By offering \n     incentives and choices to states, employers, and consumers, \n     instead of ``one-size-fits-all'' government mandates, the \n     HealthCARE Act has the potential of unifying, instead of \n     dividing, key stakeholders.\n       The American College of Physicians commends you for your \n     leadership in introducing the HealthCARE Act of 2003, and we \n     look forward to working with you and lawmakers from both \n     political parties in getting the bill enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Munsey S. Wheby, MD, FACP,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 5, 2003.\n     The Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the 94,300 members of \n     the American Academy of Family Physicians, I commend you for \n     your outstanding leadership in the effort to assure access to \n     health care for the uninsured in this nation. The AAFP has \n     reviewed your draft legislation that would change Medicaid, \n     SCHIP and the federal income tax code to make health coverage \n     more affordable to uninsured Americans. I am pleased to \n     inform you that the AAFP supports your bill and offers you \n     our assistance in seeking its passage.\n       Your legislative proposal is a wide-ranging measure that \n     would take us noticeably closer to affordable health care \n     coverage for all. For example, your bill would:\n       assist states in creating purchasing pools to provide low-\n     cost insurance for uninsured individuals with incomes up to \n     200 percent of the federal poverty level;\n       allow small businesses to have access to these state-\n     operated purchasing pools so that they can offer affordable \n     health insurance to their employees;\n       provide states with the new option to offer ``need-based'' \n     eligibility for Medicaid beneficiaries;\n       remove the federal cap on non-waivered SCHIP coverage; and\n       offer federal income tax credits and premium subsidies for \n     those currently uninsured whose income is at or below 200 \n     percent of the federal poverty level and who are ineligible \n     for Medicaid for SCHIP coverage or other insurance options.\n       These and other provisions of your proposal demonstrate \n     your longstanding commitment to the health of everyone in \n     this country and we are pleased and honored to support you in \n     this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Warren A. Jones, M.D., FAAFP,\n     Board Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the 57,000 pediatrician \n     members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), I write \n     today in support of the Health Coverage, Affordability, \n     Responsibility and Equity Act of 2003.\n       The problem of the uninsured and underinsured is real and \n     growing. This legislation is an effective way to provide \n     greater access to comprehensive health care for more \n     Americans. This legislation would allow poor and near poor \n     families a variety of options for affordable and \n     comprehensive health coverage.\n       The Academy especially appreciates the effort to \n     strengthen, not undermine current public programs. Currently, \n     more than 9 million children are uninsured in this country \n     and million more are uninsured for part of the year, churning \n     on and off of health coverage. Seventy percent of the \n     uninsured children are eligible for public programs but \n     unenrolled. This legislation would encourage greater \n     enrollment of these uninsured children by providing financial \n     incentives to the states to enroll and retain these children, \n     and by allowing families to unify their health coverage.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to our \n     nation's families and their access to quality health care. We \n     look forward to our continued work together.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         E. Stephen Edwards, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      American Geriatrics Society,\n                                     New York, NY, April 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The American Geriatrics Society \n     (AGS), an organization of over 6,000 geriatricians and other \n     health professionals who are specially trained in the \n     management of care for frail, chronically ill older patients, \n     is pleased to endorse the Health CARE Act of 2003. We commend \n     you for your sponsorship of this important bill, which seeks \n     to improve health coverage for millions of uninsured \n     Americans.\n       By simplifying and expanding coverage choices for uninsured \n     individuals and small businesses, your legislation represents \n     a balanced approach to confronting one of our nation's most \n     pressing problems. The consequences of having little or no \n     health insurance are well documented. People without coverage \n     are less likely to have a regular source of care, don't \n     receive recommended health screening services nor do they \n     have appropriate care management for chronic conditions. As a \n     result, uninsured patients often are sicker and are more \n     likely to die sooner than people who have health insurance. \n     Adults in late middle age are especially susceptible to \n     deteriorating health if they never had or lose their health \n     insurance coverage.\n       The Health CARE Act of 2003 would improve the health of \n     million of Americans expanding their access to health \n     insurance coverage. AGS applauds your willingness to tackle \n     this complex issue and looks forward to working with you to \n     enact this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jerry Johnson, MD,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, 703 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC \n         20510.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Congratulations on your introduction \n     of the HealthCARE Act of 2003. Your bill is an important \n     initiative that seeks to combine good health policy with the \n     politically achievable.\n       While Families USA, the national consumer health \n     organization, has historically supported expansions of public \n     programs like Medicaid and SCHIP, we recognize that different \n     approaches are necessary if we are to see the enactment of \n     major reductions in the number of uninsured. Your bill \n     adroitly combines (1) a federally financed expansion of \n     Medicaid and SCHIP to cover all those under 100 percent of \n     the federal poverty level with (2) a premium subsidy/tax \n     credit program to help those under 200 percent of poverty buy \n     into various health insurance plans. Further, it lays the \n     groundwork for an expansion of insurance to the rest of \n     society by the end of the decade.\n       It is imperative that Congress act as soon as possible to \n     help the nearly one our of three non-elderly Americans who \n     are uninsured sometime during any two-year period. Federal \n     help with Medicaid is particularly urgent to counter the \n     massive cutbacks in coverage by the various states during the \n     current economic downturn. As our recent report (``Going \n     Without Health Insurance, Nearly One in Three Non-Elderly \n     Americans'') shows, the problem of the uninsured,\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\n     and the adverse consequences of being uninsured, are much \n     worse than previously reported. In your State of New Mexico, \n     for example, 602,000 people--38.6 percent of the population \n     under age 65--were uninsured sometime in 2002-2002. Of that \n     number, 410,000 were uninsured for more than six months.\n       Your bill would make a major reduction in these \n     unacceptable numbers. It would greatly improve the quality of \n     health and security in America, and we look forward to \n     working with you towards its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                                S. 1030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURCHASING POOL OPERATORS.\n\n       (a) Designation.--Each State shall designate a purchasing \n     pool operator that shall be responsible for operating the \n     purchasing pool established under section 203(a). A \n     purchasing pool operator may be (or, to have 1 or more of its \n     functions performed, may contract with) a private entity that \n     has entered into a contract with the State if such entity \n     meets requirements established by the Secretary for purposes \n     of the program under this title.\n       (b) Operation Similar to FEHBP.--Each purchasing pool \n     operator shall operate the purchasing pool established under \n     section 203(a) in a manner that is similar to the manner in \n     which the Director of the Office of Personnel Management \n     operates the Federal employees' health benefits program under \n     chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, including (but not \n     limited to) the performance of the specific functions \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Specific Functions Described.--The specific functions \n     described in this subsection include the following:\n       (1) Each purchasing pool operator shall offer one-stop \n     shopping for eligible individuals to enroll for health \n     benefits coverage\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\n     under private, group health insurance plans offered by \n     participating insurers.\n       (2) Each purchasing pool operator shall limit participating \n     insurers to those that meet the conditions for participation \n     described in this title.\n       (3) Each purchasing pool operator shall negotiate (or, in \n     the case of a purchasing pool described in section \n     203(b)(1)(B), shall negotiate or otherwise determine) bids \n     and terms of coverage with insurers.\n       (4) Each purchasing pool operator shall provide eligible \n     individuals with comparative information on private group \n     health insurance plans offered by participating insurers.\n       (5) Each purchasing pool operator shall assist eligible \n     individuals in enrolling with a private group health \n     insurance plan offered by a participating insurer.\n       (6) Each purchasing pool operator shall collect private \n     group health insurance plan premium payments for \n     participating insurers and process such premium payments.\n       (7) Each purchasing pool operator shall reconcile from year \n     to year aggregate premium payments and claims costs of \n     private group health insurance plans consistent with \n     practices under the Federal employees' health benefits \n     program under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (8) Each purchasing pool operator shall offer customer \n     service to eligible individuals enrolled for health benefits \n     coverage under a private group health insurance plan offered \n     by a participating insurer.\n       (9) Each purchasing pool operator shall ensure that each \n     eligible individual has the option of enrolling in either of \n     at least 2 benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans with--\n       (A) a premium at or below a cap established by the pool \n     operator for purposes of this title; and\n       (B) coverage of essential services included in the report \n     required under section 301(e)(2), with cost-sharing \n     consistent with such report.\n       (10) Each purchasing pool operator shall establish a \n     premium cap for purposes of determining the credit limitation \n     under section 36(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \n     added by section 111(a).

Such participation \n     in the program under this title shall include at least the \n     covered benefits and provider networks available through such \n     an entity and shall not involve greater out-of-pocket cost-\n     sharing than the plan offered by such entity pursuant to its \n     contract under section 8902 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) No effect on fehbp coverage.--The Director of Office of \n     Personnel Management shall take such steps as are necessary \n     to ensure that each individual enrolled for health benefits \n     coverage under the program under chapter 89 of title 5, \n     United States Code, is not adversely affected by eligible \n     individuals or others enrolled for coverage under the program \n     under this title. Such steps shall include (but need not be \n     limited to) the establishment of separate risk pools, \n     separate contracts with participating insurers, and \n     separately negotiated premiums.\n\n     SEC. 206.

STATE WAIVERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a State may apply to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services for waivers of such provisions of law as may be \n     necessary for the State to implement policies that make \n     comprehensive, affordable health coverage available for all \n     State residents, including access to essential benefits with \n     limits on cost-sharing, as provided in the most recent report \n     under section 301(e)(2).\n       (b) Requirements.--In order to ensure that waivers under \n     this section benefit rather than harm health care consumers, \n     a State shall not be eligible for a waiver under this section \n     unless--\n       (1) the State reasonably expects to achieve a level of \n     enrollment in coverage described in subsection (a) that is at \n     least equal to the level of coverage (taking into account the \n     number of insured individuals, covered benefits, and premium \n     and out-of-pocket costs to the consumer for such coverage) \n     that the State would have achieved if the State had fully \n     implemented the coverage options available under titles I and \n     II of this Act;\n       (2) no individual who would have qualified for assistance \n     under the State medicaid program under title XIX of the \n     Social Security Act or the State children's health insurance \n     program under title XXI of such Act, as of either the date of \n     the waiver request or the date of enactment of this Act, will \n     be denied eligibility for such program, have a reduction in \n     benefits under such program, have reduced access to \n     geographically and linguistically appropriate care or \n     essential community providers, or be subject to increased \n     premiums or cost-sharing under the waiver program under this \n     section; and\n       (3) the State agrees to comply with such standards or \n     guidelines as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may \n     require to ensure that the requirements of paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) are satisfied.\n       (c) Federal Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall pay a State with a waiver approved under this section \n     an amount each quarter equal to the sum of--\n       (A) the Federal payments the State and residents of the \n     State (including, but not limited to, through the credit \n     allowed under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     for health insurance costs) would have received if the State \n     had exercised the coverage options under titles I and II of \n     this Act with respect to residents of the State who have not \n     attained age 65; and\n       (B) the amount of any grants authorized by this Act that \n     the State would have received if the State had applied for \n     such grants.\n       (2) Additional payment for medicare beneficiaries under age \n     65.--\n       (A) In general.--In the case of a State that elects to \n     enroll an individual described in subparagraph (B) in \n     coverage described in subsection (a), the amount described in \n     paragraph (1) with respect to a quarter shall be increased by \n     the amount described in subparagraph (C).\n       (B) Individual described.--An individual is described in \n     this subparagraph if the individual--\n       (i) has not attained age 65;\n       (ii) is eligible for coverage under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act; and\n       (iii) voluntarily elects to enroll in coverage described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (C) Amount described.--The amount described in this \n     subparagraph is the amount equal to the amount that the \n     Federal Government would have incurred with respect to a \n     quarter for providing coverage to an individual described in \n     subparagraph (B) under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n       (d) Implementation Date.--No State may submit a request for \n     a waiver under this section before October 1, 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Stabenow, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1032. A bill to provide for alternative transportation in certain \nfederally owned or managed areas that are open to the general public; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nsimilar to measures I have introduced in previous Congresses that will \nhelp protect our Nation's natural resources and improve the visitor \nexperience in our national parks and other public lands. The Transit in \nParks Act, or ``TRIP,'' establishes a new Federal transit grant \ninitiative to support the development of alternative transportation \nservices for our national parks, wildlife refuges, Federal recreational \nareas, and other public lands. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nAkaka, Alexander, Baucus, Corzine, Dodd, Graham, Kennedy, Lautenberg, \nLevin, Reid, Schumer, Stabenow, and Wyden, who are cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  I want to underscore again today some of the principal arguments I \nhave made in past years as to why this legislation is urgently needed. \nMemorial Day weekend, the opening of the summer travel season, is just \nweeks away. Millions of visitors will soon head to our national parks \nto enjoy the incredible natural heritage with which our Nation was \nendowed. But too many of them will spend hours looking for parking, or \nstaring at the bumper of the car in front of them.\n  Clearly, the world has changed significantly since the national parks \nfirst opened in the second half of the nineteenth century, when \nvisitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. At that time, travel \nthrough parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was long, \ndifficult, and costly. Not many people could afford or endure such a \ntrip. The introduction of the automobile gave every American greater \nmobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and see some \nof our Nation's great natural wonders. Early in this century, landscape \narchitects from the National Park Service and highway engineers from \nthe U.S. Bureau of Public Roads collaborated to produce many feats of \nroad engineering that opened the national park lands to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very \nenvironments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The \nongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of \nvisitors and cars have resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The \nGrand Canyon alone has almost five million visitors a year. As many as \n6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,400 \nparking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park \neach year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a \ngiant parking lot.\n  In 1975, the total number of visitors to America's national parks was \n190 million. By 2002, that number had risen to 277 million annual \nvisitors--almost equal to one visit by every man, woman, and child in \nthis country. This dramatic increase in visitation has created an \noverwhelming demand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic \ncongestion, visitor restrictions, and in some instances vacationers \nbeing shut out of the parks altogether. The environmental damage at the \nGrand Canyon is visible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more \nthan four million visitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than \nthree million visitors a year and experiences such severe traffic \ncongestion that access has to be restricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and \nmany others. We need to solve these problems now or risk permanent harm \nto our nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage.\n  Visitor access to the parks is vital not only to the parks \nthemselves, but to the economic health of their gateway communities. \nFor example, visitors to Yosemite infuse $3 billion a year into the \nlocal economy of the surrounding area. At Yellowstone, tourists spend \n$725 million annually in adjacent communities. Wildlife-related tourism \ngenerates an estimated $60 billion a year nationwide. If the parks are \nforced to close their gates to visitors due to congestion, the economic \nvitality of the surrounding region would be jeopardized.\n  The challenge for park management has always been twofold: to \nconserve and protect the nation's natural, historical, and cultural \nresources, while at the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment \nof these sensitive environments. Until now, the principal \ntransportation systems that the Federal Government has developed to \nprovide access into our national parks are roads, primarily for private \nautomobile access. The TRIP legislation recognizes that we need to do \nmore than simply\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nbuild roads; we must invest in alternative transportation solutions \nbefore our national parks are damaged beyond repair.\n  In developing solutions to the parks' transportation needs, this \nlegislation builds upon the 1997 Memorandum of Understanding between \nSecretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Secretary of the Interior \nBruce Babbitt, in which the two Departments agreed to work together to \naddress transportation and resource management needs in and around \nnational parks. The findings in the MOU are especially revealing: \nCongestion in and approaching many National Parks is causing lengthy \ntraffic delays and backups that substantially detract from the visitor \nexperience. Visitors find that many of the National Parks contain \nsignificant noise and air pollution, and traffic congestion similar to \nthat found on the city streets they left behind.\n  In many National Park units, the capacity of parking facilities at \ninterpretive or scenic areas is well below demand. As a result, \nvisitors park along roadsides, damaging park resources and subjecting \npeople to hazardous safety conditions as they walk near busy roads to \naccess visitor use areas.\n  On occasion, National Park units must close their gates during high \nvisitation periods and turn away the public because the existing \ninfrastructure and transportation systems are at, or beyond, the \ncapacity for which they were designed.\n  In addition, the TRIP legislation is designed to implement the \nrecommendations from a comprehensive study of alternative \ntransportation needs in public lands that I was able to include in the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, as section \n3039. The Federal Lands Alternative Transportation Systems Study \nconfirmed what those of us who have visited our national parks already \nknow: there is a significant and well-documented need for alternative \ntransportation solutions in the national parks to prevent lasting \ndamage to these incomparable natural treasures.\n  The study examined over two hundred sites, and identified needs for \nalternative transportation services at two-thirds of those sites. The \nstudy found that implementation of such services can help achieve a \nnumber of desirable outcomes: ``Relieve traffic congestion and parking \nshortages; enhance visitor mobility and accessibility; preserve \nsensitive natural, cultural, and historic resources; provide improved \ninterpretation, education and visitor information services; reduce \npollution; and improve economic development opportunities for gateway \ncommunities.''\n  In fact, the study concluded that ``the provision of transit in \nfederally-managed lands can have national economic implications as well \nas significant economic benefits for local areas surrounding the \nsites.'' The study determined that funding transit needs would support \nthousands of jobs around the country, while also providing a direct \nbenefit to the economy of gateway communities by ``expand[ing] the \nnumber of visits to the site and expand[ing] the amount of visitor \nspending in the surrounding communities.''\n  The study identified ``lack of a dedicated funding source for \ndeveloping, implementing, and operating and maintaining transit \nsystems'' as a key barrier to implementation of alternative \ntransportation in and around federally-managed lands. The Transit in \nParks Act will go far toward helping parks and their gateway \ncommunities overcome this barrier. This new Federal transit grant \nprogram will provide funding to the Federal land management agencies \nthat manage the 388 various sites within the National Park System, the \nNational Wildlife Refuges, Federal recreational areas, and other public \nlands, including National Forest System lands, and to their State and \nlocal partners.\n  The bill's objectives are to develop new and expanded transit \nservices throughout the national parks and other public lands to \nconserve and protect fragile natural, cultural, and historical \nresources and wildlife habitats, to prevent or mitigate adverse impact \non those resources and habitats, and to reduce pollution and \ncongestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor \naccess and improving the visitor experience. The program will provide \ncapital funds for transit projects, including rail or clean fuel bus \nprojects, joint development activities, pedestrian and bike paths, or \npark waterway access, within or adjacent to national parks and other \npublic lands. The Secretary of Transportation may make funds available \nfor operations as well. The bill authorizes $90 million for this new \nprogram for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2009, consistent with \nthe level of need identified in the study. It is anticipated that other \nresources--both public and private--will be available to augment these \namounts.\n  The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement in the 1997 MOU \nbetween the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \nInterior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures \nrelating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in \nnational park lands. The bill further provides funds for planning, \nresearch, and technical assistance that can supplement other financial \nresources available to the Federal land management agencies. The \nprojects eligible for funding would be developed through the \ntransportation planning process and prioritized for funding by the \nSecretary of the Interior in consultation and cooperation with the \nSecretary of Transportation. It is anticipated that the Secretary of \nthe Interior would select projects that are diverse in location and \nsize. While major national parks such as the Grand Canyon or \nYellowstone are clearly appropriate candidates for significant transit \nprojects under this section, there are numerous small urban and rural \nFederal park lands that can benefit enormously from small projects, \nsuch as bike paths or improved connections with an urban or regional \npublic transit system. No single project will receive more than 12 \npercent of the total amount available in any given year. This ensures a \ndiversity of projects selected for assistance.\n  In addition, I firmly believe that this program will create new \nopportunities for the Federal land management agencies to partner with \nlocal transit agencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, \nboth through the TEA-21 planning process and in developing integrated \ntransportation systems. This will spur new economic development within \nthese communities, as they develop transportation centers for park \nvisitors to connect to transit links into the national parks and other \npublic lands.\n  The ongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has new \ndimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource \ndegradation increasing at many of our national parks. This \nlegislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land \nmanagement agencies important new tools to improve both preservation \nand access. Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is \nessential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--\nquickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the \nsame time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of \nour gateway communities.\n  As we begin a new millennium, I cannot think of a more worthy \nendeavor to help our environment and preserve our national parks, \nwildlife refuges, and Federal recreational areas than by encouraging \nalternative transportation in these areas. My bill is strongly \nsupported by the National Parks Conservation Association, Environmental \nDefense, the American Public Transportation Association, Community \nTransportation Association, Amalgamated Transit Union, Surface \nTransportation Policy Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nFriends of the Earth, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, America Bikes and \nothers, and I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-section \nanalysis, and letters of support be printed in the Record, along with \nthe USA Today article, ``Save Parks: Park Cars.''\n  I believe that we have a clear choice before us: we can turn paradise \ninto a parking lot--or we can invest in alternatives. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Transit in Parks Act to ensure that our \nNation's natural treasures will be preserved for many generations to \ncome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\n        Corzine, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 1033. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to expand or add coverage of pregnant women under the medicaid and \nState children's health insurance program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with Senators Lugar, Lincoln, Corzine, Landrieu, Breaux, \nKerry, Murray, Cantwell, Clinton, and Miller. This legislation, \nentitled the ``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2003,'' would \nsignificantly reduce the number of uninsured pregnant women and \nnewborns by expanding coverage to pregnant women through Medicaid and \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and to newborns \nthrough the first full year of life.\n  Sunday is Mothers' Day. Every year, we honor our Nation's mothers and \nwe should take the time to assess how we can do better by them, \nincluding their health and well-being.\n  According to a recent report by Save the Children entitled ``The \nState of the World's Mothers,'' the United States fares no better than \n11th in the world. Why is this? According to the report, ``The United \nStates earned its 11th place rank this year based on several factors: \nOne of the key indicators used to calculate the well-being for mothers \nis lifetime risk of maternal mortality . . . Canada, Australia, and all \nthe Western and Northern European countries in the study performed \nbetter than the United States in this indicator.''\n  The study adds, ``Similarly, the United States did not do as well as \nthe top 10 countries with regard to infant mortality rates.''\n  In fact, the United States ranks 21st in maternal mortality and 28th \nin infant mortality, the worst among developed nations. We should and \nmust do better by our Nation's mothers and infants.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, there has been long-standing policy \nlinking programs for pregnant women and infants, including Medicaid, \nWIC, and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. CHIP, \nunfortunately, fails to provide coverage to pregnant women beyond the \nage of 18. As a result, it is more likely that newborns eligible for \nCHIP are not covered from the moment of birth, and therefore, often \nmiss having comprehensive prenatal care and those first critical months \nof life until their CHIP application is processed.\n  By expanding coverage to pregnant women through CHIP, the ``Start \nHealthy, Stay Healthy Act'' recognizes the importance of prenatal care \nto the health and development of a child. As Dr. Alan Waxman of the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of Medicine has written, ``Prenatal \ncare is an important factor in the prevention of birth defects and the \nprevention of prematurity, the most common causes of infant death and \ndisability. Babies born to women with no prenatal care or late prenatal \ncare are nearly twice as likely to [be] low birthweight or very low \nbirthweight as infants born to women who received early prenatal \ncare.''\n  Unfortunately, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, New Mexico ranked worst in the Nation in the percentage of \nmothers receiving late or no prenatal care last year. The result is \noften quite costly--both in terms of the health of the mother and \nnewborn but also in terms of the long-term expenses since the result \ncan be chronic, lifelong health problems.\n  In fact, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \n``four of the top 10 most expensive conditions in the hospital are \nrelated to care of infants with complications (respiratory distress, \nprematurity, heart defects, and lack of oxygen).'' As a result, in \naddition to reduced infant mortality and morbidity, the provision to \nexpand coverage to pregnant women can be cost effective.\n  The ``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act'' also eliminates the \nunintended federal policy through CHIP that covers pregnant women only \nthrough the age of 18 and cuts off that coverage once the women turn 19 \nyears of age. Certainly, everybody can agree that the government should \nnot be telling women that they are more likely to receive prenatal care \ncoverage only if they become pregnant as a teenager.\n  This bipartisan legislation has previously received or has added \nendorsements from the following organizations: the March of Dimes, The \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, the What to Expect Foundation, the American Academy \nof Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the \nFederation of American Health Systems, the National Association of \nPublic Hospitals and Health Systems, Premier, Catholic Health \nAssociation, Catholic Charities USA, Family Voices, the Association of \nMaternal and Child Health Programs, the National Health Law Program, \nthe National Association of Social Workers, Every Child By Two, the \nUnited Cerebral Palsy Associations, the Society for Maternal-Fetal \nMedicine, and Families USA.\n  This legislation is a reintroduction of a bill that was introduced in \n2001. Throughout that year, the Administration made numerous statements \nin support of the passage of this type of legislation, but \nunfortunately, reversed course in October 2002 after publishing a \nregulation allowing states to redefine a ``child'' as an ``unborn \nchild'' and to provide prenatal care through CHIP in that manner. In a \nletter to Senator Nickles dated October 8, 2002, Secretary Thompson \nargued, ``I believe the regulation is a more effective and \ncomprehensive solution to this issue.''\n  While a number of senators strongly disagreed with Secretary \nThompson's assertion and sent him letters to that effect on October 10, \n2002, and on October 23, 2002, we felt it was important to get the \ntestimony of our Nation's medical experts on the health and well-being \nof both pregnant women and newborns. We called for a hearing in the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on October 24, \n2002. Witnesses included representatives from the March of Dimes, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, and the What to Expect Foundation. They were \nasked to compare the regulation to the legislation and I will let their \ntestimony speak for itself.\n  Dr. Nancy Green testified on behalf of the March of Dimes Birth \nDefects Foundation. She said:\n\n       We support giving states the flexibility they need to cover \n     income-eligible pregnant women age 19 and older, and to \n     automatically enroll infants born to SCHIP-eligible mothers. \n     By establishing a uniform eligibility threshold for coverage \n     for pregnant women and infants, states will be able to \n     improve maternal health, eliminate waiting periods for \n     infants and streamline administration of publicly supported \n     health programs. Currently, according to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services and the National Governors' Association, 36 states \n     and the District of Columbia have income eligibility \n     thresholds that are more restrictive for women than for their \n     newborns. Encouraging states to eliminate this disparity by \n     allowing them to establish a uniform eligibility threshold \n     for pregnant women and their infants should be a national \n     policy priority.\n\n  Dr. Green adds:\n\n       Specifically, we are deeply concerned that final regulation \n     fails to provide to the mother the standard scope of \n     maternity care services recommended by the American College \n     of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Of particular concern, the \n     regulation explicitly states that postpartum care is not \n     covered and, therefore, federal reimbursement will not be \n     available for these services. In addition, because of the \n     contentious collateral issues raised by this regulation \n     groups like the March of Dimes will find it even more \n     difficult to work in the states to generate support for \n     legislation to extend coverage to uninsured pregnant women.\n\n  Dr. Laura Riley testified on behalf of ACOG. In her testimony, she \nstated:\n\n       ACOG is very concerned that mothers will not have access to \n     postpartum services under the regulation. The rule clearly \n     states that ``. . . care after delivery, such as postpartum \n     services could not be covered as part of the Title XXI State \n     Plan . . . because they are not services for an eligible \n     child.''\n\n  On the importance of postpartum care, Dr. Riley adds:\n\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\n\n       When new mothers develop postpartum complications, quick \n     access to their physicians is absolutely critical. Postpartum \n     care is especially important for women who have preexisting \n     medical conditions, and for those whose medical conditions \n     were induced by their pregnancies, such as gestational \n     diabetes or hypertension, and for whom it is necessary to \n     ensure that their conditions are stabilized and treated.\n\n  As a result, Dr. Riley concludes:\n\n       Limiting coverage to the fetus instead of the mother omits \n     a critical component of postpartum care that physicians \n     regard as essential for the health of the mother and the \n     child. Covering the fetus as opposed to the mother also \n     raises questions of whether certain services will be \n     available during pregnancy and labor if the condition is one \n     that more directly affects the woman. The best way to address \n     this coverage issue is to pass S. 724, supported by Senators \n     Bond, Bingaman and Lincoln and many others, and which \n     provides a full range of medical services during and after \n     pregnancy directly to the pregnant woman.\n\n  Dr. Richard Bucciarelli testified on behalf of the American Academy \nof Pediatrics. He said:\n\n       Recently, the Administration published a final rule \n     expanding SCHIP cover unborn children. The Academy is \n     concerned that, as written, this regulation falls dangerously \n     short of the clinical standards of care outlined in our \n     guidelines, which describe the importance of covering all \n     stages of a birth--pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care.\n\n  It is important to note that the regulation subtracts the time that \nan ``unborn child'' is covered from the period of continuously \neligibility after birth. Consequently, children would be denied \ninsurance coverage at very critical points during the first full year \nof life. As such, Dr. Bucciarelli expressed support for the legislation \nover the regulation because it, in his words:\n\n       . . . takes an important step to decrease the number of \n     uninsured children by providing 12 months of continuous \n     eligibility for those children born. . . . This legislation \n     ensures that children born to women enrolled in Medicaid or \n     SCHIP are immediately enrolled in the program for which they \n     are eligible. Additionally, this provision prevents newborns \n     eligible for SCHIP from being subject to enrollment waiting \n     periods, ensuring that infants receive appropriate health \n     care in their first year of life.\n\n  And finally, Lisa Bernstein testified as Executive Director of The \nWhat to Expect Foundation, which takes its name from the bestselling \nWhat to Expect pregnancy and parenting series that has helped over 20 \nmillion families from pregnancy through their child's toddler years. \nMs. Bernstein also supported the legislation as a far superior option \nover the regulation and make this simple but eloquent point:\n\n       . . . only a healthy parent can provide a healthy future \n     for a healthy child.\n\n  The testimony of these experts speak for themselves and I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a series of \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I believe it is not only \n     appropriate, but indeed, medically necessary that our \n     approach to child health care include the prenatal stage.\n       Prenatal care for women and their babies is a crucial part \n     of medical care. These services can be a vital, life-long \n     determinant of health, and we should do everything we can to \n     make this care available for all pregnant women. It is one of \n     the most important investments we can make for the long-term \n     good health of our nation.\n       Our regulation would enable states to make use of funding \n     already available under SCHIP to provide prenatal care for \n     more low-income pregnant women and their babies. The proposed \n     regulation, published in the Federal Register March 5, would \n     clarify the definition of ``child'' under the SCHIP program. \n     At present, SCHIP allows states to provide health care \n     coverage to targeted low-income children under age 19. States \n     may further limit their coverage to age groups within that \n     range. The new regulation would clarify that states may \n     include coverage for children from conception to age 19, \n     enabling SCHIP coverage to include prenatal and delivery care \n     to ensure the birth of healthy infants.\n       Although Medicaid currently provides coverage for prenatal \n     care for some women with low incomes, implementing this new \n     regulation will allow states to offer such coverage to \n     additional women. States would not be required to go through \n     the section 1115 waiver process to expand coverage for \n     prenatal care.\n       By explicitly recognizing in our SCHIP regulations the \n     health needs of children before birth, we can help states \n     provide vital prenatal health care. I believe our approach is \n     entirely appropriate to serve these health purposes. It has \n     been an option for states in their Medicaid programs in the \n     past and it should be made an option for states in their \n     SCHIP program now. As I testified recently at a hearing held \n     by the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce \n     Committee, I also support legislation to expand SCHIP to \n     cover pregnant women. However, because legislation has not \n     moved and because of the importance of prenatal care, I felt \n     it was important to take this action.\n       I know we share the same commitment to achieving the goal \n     of expanding health insurance coverage in order to reduce the \n     number of uninsured.\n       A similar letter is being sent to the cosigners of your \n     letter. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions \n     or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thompson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Republican Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Thank you for contacting me about the \n     Department of Health and Human Services' final regulation to \n     expand pre-natal and pregnancy related services to unborn \n     children under the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP).\n       The final rule allows states the option to extend such \n     services under SCHIP to low-income pregnant women and their \n     unborn children immediately. The rule also enables states to \n     cover a broader population of low-income women and children \n     because it extends coverage to unborn children regardless of \n     their mothers' immigrant status.\n       In your letter, you ask if ``this regulation has obviated \n     the need for additional legislation, and has addressed this \n     issue in a more timely and effective manner.'' As I have \n     stated many times this year, my overarching goal has been to \n     extend prenatal and pregnancy related services to low-income \n     women and their children as quickly as possible so that those \n     mothers are cared for during their pregnancy and their \n     children are born healthy and strong. The law provided me the \n     flexibility to do that and I believe the rule that was \n     published this week achieves this universally desired goal. \n     The proposed legislation, which has been pending in Congress \n     for some time, would amend the SCHIP law so as to duplicate \n     what we have already established as administration policy. I \n     believe the regulation is a more effective and comprehensive \n     solution to this issue. Therefore, there is no need for the \n     Senate to pursue this legislation now.\n       Thank you for inquiring on this important policy matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thompson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Tommy Thompson,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Thompson: Over the course of the past year, \n     you have issued press releases, written letters, and \n     responded to direct questions in both Senate and House \n     hearings in support of passing legislation to provide health \n     care coverage to pregnant women through the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). You have repeatedly stated \n     that you were proceeding with the regulation to expand SCHIP \n     to ``unborn children'' only because legislation to expand \n     coverage to pregnant women had not passed.\n       Your own regulation explicitly makes that very point and \n     acknowledges that ``gaps remain'' and that a number of \n     important health services for pregnant women, including \n     postpartum care, are not provided for in the regulation. And \n     yet, we now read in a letter from you to Senator Nickles \n     dated October 8, 2002, that the ``gaps'' have somehow \n     disappeared. As you write, ``The proposed legislation, which \n     has been pending in Congress for some time, would amend the \n     SCHIP law so as to duplicate what we have already established \n     as administration policy. I believe the regulation is a more \n     effective and comprehensive solution to this issue. \n     Therefore, there is no need for the Senate to pursue this \n     legislation now.''\n       Yet, your own regulation contradicts that statement and \n     notes that ``there are still gaps'' and repeatedly points out \n     those coverage gaps for pregnant women and children. With \n     respect to care for women, under the regulation, it is \n     explicitly stated that ``there must be a connection between \n     the benefits provided and the health of the unborn child.'' A \n     whole range of health services to pregnant women during \n     pregnancy and delivery could be potentially denied as a \n     result. In the case of epidurals, for example, the best the \n     regulation can say is that you ``expect'' coverage.\n       For postpartum care, the regulation explicitly states that \n     any care during that period, including but not limited to \n     hemorrhage, infection, episiotomy repair, C-section repair, \n     family planning counseling, treatment of complications after \n     delivery (including life-saving surgery), and postpartum \n     depression, would be denied. As the regulation reads, \n     ``Commenters are correct that care after delivery, such as \n     postpartum services could not be covered as part of [SCHIP], \n     (unless the mother is under age 19 and eligible for SCHIP in \n     her own right), because they are not services for an eligible \n     child.''\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), the United States ranks 21st in the world in maternal \n     mortality. The major causes of which were hemorrhage, ectopic \n     pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, embolism, \n     infection, and other complications of pregnancy and \n     childbirth. Again, health coverage for many of these \n     conditions is denied under the regulation but not in S. 724. \n     How then do you argue the regulation is ``more effective and \n     comprehensive'' and that the legislation is ``duplicat[ive]'' \n     of the regulation with respect to care for pregnant women?\n       With respect to coverage of children, under the regulation, \n     the 12-month continuous eligibility for children is not from \n     the time of birth but the clock begins running during the \n     time of coverage prior to birth. S. 724 provides \n     comprehensive pediatric care to children throughout the first \n     and most fragile year of life. In contrast, for prenatal care \n     delivered to an ``unborn child'' under this regulation, that \n     time is subtracted from the 12-month period after birth. \n     Therefore, under the regulation, if nine months of prenatal \n     care are provided, the child could lose coverage at the end \n     of the 3rd month after birth. Potentially lost would be a \n     number of important well-baby visits, immunizations, and \n     access to their pediatric caregiver. Once again, how then do \n     you argue the regulation is ``more effective and \n     comprehensive'' and that the legislation is \n     ``duplicat[ative]'' to the regulation for children?\n       Furthermore, according to the rule, the Administration \n     estimates that only 13 states will elect to adopt this \n     definition to include ``unborn children'' in their SCHIP \n     state plans. The other 37 states will either not expand SCHIP \n     to provide prenatal care to additional populations or be \n     forced to seek a federal waiver to also cover pregnant women, \n     as Colorado did just two weeks ago. However, the regulation \n     was right on the mark in stating that it is ``an inferior \n     option'' to require states to have to get waivers to provide \n     the full range of care to pregnant women and 12-month \n     continuous eligibility for children after birth.\n       As the regulation reads, ``. . . the Secretary's ability to \n     intervene through one mechanism (a waiver) should not be the \n     sole option for States and may in fact be an inferior option. \n     Waivers are discretionary on the part of the Secretary and \n     time limited while State plan amendments are permanent, and \n     are subject to budget neutrality.'' For a third time, how can \n     you now argue, less than a week after issuing the regulation, \n     that it is ``more effective and comprehensive'' than the \n     legislation?\n       The States agree, as you know. The National Governors' \n     Association has clear policy expressing support for the \n     passage of such legislation. As their policy position (HR-15. \n     ``The State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) \n     Policy'') reads:\n       ``The Governors have a long tradition of expanding coverage \n     options for pregnant women through the Medicaid program. \n     However, pregnant women in working families are not eligible \n     for SCHIP coverage. The Governors call on Congress to create \n     a state option that would allow states to provide health \n     coverage to income-eligible pregnant women under SCHIP. This \n     small shift in federal policy would allow states to provide \n     critical prenatal care and would increase the likelihood that \n     children born to SCHIP mothers would have a healthy start.''\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\n       Finally, unlike S. 724, the regulation provides absolutely \n     no additional resources (despite estimating the cost to be \n     $330 million over the next five years) for covering ``unborn \n     children'' and certain pregnancy-related services. Current \n     projections by the Office of Management and Budget indicate \n     that SCHIP funds will ultimately be inadequate to cover all \n     the children currently enrolled, even though millions of \n     additional children are eligible but not currently covered. \n     In sharp contrast, just as S. 724 does, we must provide \n     adequate resources to serve both low-income children and low-\n     income pregnant women.\n       Mr. Secretary, just as you said in your press release on \n     January 31, 2002, we also praise Senators Bond, Breaux, and \n     Collins for ``bipartisan leadership in supporting S. 724, a \n     bill that would allow states to provide prenatal coverage for \n     low-income women through the SCHIP program. We support this \n     legislative effort in this Congress.'' We agreed with you on \n     January 31, 2002, and hope that you will once again support \n     the passage of S. 724, the ``Mothers and Newborns Health \n     Insurance Act.''\n       We eagerly await your response to this very important \n     matter with respect to the health and well-being of our \n     nation's children and mothers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman, Jon Corzine, Edward M. Kennedy, Maria \n           Cantwell, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Dianne Feinstein, \n           Blanche L. Lincoln, Mary Landrieu, Patty Murray, James \n           M. Jeffords, John B.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for your letter of last \n     week and your continued interest in finding effective ways to \n     increase prenatal coverage.\n       I have frequently stated in the past that my chief \n     objective in proposing the rule to extend coverage to unborn \n     children was to ensure that pregnant women and children who \n     are currently ineligible for health care under either \n     Medicaid or S-CHIP are given the support they need for a \n     healthy pregnancy and a safe delivery. This is clearly a goal \n     we share. When asked my position on pending legislation \n     earlier this year, I expressed general support because my \n     overriding interest and concern has always been to provide \n     prenatal care to more women and children. If legislation \n     could provide that coverage more expeditiously, then it \n     seemed to me it would be advantageous to women and children \n     to see that go forward.\n       However, despite years of committed effort by you and other \n     members, Congress has yet to move legislation through the \n     process. Legislation was introduced in the 106th Congress but \n     was never reported out of Committee in either the House or \n     Senate. In this current Congress, the Senate Finance \n     Committee reported S. 724 in early August of this year, but \n     no floor time was scheduled for its consideration. \n     Consequently, after seven months without any legislative \n     action, I issued a final regulation.\n       Last year, when I saw that I had the authority under \n     current law to provide prenatal and delivery care to low-\n     income pregnant mothers and their unborn children, I was \n     excited because I realized the Department could accomplish \n     what we all wish to achieve: helping those children get a \n     healthy start in life. A great deal of thought went into the \n     regulation and, with the exception of postpartum care after \n     hospitalization, we were able to give the states the same \n     flexibility the would have under the proposed legislation to \n     provide prenatal and delivery care to unborn children and \n     their mothers.\n       Under current law, however, we have the authority to grant \n     waivers that include coverage for women if they become \n     pregnant, including postpartum care. Since January 2001, I \n     have granted approval to a number of states to allow for \n     expanded health insurance coverage through comprehensive 1115 \n     waivers, which also include postpartum care. In fact, this \n     summer I approved a waiver for New Mexico which included \n     prenatal care, labor and delivery, and postpartum care. This \n     regulation simply adds to the options available to the states \n     in expanding health insurance coverage.\n       In addition to making it possible for states to use federal \n     funds to provide the prenatal and pregnancy-related coverage \n     options available under S. 724, the regulation provides \n     additional opportunities and assistance for states to reach \n     low-income women. For example, under the regulation, we were \n     able to reach an even broader population of vulnerable women \n     and children because we could offer prenatal care to the \n     children of immigrants who are otherwise ineligible for any \n     coverage. The establishment of eligibility regardless of \n     immigrant status is possible under the regulation but not \n     under S. 724, making the regulation more comprehensive. I am \n     sure you appreciate the importance of the new opportunity to \n     provide prenatal care and pregnancy-related services to \n     immigrant mothers, given the substantial immigrant population \n     in New Mexico.\n       Additionally, the regulation provides more opportunities \n     for states to access enhanced-match funds than S. 724. Under \n     the bill, states with current eligibility levels for pregnant \n     women below 185 percent of poverty would not be eligible for \n     the enhanced match until they raised their eligibility at \n     their regular match rate. States have already had the option \n     to raise eligibility for pregnant women at their regular \n     match rate, but many have not done so. Thus, we expect that \n     many states will not expand prenatal coverage under S. 724. \n     However, access to enhanced-match funds under the regulation \n     will provide them a more affordable opportunity to do so.\n       With regard to specific criticisms of the rule, you have \n     raised concerns about the reference in the S-CHIP regulation \n     to ``gaps.'' It is important to put the use of the term \n     ``gaps'' in the proper context. This reference is to the \n     eleigbility gap between Medicaid and S-CHIP, which the \n     regulation and S. 724 both seek to close. The response in the \n     regulation does not refer to benefits, so the reference in \n     your recent letter that ``gaps remain'' is taken out of \n     context and, in fact, an incorrect referencing of the \n     regulation.\n       Under both the regulation and the legislation, the states \n     ultimately determine the benefit package. That feature of \n     your legislation does not differ from the rule. And, we have \n     clearly indicated federal funds will be available for \n     services including prenatal care and labor and delivery. Your \n     letter makes assumptions regarding medical services during \n     pregnancy and delivery that HHS does not. The letter confuses \n     medical decisions that are made by physicians with payment of \n     claims under a public assistance program. The regulation is \n     used to establish eligibility for benefits and does not \n     itself extend into medical decision-making between a woman \n     and her physician. HHS responded to a number of questions \n     regarding services and clearly indicated federal financial \n     participation would be available. There is no need to further \n     question whether a claim for a service already provided will \n     receive federal matching funds.\n       The issue of 12 months continuous eligibility is an option \n     for the states. Under the regulation, states that want to \n     extend eligibility can easily do so.\n       I hope this explanation of the regulation and where it \n     extends beyond the reach of S. 724 will give you confidence \n     in our policy and it's ability to meet the ultimate goal that \n     you and I have worked over the years to meet. You are due a \n     large measure of credit for your efforts on behalf of low-\n     income women and their children. The regulation is a victory \n     for those women and children and will give otherwise \n     uncovered needy mothers and their babies a healthy start in \n     life.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thomspon.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2002.\n     Hon. Tommy Thompson,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: Thank you for your letter yesterday \n     with regard to improving health coverage for pregnant women \n     and children. We appreciate your stated desire to ``give \n     otherwise uncovered needy mothers and their babies a healthy \n     start in life'' by adding ``to the options available to the \n     states in expanding health insurance options.'' We believe we \n     can take the best aspects of the legislation and the \n     regulation to truly improve the health and well-being of our \n     nation's children and mothers.\n       In light of the fact that our nation ranks 26th in infant \n     mortality and 21st in maternal mortality in the world, which \n     is the worst among developed nations, we would be remiss to \n     not take the simple but critical step of increasing access to \n     prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care through the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to help prevent \n     birth defects and prematurity, the most common causes of \n     infant death and disability, and maternal death and \n     disability.\n       As your letter acknowledges, postpartum care is not covered \n     under the regulation. This gap in coverage includes a range \n     of critical care for women, including potentially life-saving \n     postpartum care for hemorrhage, pregnancy-induced \n     hypertension, infection, ectopic pregnancy, embolism, \n     episiotomy repair, Caesarean section repair, family planning \n     counseling, postpartum depression, and other complications of \n     pregnancy and childbirth. In fact, according to the National \n     Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), ``Hemorrhage, \n     pregnancy-induced hypertension, infection, and ectopic \n     pregnancy continue to account for more than half of all \n     maternal deaths (59 percent).''\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), there were 3,193 pregnancy-related deaths in this \n     country between 1991 and 1997 for an overall pregnancy-\n     related mortality ratio (PRMR) of 11.5 per 100,000 live \n     births. Racial disparities are rather dramatic with respect \n     to maternal mortality. African-American women had mortality \n     rates over four times higher than that of non-Hispanic whites \n     over the period. American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asian/\n     Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic women had mortality rates 67 \n     percent, 55 percent, and 41 percent, respectively, higher \n     than non-Hispanic whites.\n       Those disparities are even more pronounced in some states. \n     For example, in Wisconsin, the maternal mortality rate for \n     African-American women was 4.2 times that of white women \n     between 1987 and 1996. Certainly, this is something that we \n     can all agree should be addressed.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n       To allow states the option to provide comprehensive \n     coverage to pregnant women, including postpartum care, \n     through SCHIP would help achieve that important goal. S. 724, \n     the ``Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act,'' gives \n     states that important coverage option while the regulation \n     does not.\n       While your letter correctly notes that states may receive \n     comprehensive 1115 waivers to provide coverage to pregnant \n     women, your regulation is correct in noting that is an \n     inferior option. As the regulation reads, ``. . . the \n     Secretary's ability to intervene through one mechanism (a \n     waiver) should not be the sole option for States and may in \n     fact be an inferior option. Waivers are discretionary on the \n     part of the Secretary and time limited while State plan \n     amendments are permanent, and are subject to budget \n     neutrality.'' We should remove those barriers and give states \n     the option to provide pregnant women coverage without having \n     to seek waivers.\n       We would add that the waiver option is allowed for the \n     purposes of giving the Secretary demonstration authority. We \n     certainly can all acknowledge that coverage of pregnant women \n     has reduced both infant mortality and maternal mortality and \n     need not be demonstrated any further. The waiver process \n     seems inappropriate for this purpose. Instead, we should \n     remove those barriers for states to provide comprehensive \n     coverage to pregnant women. As the National Governors' \n     Association has stated in its policy (HR-15. ``The State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) Policy''): The \n     Governors call on Congress to create a state option that \n     would allow states to provide health coverage to income-\n     eligible women under SCHIP. This small shift in federal \n     policy would allow states to provide critical prenatal care \n     and would increase the likelihood that children born to SCHIP \n     mothers would have a healthy start.\n       Just as the governors have requested, we can still make \n     that ``small shift'' in policy through the passage of S. 724.\n       As for the coverage of infants, your letter did not address \n     the issues raised in a previous letter to you from 15 \n     senators, including many of us, dated October 10, 2002. Your \n     letter restates the fact that states have the option to \n     provide children 12 months of continuous eligibility in \n     Medicaid and SCHIP. However, under the regulation, the 12-\n     month continuous eligibility for children is not from the \n     time of birth. Rather, the clock begins running during the \n     time of coverage prior to birth. Thus, it is likely that most \n     newborns would have far less than 12 months of coverage after \n     birth if a State chooses to use the option to provide care to \n     ``unborn children.'' If covered for the full nine months of \n     pregnancy, the child could lose eligibility for SCHIP after \n     the third month of life and consequently lose important \n     coverage for well-baby visits, immunizations, and access to \n     their pediatric caregiver. That would be an outright \n     reduction of coverage for some children after birth.\n       We would note that the legislation continues to have the \n     strong support of a number of groups, including some who \n     support the regulation but acknowledge its shortcomings and \n     continue to support passing legislation. Those groups include \n     the American Association of University Affiliated Programs, \n     the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of \n     Nurse Midwives, the American College of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecologists, the American Hospital Association, the \n     American Medical Association, the American Public Health \n     Association, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \n     Neonatal Nurses, the Association of Maternal and Child Health \n     Programs, the Catholic Health Association, Catholic Charities \n     USA, the Council of Women's and Infants' Specialty Hospitals, \n     the Easter Seals, FamilyVoices, the March of Dimes, the \n     National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National \n     Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, the \n     National Women's Health Network, the National Association of \n     County and City Health Officials, the Society for Maternal-\n     Fetal Medicine, the Spina Bifida Association of America, the \n     Alan Guttmacher Institute, and the United Cerebral Palsy \n     Associations.\n       There are certainly areas where the regulation is more \n     comprehensive than the legislation, such as providing \n     coverage to the ``unborn children'' of immigrant mothers and \n     by providing states easier access to enhanced matching funds. \n     We believe we could certainly amend S. 724 to address these \n     shortcomings rather easily. It would be easy to drop the \n     requirement in the bill for a state to expand eligibility to \n     185 percent of poverty before receiving the enhanced matching \n     rate. However, this begs the question about the need for \n     providing additional resources in SCHIP to cover these \n     options. Current projections by the Office of Management and \n     Budget indicate that SCHIP funds will ultimately be \n     inadequate to cover all the children currently enrolled, even \n     though millions of additional children are eligible but not \n     currently covered. S. 724 provides such funding, which the \n     regulation does not and cannot.\n       In short, we believe that we can rather quickly achieve the \n     best of both the legislation and the regulation. S. 724 \n     expands state options to cover critically important \n     postpartum services for women, ensures children are eligible \n     for coverage throughout the first and most critical year of \n     life, and provides much needed resources to provide such \n     care. In contrast, the regulation provides states with more \n     opportunities to access enhanced matching funds and provides \n     certain prenatal care services to immigrant mothers that S. \n     724 does not provide.\n       We would like to arrange a meeting with you or your staff \n     to jointly modify S. 724 to address, as best as we can, the \n     concerns we have discussed above and that you have raised \n     with the legislation to accomplish the objective we all share \n     of improving the health and well-being of out nation's \n     children and mothers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman. Blanche L. Lincoln. Jon Corzine. Maria \n           Cantwell. Patty Murray. Mary Landrieu. James M. \n           Jeffords. Edward M. Kennedy. Hillary Rodham Clinton. \n           Charles E. Schumer.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nBingaman to re-introduce the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2003.\n  The United States ranks 26th in infant mortality and 21st in maternal \nmortality in the world, the worst among developed nations. Study after \nstudy shows that providing prenatal care to pregnant women reduces \nmaternal and infant mortality and the incidence of low birth weight \nbabies. According to the American Medical Association, ``Babies born to \nwomen who do not receive prenatal care are four times more likely to \ndie before their first birthday.''\n  The Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2003 would significantly \nreduce the number of uninsured pregnant women and newborns by providing \nStates with the option to further extend coverage to pregnant women \nthrough Medicaid and CHIP, to reduce infant and maternal mortality and \nlow birth weight babies, and to cover newborns through the first full \nyear of life.\n  Current federal law allows pregnant women to receive coverage through \nCHIP through age 18--creating a perverse Federal incentive of covering \nonly teenage pregnant women and cutting off that coverage once they \nturn 19 years of age. This legislation would eliminate this problem by \nallowing States to cover pregnant women through CHIP, regardless of \nage. This also eliminates the unfortunate separation between pregnant \nwomen and infants that has been created through CHIP, and is contrary \nto longstanding federal policy through programs such as Medicaid, Women \nwith Infants and Children, WIC, Maternal and Child Health, MCH, etc.\n  An estimated 4.3 million, or 32 percent, of mothers below 200 percent \nof poverty are uninsured. According to the March of Dimes, ``Over 95 \npercent of all uninsured pregnant women could be covered through a \ncombination of aggressive Medicaid outreach, maximizing coverage for \nyoung women through [CHIP], and expanding CHIP to cover income-eligible \npregnant women regardless of age.''\n  Increasing the availability of affordable health care is certainly an \nissue of great importance to our Nation--particularly those who are \nuninsured. While our bill will not solve the problem of the uninsured, \nwe believe that helping more pregnant women and babies receive care is \na significant step in the right direction.\n  I ask our colleagues to support the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act \nof 2003, and help us take this important step in improving health care \nfor the mothers of tomorrow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, \n        and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1034. A bill to repeal the sunset date on the assault weapons ban, \nto ban the importation of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Chuck Schumer, Lincoln Chafee, Barbara Boxer, Dick \nDurbin, Jack Reed, Frank Lautenberg, Jim Jeffords, and Edward Kennedy \nthat would permanently reauthorize the assault weapons ban and close \nthe clip-importation loophole.\n  Military-style assault weapons simply have no place on America's \nstreets. But if Congress fails to act, the current ban will expire next \nyear. This would be a terrible mistake.\n  This is why Congress must reauthorize the ban and close the high-\ncapacity\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\nclip importation loophole so that we can help keep America's streets \nsafe from the violence produced by assault weapons.\n  Almost 10 years ago on July 1, 1993 Gian Luigi Ferri walked into 101 \nCalifornia Street in San Francisco carrying two high-capacity TEC-9 \nassault pistols.\n  Within minutes, he had murdered eight people, and six others were \nwounded. This tragedy shook San Francisco and the entire nation.\n  We saw with absolute clarity the destruction that could be inflicted \nwith these military-style assault weapons.\n  Navegar's advertising for the TEC-9 touted the gun as being for \n`paramilitary' use and `resistant to fingerprints,' with a `military \nnon-glare finish,' a `military blowback system,' and `combat-type' \nsights.\n  Guns like these are the weapons of choice to commit crimes. They are \nthe weapons of choice for drive-by shooters, criminals going into a \nmajor criminal event, and malcontents who are seeking to do the maximum \ndamage possible in the shortest amount of time.\n  That's what makes them so dangerous because they have light triggers, \nyou can spray fire them, you can hold them with two hands, and you \ndon't really need to aim.\n  They are not weapons of choice for hunting or defensive purposes.\n  In the aftermath of 101 California and countless other shootings, I \ndecided to do something that no one had succeeded in doing before: to \nban the manufacture and importation of military style assault weapons.\n  I authored the bill in the Senate, and Senator Schumer authored it in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I remember all the late night calls I got and all the friends who \ntook me aside and said to me: ``Don't do it. The gunners are too \npowerful. You'll never ever win.''\n  Well, we did win. We passed the first-ever ban on assault weapons, \nand since September 13, 1994, it has been illegal to manufacture and \nimport military-style assault weapons.\n  The hope of the bill has been to drive down the supply of these \nweapons and make them more expensive to obtain.\n  And in the years following the enactment of the ban, crimes using \nassault weapons were reduced dramatically.\n  In 1993, assault weapons accounted for 8.2 percent of all guns used \nin crimes; By the end of 1995, that proportion had fallen to 4.3 \npercent--a dramatic drop; and by November 1996, the last date for which \nstatistics are available, the proportion had fallen to 3.2 percent.\n  These are dramatic results, which show that the Assault Weapons ban \nhas worked. We have had trouble getting updated statistics from this \nJustice Department, but it is clear that after we banned these guns, \ncriminals used them less frequently in crime.\n  Unfortunately, to get the bill passed in 1994, we had to agree to a \nten-year sunset in the bill--and this is why we are here today. If we \ndo not re-authorize the 1994 assault weapons ban this Congress, it will \nexpire on September 13, 2004.\n  That means that at the end of next year, manufacturers could once \nagain begin making AK-47s, TEC-9s, and other banned guns that have but \none purpose--to kill other human beings.\n  We are here today because we believe that this would be a terrible \nmistake--with deadly consequences for thousands of Americans each year.\n  So today we will introduce legislation to do two simple things. \nFirst, the legislation would reauthorize the 1994 assault weapons ban \nby striking the sunset date from the original law. This would ban the \nmanufacture of 19 types of common military style assault weapons--for \nall time.\n  It would ban an additional group of these assault weapons that have \nbeen banned by characteristic for 8 years.\n  It would protect some 670 hunting and other recreational rifles for \nuse by law-abiding citizens.\n  And it would preserve the right of police officers and other law \nenforcement officials to use and obtain newly manufactured semi-\nautomatic assault weapons--helping to prevent instances when law \nenforcement agents are outgunned by perpetrators.\n  We certainly would like a stronger bill that would tighten the ban--\nbased on our 10 years of experience of what the gun companies have done \nto get around the bill.\n  But unfortunately there is not the support for that right now. If the \nsupport becomes evident, then we may amend the bill at a later date.\n  Second, the legislation would close a loophole in the 1994 law, which \nprohibits the domestic manufacture of high-capacity ammunition \nmagazines, but allows foreign companies to continue sending them to \nthis country by the millions.\n  A measure that would have closed this loophole passed the House and \nSenate in 1999 by wide margins, but got bottled up in a larger \nconference due to an unrelated provision.\n  The result: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has approved \nthe importation of almost 50 million high capacity ammunition magazines \nfrom some 50 countries since 1994.\n  It is these large clips, drums, and strips that allow lone gunmen, or \nsmall groups of teenagers, to inflict so much damage in such a small \namount of time.\n  We must close this loophole now.\n  The good news: President Bush has indicated that he supports each of \nthese provisions. During the 2000 Presidential Campaign, President Bush \nindicated that he supported both reauthorization of the assault weapons \nban and closing the clip importation loophole.\n  And just a few weeks ago, President Bush's spokesman Scott McClellan \nreiterated his support for reauthorizing the ban when he said: ``The \nPresident supports the current law, and he supports reauthorization of \nthe current law.''\n  It is therefore our hope that the President will work with us to see \nthis bill passed. We welcome the President's support and look forward \nto working with him to gain swift passage of this legislation.\n  One of the best examples of the damage that assault weapons can \ninflict is the massacre in Littleton, Colorado.\n  On April 24, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold used a TEC DC-9 \nsemi-automatic pistol to attack the students and teachers of Columbine \nHigh School.\n  They used this weapon to take the lives of 13 innocents, 12 students \nand 1 teacher, and injured dozens more mothers, fathers, sons and \ndaughters.\n  I do not believe that the 2nd Amendment protects military assault \nweapons. The Constitution is not an umbrella for mayhem. The Bill of \nRights is not a guarantor of violence.\n  Congress has passed this legislation once--it is time to pass the \nassault weapons ban again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REPEAL OF SUNSET DATE.\n\n       Section 110105 of the Public Safety and Recreational \n     Firearms Use Protection Act (18 U.S.C. 921 note) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 110105.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to carry out a \nprogram, known as the Northern Border Prosecution Initiative, to \nprovide funds to northern States to reimburse county and municipal \ngovernments for costs associated with certain criminal activities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today my colleagues and I introduce the \nNorthern Border Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative. This bill \noutlines an important initiative that would give our northern border \nStates and counties financial assistance in prosecuting criminal and \nimmigration-related cases that arise because of proximity to the \nborder. I thank my fellow northern border Senators and cosponsors, \nSenators Crapo, Murry, Murkowski, Leahy, Clinton and Schumer for \njoining with me to introduce and work to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  This initiative is modeled on a successful program already in place \nfor southern border States. The Southern Border Prosecution Initiative \nallows States and counties to apply for reimbursement of costs incurred \nin any federally initiated or declined-referred criminal case. The \nprogram is targeted at immigration-related cases, but is not limited \nonly to cases involving immigration charges. Cases arising out of \nimmigration issues but ranging from a misdemeanor property charge to a \nfelony drug conviction are eligible for reimbursement under the \nsouthern border program. The program proposed in the legislation \nintroduced today would be operated in the same way.\n  Federal agencies--such as the Border Patrol and INS--have ongoing \nefforts to police the Nation's borders, resulting in hundreds of \narrests each year. For many reasons, some of those cases are not \npursued by Federal law enforcement authorities and instead are handed \noff to State or county officials for further prosecution. Instead of \nasking States to absorb those costs--likely at the expense of other \nimportant local law enforcement initiatives--the Northern Border \nProsecution Reimbursement Initiative allows States and counties to \nreceive compensation for pursuing these immigration-related cases.\n  The Northern Border Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative would be \nadministered by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice \nAssistance. States and counties would be able to apply for \nreimbursement during an annual application period, with no limit on the \nnumber of cases submitted. Under the act, funds distribution is not \nbased on the size or population of a northern border State, but upon \nthe number of eligible cases submitted by each jurisdiction. It is \npossible for reimbursement to equal 100 percent of costs, though money \nis distributed on a pro rata basis if applications exceed available \nrevenues. Each of the 14 States along the northern border would be \neligible for the reimbursement program: Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.\n  Last year, $40 million was provided to southern border States \nArizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, offsetting the costs of \nprosecuting immigration-related cases. For 2002, $50 million was \nallocated to the program. My legislation simply authorizes $28 million \nfor Fiscal Year 2004 be made available to northern border states for \nthe same purpose.\n\n  In the years leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, activity along the \nnorthern border had shifted primarily from a focus on immigration \nissues to those related to\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\ntrade and commerce. However, homeland security has grown into a \nparamount concern in the wake of the 2001 terror attacks, and our \nStates and local governments are increasingly bearing an unfair \nfinancial burden in protecting and patrolling our national borders. \nThere are hundreds of crossings along the 4,000 mile long northern \nborder between the United States and Canada, and though improvements \nhave been made to tighten security, the northern border has yet to \nreceive the resources it needs to adequately enforce our Nation's \nimmigration laws and border restrictions.\n  The need for greater enforcement efforts along the northern border \nbecame glaringly evident in 1998 when Ahmed Ressam, a terrorist trained \nat one of Osama bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan, was arrested \nshortly after crossing the Canadian border into Washington State. \nExplosives and other bomb-making materials were found in the trunk of \nRessam's car. This frightening incident made clear the vulnerabilities \nwe face along the porous northern border, vulnerabilities that became \neven more concerning after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n  In the last two years, the Senate has taken steps to improve northern \nborder security. I have worked with Senators from the 14 States that \ncomprise the northern border--including my colleagues who join me as \ncosponsors on this legislation today--and we have successfully devoted \nmore resources to northern border security efforts. The 2001 Department \nof Defense Appropriation's bill included $55.8 million for 500 \nadditional Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors along the \nnorthern border--a 105 percent increase in staffing levels. That \nlegislation also provided $23.9 million to transfer 100 border patrol \nagents and hire 100 new agents. Working to protect our northern border \nhas been a bipartisan effort, enjoying cooperation from senators across \nthe aisle and across the country. Now it is time to take another step \ntoward greater border and national security and approve the Northern \nBorder Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative.\n  The costs of homeland security are increasingly being borne by States \nand local governments, an issue that this legislation tackles head-on. \nWithout giving States and counties the necessary resources to pay for \ncases initiated by Federal authorities, other important local law \nenforcement initiatives will undoubtedly be shortchanged. States and \nthe Federal Government must work together if our borders are to be \ntruly safe. The Northern Border Prosecution Reimbursement Initiative is \na mechanism by which all of the resources of the criminal justice \nsystem--local, State, and Federal--can work in harmony.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Older \nAmericans Tax Fairness Act of 2003. My bill would completely eliminate \nthe unjust taxation of Social Security benefits once and for all. The \nunderlying premise of my legislation is simple: Social Security \nbenefits were never intended to be taxed. At its inception and \ncontinuing on for the next fifty years, Social Security benefits were \nexempt from taxation. Budgetary shortfalls in 1984 and 1993, however, \nled to the taxation of these benefits.\n  Because of the rising cost of living, many of our seniors are forced \nto work past age 65. To these Americans, every penny counts in \ndetermining whether they are able to pay for food, heating, and \nhealthcare. However, by taxing Social Security benefits, we make it \nincreasingly impossible for millions of older Americans to make ends \nmeet. In effect, then, taxation of Social Security benefits forces many \nAmericans to endure stressful situations in what should be the golden \nyears of their lives.\n  Taxation of Social Security benefits is also wrong because it changes \nthe rules in the middle of the game. When seniors contributed to Social \nSecurity through the payment of payroll taxes, they did so with the \nunderstanding that they would one day receive those benefits tax-free. \nUnfortunately, because of runaway spending, many in the government have \nviewed Social Security taxation as a way to make up the shortfall \nbetween Federal spending and revenue. Such a decision was wrong then \nand it is even more wrong now as seniors face rising living costs.\n  In addition to being fundamentally unfair, I believe that taxing \nSocial Security benefits once seniors pass certain income thresholds \ndiscourages them from working. I firmly believe that senior citizens \nadd a wealth of knowledge and experience to the workplace. As such, we \nmust make sure that our American workforce is not deprived of these \nvaluable assets. Our laws should encourage older Americans with a \ndesire to work to continue contributing to our society. Unfortunately, \nour laws do just the opposite.\n  Every year my office receives hundreds of letters and calls from \nolder Americans throughout the country and Alabama describing the \nhardship that Social Security taxation has placed on their lives. The \nsolution to this situation is simple--repeal the unfair taxation of \nthese benefits. I therefore urge my colleagues to listen to their \nconstituents and join me in support of my bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN:\n  S. 1029. A bill to enhance peace between the Israelis and \nPalestinians; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Israeli-Palestinian Peace \n     Enhancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The security of the State of Israel is a major and \n     enduring national security interest of the United States.\n       (2) A lasting peace in the Middle East region can only take \n     root in an atmosphere free of violence and terrorism.\n       (3) The Palestinian people have been ill-served by leaders \n     who, by resorting to violence and terrorism to pursue their \n     political objectives, have brought economic and personal \n     hardship to their people and brought a halt to efforts \n     seeking a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\n       (4) The United States has an interest in a Middle East in \n     which two states, Israel and Palestine, will live side by \n     side in peace and security.\n       (5) In his speech of June 24, 2002, and in other \n     statements, President George W. Bush outlined a comprehensive \n     vision of the possibilities of peace in the Middle East \n     region following a change in Palestinian leadership.\n       (6) The Palestinian state must be a reformed, peaceful, and \n     democratic state that abandons forever the use of terror.\n       (7) On April 29, 2003, the Palestinian Legislative Council \n     confirmed in office, by a vote of 51 yeas, 18 nays, and 3 \n     abstentions, the Palestinian Authority's first prime \n     minister, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and his cabinet.\n       (8) In his remarks prior to the vote of the Palestinian \n     Legislative Council, Mr. Abbas declared: ``The government \n     will concentrate on the question of security . . . The \n     unauthorized possession of weapons, with its direct threat to \n     the security of the population, is a major concern that will \n     be relentlessly addressed . . . There will be no other \n     decision-making authority except for the Palestinian \n     Authority.''.\n       (9) In those remarks, Mr. Abbas further stated: ``We \n     denounce terrorism by any party and in all its forms both \n     because of our religious and moral traditions and because we \n     are convinced that such methods do not lend support to a just \n     cause like ours but rather destroy it.''.\n       (10) Israel has repeatedly indicated its willingness to \n     make painful concessions to achieve peace once there is a \n     partner for peace on the Palestinian side.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to express the sense of Congress with respect to United \n     States recognition of a Palestinian state; and\n       (2) to demonstrate United States willingness to provide \n     substantial economic and humanitarian assistance, and to \n     support large-scale multilateral assistance, after the \n     Palestinians have achieved the reforms outlined by President \n     Bush and have achieved peace with the State of Israel.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) peace between Israel and the Palestinians cannot be \n     negotiated until the Palestinian system of government has \n     been transformed along the lines outlined in President Bush's \n     June 24, 2002, speech;\n       (2) substantial United States and international economic \n     assistance will be needed after the Palestinians have \n     achieved the reforms described in section 620K(c)(2) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by section 1506 of \n     this Act) and have made a lasting and secure peace with \n     Israel;\n       (3) the Palestinian people merit commendation on the \n     confirmation of the Palestinian Authority's first prime \n     minister, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), and his cabinet;\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\n       (4) the new Palestinian administration urgently should take \n     the necessary security-related steps to allow for \n     implementation of a performance-based road map to resolve the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict;\n       (5) the United States Administration should work vigorously \n     toward the goal of two states living side-by-side in peace \n     within secure and internationally-recognized boundaries free \n     from threats or acts of force; and\n       (6) the United States has a vital national security \n     interest in a permanent, comprehensive, and just resolution \n     of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and particularly the \n     Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the terms of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.\n\n     SEC. 5. RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n        It is the sense of Congress that a Palestinian state \n     should not be recognized by the United States until the \n     President determines that--\n       (1) a new leadership of a Palestinian governing entity, not \n     compromised by terrorism, has been elected and taken office; \n     and\n       (2) the newly-elected Palestinian governing entity--\n       (A) has demonstrated a firm and tangible commitment to \n     peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel and to ending \n     anti-Israel incitement, including the cessation of all \n     officially sanctioned or funded anti-Israel incitement;\n       (B) has taken appropriate measures to counter terrorism and \n     terrorist financing in the West Bank and Gaza, including the \n     dismantling of terrorist infrastructures and the confiscation \n     of unlawful weaponry;\n       (C) has established a new Palestinian security entity that \n     is fully cooperating with the appropriate Israeli security \n     organizations;\n       (D) has achieved exclusive authority and responsibility for \n     governing the national affairs of a Palestinian state, has \n     taken effective steps to ensure democracy, the rule of law, \n     and an independent judiciary, and has adopted other reforms \n     ensuring transparent and accountable governance; and\n       (E) has taken effective steps to ensure that its education \n     system promotes the acceptance of Israel's existence and of \n     peace with Israel and actively discourages anti-Israel \n     incitement.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n       Chapter 1 of part III of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2351 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating the second section 620G (as added by \n     section 149 of Public Law 104-164 (110 Stat. 1436)) as \n     section 620J; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 620K.

A bill to expand the number of individuals and families with \nhealth\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\ninsurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the first part \nof a series of proposals to protect and strengthen our nation's health \ncare safety net. That bill, the ``Strengthening Our States'' or SOS Act \nof 2003,'' seeks to protect and improve the Medicaid program--a \ncritical component of our country's health system. To repeat the words \nof Diane Rowland and Jim Tallon of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid \nand the Uninsured, ``Medicaid is the glue that helps hold our health \nsystem together and takes on the highest-risk, sickest, and most \nexpensive populations from private insurance and Medicare.\n  Like a waterfront community that seeks to set up barricades against a \nrising river, defending the Medicaid program from attacks, such as the \nidea of a block grant, is a top priority.\n  However, once that is assured, we must also take the next step and \nconfront the fact that an estimated 41.2 million people, or almost 15 \npercent of the population, was without health insurance during the \nentire year of 2001, which was an increase of 1.4 million people over \n2000.\n  Moreover, the numbers in 2002 and this year have undoubtedly \nworsened. A report by the National Coalition on Health Care says, ``The \nconfluence of powerful economic forces, fueled by the terrorist attacks \non September 11, have unleashed a `perfect storm' that could increase \ndramatically the number of uninsured in the U.S.--with as many as 6 \nmillion people in total losing their coverage in 2001 and 2002.''\n  The number in New Mexico are staggering. New Mexico leads or ranks \nsecond only to Texas in the percentage of its citizens who are \nuninsured. In fact, New Mexico is the only state in the country with \nless than half of its population having private health insurance \ncoverage.\n  A rather shocking statistic, which also continues to worsen, is that \none out of every three Hispanic citizens are uninsured. In fact, less \nthan 43 percent of the Hispanic population now has employer-based \ncoverage nationwide, which is in sharp comparison to the 68 percent of \nnon-Hispanic whites who have employer-based coverage.\n  To address this growing crisis, I have worked closely with the \nAmerican College of Physicians since last fall on the legislative \nproposal, which I call the ``Health Coverage, Affordability, \nResponsibility, and Equity Act'' or the ``HealthCARE Act of 2003.'' The \nproposal seeks to: First, build upon programs that currently work, \nincluding Medicaid, employer coverage, and the private market; second, \nprovide choices for uninsured individuals, states, and small businesses \nwhile rejecting either employer or individual mandates; third, use \nmethods that have bipartisan support by borrowing the best ideas from \nDemocratic and Republican proposals; and, fourth, simplify rather than \ncomplicate coverage.\n\n  This is in sharp contrast, in a number of ways, to past efforts to \ncreate untried schemes or to impose mandates upon either businesses or \nthe individual. It also seeks to bridge the divide between Democrats \nand Republicans. This has certainly not been easy to put together and \nnor will it be easy to pass. On the other hand, we have tried to start \nwith the tools and principles more likely to get beyond the partisan \ndivide.\n  As Julie Rovner of the National Journal recently wrote, ``If \nreforming the nation's healthcare system was easy, the old saw goes, it \nwould have been done long ago. But for the moment, those who care about \nthe issue seem to be succeeding only in butting each other's heads. \nRepublicans keep pushing market-oriented reforms while Democrats want \nto expand existing public programs. And each party continues to reject \nthe other's ideas. . . .''\n  The ``Health CARE Act'' seeks to break that partisan gridlock. First, \nit adopts and builds upon the notion of many Republicans to offer tax \ncredits for the uninsured. As such, the bill would enact a new health \ninsurance tax credit that is both refundable and advanceable to \nuninsured Americans with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level \nto purchase health coverage through a variety of options, including \nemployer-coverage, State purchasing pools, or even the individual \nmarket--something pushed by a number of Republicans for many years but \nrejected by many Democrats.\n  Second, the legislation expands coverage through a State option with \nFederal financial support through the Medicaid program to anyone up to \n100 percent of the poverty level. Medicaid has been a tried and tested \nprogram for low-income Americans over the years and is a far better and \nmore viable option to people with incomes below the poverty level than \na tax credit would be. Furthermore, few beneath the poverty level have \nthe option of employer-coverage. Therefore, public programs, such as \nMedicaid, for low-income Americans makes far more sense than a tax \ncredit.\n  Furthermore, through the strengthened and improved state purchasing \npools provided for in the legislation, individuals and small businesses \nwould be afforded better options to get coverage with a choice of plans \nthat is typically not available to them with, what we believe will be, \nlower costs due to the ability to purchase coverage as a group.\n  Consequently, this approach attempts to build upon the ideas of both \npolitical parties, as it has both public program and tax credit aspects \nto it. Our hope is that people will see the things both parties like in \nit rather than focusing on what they do not like. In fact, we have also \nadded the creation of an on-going expert health commission to make \nrecommendations for further reforms and mid-course corrections in the \nfuture.\n  This bill is introduced in the spirit of compromise. To those on the \nright, I recognize your concern about the expansion of Medicaid as not \nbeing as market-oriented as you might prefer, but would point out that \ntax credits are virtually unworkable and employer-sponsored coverage \noften unavailable for people below the poverty level and that Medicaid \nis largely contracted out to private health plans--the same that many \nof you are enrolled in.\n  To those on the left, I recognize your concerns about tax credits and \nthe potential for adverse selection with people buying coverage through \nthe individual market, but I say to you that these are tax credits for \nlow-income people and that we have taken steps in the legislation to \nmitigate problems that the added options in the bill create with \nrespect to adverse selection. I would add that any expansion of \ncoverage to people without health insurance is a good thing.\n  The most important message that I hope this bill carries is that we \nmust stop having the perfect be the enemy of the good. This proposal is \ncertainly not perfect but we hope it makes a very good start.\n  I would like to thank the American College of Physicians, or ACP, for \ntheir outstanding leadership and help in putting this legislation \ntogether. ACP has been a long-standing advocate for expanding health \ncoverage and has authored landmark reports on the important role that \nhealth insurance has in reducing people's morbidity and mortality. In \nfact, to cite the conclusion of one of those studies, ``Lack of \ninsurance contributes to the endangerment of the health of each \nuninsured American as well as the collective health of the nation.''\n  I would also like to thank the many people at the Economic and Social \nResearch Institute, or ERSI, on their forethought, advice, and counsel \nas we refined the proposal over the past number of months. Their non-\npartisan approach and expertise have been invaluable to making the bill \na workable and well-reasoned reality.\n  It should also be noted that the ideas put forth in the bill are \nbased upon much of the expert work commissioned by ESRI, funded by the \nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Task Force on the Future of \nHealth Insurance, funded by the Commonwealth Fund. As a result, the \nwork of a number of other experts is reflected in the legislation and \nwe thank you as well.\n  Among the endorsing organizations for this legislation are all of the \nleading primary care physician groups in our country. In addition to \nthe American College of Physicians, the bill has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, and the American Geriatrics Society.\n  As a practicing physician in New Mexico, Dr. Robert Strickland sums \nit up well. As he wrote in an editorial\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\npublished in the Albuquerque Journal about this legislation yesterday, \n``As a New Mexico internist for 31 years, I have seen many uninsured \npeople go without care until it is too late for me to do much to help \nthem. The HealthCARE Act offers the potential of breaking the political \ngridlock that has allowed this crisis in health care to go on for far \ntoo long.''\n  I hope we can break the gridlock and urge my colleagues to heed the \ncall of our nation's primary care doctors to support this legislation.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that letters of endorsement from the \nAmerican College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family \nPhysicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Geriatrics \nSociety, and Families USA, and the text of the legislation printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no ojection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               American College of Physicians,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, 703 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: on behalf of the American College of \n     Physicians (ACP), I am pleased to express our strong support \n     for the Health Coverage, Affordability, Responsibility and \n     Equity Act of 2003 (HealthCARE Act of 2003). ACP is the \n     largest medical specialty society in the United States, \n     representing 115,000 doctors of internal medicine and medical \n     students.\n       We very much appreciate the opportunity you have given us \n     to translate many of the ideas in ACP's proposal to provide \n     health insurance coverage to all Americans by the end of the \n     decade into the HealthCARE Act of 2003. Specifically:\n       States will be given new options to extend health insurance \n     coverage to low-income working Americans, without imposing \n     unfunded mandates on financially strapped state treasuries.\n       Advance, refundable tax credits will be made available to \n     uninsured working Americans with incomes up to 200 percent of \n     the federal poverty level.\n       The tax credit will provide a premium subsidy equal to what \n     the Federal Government now provides to its own employees.\n       Tax credit recipients will have the options of buying \n     coverage through state purchase group arrangements modeled \n     after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, giving \n     them the same types and variety of health plan options now \n     available only to federal employees, or from qualified non-\n     group insurers.\n       Small employers will have new options for obtaining \n     coverage, including having access to the variety and types of \n     health plans offered to federal employees.\n       An expert advisory commission will recommend essential \n     benefits that participating health plans will be encouraged \n     to offer, as well as ways to expand coverage to those with \n     incomes above 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n       ACP is confident that this framework can succeed where \n     other health reform proposals have failed. By offering \n     incentives and choices to states, employers, and consumers, \n     instead of ``one-size-fits-all'' government mandates, the \n     HealthCARE Act has the potential of unifying, instead of \n     dividing, key stakeholders.\n       The American College of Physicians commends you for your \n     leadership in introducing the HealthCARE Act of 2003, and we \n     look forward to working with you and lawmakers from both \n     political parties in getting the bill enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Munsey S. Wheby, MD, FACP,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 5, 2003.\n     The Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the 94,300 members of \n     the American Academy of Family Physicians, I commend you for \n     your outstanding leadership in the effort to assure access to \n     health care for the uninsured in this nation. The AAFP has \n     reviewed your draft legislation that would change Medicaid, \n     SCHIP and the federal income tax code to make health coverage \n     more affordable to uninsured Americans. I am pleased to \n     inform you that the AAFP supports your bill and offers you \n     our assistance in seeking its passage.\n       Your legislative proposal is a wide-ranging measure that \n     would take us noticeably closer to affordable health care \n     coverage for all. For example, your bill would:\n       assist states in creating purchasing pools to provide low-\n     cost insurance for uninsured individuals with incomes up to \n     200 percent of the federal poverty level;\n       allow small businesses to have access to these state-\n     operated purchasing pools so that they can offer affordable \n     health insurance to their employees;\n       provide states with the new option to offer ``need-based'' \n     eligibility for Medicaid beneficiaries;\n       remove the federal cap on non-waivered SCHIP coverage; and\n       offer federal income tax credits and premium subsidies for \n     those currently uninsured whose income is at or below 200 \n     percent of the federal poverty level and who are ineligible \n     for Medicaid for SCHIP coverage or other insurance options.\n       These and other provisions of your proposal demonstrate \n     your longstanding commitment to the health of everyone in \n     this country and we are pleased and honored to support you in \n     this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Warren A. Jones, M.D., FAAFP,\n     Board Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the 57,000 pediatrician \n     members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), I write \n     today in support of the Health Coverage, Affordability, \n     Responsibility and Equity Act of 2003.\n       The problem of the uninsured and underinsured is real and \n     growing. This legislation is an effective way to provide \n     greater access to comprehensive health care for more \n     Americans. This legislation would allow poor and near poor \n     families a variety of options for affordable and \n     comprehensive health coverage.\n       The Academy especially appreciates the effort to \n     strengthen, not undermine current public programs. Currently, \n     more than 9 million children are uninsured in this country \n     and million more are uninsured for part of the year, churning \n     on and off of health coverage. Seventy percent of the \n     uninsured children are eligible for public programs but \n     unenrolled. This legislation would encourage greater \n     enrollment of these uninsured children by providing financial \n     incentives to the states to enroll and retain these children, \n     and by allowing families to unify their health coverage.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to our \n     nation's families and their access to quality health care. We \n     look forward to our continued work together.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         E. Stephen Edwards, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      American Geriatrics Society,\n                                     New York, NY, April 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The American Geriatrics Society \n     (AGS), an organization of over 6,000 geriatricians and other \n     health professionals who are specially trained in the \n     management of care for frail, chronically ill older patients, \n     is pleased to endorse the Health CARE Act of 2003. We commend \n     you for your sponsorship of this important bill, which seeks \n     to improve health coverage for millions of uninsured \n     Americans.\n       By simplifying and expanding coverage choices for uninsured \n     individuals and small businesses, your legislation represents \n     a balanced approach to confronting one of our nation's most \n     pressing problems. The consequences of having little or no \n     health insurance are well documented. People without coverage \n     are less likely to have a regular source of care, don't \n     receive recommended health screening services nor do they \n     have appropriate care management for chronic conditions. As a \n     result, uninsured patients often are sicker and are more \n     likely to die sooner than people who have health insurance. \n     Adults in late middle age are especially susceptible to \n     deteriorating health if they never had or lose their health \n     insurance coverage.\n       The Health CARE Act of 2003 would improve the health of \n     million of Americans expanding their access to health \n     insurance coverage. AGS applauds your willingness to tackle \n     this complex issue and looks forward to working with you to \n     enact this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jerry Johnson, MD,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, 703 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC \n         20510.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Congratulations on your introduction \n     of the HealthCARE Act of 2003. Your bill is an important \n     initiative that seeks to combine good health policy with the \n     politically achievable.\n       While Families USA, the national consumer health \n     organization, has historically supported expansions of public \n     programs like Medicaid and SCHIP, we recognize that different \n     approaches are necessary if we are to see the enactment of \n     major reductions in the number of uninsured. Your bill \n     adroitly combines (1) a federally financed expansion of \n     Medicaid and SCHIP to cover all those under 100 percent of \n     the federal poverty level with (2) a premium subsidy/tax \n     credit program to help those under 200 percent of poverty buy \n     into various health insurance plans. Further, it lays the \n     groundwork for an expansion of insurance to the rest of \n     society by the end of the decade.\n       It is imperative that Congress act as soon as possible to \n     help the nearly one our of three non-elderly Americans who \n     are uninsured sometime during any two-year period. Federal \n     help with Medicaid is particularly urgent to counter the \n     massive cutbacks in coverage by the various states during the \n     current economic downturn. As our recent report (``Going \n     Without Health Insurance, Nearly One in Three Non-Elderly \n     Americans'') shows, the problem of the uninsured,\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\n     and the adverse consequences of being uninsured, are much \n     worse than previously reported. In your State of New Mexico, \n     for example, 602,000 people--38.6 percent of the population \n     under age 65--were uninsured sometime in 2002-2002. Of that \n     number, 410,000 were uninsured for more than six months.\n       Your bill would make a major reduction in these \n     unacceptable numbers. It would greatly improve the quality of \n     health and security in America, and we look forward to \n     working with you towards its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                                S. 1030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A \n     purchasing pool operator may be (or, to have 1 or more of its \n     functions performed, may contract with) a private entity that \n     has entered into a contract with the State if such entity \n     meets requirements established by the Secretary for purposes \n     of the program under this title.\n       (b) Operation Similar to FEHBP.--Each purchasing pool \n     operator shall operate the purchasing pool established under \n     section 203(a) in a manner that is similar to the manner in \n     which the Director of the Office of Personnel Management \n     operates the Federal employees' health benefits program under \n     chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, including (but not \n     limited to) the performance of the specific functions \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Specific Functions Described.--The specific functions \n     described in this subsection include the following:\n       (1) Each purchasing pool operator shall offer one-stop \n     shopping for eligible individuals to enroll for health \n     benefits coverage\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\n     under private, group health insurance plans offered by \n     participating insurers.\n       (2) Each purchasing pool operator shall limit participating \n     insurers to those that meet the conditions for participation \n     described in this title.\n       (3) Each purchasing pool operator shall negotiate (or, in \n     the case of a purchasing pool described in section \n     203(b)(1)(B), shall negotiate or otherwise determine) bids \n     and terms of coverage with insurers.\n       (4) Each purchasing pool operator shall provide eligible \n     individuals with comparative information on private group \n     health insurance plans offered by participating insurers.\n       (5) Each purchasing pool operator shall assist eligible \n     individuals in enrolling with a private group health \n     insurance plan offered by a participating insurer.\n       (6) Each purchasing pool operator shall collect private \n     group health insurance plan premium payments for \n     participating insurers and process such premium payments.\n       (7) Each purchasing pool operator shall reconcile from year \n     to year aggregate premium payments and claims costs of \n     private group health insurance plans consistent with \n     practices under the Federal employees' health benefits \n     program under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (8) Each purchasing pool operator shall offer customer \n     service to eligible individuals enrolled for health benefits \n     coverage under a private group health insurance plan offered \n     by a participating insurer.\n       (9) Each purchasing pool operator shall ensure that each \n     eligible individual has the option of enrolling in either of \n     at least 2 benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans with--\n       (A) a premium at or below a cap established by the pool \n     operator for purposes of this title; and\n       (B) coverage of essential services included in the report \n     required under section 301(e)(2), with cost-sharing \n     consistent with such report.\n       (10) Each purchasing pool operator shall establish a \n     premium cap for purposes of determining the credit limitation \n     under section 36(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \n     added by section 111(a). The cap required under this \n     paragraph may not be less than the premium charged to Federal \n     employees by the most highly-enrolled health plan under the \n     Federal employees' health benefits program under chapter 89 \n     of title 5, United States Code. If the most highly-enrolled \n     plan in that program differs for Federal enrollees in the \n     State and all Federal enrollees nationally in such plan, the \n     minimum permitted premium cap shall be the lower of such \n     premiums.\n\n     SEC. 205. CONTRACTS WITH PARTICIPATING INSURERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each purchasing pool operator shall \n     negotiate and enter into contracts for the provision of \n     health benefits coverage under the program under this title \n     with entities that meet the conditions of participation \n     described in subsection (b) and other applicable requirements \n     of this Act.\n       (b) Consumer Information.--In carrying out its duty under \n     section 204(c)(4) to inform eligible individuals about \n     private group health plans, the purchasing pool operator \n     shall provide information that meets the requirements of \n     section 212(b)(2).\n       (c) State Licensure.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), a health plan \n     shall not be a participating insurer unless the plan has a \n     State license to provide State residents with the private \n     group coverage health insurance plans that it offers through \n     the pool.\n       (2) Exception.--A pool operator may enter into a contract \n     under subsection (a) to cover pool participants through a \n     health plan without a State license described in paragraph \n     (1) if such plan is offered to Federal employees nationwide \n     and, with respect to such employees, is exempt from State \n     health insurance regulation. Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to permit coverage of pool participants through \n     such a plan except with groups, contracts, and premium rates \n     that are entirely distinct from those used for individuals \n     covered under the Federal employee's health benefits program \n     under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (d) Additional Stop-Loss Coverage and Reinsurance.--\n     Purchasing pool operators are authorized to encourage \n     participation in the program under this title, improve \n     covered benefits, reduce out-of-pocket cost-sharing, limit \n     premiums, or achieve other objectives of this Act by--\n       (1) funding stop-loss coverage above levels otherwise \n     offered in the purchasing pool; or\n       (2) providing or subsidizing reinsurance in addition to \n     that provided under section 211.\n       (e) Participation of FEHBP Plans.--\n       (1) In general.--Each entity with a contract under section \n     8902 of title 5, United States Code, shall be a participating \n     insurer unless such entity notifies the Secretary in writing \n     of its intention not to participate in the program under this \n     title prior to such time as is designated by the Secretary so \n     as to allow such decisions to be taken into account with \n     respect to eligible individuals' choice of a private group \n     health insurance plan under such program. Such participation \n     in the program under this title shall include at least the \n     covered benefits and provider networks available through such \n     an entity and shall not involve greater out-of-pocket cost-\n     sharing than the plan offered by such entity pursuant to its \n     contract under section 8902 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) No effect on fehbp coverage.--The Director of Office of \n     Personnel Management shall take such steps as are necessary \n     to ensure that each individual enrolled for health benefits \n     coverage under the program under chapter 89 of title 5, \n     United States Code, is not adversely affected by eligible \n     individuals or others enrolled for coverage under the program \n     under this title. Such steps shall include (but need not be \n     limited to) the establishment of separate risk pools, \n     separate contracts with participating insurers, and \n     separately negotiated premiums.\n\n     SEC. 206.

STATE WAIVERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a State may apply to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services for waivers of such provisions of law as may be \n     necessary for the State to implement policies that make \n     comprehensive, affordable health coverage available for all \n     State residents, including access to essential benefits with \n     limits on cost-sharing, as provided in the most recent report \n     under section 301(e)(2).\n       (b) Requirements.--In order to ensure that waivers under \n     this section benefit rather than harm health care consumers, \n     a State shall not be eligible for a waiver under this section \n     unless--\n       (1) the State reasonably expects to achieve a level of \n     enrollment in coverage described in subsection (a) that is at \n     least equal to the level of coverage (taking into account the \n     number of insured individuals, covered benefits, and premium \n     and out-of-pocket costs to the consumer for such coverage) \n     that the State would have achieved if the State had fully \n     implemented the coverage options available under titles I and \n     II of this Act;\n       (2) no individual who would have qualified for assistance \n     under the State medicaid program under title XIX of the \n     Social Security Act or the State children's health insurance \n     program under title XXI of such Act, as of either the date of \n     the waiver request or the date of enactment of this Act, will \n     be denied eligibility for such program, have a reduction in \n     benefits under such program, have reduced access to \n     geographically and linguistically appropriate care or \n     essential community providers, or be subject to increased \n     premiums or cost-sharing under the waiver program under this \n     section; and\n       (3) the State agrees to comply with such standards or \n     guidelines as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may \n     require to ensure that the requirements of paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) are satisfied.\n       (c) Federal Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall pay a State with a waiver approved under this section \n     an amount each quarter equal to the sum of--\n       (A) the Federal payments the State and residents of the \n     State (including, but not limited to, through the credit \n     allowed under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     for health insurance costs) would have received if the State \n     had exercised the coverage options under titles I and II of \n     this Act with respect to residents of the State who have not \n     attained age 65; and\n       (B) the amount of any grants authorized by this Act that \n     the State would have received if the State had applied for \n     such grants.\n       (2) Additional payment for medicare beneficiaries under age \n     65.--\n       (A) In general.--In the case of a State that elects to \n     enroll an individual described in subparagraph (B) in \n     coverage described in subsection (a), the amount described in \n     paragraph (1) with respect to a quarter shall be increased by \n     the amount described in subparagraph (C).\n       (B) Individual described.--An individual is described in \n     this subparagraph if the individual--\n       (i) has not attained age 65;\n       (ii) is eligible for coverage under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act; and\n       (iii) voluntarily elects to enroll in coverage described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (C) Amount described.--The amount described in this \n     subparagraph is the amount equal to the amount that the \n     Federal Government would have incurred with respect to a \n     quarter for providing coverage to an individual described in \n     subparagraph (B) under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n       (d) Implementation Date.--No State may submit a request for \n     a waiver under this section before October 1, 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Stabenow, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1032. A bill to provide for alternative transportation in certain \nfederally owned or managed areas that are open to the general public; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nsimilar to measures I have introduced in previous Congresses that will \nhelp protect our Nation's natural resources and improve the visitor \nexperience in our national parks and other public lands. The Transit in \nParks Act, or ``TRIP,'' establishes a new Federal transit grant \ninitiative to support the development of alternative transportation \nservices for our national parks, wildlife refuges, Federal recreational \nareas, and other public lands. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nAkaka, Alexander, Baucus, Corzine, Dodd, Graham, Kennedy, Lautenberg, \nLevin, Reid, Schumer, Stabenow, and Wyden, who are cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  I want to underscore again today some of the principal arguments I \nhave made in past years as to why this legislation is urgently needed. \nMemorial Day weekend, the opening of the summer travel season, is just \nweeks away. Millions of visitors will soon head to our national parks \nto enjoy the incredible natural heritage with which our Nation was \nendowed. But too many of them will spend hours looking for parking, or \nstaring at the bumper of the car in front of them.\n  Clearly, the world has changed significantly since the national parks \nfirst opened in the second half of the nineteenth century, when \nvisitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. At that time, travel \nthrough parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was long, \ndifficult, and costly. Not many people could afford or endure such a \ntrip. The introduction of the automobile gave every American greater \nmobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and see some \nof our Nation's great natural wonders. Early in this century, landscape \narchitects from the National Park Service and highway engineers from \nthe U.S. Bureau of Public Roads collaborated to produce many feats of \nroad engineering that opened the national park lands to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very \nenvironments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The \nongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of \nvisitors and cars have resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The \nGrand Canyon alone has almost five million visitors a year. As many as \n6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,400 \nparking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park \neach year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a \ngiant parking lot.\n  In 1975, the total number of visitors to America's national parks was \n190 million. By 2002, that number had risen to 277 million annual \nvisitors--almost equal to one visit by every man, woman, and child in \nthis country. This dramatic increase in visitation has created an \noverwhelming demand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic \ncongestion, visitor restrictions, and in some instances vacationers \nbeing shut out of the parks altogether. The environmental damage at the \nGrand Canyon is visible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more \nthan four million visitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than \nthree million visitors a year and experiences such severe traffic \ncongestion that access has to be restricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and \nmany others. We need to solve these problems now or risk permanent harm \nto our nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage.\n  Visitor access to the parks is vital not only to the parks \nthemselves, but to the economic health of their gateway communities. \nFor example, visitors to Yosemite infuse $3 billion a year into the \nlocal economy of the surrounding area. At Yellowstone, tourists spend \n$725 million annually in adjacent communities. Wildlife-related tourism \ngenerates an estimated $60 billion a year nationwide. If the parks are \nforced to close their gates to visitors due to congestion, the economic \nvitality of the surrounding region would be jeopardized.\n  The challenge for park management has always been twofold: to \nconserve and protect the nation's natural, historical, and cultural \nresources, while at the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment \nof these sensitive environments. Until now, the principal \ntransportation systems that the Federal Government has developed to \nprovide access into our national parks are roads, primarily for private \nautomobile access. The TRIP legislation recognizes that we need to do \nmore than simply\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nbuild roads; we must invest in alternative transportation solutions \nbefore our national parks are damaged beyond repair.\n  In developing solutions to the parks' transportation needs, this \nlegislation builds upon the 1997 Memorandum of Understanding between \nSecretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Secretary of the Interior \nBruce Babbitt, in which the two Departments agreed to work together to \naddress transportation and resource management needs in and around \nnational parks. The findings in the MOU are especially revealing: \nCongestion in and approaching many National Parks is causing lengthy \ntraffic delays and backups that substantially detract from the visitor \nexperience. Visitors find that many of the National Parks contain \nsignificant noise and air pollution, and traffic congestion similar to \nthat found on the city streets they left behind.\n  In many National Park units, the capacity of parking facilities at \ninterpretive or scenic areas is well below demand. As a result, \nvisitors park along roadsides, damaging park resources and subjecting \npeople to hazardous safety conditions as they walk near busy roads to \naccess visitor use areas.\n  On occasion, National Park units must close their gates during high \nvisitation periods and turn away the public because the existing \ninfrastructure and transportation systems are at, or beyond, the \ncapacity for which they were designed.\n  In addition, the TRIP legislation is designed to implement the \nrecommendations from a comprehensive study of alternative \ntransportation needs in public lands that I was able to include in the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, as section \n3039. The Federal Lands Alternative Transportation Systems Study \nconfirmed what those of us who have visited our national parks already \nknow: there is a significant and well-documented need for alternative \ntransportation solutions in the national parks to prevent lasting \ndamage to these incomparable natural treasures.\n  The study examined over two hundred sites, and identified needs for \nalternative transportation services at two-thirds of those sites. The \nstudy found that implementation of such services can help achieve a \nnumber of desirable outcomes: ``Relieve traffic congestion and parking \nshortages; enhance visitor mobility and accessibility; preserve \nsensitive natural, cultural, and historic resources; provide improved \ninterpretation, education and visitor information services; reduce \npollution; and improve economic development opportunities for gateway \ncommunities.''\n  In fact, the study concluded that ``the provision of transit in \nfederally-managed lands can have national economic implications as well \nas significant economic benefits for local areas surrounding the \nsites.'' The study determined that funding transit needs would support \nthousands of jobs around the country, while also providing a direct \nbenefit to the economy of gateway communities by ``expand[ing] the \nnumber of visits to the site and expand[ing] the amount of visitor \nspending in the surrounding communities.''\n  The study identified ``lack of a dedicated funding source for \ndeveloping, implementing, and operating and maintaining transit \nsystems'' as a key barrier to implementation of alternative \ntransportation in and around federally-managed lands. The Transit in \nParks Act will go far toward helping parks and their gateway \ncommunities overcome this barrier. This new Federal transit grant \nprogram will provide funding to the Federal land management agencies \nthat manage the 388 various sites within the National Park System, the \nNational Wildlife Refuges, Federal recreational areas, and other public \nlands, including National Forest System lands, and to their State and \nlocal partners.\n  The bill's objectives are to develop new and expanded transit \nservices throughout the national parks and other public lands to \nconserve and protect fragile natural, cultural, and historical \nresources and wildlife habitats, to prevent or mitigate adverse impact \non those resources and habitats, and to reduce pollution and \ncongestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor \naccess and improving the visitor experience. The program will provide \ncapital funds for transit projects, including rail or clean fuel bus \nprojects, joint development activities, pedestrian and bike paths, or \npark waterway access, within or adjacent to national parks and other \npublic lands. The Secretary of Transportation may make funds available \nfor operations as well. The bill authorizes $90 million for this new \nprogram for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2009, consistent with \nthe level of need identified in the study. It is anticipated that other \nresources--both public and private--will be available to augment these \namounts.\n  The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement in the 1997 MOU \nbetween the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \nInterior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures \nrelating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in \nnational park lands. The bill further provides funds for planning, \nresearch, and technical assistance that can supplement other financial \nresources available to the Federal land management agencies. The \nprojects eligible for funding would be developed through the \ntransportation planning process and prioritized for funding by the \nSecretary of the Interior in consultation and cooperation with the \nSecretary of Transportation. It is anticipated that the Secretary of \nthe Interior would select projects that are diverse in location and \nsize. While major national parks such as the Grand Canyon or \nYellowstone are clearly appropriate candidates for significant transit \nprojects under this section, there are numerous small urban and rural \nFederal park lands that can benefit enormously from small projects, \nsuch as bike paths or improved connections with an urban or regional \npublic transit system. No single project will receive more than 12 \npercent of the total amount available in any given year. This ensures a \ndiversity of projects selected for assistance.\n  In addition, I firmly believe that this program will create new \nopportunities for the Federal land management agencies to partner with \nlocal transit agencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, \nboth through the TEA-21 planning process and in developing integrated \ntransportation systems. This will spur new economic development within \nthese communities, as they develop transportation centers for park \nvisitors to connect to transit links into the national parks and other \npublic lands.\n  The ongoing tension between preservation and access has always been a \nchallenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has new \ndimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource \ndegradation increasing at many of our national parks. This \nlegislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land \nmanagement agencies important new tools to improve both preservation \nand access. Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is \nessential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--\nquickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the \nsame time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of \nour gateway communities.\n  As we begin a new millennium, I cannot think of a more worthy \nendeavor to help our environment and preserve our national parks, \nwildlife refuges, and Federal recreational areas than by encouraging \nalternative transportation in these areas. My bill is strongly \nsupported by the National Parks Conservation Association, Environmental \nDefense, the American Public Transportation Association, Community \nTransportation Association, Amalgamated Transit Union, Surface \nTransportation Policy Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nFriends of the Earth, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, America Bikes and \nothers, and I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-section \nanalysis, and letters of support be printed in the Record, along with \nthe USA Today article, ``Save Parks: Park Cars.''\n  I believe that we have a clear choice before us: we can turn paradise \ninto a parking lot--or we can invest in alternatives. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Transit in Parks Act to ensure that our \nNation's natural treasures will be preserved for many generations to \ncome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\n        Corzine, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 1033. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to expand or add coverage of pregnant women under the medicaid and \nState children's health insurance program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with Senators Lugar, Lincoln, Corzine, Landrieu, Breaux, \nKerry, Murray, Cantwell, Clinton, and Miller. This legislation, \nentitled the ``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2003,'' would \nsignificantly reduce the number of uninsured pregnant women and \nnewborns by expanding coverage to pregnant women through Medicaid and \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and to newborns \nthrough the first full year of life.\n  Sunday is Mothers' Day. Every year, we honor our Nation's mothers and \nwe should take the time to assess how we can do better by them, \nincluding their health and well-being.\n  According to a recent report by Save the Children entitled ``The \nState of the World's Mothers,'' the United States fares no better than \n11th in the world. Why is this? According to the report, ``The United \nStates earned its 11th place rank this year based on several factors: \nOne of the key indicators used to calculate the well-being for mothers \nis lifetime risk of maternal mortality . . . Canada, Australia, and all \nthe Western and Northern European countries in the study performed \nbetter than the United States in this indicator.''\n  The study adds, ``Similarly, the United States did not do as well as \nthe top 10 countries with regard to infant mortality rates.''\n  In fact, the United States ranks 21st in maternal mortality and 28th \nin infant mortality, the worst among developed nations. We should and \nmust do better by our Nation's mothers and infants.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, there has been long-standing policy \nlinking programs for pregnant women and infants, including Medicaid, \nWIC, and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. CHIP, \nunfortunately, fails to provide coverage to pregnant women beyond the \nage of 18. As a result, it is more likely that newborns eligible for \nCHIP are not covered from the moment of birth, and therefore, often \nmiss having comprehensive prenatal care and those first critical months \nof life until their CHIP application is processed.\n  By expanding coverage to pregnant women through CHIP, the ``Start \nHealthy, Stay Healthy Act'' recognizes the importance of prenatal care \nto the health and development of a child. As Dr. Alan Waxman of the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of Medicine has written, ``Prenatal \ncare is an important factor in the prevention of birth defects and the \nprevention of prematurity, the most common causes of infant death and \ndisability. Babies born to women with no prenatal care or late prenatal \ncare are nearly twice as likely to [be] low birthweight or very low \nbirthweight as infants born to women who received early prenatal \ncare.''\n  Unfortunately, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, New Mexico ranked worst in the Nation in the percentage of \nmothers receiving late or no prenatal care last year. The result is \noften quite costly--both in terms of the health of the mother and \nnewborn but also in terms of the long-term expenses since the result \ncan be chronic, lifelong health problems.\n  In fact, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \n``four of the top 10 most expensive conditions in the hospital are \nrelated to care of infants with complications (respiratory distress, \nprematurity, heart defects, and lack of oxygen).'' As a result, in \naddition to reduced infant mortality and morbidity, the provision to \nexpand coverage to pregnant women can be cost effective.\n  The ``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act'' also eliminates the \nunintended federal policy through CHIP that covers pregnant women only \nthrough the age of 18 and cuts off that coverage once the women turn 19 \nyears of age. Certainly, everybody can agree that the government should \nnot be telling women that they are more likely to receive prenatal care \ncoverage only if they become pregnant as a teenager.\n  This bipartisan legislation has previously received or has added \nendorsements from the following organizations: the March of Dimes, The \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, the What to Expect Foundation, the American Academy \nof Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the \nFederation of American Health Systems, the National Association of \nPublic Hospitals and Health Systems, Premier, Catholic Health \nAssociation, Catholic Charities USA, Family Voices, the Association of \nMaternal and Child Health Programs, the National Health Law Program, \nthe National Association of Social Workers, Every Child By Two, the \nUnited Cerebral Palsy Associations, the Society for Maternal-Fetal \nMedicine, and Families USA.\n  This legislation is a reintroduction of a bill that was introduced in \n2001. Throughout that year, the Administration made numerous statements \nin support of the passage of this type of legislation, but \nunfortunately, reversed course in October 2002 after publishing a \nregulation allowing states to redefine a ``child'' as an ``unborn \nchild'' and to provide prenatal care through CHIP in that manner. In a \nletter to Senator Nickles dated October 8, 2002, Secretary Thompson \nargued, ``I believe the regulation is a more effective and \ncomprehensive solution to this issue.''\n  While a number of senators strongly disagreed with Secretary \nThompson's assertion and sent him letters to that effect on October 10, \n2002, and on October 23, 2002, we felt it was important to get the \ntestimony of our Nation's medical experts on the health and well-being \nof both pregnant women and newborns. We called for a hearing in the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on October 24, \n2002. Witnesses included representatives from the March of Dimes, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, and the What to Expect Foundation. They were \nasked to compare the regulation to the legislation and I will let their \ntestimony speak for itself.\n  Dr. Nancy Green testified on behalf of the March of Dimes Birth \nDefects Foundation. She said:\n\n       We support giving states the flexibility they need to cover \n     income-eligible pregnant women age 19 and older, and to \n     automatically enroll infants born to SCHIP-eligible mothers. \n     By establishing a uniform eligibility threshold for coverage \n     for pregnant women and infants, states will be able to \n     improve maternal health, eliminate waiting periods for \n     infants and streamline administration of publicly supported \n     health programs. Currently, according to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services and the National Governors' Association, 36 states \n     and the District of Columbia have income eligibility \n     thresholds that are more restrictive for women than for their \n     newborns. Encouraging states to eliminate this disparity by \n     allowing them to establish a uniform eligibility threshold \n     for pregnant women and their infants should be a national \n     policy priority.\n\n  Dr. Green adds:\n\n       Specifically, we are deeply concerned that final regulation \n     fails to provide to the mother the standard scope of \n     maternity care services recommended by the American College \n     of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Of particular concern, the \n     regulation explicitly states that postpartum care is not \n     covered and, therefore, federal reimbursement will not be \n     available for these services. In addition, because of the \n     contentious collateral issues raised by this regulation \n     groups like the March of Dimes will find it even more \n     difficult to work in the states to generate support for \n     legislation to extend coverage to uninsured pregnant women.\n\n  Dr. Laura Riley testified on behalf of ACOG. In her testimony, she \nstated:\n\n       ACOG is very concerned that mothers will not have access to \n     postpartum services under the regulation. The rule clearly \n     states that ``. . . care after delivery, such as postpartum \n     services could not be covered as part of the Title XXI State \n     Plan . . . because they are not services for an eligible \n     child.''\n\n  On the importance of postpartum care, Dr. Riley adds:\n\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\n\n       When new mothers develop postpartum complications, quick \n     access to their physicians is absolutely critical. Postpartum \n     care is especially important for women who have preexisting \n     medical conditions, and for those whose medical conditions \n     were induced by their pregnancies, such as gestational \n     diabetes or hypertension, and for whom it is necessary to \n     ensure that their conditions are stabilized and treated.\n\n  As a result, Dr. Riley concludes:\n\n       Limiting coverage to the fetus instead of the mother omits \n     a critical component of postpartum care that physicians \n     regard as essential for the health of the mother and the \n     child. Covering the fetus as opposed to the mother also \n     raises questions of whether certain services will be \n     available during pregnancy and labor if the condition is one \n     that more directly affects the woman. The best way to address \n     this coverage issue is to pass S. 724, supported by Senators \n     Bond, Bingaman and Lincoln and many others, and which \n     provides a full range of medical services during and after \n     pregnancy directly to the pregnant woman.\n\n  Dr. Richard Bucciarelli testified on behalf of the American Academy \nof Pediatrics. He said:\n\n       Recently, the Administration published a final rule \n     expanding SCHIP cover unborn children. The Academy is \n     concerned that, as written, this regulation falls dangerously \n     short of the clinical standards of care outlined in our \n     guidelines, which describe the importance of covering all \n     stages of a birth--pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care.\n\n  It is important to note that the regulation subtracts the time that \nan ``unborn child'' is covered from the period of continuously \neligibility after birth. Consequently, children would be denied \ninsurance coverage at very critical points during the first full year \nof life. As such, Dr. Bucciarelli expressed support for the legislation \nover the regulation because it, in his words:\n\n       . . . takes an important step to decrease the number of \n     uninsured children by providing 12 months of continuous \n     eligibility for those children born. . . . This legislation \n     ensures that children born to women enrolled in Medicaid or \n     SCHIP are immediately enrolled in the program for which they \n     are eligible. Additionally, this provision prevents newborns \n     eligible for SCHIP from being subject to enrollment waiting \n     periods, ensuring that infants receive appropriate health \n     care in their first year of life.\n\n  And finally, Lisa Bernstein testified as Executive Director of The \nWhat to Expect Foundation, which takes its name from the bestselling \nWhat to Expect pregnancy and parenting series that has helped over 20 \nmillion families from pregnancy through their child's toddler years. \nMs. Bernstein also supported the legislation as a far superior option \nover the regulation and make this simple but eloquent point:\n\n       . . . only a healthy parent can provide a healthy future \n     for a healthy child.\n\n  The testimony of these experts speak for themselves and I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a series of \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for sharing your views on \n     our new proposal to expand health care coverage for low-\n     income pregnant women under the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP). I believe it is not only \n     appropriate, but indeed, medically necessary that our \n     approach to child health care include the prenatal stage.\n       Prenatal care for women and their babies is a crucial part \n     of medical care. These services can be a vital, life-long \n     determinant of health, and we should do everything we can to \n     make this care available for all pregnant women. It is one of \n     the most important investments we can make for the long-term \n     good health of our nation.\n       Our regulation would enable states to make use of funding \n     already available under SCHIP to provide prenatal care for \n     more low-income pregnant women and their babies. The proposed \n     regulation, published in the Federal Register March 5, would \n     clarify the definition of ``child'' under the SCHIP program. \n     At present, SCHIP allows states to provide health care \n     coverage to targeted low-income children under age 19. States \n     may further limit their coverage to age groups within that \n     range. The new regulation would clarify that states may \n     include coverage for children from conception to age 19, \n     enabling SCHIP coverage to include prenatal and delivery care \n     to ensure the birth of healthy infants.\n       Although Medicaid currently provides coverage for prenatal \n     care for some women with low incomes, implementing this new \n     regulation will allow states to offer such coverage to \n     additional women. States would not be required to go through \n     the section 1115 waiver process to expand coverage for \n     prenatal care.\n       By explicitly recognizing in our SCHIP regulations the \n     health needs of children before birth, we can help states \n     provide vital prenatal health care. I believe our approach is \n     entirely appropriate to serve these health purposes. It has \n     been an option for states in their Medicaid programs in the \n     past and it should be made an option for states in their \n     SCHIP program now. As I testified recently at a hearing held \n     by the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce \n     Committee, I also support legislation to expand SCHIP to \n     cover pregnant women. However, because legislation has not \n     moved and because of the importance of prenatal care, I felt \n     it was important to take this action.\n       I know we share the same commitment to achieving the goal \n     of expanding health insurance coverage in order to reduce the \n     number of uninsured.\n       A similar letter is being sent to the cosigners of your \n     letter. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions \n     or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thompson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Republican Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Thank you for contacting me about the \n     Department of Health and Human Services' final regulation to \n     expand pre-natal and pregnancy related services to unborn \n     children under the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP).\n       The final rule allows states the option to extend such \n     services under SCHIP to low-income pregnant women and their \n     unborn children immediately. The rule also enables states to \n     cover a broader population of low-income women and children \n     because it extends coverage to unborn children regardless of \n     their mothers' immigrant status.\n       In your letter, you ask if ``this regulation has obviated \n     the need for additional legislation, and has addressed this \n     issue in a more timely and effective manner.'' As I have \n     stated many times this year, my overarching goal has been to \n     extend prenatal and pregnancy related services to low-income \n     women and their children as quickly as possible so that those \n     mothers are cared for during their pregnancy and their \n     children are born healthy and strong. The law provided me the \n     flexibility to do that and I believe the rule that was \n     published this week achieves this universally desired goal. \n     The proposed legislation, which has been pending in Congress \n     for some time, would amend the SCHIP law so as to duplicate \n     what we have already established as administration policy. I \n     believe the regulation is a more effective and comprehensive \n     solution to this issue. Therefore, there is no need for the \n     Senate to pursue this legislation now.\n       Thank you for inquiring on this important policy matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thompson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Tommy Thompson,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Thompson: Over the course of the past year, \n     you have issued press releases, written letters, and \n     responded to direct questions in both Senate and House \n     hearings in support of passing legislation to provide health \n     care coverage to pregnant women through the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). You have repeatedly stated \n     that you were proceeding with the regulation to expand SCHIP \n     to ``unborn children'' only because legislation to expand \n     coverage to pregnant women had not passed.\n       Your own regulation explicitly makes that very point and \n     acknowledges that ``gaps remain'' and that a number of \n     important health services for pregnant women, including \n     postpartum care, are not provided for in the regulation. And \n     yet, we now read in a letter from you to Senator Nickles \n     dated October 8, 2002, that the ``gaps'' have somehow \n     disappeared. As you write, ``The proposed legislation, which \n     has been pending in Congress for some time, would amend the \n     SCHIP law so as to duplicate what we have already established \n     as administration policy. I believe the regulation is a more \n     effective and comprehensive solution to this issue. \n     Therefore, there is no need for the Senate to pursue this \n     legislation now.''\n       Yet, your own regulation contradicts that statement and \n     notes that ``there are still gaps'' and repeatedly points out \n     those coverage gaps for pregnant women and children. With \n     respect to care for women, under the regulation, it is \n     explicitly stated that ``there must be a connection between \n     the benefits provided and the health of the unborn child.'' A \n     whole range of health services to pregnant women during \n     pregnancy and delivery could be potentially denied as a \n     result. In the case of epidurals, for example, the best the \n     regulation can say is that you ``expect'' coverage.\n       For postpartum care, the regulation explicitly states that \n     any care during that period, including but not limited to \n     hemorrhage, infection, episiotomy repair, C-section repair, \n     family planning counseling, treatment of complications after \n     delivery (including life-saving surgery), and postpartum \n     depression, would be denied. As the regulation reads, \n     ``Commenters are correct that care after delivery, such as \n     postpartum services could not be covered as part of [SCHIP], \n     (unless the mother is under age 19 and eligible for SCHIP in \n     her own right), because they are not services for an eligible \n     child.''\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), the United States ranks 21st in the world in maternal \n     mortality. The major causes of which were hemorrhage, ectopic \n     pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, embolism, \n     infection, and other complications of pregnancy and \n     childbirth. Again, health coverage for many of these \n     conditions is denied under the regulation but not in S. 724. \n     How then do you argue the regulation is ``more effective and \n     comprehensive'' and that the legislation is ``duplicat[ive]'' \n     of the regulation with respect to care for pregnant women?\n       With respect to coverage of children, under the regulation, \n     the 12-month continuous eligibility for children is not from \n     the time of birth but the clock begins running during the \n     time of coverage prior to birth. S. 724 provides \n     comprehensive pediatric care to children throughout the first \n     and most fragile year of life. In contrast, for prenatal care \n     delivered to an ``unborn child'' under this regulation, that \n     time is subtracted from the 12-month period after birth. \n     Therefore, under the regulation, if nine months of prenatal \n     care are provided, the child could lose coverage at the end \n     of the 3rd month after birth. Potentially lost would be a \n     number of important well-baby visits, immunizations, and \n     access to their pediatric caregiver. Once again, how then do \n     you argue the regulation is ``more effective and \n     comprehensive'' and that the legislation is \n     ``duplicat[ative]'' to the regulation for children?\n       Furthermore, according to the rule, the Administration \n     estimates that only 13 states will elect to adopt this \n     definition to include ``unborn children'' in their SCHIP \n     state plans. The other 37 states will either not expand SCHIP \n     to provide prenatal care to additional populations or be \n     forced to seek a federal waiver to also cover pregnant women, \n     as Colorado did just two weeks ago. However, the regulation \n     was right on the mark in stating that it is ``an inferior \n     option'' to require states to have to get waivers to provide \n     the full range of care to pregnant women and 12-month \n     continuous eligibility for children after birth.\n       As the regulation reads, ``. . . the Secretary's ability to \n     intervene through one mechanism (a waiver) should not be the \n     sole option for States and may in fact be an inferior option. \n     Waivers are discretionary on the part of the Secretary and \n     time limited while State plan amendments are permanent, and \n     are subject to budget neutrality.'' For a third time, how can \n     you now argue, less than a week after issuing the regulation, \n     that it is ``more effective and comprehensive'' than the \n     legislation?\n       The States agree, as you know. The National Governors' \n     Association has clear policy expressing support for the \n     passage of such legislation. As their policy position (HR-15. \n     ``The State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) \n     Policy'') reads:\n       ``The Governors have a long tradition of expanding coverage \n     options for pregnant women through the Medicaid program. \n     However, pregnant women in working families are not eligible \n     for SCHIP coverage. The Governors call on Congress to create \n     a state option that would allow states to provide health \n     coverage to income-eligible pregnant women under SCHIP. This \n     small shift in federal policy would allow states to provide \n     critical prenatal care and would increase the likelihood that \n     children born to SCHIP mothers would have a healthy start.''\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\n       Finally, unlike S. 724, the regulation provides absolutely \n     no additional resources (despite estimating the cost to be \n     $330 million over the next five years) for covering ``unborn \n     children'' and certain pregnancy-related services. Current \n     projections by the Office of Management and Budget indicate \n     that SCHIP funds will ultimately be inadequate to cover all \n     the children currently enrolled, even though millions of \n     additional children are eligible but not currently covered. \n     In sharp contrast, just as S. 724 does, we must provide \n     adequate resources to serve both low-income children and low-\n     income pregnant women.\n       Mr. Secretary, just as you said in your press release on \n     January 31, 2002, we also praise Senators Bond, Breaux, and \n     Collins for ``bipartisan leadership in supporting S. 724, a \n     bill that would allow states to provide prenatal coverage for \n     low-income women through the SCHIP program. We support this \n     legislative effort in this Congress.'' We agreed with you on \n     January 31, 2002, and hope that you will once again support \n     the passage of S. 724, the ``Mothers and Newborns Health \n     Insurance Act.''\n       We eagerly await your response to this very important \n     matter with respect to the health and well-being of our \n     nation's children and mothers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman, Jon Corzine, Edward M. Kennedy, Maria \n           Cantwell, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Dianne Feinstein, \n           Blanche L. Lincoln, Mary Landrieu, Patty Murray, James \n           M. Jeffords, John B. Breaux, Jack Reed, Patrick J. \n           Leahy, Barbara A. Mikulski, Charles E. Schumer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for your letter of last \n     week and your continued interest in finding effective ways to \n     increase prenatal coverage.\n       I have frequently stated in the past that my chief \n     objective in proposing the rule to extend coverage to unborn \n     children was to ensure that pregnant women and children who \n     are currently ineligible for health care under either \n     Medicaid or S-CHIP are given the support they need for a \n     healthy pregnancy and a safe delivery. This is clearly a goal \n     we share. When asked my position on pending legislation \n     earlier this year, I expressed general support because my \n     overriding interest and concern has always been to provide \n     prenatal care to more women and children. If legislation \n     could provide that coverage more expeditiously, then it \n     seemed to me it would be advantageous to women and children \n     to see that go forward.\n       However, despite years of committed effort by you and other \n     members, Congress has yet to move legislation through the \n     process. Legislation was introduced in the 106th Congress but \n     was never reported out of Committee in either the House or \n     Senate. In this current Congress, the Senate Finance \n     Committee reported S. 724 in early August of this year, but \n     no floor time was scheduled for its consideration. \n     Consequently, after seven months without any legislative \n     action, I issued a final regulation.\n       Last year, when I saw that I had the authority under \n     current law to provide prenatal and delivery care to low-\n     income pregnant mothers and their unborn children, I was \n     excited because I realized the Department could accomplish \n     what we all wish to achieve: helping those children get a \n     healthy start in life. A great deal of thought went into the \n     regulation and, with the exception of postpartum care after \n     hospitalization, we were able to give the states the same \n     flexibility the would have under the proposed legislation to \n     provide prenatal and delivery care to unborn children and \n     their mothers.\n       Under current law, however, we have the authority to grant \n     waivers that include coverage for women if they become \n     pregnant, including postpartum care. Since January 2001, I \n     have granted approval to a number of states to allow for \n     expanded health insurance coverage through comprehensive 1115 \n     waivers, which also include postpartum care. In fact, this \n     summer I approved a waiver for New Mexico which included \n     prenatal care, labor and delivery, and postpartum care. This \n     regulation simply adds to the options available to the states \n     in expanding health insurance coverage.\n       In addition to making it possible for states to use federal \n     funds to provide the prenatal and pregnancy-related coverage \n     options available under S. 724, the regulation provides \n     additional opportunities and assistance for states to reach \n     low-income women. For example, under the regulation, we were \n     able to reach an even broader population of vulnerable women \n     and children because we could offer prenatal care to the \n     children of immigrants who are otherwise ineligible for any \n     coverage. The establishment of eligibility regardless of \n     immigrant status is possible under the regulation but not \n     under S. 724, making the regulation more comprehensive. I am \n     sure you appreciate the importance of the new opportunity to \n     provide prenatal care and pregnancy-related services to \n     immigrant mothers, given the substantial immigrant population \n     in New Mexico.\n       Additionally, the regulation provides more opportunities \n     for states to access enhanced-match funds than S. 724. Under \n     the bill, states with current eligibility levels for pregnant \n     women below 185 percent of poverty would not be eligible for \n     the enhanced match until they raised their eligibility at \n     their regular match rate. States have already had the option \n     to raise eligibility for pregnant women at their regular \n     match rate, but many have not done so. Thus, we expect that \n     many states will not expand prenatal coverage under S. 724. \n     However, access to enhanced-match funds under the regulation \n     will provide them a more affordable opportunity to do so.\n       With regard to specific criticisms of the rule, you have \n     raised concerns about the reference in the S-CHIP regulation \n     to ``gaps.'' It is important to put the use of the term \n     ``gaps'' in the proper context. This reference is to the \n     eleigbility gap between Medicaid and S-CHIP, which the \n     regulation and S. 724 both seek to close. The response in the \n     regulation does not refer to benefits, so the reference in \n     your recent letter that ``gaps remain'' is taken out of \n     context and, in fact, an incorrect referencing of the \n     regulation.\n       Under both the regulation and the legislation, the states \n     ultimately determine the benefit package. That feature of \n     your legislation does not differ from the rule. And, we have \n     clearly indicated federal funds will be available for \n     services including prenatal care and labor and delivery. Your \n     letter makes assumptions regarding medical services during \n     pregnancy and delivery that HHS does not. The letter confuses \n     medical decisions that are made by physicians with payment of \n     claims under a public assistance program. The regulation is \n     used to establish eligibility for benefits and does not \n     itself extend into medical decision-making between a woman \n     and her physician. HHS responded to a number of questions \n     regarding services and clearly indicated federal financial \n     participation would be available. There is no need to further \n     question whether a claim for a service already provided will \n     receive federal matching funds.\n       The issue of 12 months continuous eligibility is an option \n     for the states. Under the regulation, states that want to \n     extend eligibility can easily do so.\n       I hope this explanation of the regulation and where it \n     extends beyond the reach of S. 724 will give you confidence \n     in our policy and it's ability to meet the ultimate goal that \n     you and I have worked over the years to meet. You are due a \n     large measure of credit for your efforts on behalf of low-\n     income women and their children. The regulation is a victory \n     for those women and children and will give otherwise \n     uncovered needy mothers and their babies a healthy start in \n     life.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thomspon.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2002.\n     Hon. Tommy Thompson,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: Thank you for your letter yesterday \n     with regard to improving health coverage for pregnant women \n     and children. We appreciate your stated desire to ``give \n     otherwise uncovered needy mothers and their babies a healthy \n     start in life'' by adding ``to the options available to the \n     states in expanding health insurance options.'' We believe we \n     can take the best aspects of the legislation and the \n     regulation to truly improve the health and well-being of our \n     nation's children and mothers.\n       In light of the fact that our nation ranks 26th in infant \n     mortality and 21st in maternal mortality in the world, which \n     is the worst among developed nations, we would be remiss to \n     not take the simple but critical step of increasing access to \n     prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care through the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to help prevent \n     birth defects and prematurity, the most common causes of \n     infant death and disability, and maternal death and \n     disability.\n       As your letter acknowledges, postpartum care is not covered \n     under the regulation. This gap in coverage includes a range \n     of critical care for women, including potentially life-saving \n     postpartum care for hemorrhage, pregnancy-induced \n     hypertension, infection, ectopic pregnancy, embolism, \n     episiotomy repair, Caesarean section repair, family planning \n     counseling, postpartum depression, and other complications of \n     pregnancy and childbirth. In fact, according to the National \n     Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), ``Hemorrhage, \n     pregnancy-induced hypertension, infection, and ectopic \n     pregnancy continue to account for more than half of all \n     maternal deaths (59 percent).''\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), there were 3,193 pregnancy-related deaths in this \n     country between 1991 and 1997 for an overall pregnancy-\n     related mortality ratio (PRMR) of 11.5 per 100,000 live \n     births. Racial disparities are rather dramatic with respect \n     to maternal mortality. African-American women had mortality \n     rates over four times higher than that of non-Hispanic whites \n     over the period. American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asian/\n     Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic women had mortality rates 67 \n     percent, 55 percent, and 41 percent, respectively, higher \n     than non-Hispanic whites.\n       Those disparities are even more pronounced in some states. \n     For example, in Wisconsin, the maternal mortality rate for \n     African-American women was 4.2 times that of white women \n     between 1987 and 1996. Certainly, this is something that we \n     can all agree should be addressed.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n       To allow states the option to provide comprehensive \n     coverage to pregnant women, including postpartum care, \n     through SCHIP would help achieve that important goal. S. 724, \n     the ``Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act,'' gives \n     states that important coverage option while the regulation \n     does not.\n       While your letter correctly notes that states may receive \n     comprehensive 1115 waivers to provide coverage to pregnant \n     women, your regulation is correct in noting that is an \n     inferior option. As the regulation reads, ``. . . the \n     Secretary's ability to intervene through one mechanism (a \n     waiver) should not be the sole option for States and may in \n     fact be an inferior option. Waivers are discretionary on the \n     part of the Secretary and time limited while State plan \n     amendments are permanent, and are subject to budget \n     neutrality.'' We should remove those barriers and give states \n     the option to provide pregnant women coverage without having \n     to seek waivers.\n       We would add that the waiver option is allowed for the \n     purposes of giving the Secretary demonstration authority. We \n     certainly can all acknowledge that coverage of pregnant women \n     has reduced both infant mortality and maternal mortality and \n     need not be demonstrated any further. The waiver process \n     seems inappropriate for this purpose. Instead, we should \n     remove those barriers for states to provide comprehensive \n     coverage to pregnant women. As the National Governors' \n     Association has stated in its policy (HR-15. ``The State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) Policy''): The \n     Governors call on Congress to create a state option that \n     would allow states to provide health coverage to income-\n     eligible women under SCHIP. This small shift in federal \n     policy would allow states to provide critical prenatal care \n     and would increase the likelihood that children born to SCHIP \n     mothers would have a healthy start.\n       Just as the governors have requested, we can still make \n     that ``small shift'' in policy through the passage of S. 724.\n       As for the coverage of infants, your letter did not address \n     the issues raised in a previous letter to you from 15 \n     senators, including many of us, dated October 10, 2002. Your \n     letter restates the fact that states have the option to \n     provide children 12 months of continuous eligibility in \n     Medicaid and SCHIP. However, under the regulation, the 12-\n     month continuous eligibility for children is not from the \n     time of birth. Rather, the clock begins running during the \n     time of coverage prior to birth. Thus, it is likely that most \n     newborns would have far less than 12 months of coverage after \n     birth if a State chooses to use the option to provide care to \n     ``unborn children.'' If covered for the full nine months of \n     pregnancy, the child could lose eligibility for SCHIP after \n     the third month of life and consequently lose important \n     coverage for well-baby visits, immunizations, and access to \n     their pediatric caregiver. That would be an outright \n     reduction of coverage for some children after birth.\n       We would note that the legislation continues to have the \n     strong support of a number of groups, including some who \n     support the regulation but acknowledge its shortcomings and \n     continue to support passing legislation. Those groups include \n     the American Association of University Affiliated Programs, \n     the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of \n     Nurse Midwives, the American College of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecologists, the American Hospital Association, the \n     American Medical Association, the American Public Health \n     Association, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \n     Neonatal Nurses, the Association of Maternal and Child Health \n     Programs, the Catholic Health Association, Catholic Charities \n     USA, the Council of Women's and Infants' Specialty Hospitals, \n     the Easter Seals, FamilyVoices, the March of Dimes, the \n     National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National \n     Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, the \n     National Women's Health Network, the National Association of \n     County and City Health Officials, the Society for Maternal-\n     Fetal Medicine, the Spina Bifida Association of America, the \n     Alan Guttmacher Institute, and the United Cerebral Palsy \n     Associations.\n       There are certainly areas where the regulation is more \n     comprehensive than the legislation, such as providing \n     coverage to the ``unborn children'' of immigrant mothers and \n     by providing states easier access to enhanced matching funds. \n     We believe we could certainly amend S. 724 to address these \n     shortcomings rather easily. It would be easy to drop the \n     requirement in the bill for a state to expand eligibility to \n     185 percent of poverty before receiving the enhanced matching \n     rate. However, this begs the question about the need for \n     providing additional resources in SCHIP to cover these \n     options. Current projections by the Office of Management and \n     Budget indicate that SCHIP funds will ultimately be \n     inadequate to cover all the children currently enrolled, even \n     though millions of additional children are eligible but not \n     currently covered. S. 724 provides such funding, which the \n     regulation does not and cannot.\n       In short, we believe that we can rather quickly achieve the \n     best of both the legislation and the regulation. S. 724 \n     expands state options to cover critically important \n     postpartum services for women, ensures children are eligible \n     for coverage throughout the first and most critical year of \n     life, and provides much needed resources to provide such \n     care.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nBingaman to re-introduce the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2003.\n  The United States ranks 26th in infant mortality and 21st in maternal \nmortality in the world, the worst among developed nations. Study after \nstudy shows that providing prenatal care to pregnant women reduces \nmaternal and infant mortality and the incidence of low birth weight \nbabies. According to the American Medical Association, ``Babies born to \nwomen who do not receive prenatal care are four times more likely to \ndie before their first birthday.''\n  The Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2003 would significantly \nreduce the number of uninsured pregnant women and newborns by providing \nStates with the option to further extend coverage to pregnant women \nthrough Medicaid and CHIP, to reduce infant and maternal mortality and \nlow birth weight babies, and to cover newborns through the first full \nyear of life.\n  Current federal law allows pregnant women to receive coverage through \nCHIP through age 18--creating a perverse Federal incentive of covering \nonly teenage pregnant women and cutting off that coverage once they \nturn 19 years of age. This legislation would eliminate this problem by \nallowing States to cover pregnant women through CHIP, regardless of \nage. This also eliminates the unfortunate separation between pregnant \nwomen and infants that has been created through CHIP, and is contrary \nto longstanding federal policy through programs such as Medicaid, Women \nwith Infants and Children, WIC, Maternal and Child Health, MCH, etc.\n  An estimated 4.3 million, or 32 percent, of mothers below 200 percent \nof poverty are uninsured. According to the March of Dimes, ``Over 95 \npercent of all uninsured pregnant women could be covered through a \ncombination of aggressive Medicaid outreach, maximizing coverage for \nyoung women through [CHIP], and expanding CHIP to cover income-eligible \npregnant women regardless of age.''\n  Increasing the availability of affordable health care is certainly an \nissue of great importance to our Nation--particularly those who are \nuninsured. While our bill will not solve the problem of the uninsured, \nwe believe that helping more pregnant women and babies receive care is \na significant step in the right direction.\n  I ask our colleagues to support the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act \nof 2003, and help us take this important step in improving health care \nfor the mothers of tomorrow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, \n        and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1034. A bill to repeal the sunset date on the assault weapons ban, \nto ban the importation of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Chuck Schumer, Lincoln Chafee, Barbara Boxer, Dick \nDurbin, Jack Reed, Frank Lautenberg, Jim Jeffords, and Edward Kennedy \nthat would permanently reauthorize the assault weapons ban and close \nthe clip-importation loophole.\n  Military-style assault weapons simply have no place on America's \nstreets. But if Congress fails to act, the current ban will expire next \nyear. This would be a terrible mistake.\n  This is why Congress must reauthorize the ban and close the high-\ncapacity\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\nclip importation loophole so that we can help keep America's streets \nsafe from the violence produced by assault weapons.\n  Almost 10 years ago on July 1, 1993 Gian Luigi Ferri walked into 101 \nCalifornia Street in San Francisco carrying two high-capacity TEC-9 \nassault pistols.\n  Within minutes, he had murdered eight people, and six others were \nwounded. This tragedy shook San Francisco and the entire nation.\n  We saw with absolute clarity the destruction that could be inflicted \nwith these military-style assault weapons.\n  Navegar's advertising for the TEC-9 touted the gun as being for \n`paramilitary' use and `resistant to fingerprints,' with a `military \nnon-glare finish,' a `military blowback system,' and `combat-type' \nsights.\n  Guns like these are the weapons of choice to commit crimes. They are \nthe weapons of choice for drive-by shooters, criminals going into a \nmajor criminal event, and malcontents who are seeking to do the maximum \ndamage possible in the shortest amount of time.\n  That's what makes them so dangerous because they have light triggers, \nyou can spray fire them, you can hold them with two hands, and you \ndon't really need to aim.\n  They are not weapons of choice for hunting or defensive purposes.\n  In the aftermath of 101 California and countless other shootings, I \ndecided to do something that no one had succeeded in doing before: to \nban the manufacture and importation of military style assault weapons.\n  I authored the bill in the Senate, and Senator Schumer authored it in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I remember all the late night calls I got and all the friends who \ntook me aside and said to me: ``Don't do it. The gunners are too \npowerful. You'll never ever win.''\n  Well, we did win. We passed the first-ever ban on assault weapons, \nand since September 13, 1994, it has been illegal to manufacture and \nimport military-style assault weapons.\n  The hope of the bill has been to drive down the supply of these \nweapons and make them more expensive to obtain.\n  And in the years following the enactment of the ban, crimes using \nassault weapons were reduced dramatically.\n  In 1993, assault weapons accounted for 8.2 percent of all guns used \nin crimes; By the end of 1995, that proportion had fallen to 4.3 \npercent--a dramatic drop; and by November 1996, the last date for which \nstatistics are available, the proportion had fallen to 3.2 percent.\n  These are dramatic results, which show that the Assault Weapons ban \nhas worked. We have had trouble getting updated statistics from this \nJustice Department, but it is clear that after we banned these guns, \ncriminals used them less frequently in crime.\n  Unfortunately, to get the bill passed in 1994, we had to agree to a \nten-year sunset in the bill--and this is why we are here today. If we \ndo not re-authorize the 1994 assault weapons ban this Congress, it will \nexpire on September 13, 2004.\n  That means that at the end of next year, manufacturers could once \nagain begin making AK-47s, TEC-9s, and other banned guns that have but \none purpose--to kill other human beings.\n  We are here today because we believe that this would be a terrible \nmistake--with deadly consequences for thousands of Americans each year.\n  So today we will introduce legislation to do two simple things. \nFirst, the legislation would reauthorize the 1994 assault weapons ban \nby striking the sunset date from the original law. This would ban the \nmanufacture of 19 types of common military style assault weapons--for \nall time.\n  It would ban an additional group of these assault weapons that have \nbeen banned by characteristic for 8 years.\n  It would protect some 670 hunting and other recreational rifles for \nuse by law-abiding citizens.\n  And it would preserve the right of police officers and other law \nenforcement officials to use and obtain newly manufactured semi-\nautomatic assault weapons--helping to prevent instances when law \nenforcement agents are outgunned by perpetrators.\n  We certainly would like a stronger bill that would tighten the ban--\nbased on our 10 years of experience of what the gun companies have done \nto get around the bill.\n  But unfortunately there is not the support for that right now. If the \nsupport becomes evident, then we may amend the bill at a later date.\n  Second, the legislation would close a loophole in the 1994 law, which \nprohibits the domestic manufacture of high-capacity ammunition \nmagazines, but allows foreign companies to continue sending them to \nthis country by the millions.\n  A measure that would have closed this loophole passed the House and \nSenate in 1999 by wide margins, but got bottled up in a larger \nconference due to an unrelated provision.\n  The result: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has approved \nthe importation of almost 50 million high capacity ammunition magazines \nfrom some 50 countries since 1994.\n  It is these large clips, drums, and strips that allow lone gunmen, or \nsmall groups of teenagers, to inflict so much damage in such a small \namount of time.\n  We must close this loophole now.\n  The good news: President Bush has indicated that he supports each of \nthese provisions. During the 2000 Presidential Campaign, President Bush \nindicated that he supported both reauthorization of the assault weapons \nban and closing the clip importation loophole.\n  And just a few weeks ago, President Bush's spokesman Scott McClellan \nreiterated his support for reauthorizing the ban when he said: ``The \nPresident supports the current law, and he supports reauthorization of \nthe current law.''\n  It is therefore our hope that the President will work with us to see \nthis bill passed. We welcome the President's support and look forward \nto working with him to gain swift passage of this legislation.\n  One of the best examples of the damage that assault weapons can \ninflict is the massacre in Littleton, Colorado.\n  On April 24, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold used a TEC DC-9 \nsemi-automatic pistol to attack the students and teachers of Columbine \nHigh School.\n  They used this weapon to take the lives of 13 innocents, 12 students \nand 1 teacher, and injured dozens more mothers, fathers, sons and \ndaughters.\n  I do not believe that the 2nd Amendment protects military assault \nweapons. The Constitution is not an umbrella for mayhem. The Bill of \nRights is not a guarantor of violence.\n  Congress has passed this legislation once--it is time to pass the \nassault weapons ban again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assault Weapons Ban \n     Reauthorization Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF SUNSET DATE.\n\n       Section 110105 of the Public Safety and Recreational \n     Firearms Use Protection Act (18 U.S.C. 921 note) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 110105.

REPORT ON DEFENDING AIRCRAFT FROM MAN-PORTABLE AIR \n                   DEFENSE SYSTEMS (SHOULDER-FIRED MISSILES).\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act,\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\n     the Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue a report to \n     the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure on how best to defend turbo and jet \n     passenger aircraft from Man-Portable Air Defense Systems \n     (shoulder-fired missiles).\n       (b) Issues To Be Addressed.--The report shall include an \n     analysis of--\n       (1) actions taken to date, countermeasures, risk \n     mitigation, and other activities;\n       (2) existing military countermeasure systems and how those \n     systems might be adapted to commercial aircraft applications;\n       (3) means of reducing the costs of military countermeasure \n     system by modifying them for use on commercial aircraft; and\n       (4) the extent of the threat and the need for \n     countermeasures.\n       (c) Report Format.--The report may be submitted in \n     classified form.\n\n     SEC. 14.

JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 137, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Frist, Daschle, Stevens, Kennedy, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 137) honoring James A. Johnson, \n     Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy \n     Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Frist, Daschle, Stevens, and Kennedy, to cosponsor a \nresolution honoring a very distinguished American who I am proud to \ncall my very dear friend--Mr. James Johnson.\n  Minnesota has produced some extraordinary political individuals--\nHarold Stassen, Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy and Walter Mondale, \namong others. But among those who have never sought public office, but \nare still devoted to public policy and the power of good government, \nJim Johnson stands out.\n  Born in the small town of Benson, Jim Johnson was exposed at an early \nage to Minnesota politics, where his father, Alfred Ingvald, was a \nleading figure in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, serving for 2 \nyears as speaker of the Minnesota House.\n  A natural politician, Jim was elected student body president at the \nUniversity of Minnesota when only a sophomore, then went to Africa on a \ngrant from the Ford Foundation, and earned a masters degree from \nPrinceton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Government.\n  After serving on his Senate staff, Jim served as Executive Assistant \nto Vice President Walter Mondale and served as campaign director of the \nVice President's 1984 bid for the White House.\n  In the private sector, Jim founded Public Strategies, with Richard \nHolbrooke, and later served as a managing director at Lehman Brothers.\n  Most notably, he also served as chairman and CEO of Fannie Mae, with \nthe goal of allowing more Americans to fulfill their dreams of home \nownership, and then as the chairman of the Kennedy Center.\n  For the last 7 years, Jim Johnson has done a remarkable job at the \ncenter.\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\nDuring his tenure, Congress approved a $650 million construction \nproject that will include two new buildings and a large plaza, to \nbetter connect the center with the rest of the city.\n  He has made the center more accessible to the public, thanks to the \nfree 6 p.m. performances that are held every day.\n  And who could forget last year's superb tribute to the America \nmaster, Stephen Sondheim?\n  At the same time, the Kennedy Center Awards have become nationally \nrecognized and broadcast on prime time TV.\n  Not only has Jim Johnson worked tirelessly on behalf of the Kennedy \nCenter, he has also been one of the center's most generous benefactors.\n  There is an old story about Jim Johnson, when he and former President \nClinton were in their mid 20s and trying to gain their footing in the \npolitical arena.\n  What was very clear to everyone who knew the two of them back then: \nboth had a real shot of becoming President of the United States.\n  Well, Jim Johnson never took the path of elected office. But he went \non to serve our Nation with great distinction, in the public and the \nprivate sector, and he still has so much left to give. Wherever he goes \nand whatever he does, Jim Johnson will surely leave an indelible mark.\n  His wife Maxine and their son Alfred are immensely proud of this \nextraordinary man, just as I consider myself so very fortunate to call \nhim my friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, that any statements relating thereto be printed \nin the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 137) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 137\n\n       Whereas James A. Johnson has served with distinction since \n     1996 as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the John F. \n     Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is the national \n     center for the performing arts;\n       Whereas under the leadership of Jim Johnson, the Kennedy \n     Center has earned impressive renown, and become one of the \n     finest performing arts institutions in the Nation and around \n     the world;\n       Whereas Jim Johnson initiated free public performances each \n     evening on the Millennium Stage at the Kennedy Center, and \n     these performances have now included a total of 25,000 \n     performers and reached an audience of 1,500,000 persons since \n     1997;\n       Whereas the arts education programs of the Kennedy Center \n     have been significantly expanded under the inspired \n     leadership of Jim Johnson;\n       Whereas Jim Johnson has launched a major renovation and \n     construction project to improve the physical structure of the \n     Kennedy Center and enrich the experience of all who visit and \n     attend performances; and\n       Whereas Jim Johnson deserves the thanks of a grateful \n     Nation for his leadership at the Kennedy Center, and in \n     bringing new vitality to the cultural heritage of our Nation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its appreciation for all that Jim Johnson has \n     accomplished; and\n       (2) commends Jim Johnson for his extraordinary achievements \n     as Chairman of the John F.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Prior to our closing tonight, I want to lay on the record \nthat I think we have had a pretty good week this week. There has been a \nlot of work done by both sides, and we have accomplished a great deal. \nToday was an indication of what can be done if we work together.\n  I know people in the majority feel strongly about Miguel Estrada and \nPriscilla Owen. I have to say the record this Senate has established \nregarding the approval of judges is tremendous. Today we approved the \n124th judge during the administration of this President Bush. That is \npretty good.\n  I hope those Senators who feel so intently about Priscilla Owen and \nMiguel Estrada--it is certainly their right to feel so strongly, as \npeople on this side feel strongly regarding opposition of the two \njudges--also recognize the number of judges that have been approved. We \nthink we have done a good job. In fact, this week I asked my staff how \nmany we approved. I think it was four or five judges even this week. So \nwe are moving right along.\n  I have no objection to the unanimous consent request of the \ndistinguished majority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that the Senator from Nevada \nis certainly correct. A number of judges have been confirmed. But also \nthis Senate and this Congress will be remembered, apparently--we will \nsee at the end of the Congress--apparently be remembered as the first \nSenate since 1968 to kill a nomination through the use of the \nfilibuster.\n  There have been occasional cloture motions over the years, but they \nhave been used to advance the completion of a nomination--not to stop \nit--with the exception of Fortas in 1968, which was right before a \nPresidential election. We are not right before a Presidential election. \nI think this unfortunate precedent that has been set is one that we \nhave had much discussion about on the floor and will be regretted by \nSenators on both sides of the aisle through the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/08/senate-section/article/S5979-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5979-S5980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
