Mr. President, this morning there will be a period of \nmorning business for 2 hours, until 11:30 a.m., for Senators to speak \nand introduce bills.\n  Today, we expect to receive from the House a continuing resolution. \nIt is my hope that we will be able to take up that measure and pass it \nin short order. We also hope to have the committee resolutions \ncompleted so that we can get the committees up and running so they can \nall begin their work for the 108th Congress.\n  Yesterday, the Republican conference approved our membership and, \ntherefore, we would like to have the respective party committee \nresolutions passed today if at all possible.\n  Over the course of the morning we will be talking leadership to \nleadership to establish a timetable, but hopefully that can be done \ntoday in terms of the committee composition and chairmanships.\n  Senators should know that rollcall votes are possible today. We will \nlet Senators know the timing of votes as soon as they are scheduled. \nAlso, Senators should be aware that if we are unable to complete our \nwork today, there could be rollcall votes on Friday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. ALEXANDER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if that resolution is agreed to today, I \nwould like to have a meeting of the Appropriations Committee tomorrow \nmorning at 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. FRIST. I understand. It is absolutely critical that we finish \nmuch of the business from last year. There are 11 appropriations bills \nthat are very dependent on us having the committee resolutions passed. \nHopefully that can be done as soon as possible. We made real progress \nyesterday. I am very hopeful, over the course of today, we can come to \nsome conclusion with that, and then we would be able to have the \nappropriations meetings and be able to address the spending bills--11 \nof those spending bills that are critically important to this country--\nover the course of Friday and next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves, as the \nleader knows, we had a very productive meeting with the President \nyesterday. We left there with the feeling of bipartisanship that we \nshould have with us today. We would hope, with the chairman of the very \nimportant Appropriations Committee, the President pro tempore of the \nSenate, being on the\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\nfloor today, that we can make it possible so he and Senator Byrd can \nlead us in completing that appropriations process.\n  So we look forward to working with you. Hopefully, we can get this \ndone in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S90-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we did have a meeting with the President \nyesterday. It was one where we talked about the things that need to be \ndone. The people who were at the meeting are experienced and understand \nthe legislative perils we face on a daily basis. But we also recognize \nthere are things that need to be done for the country, and we have to \nwork toward that.\n  I want to just briefly mention today that Senator Daschle introduced, \non behalf of the Democratic caucus, bills that we believe are extremely \nimportant to pass. These are not necessarily in the order of \nimportance, but the first bill introduced was S. 6, the Comprehensive \nHomeland Security Act.\n  Basically, this bill builds on legislative initiatives that were \npassed in the 107th Congress. It would authorize funding for important \nprograms. We have big holes in our security blanket. We have to do \nsomething about chemical security, domestic nuclear plants. We have to \ndo something about rail security, security of water treatment works, \nand border security efforts to combat terrorism generally. This \nlegislation is, in my opinion, a must-do piece of legislation.\n  Prescription drugs has been talked about endlessly, with nothing \nhaving been done. It is so important that we pass legislation that \nmakes Medicare a more meaningful, modern piece of legislation for our \nsenior citizens.\n  When the Medicare legislation passed in 1965, there was really no \nneed for prescription drugs because they were not used as they are \ntoday to make people more comfortable, to save lives, and to prevent \ndisease. But now that is part of the basic treatment that seniors have.\n  The average senior has 18 prescriptions filled every year. As a \nresult, they pay large amounts out of their pocket for prescription \ndrugs. What we have to do is provide a prescription drug benefit as \npart of Medicare. We need to do that and also in the process preserve \nMedicare. Medicare is not a perfect program, but it is a good program. \nPeople are saying it is about to go broke. Medicare is not about to go \nbroke. And always remember that Medicare is a pay-as-you-go program. We \ncontinually have to refund and figure out ways to finance Medicare. \nThat is the way it is. It is different than Social Security.\n  So a prescription drug benefit is important for Medicare. Also, it is \nimportant we get ahold of prescription drug prices generally for \neverybody. Prescription drugs in this country are tremendously \nexpensive, more expensive than in any other country, even though we \ndevelop and manufacture and produce most of them. It is not fair we \nspend more on prescription drugs than other countries. It is not fair \nthey are cheaper in Canada and cheaper in Mexico than they are in the \nUnited States.\n  The Leave No Child Behind Act is something that is an important piece \nof legislation, but the problem now is that it is not funded. We have \nto provide full funding for this No Child Left Behind Act. We have to \nhold States accountable for ensuring that all students have access to \neducational resources.\n  We have to guarantee full funding of the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has been a loud advocate for doing \nsomething to fund that program. We have to, as part of S. 8, help \ncommunities modernize public schools, and there are other things we \nneed to do included in S. 8 that we need to debate and pass this year.\n  S. 9 is the protection for pensions. This is a buildup of last year's \ncorporate scandals and the 3-year stock market decline. They have \nsimply highlighted the need to strengthen pension protections. That is \nwhat S. 9 is all about.\n  S. 10 deals with the more than 40 million people who have no health \ninsurance. There are many other people who have inadequate health \ninsurance. We have to do something to provide some way of these people \ngetting decent medical care. Over 40 million people with no health \ninsurance says it all. That is what S. 10 is all about.\n  As to the Equal Rights and Equal Dignity for Americans Act, we \nbelieve that we have to expand hate crimes protection, strengthen \nenforcement of existing civil rights laws, support legal representation \nfor indigent Americans, and respond to the injustice of racial \nprofiling. That is what S. 16 is all about. It is important legislation \nthat needs to be passed.\n  Global warming is S. 17. There is no question, there is no debate--\nsensibly, logically, intellectually--that global warming is taking \nplace. It is. The question is, what are we going to do about it? That \nis the key.\n  We as Democrats talk about the minimum wage. We do it because most \npeople have the stereotype that people who draw the minimum wage are \nkids flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. That is not the case. In fact, \n60 percent of the people who draw the minimum wage are women; for 40 \npercent of those women, that is the only money they get for them and \ntheir families. So it is really important that we do something to \nincrease the minimum wage. The minimum wage act would in two steps \nraise the minimum wage by $1.50: 75 cents when we pass the legislation; \n75 cents after that. It is important we do that.\n  Many people who work two and sometimes three jobs, most of them part \ntime, are paid the minimum wage. We need to increase that. That is the \nright thing to do.\n  I was very happy the leader included in his package of must-do \nlegislation for the Democratic caucus this year the Veterans and \nMilitary Personnel Fairness Act. Among other provisions, this includes \nexpanding full concurrent receipt of military retirement. We have made \na little bit of progress over the last couple years. Last year we made \nthe most progress, but we are still lacking.\n  If you retire from the military and have a medical disability, you \ncannot draw both pensions. Prior to last year, no one could. Last year \nwe provided that people who are Purple Heart recipients basically can. \nWe need to expand that. I was very happy the leader included this \nlegislation that I authored and have worked on very closely with \nSenators Levin and Warner. It has taken years to get where we are now. \nWe will continue to try to expand until people who retire from the \nmilitary and have a disability can draw the same pension as somebody \nwho retires from Sears and Roebuck and the Department of Interior and \nhas the military disability. They should be able to draw the pension \njust the same. We want that to happen.\n  S. 21, the Emergency Disaster Assistance Act, addresses severe \ndrought and floods, natural disasters farmers and ranchers face all \nover the country. We need to do more to take care of these desperate \npeople. Time magazine had their pictures of the year. I looked at that \nlast night before going to bed. It is interesting to note that a number \nof those pictures deal with the drought that has taken place. One \npicture is of a 67-year-old farmer. For the first time in his career, \nhe has nothing. He said: Farmers know what to do when it rains; we \ndon't know what to do when it doesn't rain.\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\n  That is what this legislation is all about. I hope in the spirit of \nwhat the majority leader talked about today and the President talked \nabout at the White House yesterday we can work together to pass this \nlegislation.\n  The majority has pieces of legislation that they believe are \nimportant to pass. What we should do is work together. They have pieces \nof our legislation. Maybe we can work together. That is what we should \ndo to pass the legislation. I don't think there would be many who would \ndisagree that this legislation is important. They may not agree with \nevery part of it, but that is what legislation is about. Legislation is \nthe art of compromise. I hope we can move forward and do some \ncompromising and some legislating.\n  Before the Senator takes his 40 minutes, I would say to my friends on \nthe Democratic side, prior to their arriving, Senator Gregg asked for \n40 minutes of the hour that the Republicans have set aside. He will do \nthat now. Do you want to lock in a time for the two Senators now?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would need 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. You are entitled to 10. So following the remarks of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Arkansas will speak. The \nSenator from Minnesota?\n  Mr. DAYTON. If I may have 15.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of the Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Arkansas \nbe recognized for up to 10 minutes and the Senator from Minnesota for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will speak for about 40 minutes. I \nunderstood the Senator from Arkansas only needed about 5 minutes. I am \nhappy to yield to her now as long as it does not impact my 40 minutes, \nif the Senator from Arkansas wishes to proceed.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nproceed as in morning business for 5 minutes and that it not take \nanything out of the time of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S91-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S91]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO LANCE CORPORAL JASON SMEDLEY\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have some very important guests with \nme today in the Senate. I wanted to share that with my colleagues as \nwell as my colleagues across the land.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to a young man who is with me today and \nwho has served on my staff for the past year, Jason Smedley, of Little \nRock, AK. We are joined today by his mother and his girlfriend and many \nmembers of my staff. Jason is a lance corporal in the 4th Civil Affairs \nGroup of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed here in Washington, DC.\n  On Friday, Jason and his colleagues will depart for the Middle East \nwhere he will await orders for potential U.S. military action against \nIraq. Like all of the men and women who serve in our armed forces to \npreserve our liberties and ensure global security, Jason is making a \ntremendous sacrifice in service to his country.\n  As a senior at Howard University, Jason is only a few months away \nfrom completing studies and earning his degree which he plans to earn \nupon his return. He will be leaving behind his 2-year old daughter Isis \nand his parents James and Carolyn Smedley, all of Little Rock, AK.\n  For the next few months, Jason is offering his service in a cause \ngreater than himself. I know that all of my colleagues and the American \npeople join me in honoring Jason and the tens of thousands of men and \nwomen who, just like him, face similar sacrifices in the coming weeks \nand months.\n  From Arkansas alone, as of last week nearly 700 Guardsmen and \nreservists have been activated in support of the war on terrorism and \nfor potential action against Iraq. These include troops from Little \nRock, North Little Rock, Lincoln, Ogden, Ozark, Siloam Springs, Van \nBuren, Fayetteville, Pine Bluff, and Fort Smith. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the list of Arkansas units currently activated in support \nof the war on terrorism and potential action against Iraq be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. We are proud of each and every one of these men and \nwomen for their commitment to this country and to each of us. We look \nforward to welcoming them back when their work overseas is done. My own \nfather who passed away in October was a veteran of the Korean war. He \ntaught me to always respect the great commitment made by our troops in \nfighting to protect our freedoms. Our troops of today's generation \ndeserve the same respect.\n  During Jason's service to Arkansas as a member of my staff, I have \nappreciated his hard work, as well as his energy and positive attitude. \nI look forward to welcoming him back to my staff as soon as possible. I \nam sure all of my colleagues here will join me in wishing Lance \nCorporal Jason Smedley the best in the months ahead.\n  I thank his mother and girlfriend for being here to share that with \nus today. Most importantly, I ask my colleagues, as we enter into the \nchallenging months we have before us in this great country, that we \nlook not only within ourselves but around us to our immediate family, \nto our extended family, to our Senate family, and to all of those lives \nthat are going to be, have been, and will be affected. This is a great \ncountry. The freedoms we enjoy, the incredible potential that we have \nis right here in people such as Jason Smedley.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me as we wish Jason well in his endeavors \nand as he goes to take on whatever his duties may be on behalf of the \nAmerican people. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for affording \nme the opportunity to salute someone who has meant an awful lot to me \nin my life and in my work and now to me, as an American citizen, and to \nthe rest of this great country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, especially, to Lance Corporal \nJason Smedley. We bid you well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       The following units from Arkansas have been activated as of \n     December 31, 2002:\n     Army National Guard:\n       N.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak today on a number of \nissues--primarily on the issue of the legislation we passed a year ago, \nwhich was landmark legislation, called ``No Child\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\nLeft Behind.'' It fundamentally changed the way the Federal Government \nand many of our educational institutions across the Nation will \napproach the education of low-income especially, but children \ngenerally.\n  Yesterday was the 1-year anniversary of this extraordinary bill, the \nmost significant piece of education reform legislation passed by the \nCongress. It was the primary domestic policy initiative of the \nPresident in his first 2 years in office. It continues to be one of his \nprimary focuses. The No Child Left Behind bill had as its goal \nessentially a few items. No. 1 was that low income children who for \nyears have been basically warehoused through our system will no longer \nbe put into that situation. Low-income children especially will be \ngiven the opportunity to learn and compete in our society and be given \nthe opportunity to receive an education that will allow them to \nparticipate in the American dream; and that no child--low-income or \nnot--should be left behind by our educational system. It did this and \nit tries to accomplish this goal by basically empowering the local \nschool districts, the teachers, the principals, and the school boards, \nwith more opportunities for educating the low-income child. It gives \nthem more flexibility over the dollars the Federal Government puts back \ninto the school districts and gives them more dollars. At the same \ntime, it is saying to the school districts and the States that we are \ngoing to give you more dollars and more flexibility for handling the \ndollars and, in addition, we are going to expect results, \naccountability; and the children, as they move through their \neducational experience--in the elementary school systems, especially--\nare actually learning to their grade level.\n\n  We are going to have standards and tests--not developed by the \nFederal Government but, rather, by the local communities and the \nStates--and those standards and tests are going to be set by the local \ncommunities and the States. Once they are set, we are going to expect \nthat the children in those schools in those districts will have the \neducational experience that will allow them to reach those standards \nand goals set out by the States and local communities. So we will have \naccountability.\n  Most important, we are going to give the parents of those children \nthe opportunity to see how successful their children are, to learn \nwhether or not the schools they are in are teaching their children at a \nlevel that gives the children the ability to compete in America and \nparticipate in the American dream.\n  If the school systems regrettably do not succeed, if after years of \neffort in trying to bring them up to speed they are unable still to \neducate the children at a level that is competitive with their peers, \nthen we are going to give the parents and the school systems tools to \nallow those schools to reform and we are going to give the parents \ntools to get their children other options for education.\n  So under this bill, we would basically do four things: 1, put more \nmoney into the system; 2, put more flexibility into the system for the \nuse of that money; 3, expect accountability; and empower parents to \ntake action to try to correct the situation of their child not getting \nthe education and assistance that they need.\n  This bill, this concept, obviously, is a huge and fundamental change. \nThere is clearly going to be, and there has been, a period of \nadjustment and ramping up and organizing that is necessary to put this \ntype of change in place. We are just really in the early stages of that \neffort. In fact, the States, under this bill, do not have to have their \nplans in and approved until the end of this month. So as a practical \nmatter, many States have not even ordered their plans in order to \nrespond to the issue of how you bring your children up to speed and how \nyou make sure no child is left behind. A few States have. The President \nyesterday recognized five States that have put in place plans that meet \nthe basic goals of the No Child Left Behind bill, which is to create a \nsystem where there is accountability and where parents will know how \nmuch their children are learning and where, if it doesn't work, if some \nschools are not reaching the levels of success that are required, then \nthere will be options for those parents, such as public school choice, \nsuch as getting tutorial support for their children, or such as just \nreform fundamentally the school that is having problems.\n  Five States have already accomplished that: Ohio, Massachusetts, New \nYork, Indiana--I am not sure of the fifth. But these States have a lot \nof kids in their school systems and they have been able to pull \ntogether the plans to be successful under the No Child Left Behind \nbill.\n  As these States and communities and school systems have tried to get \norganized to be ready for the No Child Left Behind initiative and tried \nto address the issue that I think we all want to accomplish--to make \nsure the school systems of America are strong, vibrant, and are giving \nchildren what they need in order to learn--as that has happened, \nunfortunately, there has been an undercurrent of opposition growing. I \nam not sure what is energizing it. Some is initiated by the fact that \nmany of our States and local school districts are going through very \ndifficult economic times now, and therefore they are under strain \nfinancially, and that is understandable. Some of it is initiated simply \nbecause there are, unfortunately, people in the educational community--\ncertainly not the majority and certainly not even a large percentage, \nin my opinion, because I think the vast majority of people in education \nreally want to succeed and they want this bill to work and they \nunderstand the importance of making sure our children learn or they \nwould not be in education. It is a very altruistic undertaking.\n  Some at the higher levels of some of our professional organizations \nbasically don't like the idea of accountability. They don't like the \nidea that there will be a scorecard that parents can look at to \ndetermine whether or not children are getting an education that will \nmake them competitive in America and give them a shot at the American \ndream. For years, unfortunately, kids have been allowed to slip through \nthe system, to be warehoused and just pushed on. That simply is not \nacceptable under this bill. That means people are going to have to \nperform to bring those kids up to the ability to read and write and do \nthe basic elements that are required in order to be a literate person \nin America. Unfortunately, some people do not like that pressure being \nput on them to be accountable.\n  Then there is the problem, unfortunately, to some degree, of the old-\nfashioned ``we are headed into a Presidential election, so let's be \npartisan.''\n  Today I want to spend some time going over what we as the Republican \nParty have put forward in resources to support the bill and why I \nbelieve we have committed the type of resources that are necessary to \nmake No Child Left Behind successful because we have heard a number of \nspeeches made on the other side of the aisle by, unfortunately, Members \nwho should be familiar with this issue but who appear to not be \nfamiliar with the facts attacking the issue of whether or not this \nPresident has made a strong enough commitment in the area of funding to \nsupport the No Child Left Behind bill.\n  It is important to do this in a juxtapositional manner. This \nPresident came into office saying he was going to make education a No. \n1 goal. He was the successor to an administration which did not make \neducation the No. 1 goal of its administration. I believe it is \nimportant to reflect on the fact that we, as Republicans, have truly \ncommitted significant resources, especially in comparison to the prior \nadministration in this area.\n  For example, since 1996, when Republicans took control of the \nCongress, Federal spending for education has more than doubled and Pell \ngrants, which are the maximum awards--Pell grants being higher \neducation grants--have increased by 62 percent from $2,400 up to \n$4,000.\n  Looking at the programs which are covered by the No Child Left Behind \nbill, funding has increased by 49 percent, almost 50 percent in the \nlast 2 years. That means that funding for education has grown faster as \na function of the Federal Government than any other element of the \nFederal Government. That includes Health and Human Services and \nDefense. Defense is up 48 percent; Health and Human Services is up 96 \npercent; Education is up 132 percent. That is a massive increase in the \ncommitment to education.\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n  Republicans have committed the highest level of funding to education \nin the history of this country. Last year, under President Bush's \nleadership, we committed $60.5 billion, for an increase of 44 percent \nfor K-12 education and higher education. This is nearly $20 billion \nmore than the highest level of funding of the Clinton administration. \nThis chart shows that: $60 billion versus $42 billion.\n  A year ago, President Bush signed into law, as I mentioned, the No \nChild Left Behind bill, which contained the most significant elementary \nand secondary education reforms in the last 30 years, and he followed \nit up with the largest increases in elementary and secondary education \nfunding in the history, a whopping $4.8 billion, representing a 28-\npercent increase in funding as a result of his commitment to back up \nthat law.\n  In addition to increasing the funding for the No Child Left Behind \nbill, the Congress passed tax cut legislation that provided $30 billion \nof tax relief for parents who are trying to educate their children. Our \ntax bill created a new deduction for qualified higher education \nexpenses, increased the amount individuals can contribute to \neducational savings accounts, allowed tax redistribution from qualified \ntuition plans, expanded deductions which teachers can take as a result \nof expenses they incur to buy classroom supplies and created a loan \nforgiveness program for teachers.\n  I note that tax bill which increased spending on education by $30 \nbillion did not receive one vote from one member of the Democratic side \nof the aisle on the Education Committee. So when I hear these folks who \ncome down to this well from the committee on which I have the honor to \nserve say we are not making our commitment--the Republican Party \nspecifically, and we have heard this interminably for the last few \nmonths--we are not making our commitment to fund education, I find that \nhard to defend in the face of the facts which I have just outlined.\n\n  In addition to the No Child Left Behind bill and the tax bill, we \nhave dramatically increased funding for special education under the \nRepublican Congress. We have increased funding for IDEA by 224 percent \nsince the Republicans took control of the Congress. In fact, unlike the \nprevious administration which essentially level funded IDEA with every \nbudget they sent up here, President Bush has increased funding for \nspecial education by over $1 billion in each year of his Presidency.\n  There have been dramatic increases, which are shown by this chart, in \nthe request for and the actual funding that has gone into special \neducation as a result of President Bush being elected President, which \nis the exact opposite of how special education was being treated under \nthe prior administration, where virtually no increase was occurring \nfrom the request put forward by the President, then-President Clinton, \nin his budget.\n  President Bush supported the largest increase in the title I program \nin history. Last year, title I received $1.5 billion. Title I is the \nprogram that is directed specifically at low-income kids. It is the \nprogram which is the core of the No Child Left Behind bill.\n  Last year, President Bush, as I mentioned, put $1.5 billion of new \nmoney into this title. He has requested an additional $1 billion of new \nmoney for this year. When you add these together, this will be the \nsingle largest increase in title I funding in the history of the \nprogram, and these dollars are dramatic in the face of what occurred \nunder the prior administration where the largest increase that was ever \nrequested by the prior administration was $200 million to $300 million. \nIt was not until President Bush was elected President and took up this \ncause of educating lower income children that significant dollars \nflowed into this program for the purpose of educating low-income \nchildren. This chart reflects that.\n  In 2 years, President Bush has increased funding by over $2.5 \nbillion, which represents a larger increase in funding in 2 years than \nPresident Clinton asked for in his entire 7 years by a factor of about \n25 percent.\n  If one looks at the specific programs within the educational \ncomponent, such as reading, within the last year alone, we have tripled \nthe funds for effective reading programs. As we all know, this \nPresident and First Lady Laura Bush consider reading to be the real \ncivil right of the 21st century. Kids have to be able to read \ncompetitively with their peers or they cannot compete in the American \nsociety. They will not have a shot at the American dream. And Mrs. \nBush, who, of course, is a librarian and a former teacher, has made \nreading the essence of her efforts as First Lady, and President Bush \nhas made a commitment to reading, an absolutely critical element of \nmaking sure that children are not left behind. He has developed a whole \nset of issues in this area of reading.\n  The starkness of this chart, which shows the funding differences \nbetween the President's commitment to reading and the prior \nadministration's commitment to reading, pretty dramatically sets out \nthe fact that we have made the commitment on a core element of \neducation to accomplish the goal of making sure kids are competitive \nand have the knowledge they need to participate in our society.\n  It is not just reading that we have funded with significant \nincreases. You can look at the programs for immigrant children, where \nwe have seen the largest increase ever in that program, to try to help \nkids learn English, kids who come to America and unfortunately--well, \nno, not unfortunately. They have come to America to participate in our \ndream. But they have come here speaking a different language, and this \nprogram tries to assist them.\n  In the area of teachers, I have heard from the other side of the \naisle, Members on the other side of the aisle make representations that \nwe have not made a commitment to teachers. They cannot possibly defend \nthat on the facts. Within the last year, State and local school \ndistricts have received dramatic increases in funding for teacher \nprograms, specifically $742 million, a 35 percent increase in teachers' \nprograms.\n  More important than that, we have taken off of those programs the \nstrictures and the categorical directions which came under the prior \nadministration. We took all the different programs for teachers, put \nthem together, and we no longer say you have to do this with the \nteacher money; you have to do that with the teacher money; you have to \nsend the teacher there; you have to give the teacher that. We say to \nthe local school district--we say to the local principal, most \nimportantly--you are going to get this money. You are supposed to spend \nit the best way you know how to get the best teachers in your \nclassrooms. If you want to use it for merit pay, you can; if you want \nto use it to send the teachers to extra course curriculum activity, you \ncan; if you want to use it for supplies for your teachers, you can use \nit that way. It is up to the principal and school district on how to \nspend that money. We are not going to decide here in Washington. We are \nnot going to send it out with a bunch of strings leading out from this \ndesk, telling you how to run that program. We know you, the principal, \nyou the school district, know best what your teachers need in order to \nmake them better and stronger participants in the classrooms.\n  So we are going to give you this 35 percent increase, $742 million, \nwithout strings. We are simply going to require that at the end of the \nday your teachers be qualified to teach the courses they are in, a \nfairly reasonable requirement. I think most people think it is a \nreasonable requirement.\n  But the other side of the aisle says we haven't increased teacher \nfunding this year. That is true. That's because we increased it by 35 \npercent last year. But that is such a specious argument because the \ndollar increase which we have put into the program has been so \nsignificant that it hasn't even been all spent. I will get to that in a \nsecond.\n  In addition, the President requested dramatic increases in funding \nfor programs specifically designed to help the neediest children--as I \nmentioned, title I and IDEA. For 2003, the President has requested even \nmore money in these categories.\n  It should be noted that over the last several years, educational \nfunding has greatly outpaced the rate of inflation and the rate of \ngrowth of our schools. I think this is important. We have increased \nelementary and secondary educational funding at the Federal level by 28 \npercent, whereas student enrollment over the same period has only \nincreased by .3 percent--less than 1 percent. That is a dramatic fact \nand this chart shows it. I am not sure if those\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\nwho are watching can see this. This is the .3 percent increase in \nenrollment. This is the increase in funding. In fact, the funding for \neducation has grown at such a rapid rate that school districts simply \nhave not been able to absorb it all. This is another important point. \nWe have been putting so much money so fast into the educational system \nthat the educational community, quite honestly, has not been able to \ndevelop the programmatic activity to handle the money efficiently and \neffectively yet.\n\n  There is presently $4.5 billion of Federal funds which has been \nappropriated and is unspent. It has not been drawn down by the school \ndistricts or by the States. This pie chart shows where this money is. A \nlot of it is in the school improvement program. A lot of it is in \nspecial education. A lot of it is in education for the disadvantaged. \nThat is the title I program. These are huge amounts of dollars.\n  So when the other side of the aisle comes to this floor and starts \nsaying there is not enough money in education, we have not spent enough \nmoney at the Federal level, first off, they ought to look at the \nhistory of their leadership when they were in charge, because their \nleadership made nowhere near the commitment this President has made. \nSecond, they ought to give the President credit for what he has done, \nwhich is dramatically increase the amount of funding in the area of \ntitle I activity--over 27 percent. Third, they ought to at least \nacknowledge there has been so much money put into the system so fast, \nbecause of this President's commitment, that the system is still trying \nto adjust to it and figure out how to handle it efficiently.\n  It is interesting to note that a great deal of the money that has not \nbeen spent here is in the two programs which were true failures that \nwere the primary initiatives of the Clinton administration, one being \nclass size and the other being school renovation. These two programs, \nwhich were the classic, categorical, ``we know best'' Washington \nprograms, which have basically been merged now into the overall \napproach of giving States more flexibility and sending the money back \nas more of a flexible grant with results-based testing versus input \ncontrol--these programs are the ones with some of the biggest dollars \nwaiting here in Washington to be managed by the local communities.\n  So we spent a lot of time here talking about dollars, but let's \nremember something else. In the area of education it is not necessarily \ndollars that makes the difference. There are a lot of statistics that \npoint this out, but I think common sense points it out as well as \nanything else. I think we all know a good school system depends on a \nlot of factors. It depends on parental involvement, No. 1. You have to \nhave parents who want to see their kids educated, in most cases, to get \nparticipation in that atmosphere at home. It depends on a good \nprincipal, one of the most important factors; good teachers, obviously; \ngood facilities; and the atmosphere in the community that encourages \nacademics in the school systems.\n\n  We know for a fact that just putting dollars into the system has not \nworked. That is why our system is doing so poorly. Federal funding has \nincreased over the last 10 years, dramatically, but scores, for \nexample, in math, have been flat. Reading scores have the same track \nrecord. Federal funding has increased dramatically, but scores in \nreading have been flat. When we compare ourselves to the other \nindustrialized countries in the world, we spend more money on education \nthan almost any other industrialized country, per pupil. We are \nspending $8,000. But our reading scores, our math scores, are some of \nthe worst in the industrialized world, whereas other nations that are \nspending significantly less per child are doing much better \nacademically. Hungary is a good example.\n  Granted, these other nations don't have some of the issues we have. \nThey may be more homogeneous nations, they are much smaller, so they \ndon't have the same concerns. But the fact is that we can show that the \namount of money we spend is competitive with everybody in the world, \nbut the results are not. We as a creative Nation should not tolerate \nthat sort of situation.\n  So it is not just money that is important. But, if it were just money \nthat was important, this administration gets an A+ for having made the \ndollar commitment that is necessary in very difficult times.\n  Let's go back to the first chart. This Government, under the \nPresident and under Republican leadership, has increased spending for \neducation by 132 percent--more than we have increased spending in any \nother Federal account, such as defense, which is always used as a \nwhipping dog for some of my colleagues across the aisle for increased \nspending, and Health and Human Services.\n  When we talk about education, I do want to take a second to talk \nabout higher education because that's another area where we have heard \nsome fairly aggressive misrepresentation from the other side of the \naisle. The fact is, President Bush has increased funding for student \naid at a dramatically faster pace than the prior administration \nincreased funding in this area. Let's compare President Bush's higher \neducation record to that of President Clinton.\n  The last time the Democrats were in charge, they actually cut the \nPell grant by $100. For the year 2003, President Bush has requested the \nhighest level of funding for student aid in the history of these \nprograms. Under the President's budget, total funding for financial aid \nfor higher education and kids going to college will be $55 billion. \nThat is a 5-percent increase over 2002.\n  Furthermore, the President has more than tripled the loan forgiveness \nactivities in areas such as math and science, special education \nteachers, and low-income schools. And under the President's proposal, \nteachers would qualify for up to $17,500 in loan forgiveness, up from \nthe current $5,000 that teachers get if they go into high-need schools.\n  The keystone of the President's effort is in the Pell grant. As I \nmentioned, the last time the Democrats were in charge they cut Pell \ngrants by $100. President Bush has dramatically increased the Pell \ngrant program. Whereas, President Clinton's first budget request for \nthe Pell grant program was $8.3 billion, his next six Pell grant budget \nrequests were for less than that amount--less than the original amount. \nIn his last budget--the 2001 budget--he actually increased Pell grant \nfunding.\n  President Bush came in and the Pell grant account was at, I think, \n$11 billion. He has increased that dramatically. Under President Bush, \nwe have seen a $4.5 million increase. Needy college children who \nweren't getting them before will now be getting Pell grants. He has \nincreased the funding. So it is now up to almost $11 billion. That is a \ndramatic increase in Pell grant funding. He has also increased the \namount of the actual grant for students under the Pell grant program.\n  Not only has the President made the commitment in the elementary and \nsecondary school level, in title I, in IDEA, in reading, in immigrant \neducation, but he has also made a commitment at the higher education \nlevel.\n  Let us go back to the issue of this tax cut directed at benefiting \npeople in education. This is something that has sort of been overlooked \nby my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when they are attacking \nthe President for his failure to fund education. It is pretty hard to \nattack him on that, but they have been making this representation.\n  Here is how this tax cut has worked, translated into real dollars. We \nput in place a new above-the-line reduction for qualified higher \neducation expenses. It is a $3,000 deduction today. It is going to go \nup to $4,000 in 2004. And it represents an $11 billion tax cut for \nAmericans who are sending their kids to school. Eliminated is the 60-\nmonth limitation on the student loan interest deduction. That \nrepresents a $3.4 billion benefit to kids who get out of school with \nlots of loans. We know that is one of the big issues for kids today. \nThey leave the school system and their college experience with a lot of \nloans, and they have to pay them back. This is a $3.4 billion attempt \nto try to reduce that burden. He has increased the annual limit on the \ncontribution to the educational savings accounts from $500 to $2,000. \nThat is a $1.2 billion benefit to people who are trying to save to make \nsure that they can go to college and participate in the American dream.\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\n  He has allowed tax-free deductions for qualified tuition plans used \nto pay educational expenses, and he has permitted private institutions \nto setup those plans. This is a real benefit to people who want to get \nready for education and to be sure, when they go to college, that they \nhave the funds to pay for it, $2.3 billion of benefits is represented \nby this change.\n  He made the income exclusion for employer-provided educational \nactivity permanent. When your employer gives you the opportunity to go \nto school to better yourself, you will be able to take advantage of \nthat. That is a $3 billion benefit to people trying to get their \neducation.\n  Over the next 5 years these changes will provide almost $22 billion \nin direct in-the-pocket benefit to students and parents who are trying \nto make sure that their kids participate in higher education and as a \nresult can go into the American workforce better prepared and have a \nbetter opportunity to be successful.\n  As this chart shows, during the last year of the Clinton \nadministration, total higher education tax benefits amounted to $7.6 \nbillion. President Bush's tax benefits for helping families today \nrepresents almost a $12 billion benefit. That is a huge difference. It \nis something, however, that is never mentioned by the other side of the \naisle.\n  When President Clinton came into office in 1993, the total \nappropriations for discretionary student programs was about $8 billion. \nPresident Clinton's last budget request for discretionary student aid \ntotaled about $11 billion, an increase of about 5.4 percent per year \nover 8 years.\n  Let us remember that during all of those 8 years we were fortunate to \nhave a surplus and a strong economy. In contrast, when President Bush \ncame into office in 2001, as I mentioned, the appropriations was about \n$11 billion for student discretionary programs--for student activities \nfor schools. President Bush's latest budget request for discretionary \nstudent aid will be about $14 billion. That is an increase of 18.3 \npercent over the 2001 appropriations. Over 2 years that averages to a \n9.1 percent increase--almost 70 percent higher than the increases \nduring the Clinton years.\n  Remember that this was done and has been done during the period when \nwe were facing a deficit. Of course, if you start adding in things such \nas the higher education and a tax cut, it even gets higher and more \nsignificant.\n  Yesterday, Senator Kennedy--soon to be, I believe, my ranking Member, \nI am not really sure whether he is chairman or ranking Member right \nnow. I believe he is still chairman--who I work with on the education \ncommittee and Congressman Miller, who is the ranking Member of the \nHouse Education Committee, sent a letter to the Secretary of Education \nthat suggested that we were underfunding No Child Left Behind; that the \nadministration was actually providing too much flexibility under that \nbill to the local school districts and the States. We have talked a \nlittle bit here about the funding issue of No Child Left Behind, but \nlet me go into some specifics.\n  The letter, I believe, was blatantly misleading. It talks about a $90 \nmillion cut.\n  The President requested a $1 billion increase in title I and a $1 \nbillion increase in IDEA. It is very hard to criticize the President \nfor cutting a $90 million earmarked program for untested non-means-\ntested program--to attack the President for cutting that $90 million \nwhen he is putting in $2 billion of new funding that will benefit the \nsame people in a much more aggressive way, directed with flexibility \nand with accountability at the local school districts. It is truly a \nbit of an inconsistency to attack him on that point.\n  Then the letter went on to say, Well, you haven't funded it up to the \nauthorization level--No Child Left Behind. There are many pieces of \nlegislation attached to this Congress that are funded to the \nauthorization level. And there is no legislation that has passed \nthrough this Congress in the last 2 years that has received the type of \nfunding increases that the educational accounts have received, as I \nmentioned earlier.\n\n  Authorization levels is a term we use around here basically to set \nout a thematic approach to an issue; not an actual approach, a wish-\nlist approach. That is why we almost never go to authorization levels \nin funding. Think of it as your credit card. You have a maximum level \nthat you can take out under your credit card, but rarely, hopefully, do \nyou ever get to that level. Usually you are borrowing much less than \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the fact is, what counts is what is \nactually being spent in relation to what was spent the year before and \nin relation to the rest of the priorities of the Government. As I have \nmentioned, this President's commitment to education has been $20 \nbillion higher in 2001 than the Clinton administration's commitment in \nits last year. As a percentage of spending of the Federal Government, \nit dwarfs everything else. We are outspending defense by a factor of 3 \nand outspending health and human services by a factor of 2. Yet the \nletter went on to say that the funds were not adequately increased for \nteacher funding. I mentioned that earlier. That is because we raised it \n$742 million the year before.\n  We have a total funding for teachers of $3 billion in the \nappropriations process. So it is totally inconsistent to say: Well, \nthey have not increased it this year--when they ignore and do not give \ncredit for last year's $740 million increase in teacher funding.\n  You can go down the list. The same is true with representations made \nin the area of weakening the dropout provisions or in the area of \nalternative certification. Just the idea that there is opposition to \nalternative certification is pretty outrageous. We are trying to get \nclassroom teachers who know what they are doing. Alternative \ncertification is one of the best ways of accomplishing that.\n  They went on to say we are dumbing down the tests because we are \nallowing a patchwork of local tests to meet the new annual testing. But \nthat claim is absolutely inaccurate. And the Department has made it \ncrystal clear to the States the only local tests that are available to \nmeet the uniform tests are those that can still be compared to the rest \nof the States. So you do not have a dumbing down of those tests.\n  There are other issues in that letter which I will put in the \nRecord--because I have obviously taken more time and appreciate the \ncourtesy of the Senator from Minnesota in his allowing me to proceed \neven longer--that are simply inconsistent with the way the law is being \nput in place and being organized.\n  The bottom line is this: No child left behind is a dramatic departure \nfrom the historic role and goal and undertaking that we have had in \neducation in this country, a dramatic departure because it says, very \nsimply, children can learn and will learn. And we are going to require \nthat our school systems not leave children behind. It is a dramatic \ndeparture because it empowers parents to do something when they find \ntheir children in schools that are not working. It is a dramatic \ndeparture because it gives local school districts, teachers, and \nprincipals a huge amount of flexibility to undertake the goals of \neducating their children. It is a dramatic departure because it has \naccountability, and it allows transparency on that accountability. It \nis a dramatic departure because it has huge increases in funding, as \nhave been outlined by the points I have made here today.\n\n  Rather than attacking the funding effort, and rather than attacking \nthe underlying goals here, we should be pulling together to make sure \nthis bill succeeds because the success of this bill is critical to the \nsuccess of our Nation.\n  If we can produce an educational system which really does take care \nof all American children, which really does make sure that every child \nin the first grade, the second grade, and by the third grade can read, \nwe will have made a massive stride to eliminating poverty in this \ncountry, to making our Nation prosperous, and to making sure that all \nAmericans have a good and decent life and have a chance to participate \nin the American dream.\n  This bill was an extraordinary bipartisan success. I regret there has \nbeen this growing, orchestrated effort to basically try to undermine \nit. I hope my\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\nstatements today have made it clear that on the facts the funding has \nbeen there. I hope that, as we move down the road in the future, we can \naccomplish the goals of this bill, without getting into this type of \ndebate but will rather be focused on debates as to how we can make it \nwork better in the actual delivery of service to the kids in America.\n  No child left behind is truly a historic piece of legislation. Let's \ntry to make it work right. Let's recognize that we are working \naggressively to accomplish that.\n  On January 8, 2002, the one-year anniversary of the passage of ``No \nChild Left Behind'', Senator Kennedy and Representative Miller sent a \nletter to Secretary Paige suggesting that we are imperiling the law's \ngoals by underfunding NCLB and by providing too much flexibility in its \nimplementation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a response to Senator Kennedy and \nCongressman Miller's letter on No Child Left Behind be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the following material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n  Let's review the letter.\n\n       Funding. Kennedy and Miller misleadingly claim that the \n     Administration cut NCLB by $90 million. Although it's true \n     that $90 million was cut from earmarks and the Fund for the \n     Improvement for Education--which contains many untested, non-\n     means tested programs--funding for Title I and IDEA was \n     increased by $1 billion. An administration that requests such \n     an enormous overall funding boost can hardly be criticized \n     for cutting $90 million from untested programs that are not \n     necessarily targeted toward either disadvantaged or disabled \n     kids, and are therefore not critical to successfully \n     implementing ``No Child Left Behind.''\n       The Democrats also state that the Administration's budget \n     is $7 billion shy of what was promised in NCLB. Let's keep in \n     mind that authorization levels are maximum numbers that can \n     be spent, not necessarily what should be spent. Think of it \n     as the maximum on your credit card. You have a maximum amount \n     of money you can borrow on your card, but generally you don't \n     spend all of that money. Authorization numbers are similar. \n     They are suggested levels of funding that are not necessarily \n     based on what is needed or what is available to spend.\n       Democrats know this. Back in 1995, when they passed the \n     last K-12 education bill, the Democrat Congress and President \n     Clinton authorized $13 billion for education programs, yet \n     they appropriated only $10.3 billion. Curiously, not a single \n     Democrat accused President Clinton of under funding education \n     by $2.7 billion.\n       Unfunded mandates. Messrs. Kennedy and Miller claim that \n     NCLB burdens school districts and States with unfunded \n     mandates to build schools and hire highly qualified teachers \n     to comply with the bill's public school choice capacity \n     requirements, but that is not the case. It should be noted \n     that since 1995 Congress has been prohibited from passing \n     unfunded mandates.\n       With regard to school construction, the U.S. Department of \n     Education has never required school districts to build new \n     schools to accommodate NCLB's public school choice \n     provisions. Furthermore, the Department is still waiting for \n     States to draw down $900 million in school renovation funds \n     that were appropriated in 2001.\n       With regard to the new teacher requirements, it should be \n     noted that the new ``high-quality'' teacher requirements that \n     were included in No Child Left Behind were coupled with one \n     of the largest increases in teacher funding in history. Last \n     year States received over $3 billion to assist them with the \n     teacher requirements--this was a 35 percent increase over \n     anything Clinton provided for teachers. Furthermore, States \n     are guaranteed to continue to receive at least another $3 \n     billion.\n       Weakening drop-out provisions. Kennedy and Miller say that \n     NCLB final regulations establish an incentive for schools to \n     focus on test scores while ignoring high dropout rates, \n     thereby jeopardizing the law's accountability provisions. \n     Nothing could be further from the truth; the regulations are \n     actually stronger than the statute. The statute was unclear \n     on graduation rates. The regulations state that even if all \n     children are doing well in school, if dropout rates are high, \n     then the school is still identified as in need of \n     improvement.\n       Alternative certification. The Democrats criticize the \n     Department for allowing teachers who are alternatively \n     certified or working on becoming alternatively certified to \n     be counted as highly qualified. This is a perfect example of \n     how the Democrats do the teacher union's bidding by trying to \n     prevent individuals who don't go through the traditional \n     teacher certification process--which is dominated by the \n     unions and their allies--from being hired by schools. They \n     want no competition from Teach for America or other programs \n     that encourage professionals from other fields to become \n     teachers.\n       Prohibiting norm-referenced tests. Kennedy and Miller state \n     that NCLB prohibits ``norm-referenced'' tests, which measure \n     students' achievement against that of their peers. That is \n     patently false. Although the House bill originally prohibited \n     ``norm-referenced'' tests, that provision was dropped in \n     conference and no such prohibition is contained in the law.\n       Different tests for different students. The Democrats claim \n     that the Department allows States to use a patchwork of local \n     tests to meet the new annual testing requirements, making it \n     impossible to measure whether achievement gaps are being \n     closed. The Department, however, has made it crystal clear \n     the States can only use local tests if those tests allow for \n     a uniform or comparable measure of student performance across \n     the State. NCLB is based on President Bush's firm commitment \n     to reduce the achievement gap. To infer that in any way this \n     Administration would allow States to mask the achievement gap \n     is simply absurd.\n       Allowing discrimination with federal funds and denying \n     basic civil rights protections for children. The Democrats \n     are engaged in a bit of revisionist history when they claim \n     that NCLB allows federal education programs to directly fund \n     religious organizations and to permit organizations to \n     discriminate based on religion. After many, many hours of \n     negotiations, we reached a bi-partisan agreement to be \n     silent, that is, to allow current law to continue to operate, \n     on the issue of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title \n     VII prohibits discrimination based on race, sex religion, and \n     national origin in employment, except with regard to \n     employment by religious institutions. We did not, nor did we \n     intend to, reverse that precedent. To claim otherwise is \n     simply a ridiculous misinterpretation of the facts.\n\n  In sum, the letter from Messrs. Kennedy and Miller is classic \npolitical ploy. The Democrats want the Department to pile additional \nrequirements onto States and school districts who are already doing a \nyeomen's job to comply with the many reforms in NCLB. This letter is \nnothing short of an attempt to sabotage the bill and ensure that States \nand school districts will be so overwhelmed that they will be unable to \nimplement even the smallest provisions in the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I wonder if perhaps you and some of my \ncolleagues remember, as I do, the movie ``Animal House,'' one of the \nclassic American comedies. In the movie, the rogue fraternity Delta \nHouse had one solution to many of their problems, and that was a road \ntrip. If there was an academic suspension--a road trip; fraternity \nproblems--a road trip; expulsions--a road trip.\n  Here in Washington we have some who hold a similar one-line refrain \nto just about every problem; and that is--tax cuts. We have budget \nsurpluses--tax cuts; budget deficits--tax cuts; economic recessions--\ntax cuts.\n  Well, like road trips, tax cuts are a lot more fun and popular than \ndealing with unpleasant realities. Tax cuts are practically guaranteed \nto make the politicians who support them popular with their \nconstituents, and so I must confess to liking them myself. But, like \nroad trips, tax cuts not only avoid unpleasant realities, they often \nmake them worse. They might postpone the day of reckoning, but the \nconditions will be even worse as a result, not only because of the \ndelay in facing up to those realities, but also because of the tax cut \nitself.\n  This tax cut proposal that the President made 2 days ago is the road \ntrip equivalent of visiting Fort Lauderdale. It is excessive, it is \nreckless, it is dangerous, and it is seductively appealing. \nMasquerading it as economic stimulus would be consumer fraud. I note \nwith interest that the White House has seemed to have dropped that \nclaim. Little of it would take effect actually this year, and none of \nthe proposals put real dollars in the pockets of consumers.\n  This is a reelection stimulus package aimed at 2004 rather than an \neconomic stimulus package aimed at 2003. It is\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nputting money in the pockets of the wealthiest Americans who, if this \nadministration had its way, would, it seems, pay almost no Federal \ntaxes of any kind, whether they are alive or after they are dead. It is \nimportant we remember that the richest Americans already got huge tax \nreductions in 2001. Those with incomes of more than $1 million a year \nwill get an average of $650,000 in tax cuts over the 10-year life of \nthat bill. The rich do not need another tax cut, yet they would be the \nones getting most of the money in the President's proposal.\n  The struggling millionaire getting by on an annual income of $1 \nmillion or more would be getting another $50 to $100,000 a year in \nadditional tax reduction, depending on their amount of dividend income. \nMiddle-income-tax payers, upper middle income-tax payers, people who \nwork for a living, would get the benefit of the increase in the child \ntax credit, which I support. That is a good idea. I hope this body will \npass it. But they will get little from the rest of the President's \nproposals. And for most of them who put their investments into 401(k)s \nor IRAs or other retirement accounts for whom dividend income is \nalready tax exempt, there would be no additional gain in our doing so \nat the cost of some $67 billion over the next 10 years to the Federal \nTreasury.\n  In fact, the total tax package of $670 billion in cost over the next \n10 years would give little boost to economic recovery, little tax \nrelief to most Americans, and once again, more huge tax cuts to the \nrichest 1 percent of Americans.\n  Those of us who point this out are accused of class warfare. I must \nsay, this is not my proposal. These are the facts. And those who are \nproposing it are the ones who are guilty of setting one class of \nAmericans against others.\n  In addition, this is a $670 tax package that we cannot afford. We are \nalready running, once again, $200-billion-a-year deficits. That is $200 \nbillion a year in deficit after we use up all of the Social Security \ntrust fund surplus. President Clinton, in 1997 and 1998, balanced the \nFederal budget for the first time in 28 years. Then he did it again in \n1999 and 2000, in the actual operating account of the Federal \nGovernment, leaving the Social Security surpluses untouched. As you \nrecall, those of you who, like me, ran in the year 2000, most of us, I \nthink probably all of us promised to put that money in a lockbox.\n  The President, when he was campaigning, promised to put the Social \nSecurity surpluses in a lockbox which meant that the rest of the \nFederal operating budget would have to be balanced, and it was. It was \nprojected by OMB in January of 2001 to remain balanced, actually in a \nsurplus, for the next 10 years. Well, of course, that has not happened.\n  We have gone from debating, when I first arrived here 2 years ago, \nhow to best utilize a $5.6 trillion expected surplus over the decade, \nhow we could pay down the national debt and save $200 billion a year in \ninterest payments so that when the baby boom generation retires in \nsignificant numbers, starting in about a decade, when that trust fund \nhas to start cashing in its IOUs, that this country would be in the \nstrongest possible financial condition to meet those growing needs. But \nin 2 years, those surpluses have disappeared, and we are now looking at \nprojected deficits every year for the foreseeable future, which is \nheading us, with additional debt and no cushion, toward a financial \nArmageddon in a decade that will rival nothing we have seen in this \ncountry since the Great Depression.\n  The least we should do--not what we should do but the least we should \ndo--is not make it worse. This tax proposal would do so.\n  So in one tax proposal, we have greater tax unfairness, greater \nincome inequality, greater financial instability, a greater future \ncatastrophe. For this proposal and those who support it, it is like an \nalcoholic. I am a recovering alcoholic, so I know whereof I speak. It \nis like an alcoholic who knows that they should stop, that it is bad, \nthat there are going to be future disastrous consequences, but is \nunwilling or unable to do so.\n  I must say that those of us who are ``Friends of Bill W.'' see other \nsigns of that kind of behavior in some of the statements being made \nthese days, justifications for these deficits--that a trifecta caused \nour budget downfall; people don't cause deficits, trifectas cause \ndeficits--and denial where top administration officials are starting to \nsay: Well, deficits don't matter.\n  Well, they mattered when the President was campaigning in the year \n2000 and pledged to keep the Social Security surpluses in a lockbox. \nThey mattered the last 2 years when the President criticized any \nattempt to spend additional money on schoolchildren or prescription \ndrugs for the elderly. It seems that deficits don't matter only when \nthe White House wants to ignore them.\n  It is bad enough that people in the administration who should know \nbetter say that deficits don't matter. It is their job to pretend that \nthe emperor has clothes even when he does not. But other economists and \neconomic policymakers around the country who are saying the same things \nand making up rationalizations and contradicting their former positions \nreally are guilty of professional cowardice, and they do their country \na great disservice by the masquerade they are enabling. They have no \nhonest escape from or avoidance of the truth and the facts as they know \nthem to be.\n  I must say that responsibility starts with and falls most heavily on \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has danced around the head of \na needle every time this administration has proposed policies which \ncontradicted the admonitions he consistently gave to the Congress \nduring the last administration. I think it will be shameful for \nanybody, any professional economist, or economic policymaker to come to \nCapitol Hill in the next few weeks and hedge or confuse or rationalize \nwhether this is an economic stimulus proposal, which is not what its \nbenefits are relative to its fiscal cost to this country, and whether \nit promotes greater tax inequality or equity. And anyone who is \nunwilling to speak that truth should have the integrity to step out of \nany public position or should just stay away from here entirely.\n  To the millionaires and the multimillionaires of America, the \ncaptains of industry who are running up support for this proposal, I \nknow whereof I speak. I say, you are letting your greed ruin America. I \ncan understand most Americans' aversion to taxes, especially the poor, \nthe middle class, even the upper middle class who are living on their \nearned incomes, who are raising children, wanting to improve their own \nfinancial conditions and that of their families. I can understand their \nresentment for every tax dollar. But if you can't live on a million \ndollars in this country and pay your fair share of taxes on it, you \nshould deal with that yourself. You are the luckiest people in America. \nYou are the luckiest people in the world. You are the luckiest people \nin the history of the world.\n  If you are paying more taxes, it is because you are earning more \nmoney, a lot more money in many cases in the last few years. For people \nwho want to make more money and pay less taxes on it, that, to me, is \ngreed. To advocate for it, knowing the financial condition of this \ncountry, knowing the harm it would cause your children and your \ngrandchildren when they have to pay the bills in the years ahead, is \nnot only selfish, it is downright unpatriotic.\n  This antitax ideology is destructive to America. This obsession with \npaying no taxes whatever it takes, moving a home or residence, moving a \nbusiness, setting up offshore shells and tax evasions and other kinds \nof tax avoidance, people who are doing so should be ashamed. If this \ncountry falls into a financial abyss in the years ahead, we will have \nno one to blame but you. Nothing that anyone has hoarded will begin to \nreplace the economic strength of this country if it is lost.\n  There are other reasons this tax cut is terrible. That is that it \nignores the serious unmet needs of our people. The priorities of this \nCongress and this administration regretfully have been tax cuts for the \nrich ahead of quality education for our schoolchildren, prescription \ndrug coverage for senior citizens, disaster aid to destitute farmers \nand flood and fire victims, and a lot of serious unmet social needs.\n  One of those areas of greatest critical need and a broken promise of \nthe Federal Government for a decade is the area of special education. \nIt was a quarter century ago when Congress made a promise that it would \npay for 40 percent of the cost of special education. In fact, Congress \neven passed a\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nlaw in 1982 that stated that it would do so. It legally bound itself to \nproviding 40 percent of the cost of special education.\n  Today, nationwide it is 16 percent; in other words, less than half of \nthe promise that was made.\n  For my State of Minnesota, that difference amounts to over $200 \nmillion a year in tax money, in funding for education that has to be \nmade up by tax money in Minnesota, with more regressive property taxes, \nState income taxes--money that Minnesota does not have and many other \nStates don't have.\n  Now, I heard my friend from New Hampshire recite a great number of \nstatistics that purported to demonstrate how much the Federal \nGovernment has increased its funding for education. The problem with \nthe numbers of percentage of increase is the actual base in many of \nthese programs--the measure was quite low. In fact, the Federal share \nfor funding of all of K-12 education has been 7 percent. The State and \nlocal governments have been obligated to pick up the rest. For most of \nthe time it has been desirable because it has maintained local control \nof our schools. But you can increase a low number by a high percent and \nstill have a low number.\n  I heard lots of blaming of the previous administration, that they \nshould have spent more for education. I would say, having come 2 years \nago, probably it should have done so. Probably the last 25 years of \nadministrations should have spent more for education--certainly in \nspecial education they should have honored that promise when it was \nmade and kept it. The priority of the last administration, almost by \nnecessity, was to bring this country out of deficits, to put this \ncountry back in sound fiscal condition, to put the Social Security \nsurplus money in a lockbox so it would, therefore, meet present and \nfuture retirements.\n  I believe I heard the Senator from New Hampshire say that in all of \nthose 8 years, this country was operating in a surplus. That is not the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used up his time.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 more \nminutes to finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Certainly we should have spent more. President Bush, to \nthe extent he has spent more money--and he has--for special education, \nboosting the Federal share from 12 to 16 percent, I give him credit for \ndoing so.\n  But I am not concerned about who is right. I am concerned about doing \nwhat is right. I am concerned about what is right for the \nschoolchildren of this Nation. I speak as a former schoolteacher who \ntaught in a public school in New York City with 32 children in the \nclassroom. It was the toughest job I ever had. I heard them say that \nthe number of students in a classroom doesn't make any difference. \nAnybody who has tried to teach kids knows it makes a difference. I have \nbeen to 150 more schools in Minnesota, and anybody who doesn't know \nthey are substandard and dangerously decrepit--they can cite all the \nstatistics they want, but they are not looking at reality. Anybody who \nthinks the schools are over funded and that teachers who are averaging \n$40,000 nationwide are overpaid should spend a day, a week, or a year \nin a school and see what that job is about, see the kids from all \ndifferent backgrounds and countries with different languages and \ncapabilities--no wonder test scores are affected.\n  Anybody who thinks we are over funding public education is off in \nanother world. In Minnesota and in other States where funds are not and \nwill not be available through property taxes and State taxes, the \nquestion is, Who will help us out? The Federal Government has these tax \ncuts for the wealthiest people, and we are saying to these kids: No, I \nam sorry, you go your own way, you suffer, we are not going to put \ncomputers on your desks to enable you to succeed. We are going to test \nyou and find out how you are doing and use the bully pulpit. It is no \nwonder good teachers are leaving. Who would want to stay when that is \ngoing on. This next year is about priorities for this country, \npriorities on how we will spend the money and the resources we have. \nThat debate should continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to follow the \nSenator from Ohio for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very proud, as the 108th Congress \ngets underway today, to pay tribute to the awesome accomplishments of \nthis season's Ohio State University football team--a team that, after \nwhat was certainly one of the greatest games in college football \nhistory, clinched the 2002 National Collegeiate Football Championship \ntitle. This recent distinction represents Ohio State's fifth outright \nnational football title.\n  It is a great privilege, also, to represent a State that is home to \nmany outstanding schools and numerous past national champions of \ncollege football. In Alliance, OH, for example, we have the Mount Union \nCollege Purple Raiders. This exceptional football team ended the year \nwith a 14 and 0 record, winning the division III national championship \nfor the sixth time in 7 years.\n  The team is 109 and 1 in the last 11 regular seasons. Since 1990, the \nRaiders have won an incredible 162 out of 170 games. So I congratulate \nthese fine young athletes on yet another great championship season.\n  I want to recognize the Raiders' coach, Larry Kehres, for his \ndedication and commitment to the school and to the team. He has just \nbeen named the AFCA Division III National Coach of the Year, making him \nthe first coach to win 7 national coach of the year awards. Mr. \nPresident, this is an unprecedented accomplishment. I congratulate \nCoach Kehres and his entire coaching staff. I wish him and the Purple \nRaiders and their fans all the best for next season and for many years \nto come.\n  Mr. President, I also congratulate Ohio State football coach Jim \nTressel, who was named this season's Division 1-A National Coach of the \nYear. This is the third time Coach Tressel has been recognized as \nnational coach of the year, and deservedly so. He is a man who already \nhas a lifetime coaching record of 142 wins, 62 losses, and 2 ties. He \nhas coached previous teams at Youngstown State University to 4 national \nchampionships and has qualified for the Division 1-AA playoffs a \nremarkable 10 times in the past. He is a native Ohioan who graduated \ncum laud in 1975 from another fine Ohio institution of higher learning, \nBaldwin Wallace College. Coach Jim Tressel stresses academics, \nathletics, and community responsibility. When Jim Tressel took over as \nhead coach of Ohio State, he said this:\n\n       The two greatest days in our student-athletes lives should \n     be the day they walk across the stage to receive their \n     diploma and the day they slip a championship ring on their \n     finger.\n\n  Because of Coach Tressel's dedication to his athletes, many of the \nplayers on Ohio State's football team have and will accomplish both of \nthese great honors.\n  Mr. President, I am sure many of my colleagues watched last week's \nOhio State-University of Miami game. What a great game it was. Both \nteams played very well, and both schools can be very proud. I know that \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell certainly watched the game. They \nhave both already come to the floor to talk about it. I thank them for \ntheir remarks on the floor earlier in the week.\n  I was pleased to join my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator \nGeorge Voinovich, in sponsoring a resolution honoring the team's \nachievement. This resolution commends not only the entire Ohio State \nathletic department, but also recognizes the support and dedication of \nthe Ohio State marching band, the cheerleaders, the students, the \nadministration, the board of trustees, the faculty, the alumni, the \nCity of Columbus, the entire State of Ohio, and all of the great fans. \nIndeed, this season and last week's championship game represent the \nculmination of a year of hard work and a true team effort.\n  Mr. President, anyone who watched last week's game will tell you it \nwas an\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\nunbelievably tense game. Ohio State entered the game at least an 11\\1/\n2\\-point underdog. The team's defense was certainly key in putting Ohio \nState into a position where they could win the game. During the first \novertime, the game was tied 17 to 17. Then facing what could have been \nthe end of the game--fourth down and 14 yards to go--Ohio State \ncompleted a 17-yard pass to stay alive.\n\n  I know Ohio State fans, whether they were in Tempee, AZ, or whether \nthey were, as I was, watching TV in Cedarville, OH, just could not \nbelieve what happened. Ohio State's quarterback faded back and made \nthat unbelievable pass on fourth down and 14. After a few more plays, \nthe Buckeyes scored from the 1-yard line to go into that second \novertime.\n  Then in the second overtime, Ohio State scored on a rushing attempt, \nand this proved to be the last score of the game. Miami got the ball, \nof course, and then on the last play of the game, fourth and goal at \nthe 1-yard line, the Buckeyes blitzed and forced Miami's quarterback to \nrush his pass in desperation, allowing the Buckeye defensive linebacker \nto bat it down to the ground. This moment secured Ohio State as the \n2002 national champions and gave the team a place in history. Without a \ndoubt, both teams played well; both teams are great champions.\n  Many sports writers already have made the case that Ohio State's 31-\nto-24 double overtime victory in this year's Fiesta Bowl was the \ngreatest championship game in the history of college football. This \nsort of fantastic finish was the same type of dramatic conclusion to \nmany of the Buckeyes's wins this season.\n  The truth is Ohio State was underestimated the entire season, but \nbecause the players worked together as a team to overcome huge \nobstacles, they were able to reach their ultimate goal. The unselfish \nattitude of the players and coaches resulted in win after win for their \nteam.\n  The Ohio State University football team defied history and odds to \nwin 14 games in one season, overcoming all barriers along the way to \npersevere in the end.\n  I wish to conclude with the words of former Ohio State national \nchampion coach, Ohio legend, the late Woodrow Wayne Hayes--Woody Hayes. \nI quote Woody Hayes:\n\n       Anytime you give a man something he doesn't earn, you \n     cheapen him. Our kids earn what they get, and that includes \n     respect.\n\n  It is with great respect today that I say congratulations and go \nBucks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the Ohio \nState football team, coaching staff, and players be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  2002 Ohio State Football Team Roster\n\n       John Adams, Tucker Allen, Will Allen, Tim Anderson, David \n     Andrews, Kyle Andrews, Redgie Arden, Bryce Bishop, Mike \n     Bogart, Jason Bond, LeAndre Boone, Joe Bradley, Bobby \n     Britton, Jason Caldwell, Bobby Carpenter, Drew Carter, Angelo \n     Chattams, Bam Childress, Maurice Clarett, Adrien Clarke, R.J. \n     Coleman, John Conroy, Chris Conwell, Ryan Cook, Bryce Culver, \n     Mike D'Andrea, Doug Datish, Michael DeMaria, Mike Doss, Ivan \n     Douglas, T.J.

Mr. President, I say to my colleague from the State of \nOhio, I tuned in to that game in the final minute of the regular game \nand was watching as one of the Miami running backs was injured. It \nappeared the game was going to end with Miami being the winner. I agree \nwith the Senator from Ohio, it was one of the most exciting college \nfootball games I have ever seen. Of course, being from Illinois, since \nour signature university is one of the 11 members of the Big Ten, we \nare particularly proud that another team from the Big Ten is the \nnational champion, and the Ohio State Buckeyes certainly did us proud \nthat evening. I am sure Senator DeWine is very happy about that outcome \nand proud of what they did as well.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I appreciate \nmy colleague's comment. I just knew my colleague from Illinois, another \nBig Ten school, would be rooting for the Buckeyes that day.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly was.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S99-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S99-S101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ECONOMY AND EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we came back to Washington to be sworn in \nand begin a new Congress, and the President traveled to my State of \nIllinois, to Chicago, to announce his proposal for an economic \nstimulus. We need it; we need it desperately. For the last 2 years, we \nhave languished. Our economy has gone from bad to worst.\n  The President inherited a budget surplus, at least on paper, that \ngave us some opportunities to pay down the debt of the Nation. Instead \nof borrowing money from the economy to finance our Government, we were \nactually not borrowing at the same rate. I am careful with my rhetoric \nbecause I am being followed by Senator Hollings who is the guru and \npast master when it comes to the questions of deficits and surplus. He \nwill quickly disabuse me of my notions if I am wrong. He will concede, \nas I hope I would as well, that our budget situation today is worse \nthan it was when President Bush took office in terms of the deficits we \nare generating.\n  That deficit situation reflects three situations, some of which we \ncontrol and some we do not. No one could have anticipated the negative \nimpact September 11 had on our economy and the increased expenses of \nGovernment for military and defense efforts. That is something for \nwhich no President can be held accountable because it was totally \nunexpected. That situation has added to our deficit.\n  The continued recession we are going through has made the deficit \neven worse: Fewer tax revenues going into Washington, fewer dollars \navailable for spending on programs and a deficit as a result.\n  The third piece, though, has to fall on the President's lap. He came \nto us and said: I want to cut taxes, and if I cut taxes, this economy \nwill turn around, trust me. The majority of the Senate and the House \ndid--I was not one of them--and they were wrong.\n\n  The President's tax cut proposal did not invigorate the economy; it \nadded to our deficit. So that red ink pool gets deeper and deeper. We \nare deeper in debt and the economy is still languishing.\n  The President came back this week and said: I have a brand new idea: \nMore of the same. Let me cut taxes on the highest income people in \nAmerica, and I swear to you, America, this time it is going to work; if \nyou will just give the richest people in America a substantial tax \nbreak, we know they will do the right thing; we know they will \ninvigorate the economy.\n  Isn't it interesting what the public reaction has been? CNN had a \ncall-in and said to the American people: Do you buy the President's \napproach? Do you want to try this again or would you rather go for a \ndifferent approach suggested by the Democrats, that we have a smaller \nmore manageable stimulus package that helps us this year immediately \nand is focused on helping the majority of Americans, not just 1 percent \nof the wage earners, the wealthiest?\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\n  The CNN poll came back. Two to one, the people calling in said: We \nprefer the more managed approach, the smaller stimulus that does not \nadd to the deficit and, frankly, tries to help all taxpayers, not just \nthe wealthiest among us. Two to one, people rejected President Bush's \nfailed economic policy which he is trying to bring back to us again.\n  Let me tell you what is interesting, too. President Bush suggests \nthat in the course of this economic stimulus we can take out of the \nTreasury during the next 10 years--let me get the number correct--$676 \nbillion. Most of it is not going to happen in the first year, so it is \nnot much of a stimulus package. It really does not happen at all. To \nsuggest that people who receive corporate dividends this year will not \nhave to pay taxes next year--of course, those are the wealthiest people \nin America as a class--it will not stimulate the economy. Most \nAmericans say that does not make any sense at all. Why create a worse \ndeficit for our country, more debt for our children, more competition \nfor capital funds between business and Government with a program that \nwon't work?\n\n  The President says we can take $676 billion out of our Treasury for \nthis experiment, the first phase of which has already failed. Taking \nthat money out of the Treasury would, of course, mean less money \navailable for America's priorities.\n  What would that be? Well, more compensation to provide for our \nmilitary. We are about to go to war. I hope we do not. If we do, make \nno mistake, we will spend what is necessary to put our troops in the \nfield and make sure they are adequately trained, have the right \nresources and technology to win, and come home safely. We will spend \nthat money. And we should--every penny of it.\n  The President says as we take money out of the Treasury, it makes no \ndifference. It does; more money spent on the military means less money \nspent elsewhere. For example, homeland security. We want to be safe in \nIllinois. Every person does. It costs money. We need a statewide \ncommunication network so all the first responders--police, fire, \nmedical communities--can share in communications instantly. It will \ncost us $20 million. We do not have it.\n  If the Federal Government wants to make America safer, wants real \nhomeland security, start on the home front. When we take $676 billion \nout for a tax break for wealthy people, the likelihood that Illinois \nwill get $20 million to be safer as a State is diminished dramatically.\n  Another area tells an important story about the priorities of this \nadministration: education. When we take more money out for tax breaks \nfor wealthy people, there is less money available to go into education. \nRemember a year ago? A year ago yesterday President Bush signed No \nChild Left Behind, the first and highest priority of his new \nadministration. When he was still in Texas before being sworn in, he \ncalled in the congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans, and \nsaid: Put your party label aside; can't we all agree--Senator Kennedy, \nCongressman George Miller and the Republican leaders--on a bipartisan \nbasis to do something meaningful for America's schools? He convinced \nthem. He convinced me. He convinced the majority in Congress. We passed \nNo Child Left Behind and said we would go after the 6 million-plus \nstudents in America who are falling behind in failing schools. We are \ngoing to not only find out what their current state of education is, we \nare going to help the school districts get back on their feet with \nbetter teachers, better classrooms, more technology, more time in the \nclassroom, and better results. I cheered it on. We all did. It was a \nbipartisan approach. The President took great pride. This would be the \ncenterpiece of his new administration. He was truly going to be an \neducation President.\n  As soon as the floodlights had dimmed and the television cameras had \nleft, we learned something in this town of secrets, about a secret that \nhad been kept by the administration. The secret was this: The President \nwas prepared to sign the bill to approve the plan. The President was \nnot prepared to put the Federal dollars on the table to make it work. \nAs a consequence, we stand here today with mandates from this No Child \nLeft Behind on school districts in States across America and the Bush \nWhite House refuses to fund those mandates.\n  Pick your State. With very few exceptions, every State in the Union \nis in deep deficit. My home State of Illinois will swear in a new \nGovernor on Monday. Congressman Rob Blajovich is leaving the House of \nRepresentatives to become our new Governor. He inherits a fiscal \nnightmare of a $4 billion deficit. California has more than a $30 \nbillion deficit. These Governors who are required to balance their \nbudgets will be scrambling to cut basic services or increase taxes. \nThey have no other place to turn.\n  One of the major responsibilities of our State is education. At a \ntime when the State of Illinois cannot afford to meet its basic \nobligation for education, we have a mandate coming from President Bush, \na mandate under No Child Left Behind, which will add to the expenses of \nIllinois and every other State, but the President refuses to put the \nmoney on the table to fund his own education program.\n  Take a look at some of the charts to get an idea of the priorities of \neducation by this Bush administration. The Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, the basic bedrock of helping failing schools and \nstudents improve, is a part of the Federal budget which reflects the \npriorities of the administration. Under the Clinton administration, the \naverage amount of increase each year was 22.3 percent. In comes \nPresident Bush, the education President, proposing a 3.6-percent \nincrease. Thank goodness Congress refused, denied him, and increased it \nto 20 percent. This tells you about the priorities.\n  Look at the increases in education over the last 7 years, overall \nspending in education, and you see double digits, but for 1 year, until \nwe come to President Bush; his increase was 2.8 percent in education. \nThe education President will not put the money on the table. Under the \nBush administration, we have the smallest increase for education in 7 \nyears.\n  Now take a look at what the Bush budget has done. Because he cuts \nback on education increases, because he will not fund his own No Child \nLeft Behind, 18,000 teachers were cut from professional development to \nimprove their skills in the classroom; 20,000 students lost college \nwork-study programs; 25,000 limited-English-proficient children were \ncut from the Federal bilingual education programs; 33,000 kids cut out \nof afterschool programs; no increase in Pell grants; no increase in \nstudent loans. Is this the education President?\n  No child left behind? Look who is being left behind. Not only the \nchildren but the teachers--and the Nation.\n  If you take a look at President Bush's budget, he promised 6.7 \nmillion children would be rescued by No Child Left Behind. In fact, \nthey have not been. They have been left behind themselves. The \nPresident said we were going to have 2 million more children protected \nthis year. In fact, there are only 354,000.\n  When it comes down to it, you have the Bush administration on the one \nhand posing for pictures and shaking hands with school principals \nacross America and with the other hand reaching into their pockets and \npulling out their State funds to fund his unfunded mandate under No \nChild Left Behind. We will have States paying for the testing required \nby the Federal Government and not paid for, paying for the evaluation \nof students required by the Federal Government and not paid for, \nteacher certification and improvement required by the Federal \nGovernment and not paid for, paraprofessionals improving skills \nrequired by the Federal Government and not paid for--along series of \nunfunded mandates from this President.\n  What will it mean in the States across the Nation? Read the bad news. \nI have it here. State after State is seriously considering, and some \nalready deciding, to go to a four-day school week because they cannot \nafford to keep the schools open while President Bush sends unfunded \nmandates under No Child Left Behind.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has outlined what we have required States to do \nas a result of Federal legislation. What if school districts decide not \nto do this?\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. They could face a cutoff of the existing Federal funds \nthey are receiving. You have States that could be penalized, States \nthat already are in trouble because of State deficits. They could be \npenalized by not complying with the Federal mandates that President \nBush created, signed, and refused to fund.\n  Now, let me tell you where I stand. Senator Kennedy, who is not with \nus today but he certainly has been our leader on this issue, has called \nfor full funding under title 1, full funding under the IDEA program for \ndisabled students, and those are things I support. It comes to about $7 \nbillion, if I am not mistaken. We should come up with that money. If we \ncan find $676 billion for tax breaks for wealthy people, can we not \nfind $7 billion for education?\n  It is my position--and I do not speak for anyone but myself on this--\nif this Congress fails to fund the unfunded mandates of No Child Left \nBehind, this Senator will propose suspending those mandates, saying to \nthose school districts across America that until we are prepared to put \nthe money on the table, until this economy is stronger, we are not \ngoing to require you to test every student every year to make an \nevaluation of each of those students and go through all the \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind.\n  The President cannot have it both ways. He cannot call himself an \neducation President, wrap himself in the cloak of educational reform, \nand then refuse to put the money on the table. That is what he has \ndone, year after year after year.\n  There are those who believe the way to stimulate America's economy is \nto make sure a majority of tax breaks go to a majority of Americans who \nbelieve that we should invest, as well, in the education of our \nchildren. Is there anything more important? This administration makes \nit the lowest priority. It should be our highest. That investment by \nour Nation at this moment in time will not only help us through the \ncurrent recession but it will also help us for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S101-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

I commend our distinguished friend from Illinois. He \nhas brought into sharp focus our dilemma with respect to the prime \ninitiative of President Bush with respect to education.\n  I just finished a column for the local newspaper relative to symbols \nversus substance. You will find our Republican colleagues very strong \non symbols but very weak on substance itself.\n  Let me ask the question, rhetorically, of course: What Governor, what \nmayor--all of us are facing these deficits--is cutting taxes in the \nface of these deficits? With voodoo? In other words, all you have to do \nto fix the deficit is cut your revenues. We heard this under President \nReagan, and Vice President Bush called it voodoo. We heard all you \nneeded to do was to cut taxes and the people would have so much money \nthey would spend and everything else. We would have consumer demand. \nYou would have sales tax revenues. You would have income tax revenues, \nthey would all increase, and we would just grow out of a deficit.\n  At that time Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush No. 1, \ncalled it voodoo.\n  We just had, last year and the year before, of course, voodoo II. A \ntax cut of $1.3 trillion plus interest costs $1.7 trillion. We are \ncutting the revenues and at the same time in the 4 years, and I want my \ncolleagues to check the record and mark it down, the defense budget has \ngone in the last a little over 3, nearer 4 years from 1998 until now, \nfrom $271 billion to at least $371 billion. It will probably be nearer \n$386 billion. We have increased defense costs $100 billion. We have \nincreased health costs $107 billion, when you look at Medicare and \nMedicaid and the veterans. But that does not include the community \nhealth centers or child health care, of course. So we spend another \n$200 billion there. We have increased agriculture, farm subsidies \nanother $35 billion.\n  While we are increasing the spending that both sides of the aisle \nsupport--health care, defense, and agriculture, some $235 billion--and \nthen we cut the revenues $1.7 trillion, in voodoo, and we end up with a \ndeficit. We are just like the States. Only there is no serious purpose \nup here for the needs of the country. It is only for the needs of the \ncampaign.\n  We have been using this Congress and the White House to campaign. The \nheck with the country. Despite having just completed one election, \nwe're already looking at the next election. And the blooming media has \ngone along with us. They treat politics as a spectator sport, where \nthey want to know who is up, who is down, who is announcing, who is \nquitting, who is doing this, and who is doing that. You can't get their \nattention on paying the bill.\n  As a result, the debt has soared to $6.3 trillion. We will be \ndebating next month about increasing the debt limit. I want to see how \nmany of my colleagues will vote for that. They have increased the debt \nby cutting all the revenues, increasing all the spending, and saying: I \nam against the Government, the Government is too big, the Government is \nnot the solution, the Government is the problem.\n  I have sent to the desk a value-added tax. I want to increase taxes. \nI am sober. I am experienced. I got a triple A credit rating back in \n1959 for the little State of South Carolina. I know what you have to do \nto pay the bill. I have been the chairman of our Budget Committee up \nhere in the National Government, in the Senate. I can tell you, this is \nabout my third try for a value-added tax.\n  My bill will be referred to the Finance Committee. I know revenue \nmeasures under the Constitution derive in the House of Representatives. \nBut I know also that we had a hearing back in the 1980s when we had \nthis voodoo. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas was chairman of that committee. I \nbrought Dr. Cnossen, the Hollander expert. He testified, because he \nknew he had helped the United Kingdom. He had written a value-added tax \nfor Japan, for Canada--every industrialized country in the world save \nthe United States has a value-added tax. That is one of the big \ndeficiencies we have in international trade.\n  They have a 15 percent to 17 percent advantage with their VAT. We \nhave the disadvantage. When Dr. Cnossen testified, as they were leaving \nthe room--I will never forget--former Senator John Chafee turned to \nLloyd, the chairman, and he said, ``Lloyd, if we had a secret ballot we \nwould vote it out of this committee unanimously.''\n  We needed the money to balance the budget. We tried with Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings and had a temporary restraint on the Federal budget. \nBut then instead of a prompter, a sword to prompt fiscal \nresponsibility, it was used as a shield. We needed to take extreme \naction. But we didn't take it, and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was out by \n1992. Bush I was running a $400 billion deficit and lost office to the \nGovernor of Arkansas.\n  Let's get to the Governor of Arkansas. When Clinton got nominated, \nhis friend Erskine Bowles from Charlotte got together business leaders \nand market experts. They went down to Little Rock. Along with them was \nAlan Greenspan. Greenspan told then-Governor Clinton--he said, When you \ncome to Washington you are going to have to not only cut spending, you \nare going to have to increase taxes.\n  Clinton said, Are you serious?\n  He said, The country needs it. We are not going to have any \ninvestment, we are not going to have any jobs, until the Government \nstarts paying down the debt.\n  And paying down the debt was the 8-year chant on the floor of the \nSenate. You can't hear it now. You can't hear it now, about paying down \nthe debt. You have to have tax cuts and so forth. One side says let's \nhave, I don't know, a $700 billion, $800 billion, $900 billion\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\ntax cut. The other one says, no, only $200 billion or $300 billion. We \nare back into the ying and the yang. We had that under voodoo I, under \nBush II, year before last, when he said he wanted $2.3 trillion in tax \ncuts. The Democrats come around and said $900 billion and we \ncompromised at $1.3 trillion and with interest costs $1.7 trillion. \nThat is what we are on course to do.\n  Politicians go on the weekend shows chanting, I am for the rich, you \nare for the poor, the ying and yang, and it is all campaign applesauce. \nIt is not for the good of the country.\n  I am telling you what we need to do is pay for the war. We have a \nPresident, a Commander in Chief who says, look, I am going to send you \nto get killed in Iraq, or maybe North Korea, or wherever he is \nheaded. He is going to ask you to fight and sacrifice, but we are not \ngoing to pay for it. We are going to have to run deficits. In past wars \nwe ran deficits, but we paid for it at the particular time.\n\n  What really happened? If you take all of the deficits for the last 30 \nyears--right after World War II--under Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, \nKennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford--you take the sum total of all those \ndeficits. It is $358 billion.\n  We just finished the fiscal year--one year under Bush II--which does \nnot include the cost of the real war. It was only an excursion in \nAfghanistan. The Congressional Budget Office says the excursion in \nAfghanistan and homeland security amounts to $35 billion at the most. \nBut in one year we have run a deficit of $428 billion. And to what do \nwe owe this amount? Guess what. We had a stimulus--I want everybody to \nhear this--a stimulus of $428 billion in the last fiscal year. We are \nalready $159 billion in the red the first 3 months of this fiscal year.\n  Added together, you have a $587 billion stimulus in the last 15 \nmonths. It hasn't worked. We are getting worse and worse. There is not \ngoing to be financial investment as long as we continue on this course. \nIt is absolutely reckless to talk about whether any kind of a dividend \ncan do it, or whether a marriage penalty can do it, or whatever else. \nThey have to come around and argue about double taxation and everything \nelse of that kind. We need to do both. We need to cut the spending and \nwe need to increase the revenues. To accomplish this goal, we must have \na value-added tax.\n  I can tell you here and now that it will take a year to get this 1 \npercent value-added tax up and running. It will take a year to get it \nthe administration worked out, and to get the different businesses to \nchange around their computers and for the IRS to institute it. And when \nwe do it will get about $35 or $40 billion, and we will begin a modest \neffort to pay for whatever war, whether it is a domestic war, an Iraqi \nwar, a North Korean war, or some of the 14 peacekeeping operations.\n  I can tell you now the military is stretched. That Reserve crowd that \nflies the C-17s in my backyard have been there since September 12, \n2001. If they made $60,000 or $70,000 in private life, they are down \nnow to $35,000 at the most. They cannot pay their rent. It is the same \nway with the National Guard. They are being called up everywhere in \nthese particular cases.\n  We need to come to grips with what we are doing and cut out the \ncampaigning and start looking at the needs of the country. \nSpecifically, every Senator says we are not going to spend Social \nSecurity. President Bush, in February the year before last, when he \nsubmitted his message to the Congress said: I am setting aside $2.6 \ntrillion for Social Security.\n  We have that, and more. In the law, it says: You shall not spend the \nSocial Security surplus on anything other than Social Security. That is \nsection 13301, recommended in section 21 of the Greenspan Commission. I \ndropped in a bill that requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \ncertify that if there is a deficit there cannot be a tax cut. That tax \ncut--whatever they pass in this pandemonium, pell-mell rush for \nreelection--whatever tax cut they pass will not take effect until that \non-budget surplus or on-budget deficit is zero.\n  That is the test of not using Social Security moneys. I want to keep \nthem honest. I have already introduced it as a bill. It won't be a \nsurprise. I had it all ready last year. We couldn't even debate the \nbudget last year. We were criticized on the Democratic side of the \naisle for not bringing up the budget. But I say bring it up and we will \nget the votes and find out whether they really want to protect Social \nSecurity because they have been spending it on any and everything but \nSocial Security. Under section 21 of the 1983 Greenspan Commission \nreport, it said set these funds aside in trust for the baby boomers. \nThere is nothing wrong with Social Security except how they spend it. \nNow we owe the Social Security trust fund $1.3 trillion because we have \nbeen spending it on any and everything other than Social Security.\n\n  Let us not double talk the electorate. Let us remember to tell the \ntruth to the American people. But I can tell you the bottom line is \nthere is a $428 billion deficit for 2002, and we are $159 billion \nalready in the red in first 3 months of 2003--in the last 15 months we \nhave $600 billion of stimulus money that hasn't stimulated the economy. \nAnother $30 billion or $40 billion a year is not going to stimulate it.\n  So we are whistling ``Dixie.'' We are doing this not for the country \nbut for campaigns.\n  I want to say one more word with respect to the economy. We were \nhaving a hearing, and the distinguished Senator from Kansas talked \nabout Boeing and how they just lost some 10,000 jobs. I reminded him \nthat since NAFTA, we have lost 55,200 textile jobs. The Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, reminded us how we lost the steel \nindustry. We can go right on down. We have 6.3-percent unemployment in \nmy little State of South Carolina. We are not manufacturing anything. \nWe have exported the industrial backbone of the United States. What we \nhave is not free trade. Now the Senator from Kansas understands that it \nis competitive trade.\n  There are all kinds of subsidies. There is a standard of living. We \nrequire before you open up any manufacturing, you have to have clean \nair, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing \nnotice, parental leave, safe machinery, safe working places--go right \non down the list--the highest standard of living. You can go to Mexico \nfor 58 cents an hour, and you can go to China for less than that. They \nare leaving Mexico to go to China. They are all talking about free \ntrade. Nothing is free. It is competitive.\n  We have to rebuild the economic manufacturing capacity and strength \nof the United States. We need jobs. We are not going to have any jobs \nuntil we get a competitive trade policy. Otherwise we are not going to \nhave any investment long-term because what we are doing is increasing \ninterest on taxes. You cannot avoid it. The interest costs for the debt \nis growing at $1 billion a day right now. If we go to war, oil costs \nare going up, and interest costs are going up. Rather than $365 \nbillion, interest costs are going to be up to $400 billion to $500 \nbillion for just carrying the charges--for the privilege of campaigning \nand the politicians looking out for their reelection and not for the \ncountry.\n  I am sorry to say this. But that is the truth.\n  I see others are now ready to speak. I will speak at length otherwise \nwith respect to the draft. There is no sense of sacrifice in this \ncountry. Our friend, Charlie Rangel, over on the House side, has put in \nthe draft bill. In the beginning, I was opposed to the creation of an \nall volunteer force. So I put the draft bill in the Senate three other \ntimes. And I put it in now a fourth time day before yesterday because \nthere has to be a sense and a feel of shared sacrifice. Don't come and \ntell us we have a strong economy, and I am sending you to get killed; \nand, this is a wonderful thing. We have to have more confidence in our \ncommander in chief. He simply cannot just go to flag factories, get his \nsound bite early in the morning, rat-a-tat-tat sound bite, have two \nfundraisers at night, and let the country go to--you know what--in a \nhand basket.\n\n  That is what is going on. We have to sober up. We have to pay for the \nwar. There has to be a shared sacrifice and sense of it in this \ncountry. I think the country is ready, but the Government is not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, this month our Nation will celebrate \nwhat would have been Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 74th birthday. It is \nright and fitting that on the third Monday of every January since 1986, \nAmericans have paused from their work, school, or other activities to \nhonor Dr. King and his legacy. Dr. King gave hope to millions of \nAmericans and was a catalyst for the greatest advancement in civil \nrights our Nation has experienced since the end of the Civil War.\n  Because of great Americans such as Dr. King, separate but equal is no \nlonger the law of the land. Because of the progress we have made in the \nlast 50 years, segregation in public schools has been unlawful. African \nAmericans have the right to vote. Americans cannot be fired or denied a \njob based on race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, or \nage. Our Nation has made great strides to protect freedom and equality \nfor all Americans as a result of Dr. King's leadership.\n  But almost 40 years after Dr. King delivered his historic ``I Have a \nDream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and nearly 35 \nyears after Dr. King was tragically gunned down at a hotel in Memphis, \nTN, our Nation still has a long way to go to finish his work.\n  As we begin the 108th Congress, I want to take this moment to urge \nboth my colleagues and the President to make civil rights a priority.\n  Earlier this week, the Senate welcomed a new majority leader, Senator \nBill Frist. But the discussions leading up to that should be the \nbeginning, not the end, of a national discussion about the unfinished \nwork of securing civil rights for every American.\n  Congress and the President can demonstrate their support for freedom \nand justice by supporting civil rights initiatives that have been \nignored for far too long. And they should begin this month, as the new \nCongress convenes and as the Nation celebrates Dr. King's birthday.\n  Perhaps no issue on this agenda is more urgent than the issue of \nracial profiling. Racial profiling is the insidious practice by which \nsome law enforcement agents routinely stop African Americans, Latinos, \nAsian-Americans, Arab Americans, and others simply because of their \nrace, ethnicity, or national origin. Reports in States from New Jersey \nto Florida, and Maryland to Texas all show that African Americans, \nHispanics, and members of other minority groups are sometimes being \nstopped by some police far in excess--far in excess--of their share of \nthe population and the rate at which they engage in criminal conduct.\n  Just this week, the Boston Globe ran a series of news articles about \nits analysis of traffic stop data in Massachusetts and came to the same \ntroubling conclusion we have seen in places such as New Jersey and \nMaryland. Racial profiling still exists and is a very real problem. It \nhasn't gone away or ended. In fact, the Massachusetts experience only \nunderscores the need for a national law on this issue of racial \nprofiling. And the time to act is now.\n  I might add that the urgency for banning racial profiling is \ncompounded by concerns post-September 11 that racial profiling--not \ngood police work and following up on legitimate leads--is being used \nmore frequently against Arabs, Muslims, or Americans who are perceived \nto be Arabs or Muslims.\n  President Bush pledged to end racial profiling nearly 2 years ago \nduring this first address to a joint session of Congress. Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft also has acknowledged the damage caused by racial \nprofiling and, he too, called for an end to the practice. So it is time \nfor this administration to move this effort forward.\n  In the last Congress, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress \nsponsored the End Racial Profiling Act. Representative John Conyers, \nthe distinguished ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, and \nI, intend to reintroduce our bill early in this Congress. Our bill bans \nracial profiling and requires Federal, State, and local enforcement \nagencies to take steps to prevent the practice. This bill should be one \nof the top agenda items in this Congress, and the administration should \nfollow through on its promise to address this issue.\n  September 11 cannot be an excuse for continued delay in dealing with \nthe problem of racial profiling. This is a problem and a challenge that \nour country can and must meet. We need improved intelligence and we \nneed improved law enforcement, not racial stereotypes, to protect our \nNation from future terrorist attacks.\n  Indeed, I believe that the End Racial Profiling Act is a pro-law \nenforcement bill. It will help to restore the trust and confidence of \nthe communities our police and law enforcement have pledged to serve \nand protect. That confidence is crucial to success in stopping crime, \nand, yes, in stopping terrorism. The End Racial Profiling Act is good \nfor law enforcement and good for America.\n  As Dr. King often implored his fellow activists, it is not time to \nwait. It is not time to ``slow up'' or ``cool off.'' He said, ``[W]e \ncan't afford to stop now because our Nation has a date with destiny. We \nmust keep moving.'' Mr. President, it is time to act.\n  Yes, we have many pressing priorities this Congress. And I certainly \nthink that first and foremost is combating terrorism and addressing our \nNation's weak economy. But we cannot ignore a fundamental \nresponsibility of this Congress: to fight for freedom, justice, and \nequality for all Americans. In addition to passing the End Racial \nProfiling Act, Congress and the President should also address a range \nof civil rights-related issues this Congress--from education, to \nwelfare, to health care, to improving our criminal justice system.\n  We should ensure that every child has access to a quality public \neducation. I voted against the education bill in the last Congress, \nbecause I do not believe that it will bring us closer to that goal. I \nam particularly concerned about the annual testing mandate included in \nthis law. Study after study shows that disadvantaged students lag \nbehind their peers on standardized tests. If we are to truly leave no \nchild behind, we should give local school districts the resources they \nneed to provide the basic educational services and programs to which \neach child is entitled. If we fail to provide these resources, we run \nthe risk of setting disadvantaged children up for failure on these \ntests--failure which could damage the self-esteem of some of our most \nvulnerable students.\n  Congress should also do more to ensure that federally funded programs \ncomply with civil rights and other laws. In particular, we must improve \nthe Federal welfare law to require that each State's program treats all \napplicants and clients fairly. While Congress rightly encouraged State-\nlevel innovation with the 1996 welfare law, we should use the pending \nreauthorization of that law as an opportunity to ensure that all State \nplans conform to uniform Federal fair treatment and due process \nprotections for all applicants and clients.\n  Congress should ensure that all Americans get a fair wage for an \nhonest day's work. Too often, parents work double shifts or more than \none job for low wages in order to make ends meet and to provide the \nbasic necessities for their families. We must at last increase the \nFederal minimum wage. And we must work to close the wage gap between \nwomen and men.\n  Congress should also take action to ensure fairness and justice in \nthe administration of the death penalty. We know that the \nadministration of the\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\ndeath penalty at the Federal and State levels is flawed. With over 100 \ninnocent people on death row later exonerated in the modern death \npenalty era, any reasonable person can see that the current system \nrisks executing the innocent.\n\n  Just this week, the University of Maryland released a study finding \nenormous racial and geographic disparities in the Maryland death \npenalty system. African-American defendants accused of killing white \nvictims are significantly more likely to face the death penalty than \ncases with nonwhite victims. Prosecutors in Baltimore County are \nsignificantly more likely to file initially for a death sentence than \nother Maryland jurisdictions.\n  I think Governor Glendening did the right thing when he placed a \nmoratorium on executions last year, and I urge Governor Ehrlich to \ncontinue that moratorium while he and other Maryland officials analyze \nthis study's disturbing findings. It would be contrary to our Nation's \nfundamental principles of justice and fairness to execute anyone in \nMaryland until the disparities identified by this study have been \naddressed.\n  Of course, Maryland is not the only State with troubling racial and \ngeographic disparities in its death penalty system. Similar concerns \nhave been raised about the Federal system, as well as the \nadministration of the death penalty in other States. That is why \nCongress should pass the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act. \nCongress and the President should support a moratorium on executions \nwhile a national, blue ribbon commission reviews the fairness of the \nadministration of the death penalty.\n  This is a civil rights issue. We simply cannot say we live in a \ncountry that offers equal justice to all Americans when racial \ndisparities plague the system by which society imposes the ultimate \npunishment.\n  Congress must also do more to protect hardworking Americans from \ndiscrimination in the workplace. We should pass the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act. I have been pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, in sponsoring this important bill that will ensure that \nAmericans are not discriminated against by employers based on their \nsexual orientation. The world has changed. It is time that we take this \nstep on behalf of equal opportunity and equal rights.\n  Congress should also take another step to realize Dr. King's dream of \na nation where all Americans have the right to vote and to be \nrepresented in their Congress. We meet today in a jurisdiction where \nover half-a-million people are denied the right to fully participate in \ntheir government. The majority of the people in this jurisdiction, the \nDistrict of Columbia, are African American. Shutting them out of our \nGovernment is a continuing moral stain on our Nation that must be \naddressed. We should take action on legislation sponsored by Senator \nLieberman and myself, under D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton's \nleadership, to grant full congressional representation for the District \nof Columbia.\n  Finally, the President should demonstrate his commitment to justice \nfor all Americans by nominating judges to the Federal bench whose \nrecords demonstrate that they will uphold our Nation's civil rights \nlaws and give fair and impartial treatment to all who come before them. \nThe President's renomination this week of Charles Pickering, Sr. to a \nposition on the Fifth Circuit is a step backward. As a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I reviewed his record closely last year and came \nto the conclusion that Mr. Pickering would not be fit for a position on \nthe Fifth Circuit. I am not convinced that he will give all who come \nbefore him a fair hearing, especially on issues of racial justice.\n  Soothing words or a change of leadership alone cannot heal the \ndivisions that remain in our Nation. Congress and the Administration \nmust take concrete steps to protect Americans' civil rights, not just \ngive them lip service.\n  As Dr. King said, ``This is no time to engage in the luxury of \ncooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the \ntime to make real the promises of democracy.''\n  There is much more work to do to fulfill Dr. King's dream that all of \nAmerica's children would someday live in a country ``where they will \nnot be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their \ncharacter.'' Let's begin that work in this Congress, in this body, \nduring this month when the nation celebrates Dr. King's birthday. There \nis no time to waste.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S104-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S104-S106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to H.J. Res. 1, the short-term continuing resolution which is \nat the desk; further, that the resolution be read the third time and \npassed, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there are a number of our colleagues--and \nI would say I am certainly one of them--who would vote no if we were to \nhave a rollcall vote on this continuing resolution today. I have \nattempted to accommodate colleagues who are not able to be here as a \nresult of their illness, and it is only as a result of illness we will \nforego the need for a rollcall vote. But I think this moment requires \nat least an explanation.\n  We are now into the 6th month of the effort underway in Congress to \naddress appropriations. We have continued to extend the continuing \nresolutions at levels far below what is viewed as adequate for \neducation, homeland security, health, research, and for the priorities \nthat many of us hold to be the most important. So I must say I am \ndeeply troubled by this continuing extension of the continuing \nresolution without addressing the need for adequacy in education and \nhomeland security, in particular.\n  Basically, what this reflects is a dramatic cut, a deep cut in the \nfunding for education, a deep cut in the funding for homeland security, \na deep cut in transportation and research--cuts virtually across the \nboard. I hope this will be the last continuing resolution that we will \nadopt in this manner.\n\n  I know that the chairs and ranking members of the Appropriations \nCommittee are working now to resolve the other matters relating to \nthese priorities and will bring an appropriations bill to the floor \nperhaps within the next few days.\n  It is with that understanding that we will not object to this CR, \nthat we will not ask for a rollcall vote, but that we will voice, as \nstrongly as we can, our opposition to these cuts and our determination \nto find a way to address them successfully as we consider the \nappropriations bills perhaps as early as next week. I do not object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I congratulate our leaders for this \nunderstanding. We are standing by ready to commence work on the 11 \nbills that are the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills. We have had \ngreat bipartisan work on our committee with the staff and the Members. \nI believe the Democratic leader is absolutely correct; we are prepared \nto work with anyone in the Senate to try to work out any details that \nmight have to be considered. We look forward to working with Senator \nDaschle in every way possible so we can move these bills as quickly as \npossible.\n  I speak as one who has just come back from my home in Alaska. We have \nthe highest unemployment I have seen. Many of these bills contain money \nthat would bring construction items and jobs to my State during this \nyear. If we delay any further, we miss the construction season. These \nbills are vital\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nto restart our economic engine. I am pleased to have this report that \nwe are able to move forward on this continuing resolution. I can pledge \nthe four leaders of the Appropriations Committees--of the House and \nSenate--on a bipartisan basis have agreed to work together to get these \nbills finished as rapidly as possible with the help of the leaders. I \nthank the leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senators should not be under any \nillusion: CR will starve vital functions of government. You don't have \nto take my word for it. According to Representative Bill Young the \nRepublican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a long-term \nCR at these levels ``would have disastrous impacts on the war on \nterror, homeland security, and other important government \nresponsibilities.''\n  Chairman Young wrote that sentence in a memo he sent to Speaker \nHastert. The memo went even further, detailing the impact of a CR on a \nhost of important domestic programs. Here is a sampling of what \nChairman Young said will be cut:\n  No. 1, FBI: The funding to hire additional agents to fight terrorism \nand to continue information technology upgrades would be denied;\n  No. 2, bioterrorism: There would be no funding for the President's \n$800 million initiative to increase funding for new basic bioterror \nresearch, to develop and test a new improved anthrax vaccine, and to \nassist universities and research institutions;\n  No. 3, first responders: There will be no funding for the President's \n$3.5 billion initiative to provide assistance to local law enforcement, \nfire departments, and emergency response teams;\n  No. 4, SEC/corporate responsibility: There will be insufficient \nfunding to support current staffing requirements let alone significant \nstaff increases needed to monitor corporate behavior;\n  No. 5, veterans medical care: A long-term CR would leave the veterans \nmedical health care system at least $2.5 billion short of expected \nrequirements;\n  No. 6, firefighting: The $1.5 billion taken from other Interior \nDepartment programs to pay for firefighting costs will not be replaced;\n  No. 7, Pell grants: A freeze in this program will result in a \nshortfall of over $900 million;\n  No. 8, Medicare claims: There will be no funding for the President's \n$143 million proposal to ensure that the growing number of claims are \nprocessed in a timely manner;\n  No. 9, special supplemental feeding program for WIC: Funding would be \nreduced by $114 million below current levels, meaning less will be \navailable for families that depend on this program;\n  No. 10, Social Security claims: There will be no funding increase to \nprocess and pay benefits to millions of Social Security recipients.\n  In addition to the program cuts listed by Chairman Young, the House \nCR omits assistance for thousands of farmers all over this country who \nare confronting the worst drought in more than 50 years.\n  This is the wrong way to do business. We should be completing our \nwork on the bipartisan appropriations bills, not cutting education, \nveterans affairs, homeland security and other important priorities.\n  Each of these bills properly fund key priorities. And, most \nimportantly, each enjoyed the unanimous support of the Democrats and \nthe Republicans on the Committee.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse wrote a memo that has been widely read. It is an excellent memo \nthat reviews the impact of these cuts. It was sent to the Speaker last \nOctober. I ask unanimous consent that the memo be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Speaker Hastert\n     From: Chairman C.W. Bill Young\n     Re: Impacts of a Long-term Continuing Resolution\n     Date: October 3, 2002\n       Pursuant to my October 1st correspondence regarding the \n     state of the appropriations process, I want to provide you \n     with further analysis of the potential impacts of a long-term \n     continuing resolution (CR). These projections assume a \n     current-rate CR excluding one time expenditures that extends \n     through February or March.\n       A long-term continuing resolution (CR) that funds \n     government operations at FY02 levels would have disastrous \n     impacts on the war on terror, homeland security, and other \n     important government responsibilities. It would also be \n     fiscally irresponsible. It would fund low-priority programs \n     the President has proposed to eliminate.\n       Homeland Security--The President has proposed a nearly $40 \n     billion increase for homeland security in his FY03 budget. \n     None of these funds would be provided under a long-term CR. \n     Assuming Congress completes work on creating a Department of \n     Homeland Security, a long-term CR would leave this new agency \n     with very little resources to carry out its new mission.\n       Projects--A long-term CR ensures that no Member of Congress \n     would receive a single project. The Committee has received \n     tens of thousands of requests for billions of dollars from \n     almost every Member of Congress.\n       War Supplemental--It is likely that the first item Congress \n     will consider when we reconvene after the election is a major \n     supplemental to fund possible military operations in Iraq. \n     It would be highly problematic to expect the Congress to \n     complete work on 11 spending bills while working on an \n     urgent war supplement.\n\n               Homeland Security Impacts of Long-Term CR\n\n       FBI--We would not have sufficient funding to hire \n     additional agents to fight terrorism and to continue IT \n     upgrades that will help the FBI ``connect the dots'' through \n     data mining proposals and other information infrastructure \n     enhancements.\n       TSA--Efforts to improve aviation, maritime and land \n     security would be seriously curtailed. Port, cargo, and \n     trucking security would seriously deteriorate. If emergency \n     funds are excluded from the CR calculations (which is \n     historically the case), TSA would be under an annual rate of \n     $1.5 billion for the life of a long-term CR. This would be \n     only 28 percent of their FY03 budget request ($5.3 billion). \n     At this level, it is unlikely TSA could maintain their \n     current workforce of 32,000 screeners as well as air \n     marshals. TSA would likely face personnel RIF's. Most \n     airports would not be able to meet the deadlines for security \n     improvements established by Congress last December.\n       Coast Guard--The Coast Guard is requesting a large ($500 \n     million) budget increase in FY03, and much of this is to hire \n     additional security personnel, such as Maritime Safety and \n     Security Teams to patrol harbors and respond to suspicious \n     activity. It also includes funds to expand the sea marshal \n     programs, which escorts DoD and high-risk commercial ships \n     into pert. Under the FY02 level, these safety expenses would \n     be deferred, or would require diversion of fund from other \n     critical missions such as drug interdiction or search and \n     rescue. Coast Guard ``deepwater'' program is slated to expand \n     from $500 million in FY02 to $725 million in FY03. The \n     contract was just signed this past June. Under a long-term \n     CR, the effort will have to be scaled back due to lack of \n     funding. This will impact shipyards, design companies, \n     aircraft manufacturers, and integration companies, all around \n     the country.\n       Bioterrorism--President has proposed a nearly $800 million \n     increase for new, basic bioterror research, $250 million to \n     develop and test a new improved anthrax vaccine, and $150 \n     million to assist universities and research institutions in \n     upgrading research facilities to conduct secure, \n     comprehensive research on biological agents. None of these \n     important initiatives to combat, study and prevent bio-\n     terroism would be funded under a long-term CR.\n       Border Patrol/INS--Efforts to deploy an additional Border \n     Patrol agents and immigration inspectors at land port-of-\n     entry along both the northern and southern borders would be \n     stalled. Likewise, construction projects that are necessary \n     to house these additional Border Patrol agents would be \n     delayed. No funding would be available to continue planning \n     and implementation of the INS' Entry Exit system, a program \n     designed to facilitate more secure and controlled access to \n     this country by non-U.S. citizens.\n       First Responders--The President has proposed a new \n     initiative to provide $3.5 billion in assistance to local law \n     enforcement, fire departments and emergency response teams \n     across the Nation. No funds would be provided for this \n     program, one of the highest domestic security priorities for \n     the President and his Homeland Security advisor. Tom Ridge.\n       Hospital preparedness--We would not have sufficient funds \n     to assist hopitals in making the necessary infrastructure \n     improvements and expansions so that they are prepared to \n     respond to bio-terrorism emergencies.\n       Diplomatic security--We would not have the funds to hire \n     additional State Department security staff for deployment \n     overseas, or to carry out needed technical and physical \n     security upgrades.\n       Office of Homeland Security--The Office of Homeland \n     Security was funded through the $20 billion supplemental. \n     Under a clean CR, this office would not be funded.\n\n                  Programmatic Impacts of Long-Term CR\n\n       SEC/Corporate Responsibility--We would not be able to fund \n     current staffing requirements, let alone support significant \n     staff increases needed to fight corporate fraud and protect \n     investors.\n       Veterans--The veterans medical care system will likely be \n     at least $2.5 billion short\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\n     of expected requirements. Veterans would be deprived of \n     significant increases in medical care proposed by the \n     President and the House budget resolution.\n       NIH--We would not be able to scale-up significantly Federal \n     support for bio-preparedness research and development as \n     proposed by the President. Anthrax vaccine research and \n     development also would be slowed. It would forgo the nearly \n     $4 billion proposed for the National Institutes of Health \n     which is consistent with Congress commitment to double \n     funding for NIH over a set period of time.\n       Foreign Operations--Afghanistan reconstruction, including \n     the famous Presidential ring road, would staff, increasing \n     chances that unrest and killings would resume there as the \n     Iraq matter comes to a head. It will severely cut the U.S. \n     contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \n     and Malaria and reduce by 30 percent funds for Plan Colombia.\n       Firefighting--interior has already spent $1.5 billion on \n     firefighting above what provided in FY02. This has come at \n     the expense of other programs including Member projects. \n     These bills would not be paid under a long-term CR.\n       Pay--All agencies would have to absorb Federal employee pay \n     increases due in January. This will make it much more \n     difficult for agencies to operate under a current rate and \n     result in widespread layoffs and furloughs.\n       Pell Grants--A freeze in the Pell program will result in \n     the accumulation of a significant shortfall. There will be a \n     shortfall of over $900 million, even when factoring in the $1 \n     billion supplemental appropriation provided to the program in \n     fiscal year 2002.\n       DEA--We would be unable to hire new agents in response to \n     FBI restructuring, which shifted 400 FBI drug agents to \n     counter-terrorism. We have proposed to hire hundreds of new \n     agents to fight the war on drugs. Not a single new agent \n     would be hired under a long term CR leaving a significant gap \n     in the federal government's drug enforcement capabilities.\n       GSA Construction--No new starts for any GSA line-item \n     construction ($630 million); would delay $300 million for 11 \n     courthouse construction projects, $30 million for 6 border \n     station construction projects, and $300 million for 5 other \n     construction projects, including funds for consolidating \n     Food and Drug Administration facilities, a major Census \n     building, and the US mission to the UN in New York. \n     Projects would become more expensive due to inflation.\n       Campaign finance Reform--No funding for implementation of \n     the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act making it difficult for \n     the Federal Elections Commission to implement the reforms \n     signed into law by the President.\n       Federal Prisons--Insufficient activation funds to four \n     Federal prisons that are scheduled to open in FY 2003, \n     exacerbating the already overcrowded conditions in the \n     Federal prison system.\n       Medicare claims--We would not be able to provide additional \n     funding, as proposed by the President, to handle the \n     increased Medicare claims volume in a timely manner. The \n     President proposed a $143 million increase to adequately \n     process the growing number of claims. A long term CR would \n     significantly slow down the claims process and unnecessarily \n     inconvenience Senior Citizens who depend on Medicare.\n       Yucca Mountain--A CR at the FY 2002 enacted level of $375M \n     would significantly cut DOE's nuclear waste repository \n     program by over $200 million. This would cause real delays in \n     the scheduled opening of the facility.\n       The Special Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, \n     Infants, and Children (WIC) would be reduced $114 million \n     from current levels. This would result in less assistance \n     being available for families who depend on this important \n     program, especially in uncertain economic times.\n       The Food and Drug Administration would be reduced by $138 \n     million which would result in immediate furloughs and RIFs \n     among newly hired employees responsible for enhanced \n     availability of drugs and vaccines, and for increased food \n     safety activities (primarily surveillance of imported food \n     products, an identified vulnerability).\n       Social Security--The President also asked for a significant \n     increase in funds to process and pay benefits to the millions \n     of Social Security recipients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to spend some time today here on \nthe floor of the Senate discussing the state of the American economy, \nthe choices we face, how we got here and hopefully a vision for a \nbetter future for our middle-class working families.\n  What is the state of the Nation's economy? You don't need to look at \nthe economic indicators, and the latest unemployment statistics, \nalthough they could tell you a story. You can just walk on the streets \nof Burlington or Waterloo or any city, or most towns large and small \nanywhere in America. For ordinary people paying taxes, it is tough for \nfamilies right now. People are hurting.\n  In the longer view, we face a growing fiscal and economic crisis due \nto a lack of reasonable economic leadership of this President. We have \nreturned to deficit spending and are mortgaging the dreams of the \nmiddle class with millions to finance a tax cut aimed at the very few. \nThat tax cut is squeezing out sensible, middle-class tax relief. It is \nsqueezing out funding for health care and education. In the last year, \nthe President, even in his budget reduced funding for the Leave No \nChild Behind Act, which just yesterday at the White House he was \ntouting as being a great success. It is squeezing out money needed for \nthat.\n  Worst of all, the President's fiscal mismanagement threatens Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and threatens having a real prescription drug \nbenefit that is so needed. It threatens the need that we have to raise \nthe floor on Medicare payments to States. My State of Iowa is right now \nrock bottom in the Nation in terms of beneficiary funding for Medicare.\n\n  Again, we are facing the retirement of the baby boomers who are \ncoming along pretty soon; and, of course, the need to fight terrorism.\n  All of these are being squeezed by the misguided and misplaced \neconomic policies of this administration. To date, the economic \nleadership of President Bush has been a miserable failure.\n  Let us start at the beginning.\n  On the day that George W. Bush was sworn as the 23rd President of the \nUnited States, the 10-year budget surplus was estimated at $5.6 \ntrillion $3.1 trillion on budget--the largest in American history. That \nyear's budget surplus was $236 billion--again, the largest 1-year \nbudget surplus in our Nation's history. The economy had created 22 \nmillion new jobs in the previous 8 years. Unemployment stood at 4.2 \npercent, a record.\n  The Nation's fiscal health in January of 2001 was such that facing a \nslowing economy, we could have passed a substantial stimulus package to \nboost the short-term economy without harming the Nation's long-term \nfiscal health. In kind of simple terms, it is if you or I get sick, and \nif we eat right and exercise, and we are in good health, we can even \nride out the occasion of a bad flu, for example. But if you haven't \ntaken care of yourself, if you haven't eaten right, and you are not in \ngood health overall, a simple flu can put you in the hospital or on \nlife support. That is the kind of smart economic plan we followed in \nthe 1990s. Those fiscally responsible and pro-growth policies made it \npossible for us to deal with the short-term economic slowdown without \nharming our Nation's long-term fiscal health.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush chose a different but now an all-to-\nfamiliar economic course--a massive, fiscally irresponsible tax cut \nthat does little to create jobs but does benefit largely the wealthiest \namong us. It has little or nothing to do with helping the middle class \nor with creating jobs.\n  In this day and age it seems that a Republican candidate running for\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nPresident can never go wrong by proposing a massive, deficit-bloating \ntax plan that largely benefits the wealthy. That is what candidate \nGeorge Bush did in 1999. It was not about the state of the American \neconomy, it was about simple Republican politics.\n  The Bush tax plan forgot that Americans don't live their lives on the \nright or the left of political parties. They live and work and struggle \nas part of the great American middle class. And they are here every \nday--not just on election day. They deserve economic policies that \nrespond to their needs--not the short-term political goals of this \nPresident, or any other politician or party or political theory. Not \nonly is the Bush tax plan rooted in what I call 2000 Republican \npolitics, but it is deeply rooted in a failed economic theory called \n``supply-side economics.'' Supply-side economics is nothing more than a \ndressed up fancy name for what we called back in the 1920s and the \n1930s trickle-down economics. In fact, former President Bush called it, \nI think, what it really is. He once termed it voodoo economics.\n\n  You can call it anything you want, but, in the end, it spells \ndisaster for America's long-term fiscal health. At its core, trickle-\ndown economics says that if we just slash marginal tax rates, \nparticularly for the wealthiest Americans, they will get so much money \nthat it will trickle down, and the economy will grow so rapidly that \nthis tax cut will, to a significant extent, pay for itself.\n  Well, it is a nice theory for those who are not weighted down by the \nburden of reality. It does not work in widely held economic theory and \nit did not work in practice when former President Reagan tried it in \n1981. That is a fact.\n  Many will claim that the 1981 tax cut was good for the economy. In \nfact, the economy dropped like a rock. When it passed in August 1981, \nunemployment was 7.4 percent. By the end of the year, it had climbed to \n8.5 percent. A year after passage, it was continuing to rise, reaching \na peak of 10.8 percent.\n  In Iowa, we faced the worst farm and small-town prices since the \nGreat Depression. I have a chart in the Chamber that depicts what \nhappened after the 1981 tax bill was passed. It shows the unemployment \nrate going up and up and up and up and up all the time. That was the \nresult of that 1981 tax bill.\n  While the economy did get back on track, it did thanks to a sharp cut \nin interest rates by the Federal Reserve in 1982. But the adverse \neffects of this misguided tax policy remained. The Federal deficit \nclimbed from 2.7 percent of the gross domestic product to over 5 \npercent--double. More importantly, over time, the Government's publicly \nheld debt multiplied fivefold as well.\n  This failed philosophy is now being put into practice for the second \ntime with the first Bush tax cut and now with this proposed second tax \ncut. That is why I call those who support this failed economic program \n``red ink'' Republicans. Maybe, as we move ahead if this is the course \nRepublicans choose, I say to the Presiding Officer, we should replace \nthe symbol of the Republican Party with something more fitting. Rather \nthan an elephant that is supposed to have a great memory, perhaps the \nsymbol of the Republican Party ought to be a big bottle of red ink, \nbecause every chance that these ``red ink'' Republicans get, they leave \nus swimming in red ink in this country. They did it in 1981. They are \ndoing it again now--deficits, deficits, deficits as far as the eye can \nsee.\n  This chart shows what happened during the 1980s. The deficits \nclimbed. Then, in 1993, we enacted the Clinton economic program. Look \nwhat happened to the deficits. Down they came. Down they came, until we \nhad the largest surplus on record.\n  Then we hit 2001, and another trickle-down economic tax plan, with \ndeficits soaring again. And again, we are swimming in red ink in this \ncountry. The trickle-down, red-ink tax cut in 1981 did not get folks to \nwork then, and it isn't now.\n  Just look at how many of my Republican friends reacted to the recent \nappointment of Stephen Friedman to the chairmanship of the President's \nNational Economic Council. Many vocally opposed Mr. Friedman's \nappointment because, of all things, he was a member of the Concord \nCoalition, a bipartisan organization focused on doing away with the \ndeficits. They certainly did not want anyone like that as the Chairman \nof the President's National Economic Council.\n\n  I think the case of Mr. Friedman signals the modern day Republican \nParty's total abandonment of fiscal discipline. It began in 1981. It \ncontinued through the 1990s as Republicans, to a person here in the \nCongress, opposed President Clinton's economic plan, a plan that \nbalanced the budget, brought us a surplus, created 22 million new jobs, \nand gave us the longest economic expansion in America's history.\n  Now these ``red ink'' Republicans are still at it today. We heard all \nkinds of arguments in 1993--I was here--from my friends on the other \nside of the aisle about how terrible this 1993 recovery plan was going \nto be. Why, it was just going to be awful. It was going to destroy this \ncountry. And yet, as I said, it created one of the longest economic \nexpansions in our Nation's history. Not one Republican voted for it.\n  One trickle-down Republican after another united in one prediction: \nthat the 1993 bill was going to ruin the economy.\n  Well, let's take a look at what happened, after that 1993 bill was \npassed, in terms of unemployment. Unemployment was high. We passed the \nbill and unemployment came down. It came down, in fact, to the lowest \npoint in our Nation's recent history; down to about 4 percent in the \nlate 1990s.\n  Now we come to the end of 2000. We have our country on course. We \nhave a record surplus. We have predicted surpluses for this decade of \nover $5 trillion; a healthy basis on which we could now begin to \naddress the needs of the baby boomers as they start to retire, reduce \nthe public debt, get our economy on a sound keel, and then, when the \nbaby boomers retire, we will have the wherewithal to meet those needs \nof Social Security and Medicare. That is where we were at the beginning \nof the Bush Presidency in 2001.\n  That was until President Bush sent down his tax proposal of 2001. The \nCongress passed it and sent it to the President. The price tag was \nsupposed to be $1.35 trillion, but the actual cost was much higher. It \nwas only by using some accounting gimmicks and tricks that would even \nmake Ken Lay of Enron blush. The actual cost goes much higher.\n  The 2001 tax bill was structured in another interesting way. In 2001, \nthose in the top 1 percent of income--with incomes averaging over $1 \nmillion got under 10 percent of the benefits. For 2002 and 2003, they \nget under 20 percent of the benefits. By 2006, they are scheduled the \nget over a third of the benefits. And in 2010, they get over 50 percent \nof the benefits.\n  This truly is trickle-down economics. The top 1 percent's share of \nthe Bush tax cuts--see, it is a kind of little trick. It starts out \nlow, but look what happens when we go through the decade. And we wind \nup in a decade where over 50 percent of the Bush tax cut goes to the \ntop 1 percent, the wealthiest people in this country.\n  What did President Bush tell us at the time in trying to pass this \nbill?\n  I quote here from a speech he gave at Western Michigan State:\n\n       Tax relief is central to my plan to encourage economic \n     growth, and we can proceed with tax relief without fear of \n     budget deficits, even if the economy softens. Projections for \n     the surpluses in my budget are cautious and conservative. \n     They already assume an economic slowdown in the year 2001.\n\n  President Bush gave that speech on March 27, 2001:\n\n       . . . we can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits. . . .\n\n  We went from a surplus, the largest on budget surplus in our Nation's \nhistory of $83 billion, to over a $300 billion deficit just two years \nlater; a shift of over $400 billion in just two years. $\\1/2\\ trillion \nin surpluses wiped out in 2 years of this Presidency. And he said there \nwould be no fear of budget deficits. Well, maybe the President doesn't \nfear budget deficits; maybe like President Reagan.\n  Maybe they don't care, but the middle class in America, the baby \nboomers about ready to retire better fear it because it is eating right \ninto Social Security. That is exactly what it is doing.\n  Then he says, ``projections for the surpluses in my budget.'' Can you \nbelieve that his budget actually projected surpluses when in the very \nfirst year it plunges us into the biggest deficits we have ever had?\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\n  I can only say that if I were President and my economic advisers had \ngiven me this plan and written this speech for me, which I assume they \nprobably did for him, and it turned out the way it turned out, I would \nfire the whole lot of them. Obviously, they didn't know what they were \ntalking about. Either that or they knew what they were doing, they knew \nwhat they were talking about, and they were pulling the wool over the \neyes of the American people. I tend to think that is really what it was \nabout. It was a scheme to reward those who had done the most to help \nthis President get elected, a massive tax cut for the wealthiest in our \ncountry.\n  Two years after this quote, here is the Bush economic record: The \nestimated 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion is wiped out; this \nyear's on-budget deficit, $319 billion as estimated by the CBO. The \neconomy has shed 2 million jobs, the worst record of negative job \ncreation of any President in more than 50 years.\n  I must hand it to this President. All this was done in 2 years. It is \namazing. The latest unemployment is about 6 percent. This is where we \ncame from: 4.5 percent in April, 2001 when the bill became law. After \n18 months, it is still going up. Hang on.\n  That is why we need a short-term stimulus to stop the rise in \nunemployment. Quite frankly, the President's program of slashing taxes \non dividends will not do that. I will explain that.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that:\n\n       The tax cut would cost the Treasury approximately $4 \n     trillion in the decade after 2011, the same period when the \n     baby boomers will begin to retire in large numbers and the \n     cost of Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and long-\n     term care will rise substantially as a result. Yet it is \n     during that same decade, after 2010, that the cost of a \n     permanent tax cut would explode as all of its revenue losing \n     provisions would then be fully in effect.\n\n  As I pointed out, after it goes fully into effect, well over half of \nit goes to the top 1 percent of our country. And yet those who rely on \nSocial Security and Medicare and long-term care are the ones put at \nrisk.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       [If] the tax cut takes full effect as scheduled and \n     continues after 2010, the long-term cost will substantially \n     exceed the 75-year deficit projected within Social Security. \n     In fact, if the tax cut were just scaled back so that three-\n     fifths of it took effect while the funds of the other two-\n     fifths were used to strengthen Social Security, the entire \n     75-year projected deficit of Social Security could be \n     eliminated.\n\n  There you have it. You have your priorities. Do you want to shore up \nand secure Social Security for the next 75 years, or do you want to \ngive the top 1 percent of our country more tax breaks?\n  That is the course we face. That is the course we have to change: \nGoing from an $86 billion budget surplus to a $318 billion deficit, a \nshift of over $400 billion.\n  The economic record of this President is one of fiscal mismanagement, \neconomic stagnation, rising unemployment, and jeopardizing the jobs and \nthe futures of our middle-class families and jeopardizing the long-term \nhealth of Social Security and Medicare. That is why we have to change \ncourse now.\n  I said, we need to begin with a stimulus package to stop the rise in \nunemployment. In the coming debate, the President has already accused \nsome of us on our side of playing ``class warfare.'' But it is the \nPresident's own tax cut of 2 years ago that already declared class \nwarfare, class warfare on the middle class. Take from the middle class, \ngive to the wealthiest 1 percent. If that is not class warfare, I don't \nknow what is.\n  Middle-class families are not getting their fair share of tax relief. \nThey are not seeing their incomes rise. Many are losing their jobs. And \nevery day hundreds of thousands of working families go without any \nhealth insurance. Millions of Americans are already without any health \ninsurance coverage whatsoever; every day hundreds of thousands more are \nadded to the rolls.\n  For some reason the President cannot see the pain that his economic \npolicies are causing. The President's refusal to see his own mistakes \nreminds me of that scene from the Caine Mutiny. The ship was sailing \nthrough a typhoon. It was in danger of floundering, but stubbornly and \nrigidly, Captain Queeg tells the helmsman to hold course, because Queeg \nrefused to listen. He refused to see the danger ahead. He could not \nsave the ship.\n  Just like the crew of the Caine, our first loyalty is in saving the \nship, not protecting the captain, not blindly following what the \ncaptain says when we plainly know what lies ahead. That is why it is \ntime for us to change America's economic course. We need to provide an \nimmediate stimulus to put people to work.\n  The President made his proposal. It is more of the same--more tax \ncuts for the wealthiest, little for working and middle-class families. \nThe centerpiece of the President's new proposal is the elimination of \ndividend taxes at an estimated cost of $364 billion over 10 years.\n  According to the tax policy center, about 45 percent of these \nbenefits will go to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers. Sound \nfamiliar? It should. We did the same thing 2 years ago.\n  Here are the facts: A 100-percent reduction in dividend taxes, plus \nthe other components of the Bush economic plan, would provide for those \nwho make more than a million dollars a year over $88,000 in tax cuts \nthis year, 2003. For my fellow average Iowan making between $20,000 and \n$30,000 a year, they will get $204 in 2003. So I guess the President is \nright. Everybody gets a little something--yes, average working families \nget the crumbs from the table and the wealthy get the smorgasbord. But, \nlooking ahead, most of the benefits that went to average taxpayers \ndissolve. But, the linchpin of the plan that mostly goes to the top 5 \npercent, that continues on for the long haul\n  That is class warfare. It is a direct frontal assault on the middle \nclass in America. But not only is the Bush plan class warfare, it \nmortgages our future by raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds. And now it will shortchange key investments in education, health \ncare, and homeland security. I predict--and I will come to the floor \nnext week and apologize if I am wrong--that the appropriations bills \nthat will be brought up by the Republican side to be added to the \ncontinuing resolution for this year will have cuts in education \ncompared to what the Appropriations Committee approved last summer. I \npredict that there will be cuts in education.\n  Quite frankly, in the budget for this year that the President sent up \nfor fiscal year 2003, he actually proposed cutting funding for Leave No \nChild Behind. Secretary Paige was on television today saying that was \nwrong. Next time I see Secretary Paige, next time he comes before our \ncommittee for a hearing, I am going to get the White House's own budget \nbook and lay out the programs for Leave No Child Behind and show him \nwhat the President's budget was. There was a cut of $90 million in the \nBush budget this year for the Leave No Child Behind programs. Why? So \nwe can pay for all these tax cuts for the wealthiest in our society.\n  Trickle-down economics. We need to get a prescription drug benefit \nthrough for the elderly, but there will not be any money for it. Why? \nBecause we are going to have a tax benefit, doing away with taxes on \ndividends, which benefit the wealthiest 5 percent. We will not have any \nmoney left for prescription drug coverage. So we have to change course. \nWe cannot blindly follow the captain in his misguided economic policies \nfor America. We must stimulate job growth now and it must not come at \nthe expense of Social Security.\n  I think the following elements should be addressed and should be \npassed to get our economy going. First, extend the unemployment \ninsurance benefits. We need to do that now. We have considerable \nreserves and now those facing long-term unemployment need help. Of \ncourse, if they get that money, they spend it quickly and it helps the \neconomy. Now, we did pass an extension this week that is short, but we \nneed to do more.\n  Secondly, we need to provide fiscal relief for the State. States all \nacross the country, including my own, are facing huge deficits that \nthey have to eliminate under their State constitutions. That means \nthere are going to be big cuts in crucial services--often health care \nfor the poor or the working poor, education for our children, housing, \nhelp for the homeless, things that States have to spend a lot of money \non.\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\nWell, they will not have it. So we are going to need to step in to \nprovide these crucial services.\n  Third, we need to quickly put people back to work on things we need. \nI have been trying for years to get the Congress to address the need of \nrebuilding and modernizing schools all over America. We did succeed in \ngetting a billion dollars into that program in the last Clinton budget \nfor 2001. The results of that are now coming in from States all over \nAmerica. That money was used to rebuild and modernize schools all over \nAmerica.\n  Our experience in Iowa--I can only speak about that because that is \nall I have the data for right now--was that for every dollar that we \nput into rebuilding and modernizing schools in Iowa, it translated into \nwell over $20 of economic activity. It put people to work, it got money \ninto the economy, and guess what we got out of it. We got new schools, \nnew classrooms, better equipped classrooms for our teachers to teach \nin.\n  There are many projects in this country that are truly needed. We can \nhave people working on these within months. I was told when they were \nusing this money to build a new school in Iowa with this money that not \nonly did it put people to work immediately, but the whole chain--\neverything from the electricians ordering electrical parts, lights and \nwiring, to those who put in the wallboard, ordering that, and the \nlumber and the tile and everything that goes into that. As one small \nrestaurant owner told me, for the year and a half they were building \nthe school, he even had people come in there buying lunches, so it even \nhelped that local economy. This is what we need to do to get people \nback to work right away.\n  Fourth, we need to pass a short-term middle-class tax cut that will \nimprove our short-term economy without further harming our long-term \nfiscal health. I say that we should consider a short-term payroll tax \nholiday, paid through the general fund, that will put money in the \nhands of people more likely to spend it right now. If we had a payroll-\ntax holiday, people could get their money directly through the regular \npayroll checks, that will speed up its delivery and the likelihood that \nit will be spent now.\n  We need to stimulate the economy right now and this would help \nworking people left out of the tax rebates in 2001.\n  Fifth, we must cut wasteful spending and close tax loopholes. I have \noutlined a series of cuts in Government spending that would do that. I \nsay to my friends on the other side that we can have a significant \nstimulus package and we can take care of the unemployed, provide tax \nrelief for middle-class families for this year, and reduce the size of \nGovernment at the same time.\n  One of the first things we have to do is have competitive bidding in \nMedicare. Now, we have cut down the waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare \nover the past 10 years. It has gone from $20-some billion a year to \naround $11 billion or $12 billion. We have a ways to go. But the one \nthing that would save money right now and cut wasteful spending would \nbe good old-fashioned competitive bidding in Medicare. We ought to do \nit and we ought to do it soon.\n  I believe that the stimulus package should entirely be in the \npeople's hands this year. The cost should not exceed $100 billion. And, \nthat it could be more than fully paid for over the course of ten years \nthrough the implementation of reductions in spending by things like \nrequiring competitive bidding on durable medical equipment and by \neliminating the tax rate cut that only goes to the one percent of those \nwith the highest incomes, averaging over a million dollars a year. We \nalso need to eliminate allowing Benedict Arnold companies and \nindividuals that make their home overseas in order to escape paying \ntheir fair share of taxes.\n  Well, this, I believe, is the course of action we ought to take and \nnot continue on the disastrous course we were set upon 2 years ago. And \nnow we are asked to make it even worse with the new President Bush \nproposing tax relief for the wealthy. We need a strategy that adheres \nto these good principles: benefit working and middle-class families, \nfocus on job creation, restore fiscal discipline. In short, America's \nnew economic strategy must take into account the economic realities, \nnot failed trickle-down theories or cynical political strategies purely \nfor election purposes.\n  When it comes to the economy, I will paraphrase President Bush in his \nacceptance speech at the Republican National Convention almost 3 years \nago: You have had your chance. You have not led. We will. That is what \nwe need to do.\n  President Bush's response was to make permanent the 2001 tax \nwindfalls which will blow a hole in the budget to endanger Social \nSecurity. Add to that another windfall tax benefit to the wealthiest in \nour country. By every measure, it is the wrong course for America. It \nwill just ensure the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the \nmiddle class gets stuck with paying both of the bills. It is time for a \nnew direction. I am hopeful that in the Senate we can have a real \ndebate over the best economic policies for the future of our country.\n\n  When it comes to the economy, the President reminds me of the guy who \nis lost driving but he refuses to pull over and get directions. He just \nkeeps going down the same roads over and over. Mr. President, it is \neither time to pull over and get directions or let someone else drive \nbecause it is obvious, Mr. President, you and your economic team are \nlost. It is time to return to policies we know work: Balanced budgets, \ntax cuts for working families, investment in education and health care, \nnot failed trickle-down economics.\n  Let's start the debate. Let's have the debate, but more than the \ndebate, let's have the votes in the Senate. We can no longer afford to \ndelay. We have to step up to the plate and change our course. We are \nnow in the midst of a serious economic and fiscal predicament. We have \nto make some adjustments, some course corrections. We cannot cling \ndogmatically and rigidly to the same old policies that did not work \nbefore, are failing us now, and will jeopardize the future of Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Again, let's have the debate but, more importantly, let's have the \nvotes to change the economic course in our country so that our middle-\nclass families are the ones who benefit. Let's end the class warfare \ndeclared on the middle class by this President and his failed economic \npolicies. Let's recognize that we are all in this together, and the \nbest way to keep that ladder of opportunity there so people, yes, on \nthe bottom can become middle class and, yes, those in the middle class \ncan become rich is to change the failed economic policies of this \nadministration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. REED. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Rhode Island speaks for up to 10 minutes, the Senator from \nNew York then be recognized for 10 minutes, and then I be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the American economy is in serious distress \nand thousands of families across America are suffering. When President \nBush took office in January 2001, the unemployment rate was 4.2 \npercent. In November of 2002, the unemployment rate was 6.0 percent; \n2.2 million more Americans were out of work than when President Bush \ntook office in January of 2001.\n  The economy is not growing fast enough to generate the jobs that \ncontinue to employ millions of Americans. Labor market conditions are \nnot improving. In fact, tomorrow the Bureau of Labor Statistics will \nreport on employment statistics in December, and they are likely to be \nunchanged from November, roughly 6 percent unemployment in the United \nStates.\n  This is an extremely disappointing economic record, and the Bush \nadministration is refusing to take prompt and responsible action to put \nAmericans back to work.\n  Increasingly, we hear the Republicans trying to deflect this \nsituation by claiming this is the Clinton recession, but the National \nBureau of Economic Research, which is recognized as\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\nthe authority on these matters, indicated that the recession began in \nMarch 2001, months after President Clinton left office, several months \nafter President Bush assumed responsibility for economic policy.\n  Indeed, in the last full month of the Clinton administration, the \nunemployment rate was 4.0 percent. In the last full quarter of the \nClinton administration, the economy was still growing. More to the \npoint, rather than assessing responsibility, a President of the United \nStates, regardless of responsibility, has to act on behalf of the \nAmerican people, and we are still waiting for prompt and effective \naction from President Bush to remedy the ills of this economy.\n  What has the President proposed to get us moving again? He is \nproposing, as the centerpiece of his plan, a massive elimination of \ntaxation on dividends, which has several problems.\n  First, it would have no immediate stimulative effect on the economy.\n  Second, it is grossly unfair. It will accrue to taxpayers with very \nhigh incomes and provide little or no benefit to the majority of \ntaxpayers, including most seniors, and it significantly erodes long-\nterm budget discipline, which has been the foundation of economic \ngrowth in this country since the Clinton administration.\n  When we began debating a stimulus package over a year ago--because \neven then we recognized the economy was foundering--the four leaders of \nthe House and Senate Budget Committees on a bipartisan basis \nestablished principles for any effective stimulus package. The \nCongressional Budget Office used similar principles in a report in \nJanuary of 2002 evaluating proposed changes in tax policy aimed at \nproviding stimulus.\n  The President's dividend proposal, when measured by these bipartisan \nprinciples, fails dramatically.\n  First, a tax cut is most effective as stimulus when it puts money \ninto the hands of the people who will spend that money almost \nimmediately, but based on the administration's own theories, only $20 \nbillion of the projected direct cost of $364 billion over 10 years will \nbe spent in the first year. A small fraction of the ultimate cost of \nthis tax plan will be available to be spent in the near term. That is \nwhen we need stimulus. That is what a stimulus package is all about.\n  Second, the dividend proposal is particularly poorly targeted as \nstimulus. Most families have little or no direct ownership in stock. \nThey have pension plans, they have Keogh plans, they have retirement \naccounts, but the majority of direct ownership of stock is concentrated \nin the hands of very wealthy individuals, higher income households that \nare more likely to save the money than to immediately engage in \nconsumption, to increase demand, to get the economy moving.\n  As I mentioned before, a stimulus by its very nature should provide \nimmediate effects, but even the $20 billion in projected stimulus for \n2003 is not really stimulus because taxpayers will have to wait until \nthey file their returns next year until they actually see this money in \ntheir hands.\n  Stimulus should not undermine long-term economic discipline. We found \nout through the policies of the Clinton administration that sound \nfiscal policy in Washington, leading ultimately to a surplus, was the \nfoundation for economic expansion, the longest running economic \nexpansion in the history of this country. We are in grave danger of \nlosing that economic discipline, of seeing interest rates begin to \nclimb and choke off growth.\n  For all these reasons, the President's proposal, particularly his \ncenterpiece, the dividend proposal, is bad economic policy.\n  Some have said these criticisms are just an exercise in class \nwarfare. Let me tell my colleagues the facts. Under the President's \nproposal, the 226,000 tax filers with more than $1 million of income--\nabout .2 percent of tax filers--will receive an average tax cut of \nalmost $90,000. A third to a half of that will come simply from this \ndividend proposal.\n  In contrast, the 109 million taxpayers with incomes under $75,000--\nthe middle and working class Americans, 82 percent of taxpayers--will \nreceive an average tax cut of $273. Let me once again suggest the \ndimensions here: 226,000 upper-income tax filers versus 109 million \nmiddle-class and working-class tax filers. The 226,000 receive $90,000 \non average; the 109 million--the rest of us--receive about $273. Now, \nnearly a quarter of elderly taxpayers will be left out of this bounty. \nNearly half the heads of households with children will be left out of \nthe benefit.\n\n  I have concentrated on the bad economic policy associated with this \nproposal. But it is also terrible budgetary policy. Even without the \nPresident's new proposal, we have seen a stunning decline in our fiscal \nsituation. In January of 2001, we were looking at a projected surplus \nover 10 years of $5.6 trillion. In fact, we were shopping around--not \nreally ``we,'' the Republicans--were shopping around for tax cuts \nbecause they said we will have too much surplus and we will not be able \nto conduct debt operations of the United States. We will have too much \nsurplus, and we will not be able to find investments for all this \nmoney. In a little over 2 years, we have seen those surpluses \ndisappear.\n  Still, we have educational issues we have to fund and health care \nissues. Ask the average American what they are most concerned about, \nthe first concern is health care. Can I get it? If I am a business man \nor woman, can I afford to give it to my employees. Second issue, can we \nmaintain education? That is not just an issue for families but for \nStates and localities. They are suffering under tremendous budget \npressure. Their two biggest items of expense are health care and \neducation.\n  And we have the challenges of international affairs and of homeland \ndefense. All of these proposals require expenditures that cannot be \nignored or deferred. And the President proposes further to weaken our \nfiscal balance, our fiscal foundation.\n  And there is another issue. We are within a decade of the baby boom \ngeneration reaching retirement age, a huge demographic tidal wave. Will \nwe be prepared for it? Will we have the resources to take care of \nMedicare and Social Security? Not if we cut taxes as dramatically and \nas inefficiently and inappropriately as the President has asked.\n  Now, there is an alternative to the President's proposal. That is a \nproposal that Democrats in both the Senate and House have advocated. \nThe plans differ but they are consistent in many respects. They want to \ngive tax benefits to middle and working class Americans. They want to \nmake sure these benefits are immediate. They can be spent now to \nstimulate the economy and get them going forward. And they are crafted \nin such a way we do not jeopardize any further our fiscal discipline \nhere in the United States. These are the proposals we should enact. I \nhope we do.\n  Let me conclude by summarizing a major concern I have. We will, in \nthe weeks ahead, debate this issue of stimulus and growth. We will take \nvotes on stimulus and growth. We will try to adopt economic policy. But \nfor me, the real issue is not whether we reduce taxes, the real issue \nfor me is whether we are going to have a Social Security system for \nAmericans of this generation, of my generation, and of future \ngenerations.\n  This chart is illustrative. Where is all the money coming from in the \nPresident's proposal, $933 billion? That is not just a direct tax \nbenefit, that is all the interest over 10 years that we will have to \npay because of this deficit. Where does it come from? It comes from the \nSocial Security system. I fear that if we enact the President's \nproposal, within months the President will simply say we can no longer \nafford Social Security. We have such a large deficit now we have to \nabandon the system.\n  I hope all my colleagues and the American people pay attention to the \nvotes in the next several weeks. They are not about growth and stimulus \nbut about whether we will have a Social Security system, whether we \nwill have an adequate Medicare system, whether we will keep our promise \nover 60 more years to the people of America.\n  These are daunting times. We need policies that will work, that will \nbe fair, and that will leave us stronger rather than weaker. I hope we \nadopt these policies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Rhode \nIsland;\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\nhe has done a superb job in his leadership of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, following the economic trends and keeping track of all of \nthe evidence that supports the remarks he has completed.\n  I join the Senator and my other colleagues in sharing some of my own \nthoughts on this latest tax proposal outlined by the President. I will \nbe sure not to call it a stimulus package because it is not. In fact, \nas I understand it, the President and his staff have recently been \ncareful not to describe it as one either. Yet, again, the \nadministration has opted to use our stumbling economy to stimulate \nbudget-busting tax cuts, rather than to use common sense to stimulate \nthe stumbling economy.\n  There is a conventional wisdom developing in Washington. One can \nalmost see it and one can certainly hear it as it emerges from the \npages of our national newspapers and our television talk shows. That \nconventional wisdom proclaims the boldness of President Bush's economic \nstrategy. ``In for a dime, in for a dollar,'' says one of our \ncolleagues. ``Big steps get more followers,'' says a White House \nofficial.\n  I am relatively new to the Senate but not to the work of public \nservice. So I do have a healthy respect for conventional wisdom and the \npower that it has over how people think and even act about the issues. \nI also know enough to be weary of marching in lock step with the latest \nline. Far too often, what we collectively say and think today is proven \nto be wrong tomorrow.\n  I will not deny that the President's plan is, as conventional wisdom \nholds, bold. I looked up the meaning of that word. There is nothing \nthat equates ``bold'' with ``good'' or ``bold'' with ``right.'' We \nshould not assume that the solution to our deficits or to our faltering \neconomy is to in some way take bold action, even if it is wrong. We \nought to be looking for the right action that will bring about the \nresults that all agree are in our country's best interests.\n  Winston Churchill once said: Never in the field of human conflict \nhave so few given so much to so many. The Bush economic plan turns that \nsaying on its head: Never in the field of economics have so few been \ngiven so much at the expense of so many.\n  What is this really all about? I believe fundamentally it is a \nquestion of values. What do we as Americans value? Every discussion we \nmake about our own private money or that we make as a society about tax \nor spending decisions is at bottom a decision about values. People who \nlive for today because they will not plan for tomorrow are \ndemonstrating their values. They are not willing to put away and save. \nThey think somehow it will rain from heaven. We look at them and say \nthey are irresponsible.\n  Here, when we look at the tax decisions proposed by this \nadministration, we have to ask ourselves, What are the values that are \nembedded in these proposals? I believe when it comes down to a choice \nabout values, the American people expect us to be making choices that \nreflect their values.\n  During the 1990s, we saw the creation of over 22 million new jobs. \nThat reflected our value of work and the belief that a good job is by \nfar the best kind of outcome for any economic or social policy.\n  Over the last 2 years, we have seen what is called negative job \ngrowth. That means that people are losing jobs and are not able to find \nthem. During the 1990s, real median family income grew by over $6,000 \nwith double-digit income growth for all income brackets, and \nunemployment and welfare rolls hit their lowest level in 30 years. We \nended the 1990s with the largest surplus and 3-year debt paydown in \nAmerican history. Those reflected solid American values: Pay as you go; \nlive within your means, the kind of values with which I was raised, the \nkind of values I think made America a very great nation.\n  We are at this turning point. I think someone has to say that a \nstrategy of ``in for a dime, in for a dollar'' is not the strategy for \nour Nation.\n  Many Americans are counting their pennies. They are worried about \nwhere their next dollar is coming from. They should not feel the values \nthey hold dear are being abrogated by irresponsible economic decisions \nmade by their Government. Someone needs to point out that it is hard to \nbe in for a dime and in for a dollar when what you are really doing is \npassing the buck.\n  We are passing the buck right to our States and our cities. We are \nforcing them to make the hard decisions we are avoiding. Looking at a \nState such as New York, we are facing drastic cutbacks. When I talk \nabout the services that will be cut, I am not talking about luxuries. I \nam talking about taking police off the street. I am talking about \nclosing fire houses. I am talking about increasing tuition so much that \nsome kids are going to have to drop out of college because they and \ntheir families will not be able to afford for them to stay.\n  As we look at what the States and cities of our country are laboring \nunder, how can we in good conscience turn our backs on them? How can we \ncontinue to talk about enormous tax cuts that will not stimulate \nanything except red ink, when we are on the brink of facing perhaps \nmilitary actions that will require billions upon billions of our \ndollars?\n  Our Governor in New York recently announced that the $2 billion \ndeficit we face this year could grow to $10 billion next year. The \nPresident's tax package basically says: That is your problem, New York; \nnot ours. In all of the counties throughout New York, as in States \naround the country, every dime of property tax raised in the counties \nof New York may very well end up going to pay for the Medicaid bills \nthat we have.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, States have to balance their budgets. \nThey cannot just have a gigantic credit card that runs up the costs and \ndoes not really worry about tomorrow. Our States need help. That is one \nof the reasons why last year I fought for some assistance with the \nFederal Medicaid matches amounts and today I will again join Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Collins in introducing a similar proposal that \nwould bring an additional $20 billion in fiscal relief to States, \nincluding $2.6 billion for New York.\n  Those are all stopgap measures, because if the President's proposal \nis enacted, it will have a dramatic ripple effect through the States, \nbecause most States tie their tax systems to the Federal system so when \na change is made in Washington, where some kind of tax is cut, one can \ncount on revenues being taken away from the States.\n  The President's package was advertised as costing about $674 billion. \nThe truer cost is closer to $900 billion and we are still trying to \ncalculate the real cost.\n  I am not going to, as some of my colleagues have, talk about the \nunfairness of the way this tax is configured. I think that pretty much \nspeaks for itself. But I want to say a word about deficits.\n  I realize there is a new economic team in town and the President's \nadvisers do not think budget deficits are much of a problem. I have to \nrespectfully disagree. I cannot understand how a tax cut that pushes us \ndeeper into long-term debt and raises our current budget deficit is not \na values choice. We are choosing to go into debt instead of providing \nhelp for the States. We are choosing to run up the deficit and \ntherefore we cannot keep our promises to our children and our schools \nabout funding the education reform we voted for.\n  Where will we, for example, come up with the money for the promised \nprescription drug benefit? Where will we come up with the money to keep \nthe lights and the heat on in homes that rely on the low income heating \nenergy program? I do not understand how these are the choices that \nreflect the values of the vast majority of Americans, and today I raise \nthese issues.\n\n  I do not think we should shy away in this Chamber from saying that, \nyes, the proposal may be bold and it may be big but it is boldly wrong. \nIt takes big steps in exactly the wrong direction from where our \ncountry should be headed. We will talk day after day about the real \nchoices, trying to illustrate and contrast the value systems that \nunderlie the economic policies chosen by this administration compared \nto those that were chosen by the previous administration, because it is \nimperative that the American public understands this is not just about \nphoto ops. It is not just about speeches and rhetoric. It is not even \njust about charts. It is about the future of this\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\ncountry and it is about the billions of individual choices that \nAmericans will be able to make as they seek to demonstrate their own \nresponsible life choices, as they seek to acquire greater opportunity \nfor themselves and their children, and as they seek to contribute to \nmaking our country richer, safer, stronger, and smarter in the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S112-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S112-S113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we begin the 108th Congress, I want to \ntalk about the situation in Iraq and our response to it, because I \nbelieve there may be a fundamental misunderstanding as to the process \nthat is underway to bring about Iraq's disarmament. Pursuant to U.N. \nresolution 1441, the U.N. Inspection Commission and the International \nAtomic Energy Agency are to provide updates to the U.N. on the results \nof their inspections to date. These updates are intended to be interim \nreports, not final conclusions. I think we all, particularly the \nadministration and the press, need to be very aware of that fact.\n  The January 27 report will only be one of a number of such reports \nthat will be presented to the Security Council over the weeks and \nmonths to come. It is not a determining date on the issue of whether or \nnot Iraq has materially breached U.N. resolution 1441, or whether we \nwill use force against Iraq. We are not in the fourth quarter of some \nfootball game. In fact, we have just begun to share a small quantity of \nthe large amount of information that we have relative to Iraqi suspect \nsites.\n  Let us look at the events that led up to the unanimous decision by \nthe United Nations Security Council on November 8 of last year to set \nup an enhanced inspection regime to afford Iraq an opportunity to \ncomply with its disarmament obligations. Iraq, as we all remember, \ninvaded Kuwait on August 1, 1990. After numerous demands and \ndiplomatic, economic, and political action by the international \ncommunity, on November 29, 1990, almost 4 months after the attack, the \nU.N. authorized member states ``to use all necessary means'' to \nliberate Kuwait.\n  Iraq's defeat at the hands of a United States-led coalition in 1991 \nwas followed by a U.N. Security Council resolution in April 1991 that \nestablished a number of conditions for a cease fire, notably including \na demand for the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nprograms, and Iraq accepted that resolution.\n  In the intervening years, Iraq repeatedly obstructed and failed to \ncooperate with the weapons inspectors of the United Nations and of the \natomic energy agency that were charged with the responsibility of \ndisarming Iraq.\n  With this historical background, the Security Council adopted \nresolution 1441 on November 8 of last year to set up an enhanced \ninspection regime. Under resolution 1441, Iraq is required to provide \nthe United Nations inspectors and the IAEA ``immediate, unimpeded, \nunconditional, and unrestricted access to any and all areas, including \nunderground areas, facilities, buildings, equipment, records and means \nof transport which they wish to inspect, as well immediate, unimpeded, \nunrestricted, and private access to all officials and other persons \nwhom the inspectors of the IAEA wish to interview,'' and that includes \noutside of Iraq. Resolution 1441 also requires Iraq to provide a \ncomplete, accurate, and full declaration of all aspects of its weapons \nof mass destruction and delivery systems programs.\n  In order to assist the U.N. Security Council in its oversight of \nimplementation of Iraq's disarmament, resolution 1441 set out a time \nline of events. Using November 8, 2000, the date the U.N. Security \nCouncil adopted resolution 1441, Iraq was required to accept the \nresolution within 7 days. It did so. Iraq was required to provide a \nfull declaration of weapons of mass destruction within 30 days of \nNovember 8. It said that its declaration was a full one and it did it \non the 29th day.\n\n  The inspectors were to start within 45 days of November 8; the \ninspections began on November 25th.\n  The inspectors were to provide an update on their inspections to the \nSecurity Council within 60 days of the date that the inspections \ncommenced. They have announced their intention to provide these first \ninterim progress reports on January 27, within that time limit.\n  The inspection process was begun with reasonable speed. The \ninspectors have already inspected a Presidential palace that had \nheretofore been subject to special rules, and they are inspecting on \nweekends and holidays. Their principal job right now is to establish a \nbaseline for future inspections and testing Iraq's willingness to \ncooperate. This is the key, the inspection process is at its beginning. \nAs of the end of December, virtually all of the arms inspections had \ntaken place in the Baghdad area as the U.N. inspectors only had one of \nits eight helicopters in Iraq and had just opened a headquarters in \nMosul in northern Iraq.\n  Again and most significantly, the United States and other nations \nwith sophisticated intelligence capabilities have only just begun to \nshare intelligence with the arms inspectors and are proceeding \ncautiously in light of the reported Iraqi infiltration of the \ninspectors during the 1990s. In fact, today's Washington Post reports \nthat Secretary of State Powell stated in an interview yesterday that \nthe administration was holding back much of the information in its \npossession, waiting to see if the inspectors ``are able to handle and \nexploit'' the information that we did give them.\n  The inspection process is estimated to take months, not weeks, and \nthis timetable was understood by the Security Council from its \ninception. That is why the U.N. resolution refers to the January 27th \nreports from the inspectors as ``updates,'' and that is why January 27 \nis not a deadline for deciding whether to use force.\n  British Foreign Secretary Straw noted on December 19, with respect to \nthe declaration filed by Iraq on its weapons of mass destruction and \ndelivery systems: that [``What we've got today is a further step in a \nvery calm and deliberate process to try by every means possible to get \nIraq to comply with its international obligations peacefully and \ntherefore and thereby to resolve this crisis in a peaceful manner.'']\n  In an interview at Crawford, TX, on December 31, President Bush \nseemed to agree with the British Secretary when he stated that he hoped \nthe Iraqi situation will be resolved peacefully. And in answer to a \nreporter's question, President Bush said: ``You said we're headed to \nwar in Iraq--I don't know why you say that. I hope we're not headed to \nwar in Iraq.'' On that same day, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said \n``Obviously they [the inspectors] are carrying out their work and in \nthe meantime Iraq is cooperating and they are able to do their work in \nan unimpeded manner, therefore I don't see an argument for a military \naction now.'' And, in a press conference at the Pentagon just \nyesterday, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said ``I don't know why anyone \nwould use the word 'inevitable.' It clearly is not inevitable.''\n  The arms inspections in Iraq are at an early stage. The United States \nhas just begun to provide information to the inspectors about suspect \nsites. Barring a dramatic development, the interim progress reports \nthat the inspectors will make to the U.N. Security Council on January \n27 will only be one of a number of such reports that will be presented \nto the council over the months to come.\n\n  Earlier today, Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, at a \npress conference at the United Nations stated ``We will provide an \nupdate report on the 27th of this month. However, that report, we \nshould emphasize, is an update report, it is not a final report. It's a \nwork in progress. And this simply would register where we are on the \n27th of January, but we obviously continue to we'll our work afterward, \nand we still have a lot of work to do.''\n  In the absence of the U.N. inspectors finding that Iraq currently \npossesses or is developing weapons of mass destruction or that Iraq is \nnot cooperating with the inspections, we need to give\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nthe inspectors the needed time to complete their work. In the meantime, \nwe need to provide targeted intelligence to inspectors to facilitate \ntheir effort, without disclosing sources and methods, of course. That \nis our best chance of bringing about Iraq's voluntary disarmament or, \nfailing that, obtaining broad international backing, including U.N. \nauthorization for a multilateral effort to forcibly disarm Iraq.\n  If we prejudge the outcome of the inspections or if we don't furnish \nthe arms inspectors with targeted intelligence, we will not be able to \nobtain the international support, as represented by U.N. authorization \nfor the use of force, that is so highly desirable and advantageous to \nus. Forcibly disarming Iraq without international support would be \nperceived as a unilateral attack by the United States and a few allies. \nInternational support is critical to reducing the short-term risks, \nsuch as a loss of regional cooperation with resulting increased \nprobability of U.S. casualties and reduced likelihood of international \ncontributions in a postconflict environment.\n  International support is also important to reducing long-term risks, \nsuch as a loss of international cooperation in connection with the war \nagainst al-Qaida, and increased probability of terrorist attacks \nagainst us.\n  In summary, January 27 is the first interim report. It is not D-Day, \ndecision day, as to whether to attack Iraq. We must not prejudge the \noutcome of the very inspection process that we worked so hard to put in \nplace as being highly relevant to the question of whether we launch \nattack on Iraq. We must share all the information we can on suspect \nsites. And finally, if we don't share our information with the U.N. \ninspectors, or if we prejudge the outcome of these inspections, we will \nincrease the likelihood that we will go to war and increase the risks, \nshort term and long term, to our troops and our Nation in doing so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the beginning of the 108th Congress marks \na pivotal moment in the management of one of the most complex water \nsystems in the world. Complex both hydrologically and legally, the \nriver is managed through a series of agreements that are collectively \nknown as the ``law of the river.'' and it is the ``law of the river'' \nthat brings me to the floor today.\n  For years, the State of California has consumed far more than its \nannual allocation of 4.4 million acre-feet of water from the Colorado \nRiver. Instead, the State has pursued a path of overuse--often drawing \nmore than 1 million acre-feet of water a year over its allocation. With \nthe turn of the new year, and just as Colorado enters the fourth year \nof the most severe drought in 300 years, I am pleased that Secretary \nNorton and the Department of the Interior have taken strong action to \nforce California into compliance with the decades-old agreements that \ndictate the amount of water that the State is entitled to consume, \nthereby ending its abuse of the river. This watershed decision to \nenforce the 4.4 million acre-feet allocation reveals a welcome \ndetermination to ensure confidence in the law through decisive action, \ndemonstrating to all parties that abuse of the ``law of the river'' \nwill not be tolerated.\n  ``The law of the river'' has evolved over 80 hard fought years; every \nprecious drop of the river means life or death to the people of the \nbasin States. Secretary Norton has now made it clear that every party \nto the compact will be held accountable, and that these agreements will \nstand as precious as the water itself. No longer will States be able to \nignore the ``law of the river.''\n  In Colorado, our citizens must abide by the doctrine of prior \nappropriations. Other States govern water under a hybrid or riparian \nrights system. These time-tested theories have one constant principle--\na user cannot take more water than its legal share. This strong \nsentiment is reflected in a recent Denver Post editorial that I would \nlike to share with you today. I ask unanimous consent that the article \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLARD. California has had ample opportunity to meet its legal \nobligation; agreements outlining baby steps toward compliance with the \n4.4 limit have been in existence since the 1990's. Even though the \nState has consumed far more than its fair share for years, it has had \nplenty of opportunity to live within its allocation. Yet in the end, \nwith the water shutoff, I hope California will recognize its legal \nobligations.\n  To Secretary Norton and my colleagues from the basin States, I urge \nyou to continue to force all members to abide by their allocation and \nto protect the law. Secretary Norton's fair action has demonstrated \nthat this administration will uphold the ``law of the river,'' and when \nthe law is not adhered to, those in violation will be held accountable.\n  I have remained in close contact with Colorado Governor Bill Owens \nthroughout the ordeal, and would like to share with you an insightful \ncomment made by the Governor in a conversation we had shortly after the \ndecision to shut off the water was announced Governor Owens said, ``In \nthe West, our word is our bond. As Colorado suffers from the worst \ndrought in its history, we cannot and will not support so-called \n`surplus' water deliveries to California, unless California keeps its \nword to us.'' I certainly agree.\n  I commend the Secretary for her action, and hope this will serve as a \nclarion call that the law of the river is indeed a law that must be \nobeyed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Denver Post, January 4, 2003]\n\n                          The Law of the River\n\n       Nevada shouldn't be surprised. Two weeks ago, U.S. Interior \n     Secretary Gale Norton said California couldn't take more than \n     its legal share of Colorado River water. This week, she told \n     Nevada the same thing. Her actions were proper. All seven \n     states that share the river and tributaries must abide by the \n     Colorado River Interstate Compact, the 80-year-old agreement \n     known as ``the law of the river.''\n       California hogs 5.2 million acre-feet of river water a \n     year, far more than its legal share of 4.4 million acre-feet.\n       But Nevada has been slurping more than its share, too. The \n     pact entitles Nevada to 300,000 acre-feet annually, but it \n     uses an extra 37,00 acre-feet a year, or 11 percent over its \n     legal share.\n       California had wanted Norton to declare a surplus of water \n     in the Colorado River, thus letting it continue using more \n     than its legal allotment. But such a declaration would have \n     been absurd during an ongoing, record-breaking drought.\n       After telling California ``no,'' Norton had to apply the \n     same standard to other states. Although Nevada's excess water \n     use is a drop in the bucket compared to California's wastrel \n     ways, Nevada also must follow the law of the river.\n       Colorado doesn't use its entire share of river water, \n     however. The river flows on the Western Slope, but our \n     population lives mostly on the Front Range. The dispute is \n     over preserving Colorado water rights for future generations.\n       Colorado is supposed to get 51.75 percent of the river's \n     water. The interstate pact assumed the Colorado River would, \n     on average, flow 7.5 million acre-feet a year. But the pact \n     was signed during an exceptionally wet era in the West, so it \n     overestimated how much water the river usually has. Still, \n     the optimistic scenario entitled Colorado to 3.85 million \n     acre-feet of river water in an average year.\n       In reality, the Colorado River averages about 6 million \n     acre-feet a year, allowing Colorado 3.1 million acre-feet \n     under the formula.\n       But Colorado consumes only 2.65 million acre-feet from the \n     river in a normal year. So, depending on how the river's \n     average flows are calculated, Colorado lets 500,000 to 1.2 \n     million acre-feet of its share flow out of state. Much of \n     that water supplies vegetable farms and fruit orchids in \n     California's agriculturally rich Imperial Valley.\n       To recapture its lost water, Colorado leaders have floated \n     ideas to build new dams or pump thousands of acre-feet from \n     the Utah\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\n     line to metro Denver. But any of the plans would cost \n     billions of dollars and create ecological woes.\n       If Colorado's population continues growing, our state \n     someday will claim its share of Colorado River water. When it \n     does, California and Nevada could rights demand that Colorado \n     and other upper-basin states--Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, and New \n     Mexico--follow the pact's strict limits, too.\n       The law of the river must be enforced, for everyone. And \n     water conservation must become a way of life in the West.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today as an alumnus of Ohio \nState University and a Senator filled with pride for our 2002 national \nchampions, the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n  I congratulate my home team and their outstanding coach, Jim Tressel, \non a spectacular win and the best season ever in the history of Ohio \nState University--14 wins and no losses. Throughout the season, the \nBuckeyes showed a remarkable spirit of determination, cooperation, and \nthe best teamwork that I have seen in a football team, frankly, during \nmy lifetime.\n  The Buckeyes have good people and a great leader who inspired his \nteam to do their best--as athletes and young men with character, \ndetermination, pride, and loyalty to each other and to their alumni.\n  On the night of the game, some of the sports pundits said that the \nother team had more talent than the Ohio State Buckeyes. But throughout \nthis season, we utilized our talent more fully than any other opponent.\n  The Buckeyes have that special ingredient--sticking together and \nworking together--a true symbiotic relationship. They understood that \nthe more they cooperated on behalf of the team as a whole the better \noff all of them would be. That is the spirit that shone through during \nthe whole season--unselfish determination and genuine teamwork. That is \nwhat it was about.\n  Their lesson is a good one for us in the Senate. It is the same kind \nof spirit that we are going to need on the floor of the Senate and in \nour country if we expect to win the war on terrorism and to become \nnational champions for our hard-working citizens who put their trust in \nus. We would all do well to emulate the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes. I \ncongratulate our 2002 national champions and again underscore that if \nwe can maintain the spirit they have of working together, teamwork, and \nbipartisanship, we are going to have an outstanding season here in the \n108th Congress.\n\n  I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion \nin recent days about the American economy. The President was in Chicago \nthe middle of this week and proposed a new plan talking about tax cuts \nin order to stimulate the economy. Others in the Democratic Caucus in \nthe Senate and the House have talked about various plans for tax cuts \nto stimulate the economy. While all this discussion about the economy \nis important, I wanted to mention something else that is happening in \nthe American economy that gets precious little attention.\n  There is an economic blight that is occurring in our country that is \nout of sight and therefore it is not very well understood by most \nAmericans. I want to talk about it for a moment.\n  In the last Congress, with Senator Chuck Hagel from Nebraska, I \nintroduced legislation called the New Homestead Economic Opportunity \nAct. I visited briefly yesterday with Senator Hagel and we are going to \nbe talking about reintroducing that legislation very soon in this \nCongress. I wanted to make a couple of comments about it and alert \ncolleagues that this legislation is something we are going to work very \nhard to try and get approved by this Senate.\n  There is a problem in this country with the economy. This is not a \nproblem about the American economy in its entirety. It is a problem \nabout the economy in the heartland of our country. This map shows the \nrural counties of high out-migration in the country, that is, counties \nin which people are moving out, not in; counties that are losing \npopulation.\n  If we draw an egg shape from North Dakota down to Texas in the middle \npart of our country, we have the heartland of America being \ndepopulated.\n  This is the heartland of America, which is North Dakota, South \nDakota, Nebraska, Kansas, right on down to Texas, including some States \non both sides. This is the part of the country that we populated a \ncentury and a half ago with something called the Homestead Act. My \ngreat-grandmother, named Caroline, with her six children--her husband \nhaving died, she was an immigrant widow from Norway--decided to move to \nthe prairies of North Dakota. She pitched a tent, built a house, \nstarted a farm, and raised a family. She had a son, who had a daughter, \nwho had me, and that is how I come from Hettinger County in North \nDakota.\n  A century and a half ago, we populated the middle part of our country \nthrough something called the Homestead Act, saying to people: move \nthere, build there, and create a family there. We will give you some \nfree land. It is called the Homestead Act. So they did. In covered \nwagons they came to the middle of our country. Now a century and a half \nlater, people are moving out in a relentless depopulation. In every one \nof these States--North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, \nWyoming--people are moving out of the rural counties. The percentage of \nout-migration is shown on this chart. In North Dakota, about 90 percent \nof the counties are losing population. I grew up in a county in \nsouthwestern North Dakota. My home county is bigger than the State of \nRhode Island. When I left there were 5,000 people who lived there. Now \nthere are 2,700 living there. In the year 2020 the demographers say \nthere will be 1,700 living in my home county, a county larger than the \nState of Rhode Island.\n\n  In this county, there is a town called New England, ND, a wonderful \nlittle community. Donna Dorman is the minister at the Lutheran Church \nin New England. She said that as a minister she presides over four \nfunerals for every wedding. Think of that: Four funerals she officiates \nat for every wedding. This is a Lutheran minister. What does that say \nabout the towns, where the population is getting older, people are \nmoving out, young couples that stay are not having children. It is the \nopposite of the movie ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' Four funerals \nper wedding. That is a description of what is happening up and down the \nmiddle part of the country with this steady depopulation.\n  Then we have people in other parts of the country who are trying to \nrecreate what we have in the middle: Great schools, good places to \nlive, safe neighborhoods, good places to raise children. They are \ntrying to recreate that in other population centers of the country.\n  We have people leaving the middle of America, in the heartland. The \nquestion is, What do we do about this? Can we do anything? William \nJennings Bryant said destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter \nof choice. It is not a thing to be waited for; destiny is a thing to be \nachieved.\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\n  The question is, What kind of an economy do we want in this country? \nDo we care about the heartland? Do we want to do something about the \ndepopulation of the heartland? When America's cities were in deep \ntrouble several decades ago, with the decay of America's cities and the \neconomic blight affecting America's metropolitan areas, guess what the \nCongress did. The Congress said, let us help; let us develop an urban \nrenewal program, a model cities program. And we did. We invested in \nAmerica's cities. And America's cities are doing well. We turned around \nthe major metropolitan areas of this country with programs deciding \nthat the cities are too good, too important, to be allowed to fail. So \nwe had model cities and urban renewal programs.\n  What about America's heartland? Is that important enough to save? Is \nit important enough to care about? Senator Hagel and I introduced a \npiece of legislation called the New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act. \nWe do not have land to give away to people who would come out and \nhomestead anymore. We did a century and a half ago. We gave them free \nland. We do not have land to give away. What we do have is tax and \nother financial incentives to offer to encourage people to stay there, \nto come there, to live there, to grow there, to build there, and to do \nbusiness there. We have the capability to say to them: If you are going \nto run a business in a rural county that has lost more than 10 percent \nof its population in the last 20 years, you may benefit from investment \ntax credits. You are a new student who has graduated from school and \nare employed in a high out-migration rural county, you will get some \nhelp paying off your college loans. There are tools we can develop and \nuse to do that.\n\n  Senator Hagel and I have written a piece of legislation that has now \nbeen joined by 10 other members of the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats, saying this country owes it to itself to save the heartland.\n  Let me describe why I think this is important to do. Some would say, \nwell, whatever is, is; whatever happens, happens, and do not pay too \nmuch mind to it. If for some reason the incentives for life in America \nin the year 2003 do not provide people some inertia or encouragement to \nsettle in Hettinger County, ND, that is just the way it is. I suppose \nyou could have said that a century and a half ago and we would not have \nthe wagon trains taking the pioneers out to go homestead. They did not \nsay it then. They said it is important to populate the heartland of our \ncountry for a number of reasons.\n  I will discuss the value system in rural America that nourishes and \nrefreshes the values of our country. I come from a wonderful State of \n640,000 people. I grew up myself in a very small town. There were 400 \npeople when I was living in that town. Now there are fewer than 300 \npeople in that same community. I graduated from a senior high school \nclass of nine students. In my State, in communities like that, there \nare wonderful people and they are great places in which to live. In my \nState, there is a small town called Sentinel Butte, ND. They have one \ngas station. The man and his wife who run the gas station are nearing \nretirement age and do not want to work all day long, so when they close \nthe gas station in early afternoon, they hang the key to the gas pumps \non a nail in the front door. If you want gas and they are not open, \ntake the key, unlock the pump, pump gas, and write your name on a \ntablet that is right below the key.\n  That is a value system that is important. It works in rural America. \nThere is a place called Marmarth. They have a hotel in Marmarth that is \na very small town but no one works at the hotel. If you need a bed, go \ntake a bed and get some rest. And there is a cigar box tacked on the \ninside of the door when you leave. When you are done sleeping at that \nhotel, when you leave, please put a little money in the cigar box.\n  Is that a big business? No. Is it important to Marmarth? Sure. In a \ntown called Tuttle, the grocery store closed. That little community \nunderstood you need to have a grocery store. No one would come in and \nbuild a grocery store. So the city government built it. The city \ncouncil decided we have to build a grocery store. And I was there the \nday they cut ribbons on the grocery store in Tuttle, ND. They blocked \noff Main Street and had the high school band play. What was that about? \nCutting the ribbon on a new grocery store in Tuttle, ND, that was \ndeveloped by the city council of Tuttle, ND.\n  In Havana, ND, they cannot keep a cafe open, unless they have people \nin town sign up for the time they are going to work for nothing to keep \nthe cafe open. When is it your turn to work in the cafe? That is the \nway the community keeps the cafe open.\n  All of these things represent a value system that I think is \nimportant to this country--wonderful small communities making do for \nthemselves, great places in which to live, great places in which to \nraise children, safe streets, good neighbors. We are going to lose all \nof that unless the Congress decides the heartland is worth saving. The \nNew Homestead Economic Opportunity Act is a piece of legislation \nSenator Hagel and I will reintroduce in the next couple of weeks. My \nhope is that Senators, Republicans and Democrats, up and down the \nheartland, will join us as cosponsors once again this year and that we \ncan work together creating tools by which these States, these counties, \nthese small cities that are losing population, can begin once again to \nbuild a future home and opportunity for themselves.\n  There are some who say, well, this is just the way things are, just a \nforce of life that is not going to change. People are moving from rural \nareas to the cities. My State is also an agricultural State with a lot \nof family farmers. I know there are some who look at that and say, Why \nwould someone farm? I suppose you have to live on a farm to understand \nthe values and the forces that make you believe it is a wonderful way \nof life.\n  I notice that there is a television network that is going to do a \nreality show which I read about yesterday--and shook my head once \nagain, as is so often the case with modern television shows. They are \nlooking for a poor farm family somewhere in this country. They are \ngoing to take that poor farm family, they said, and put them in a \nmansion in Beverly Hills and then do reality television to see how they \nreact, a poor farm family in a Beverly Hills mansion, kind of like \n``The Beverly Hillbillies.'' They are doing what I think they call \ntheir ``hick search'' now, looking for these people who would not fit \nin. Then they would send them out to a mansion in Beverly Hills so they \ncan do a television show and make fun of them. There is precious little \nto make fun of, in my judgment, about the value system of life on the \nfamily farm in this country. It is about struggling against the odds. \nIt is about perseverance, sometimes against hope, almost. It's about \ndeveloping survival skills.\n\n  These are people who put a seed in the ground and then have to pray \nand hope the seed comes up to a plant, so that it grows into a plant \nand perhaps it will rain, so it grows and perhaps it won't rain too \nmuch so it doesn't drown out, maybe the insects won't come in and eat \nit, maybe it won't get crop disease, maybe it won't hail, maybe you \nwon't get a windstorm that knocks the crop over. But, in any event, in \nthe fall when you have grown that seed into a crop, having put all your \nmoney into it in the spring to try to get the seed into the ground, \nthen if you are lucky enough to get a crop, then you have to hope that \nthe price is decent in August, September, October, because if you lost \nthe crop you lost everything, and if you get a crop and don't get a \nprice in the fall you have lost everything.\n  Those are the odds these farmers have faced, those who have elected \nto go to the prairies in the heartland of our country and begin to \nfarm. They produce America's food. But they do more than that. They \nproduce communities. They are a seedbed of values that, as I said, \nnourishes and refreshes the value system of our country.\n  My fervent hope is that we will find a way in this Congress to \nunderstand, just as we did in dealing with the blight of America's \ncities, that we have responsibility to deal with the relentless out-\nmigration that is crippling so many rural counties up and down the part \nof America's heartland that you see marked in red.\n  I think there is a tendency for some to think what is between \nCalifornia and New York is simply 6 hours in an\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nairplane seat. That, of course, is not the case at all. What is between \nCalifornia and New York is a wonderful part of America and a part of \nAmerica that we should care a great deal about, a part of America that \nis suffering a great deal at this point with the out-migration of \npeople. You see it in red on this map.\n  As we proceed, there will likely be things that are very partisan \nhere on the floor of the Senate, and perhaps properly should be because \nthe political parties come to this debate on a range of issues \nbelieving in different things--not different goals, but dramatically \ndifferent ways to achieve the same goal, in many cases. But my hope is \nthat even as we have those debates which can and perhaps will be \npartisan debates from time to time, there will be some issues on which \nRepublicans and Democrats can say: Sign us up together. This is not \nabout getting credit. It's not about forcing the other side to lose or \ndemanding that we win. It is about doing together that which needs to \nbe done for the preservation of this country, for the preserving of \nvalues in this country, and for the nourishing of hope for certain \npeople in this country who have lost hope, especially those living in \nthe heartland and living in circumstances where their neighbors have \nleft, their community is shrinking, family farmers are leaving.\n  We can do better than that. My hope is that we will find a bipartisan \nway in this Congress to decide this, too, is an urgent priority for our \ncountry and pass legislation of the type Senator Hagel and I will \nreintroduce once again, called the New Homestead Economic Opportunity \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I come with a sad heart today because on \nJanuary 3, the City of Fairbanks, where I started my life in Alaska, \nand the State of Alaska lost a great citizen with the passing of \nCaptain Jim Binkley at the age of 82.\n  Jim was born in our State in Wrangell, on May 16, 1920. His parents \nwere gold rush pioneers, and his father was a riverboat pilot on the \nStikine River in southeast Alaska.\n  In World War II, he was a veteran who served on riverboats in Alaska \nand after the war he attended the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. In \n1950, Jim and his wife Mary bought their first boat, the Godspeed, and \nbegan what would become Alaska Riverways, Incorporated. They ran a \nhistoric riverboat for tourists who came to Alaska.\n  Jim and Mary built and rebuilt many of their company's sternwheelers \nin the backyard of their family's home which was on Noyes Slough, which \nis a river that runs through Fairbanks, AK. It was a great experience \nto go with him on that boat. I have taken many people on Captain Jim's \nboat.\n  Alaska Riverways is Fairbanks' number one tourist attraction. Each \nsummer, Alaska Riverways' three sternwheelers, the Discovery (I), the \nDiscovery (II), and the Discovery (III), ferry thousands of tourists \ndown the Chena and Tanana Rivers, following trails to the gold rush \npeople and really letting people see what rural Alaska is like.\n  Along with being a successful riverboat captain, Jim served in the \nAlaska State House of Representatives for two terms from 1961 to 1964. \nIn addition to that service in the Alaska legislature, Captain Jim \nserved on numerous community boards and organizations. He received many \nstatewide awards, including being named ``Alaskan of Year'' and the \nbusiness leader of the year.\n  Jim was a proud father of three sons and daughter Marilee. I know all \nthree sons: Johne, Jim Jr., and Skip. They are all riverboat captains \nand they have continued the great tradition of their father, as have \nseveral of his grandchildren.\n  Captain Jim was clearly a leader in the development of Alaska tourism \nand of our State in general. His vision and hard work forever changed \nAlaska's visitor industry, and for that we are very grateful.\n  I am pleased to say I have asked that a flag be flown over the \nCapitol today so we may send it to his family, along with a copy of \nthis statement.\n  (At the request of Mr. Stevens, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak and honor \na great Alaskan, and long time family friend, Jim Binkley of Fairbanks.\n  Jim, one of the State's great riverboat captains, died last Friday \nafter a long and painful illness. I join all Alaskans in expressing my \ndeepest condolences to his family and all of his friends across the \nState.\n  Jim was born in Wrangell in southeast Alaska 82 years ago and was \nraised in California after his father's death. After high school, Jim \nmoved back to Wrangell and worked as a river guide with him uncle, \nlearning his craft on riverboats and gaining his love of the water. \nAfter a few years he moved to Fairbanks to attend the University of \nAlaska.\n  It was there during the long Fairbanks summers that he learned the \nways of interior rivers, working on steamboats, hauling supplies to \nEskimo and native villages along the Yukon River. While his schooling \nat the University was interrupted by a tour of duty in the U.S. \nmilitary during World War II, he returned to school in Fairbanks after \nthe war. There he met his future wife of 55 years, Mary Hall, and they \nwere married in June 1947.\n  In 1950, Jim and Mary were asked to run riverboat cruises in \nFairbanks by Alaska tourism pioneer Chuck West. Using the Episcopal \nChurch vessel, ``Godspeed'' they began offering tours of the Chena and \nTanana Rivers. As their business expanded, they needed a bigger boat. \nSo in 1955, Jim and Mary, along with their original partner Bill \nEnglish, built the first Riverboat Discovery in their backyard on the \nNoyes Slough in Fairbanks.\n  Over his 45 years in the riverboat business, Jim built two more \nboats, helping to launch the modern era of tourism in Alaska's \ninterior. But he launched much more for Alaska.\n  He helped create Alaskaland, Fairbanks' historic major municipal \npark. He was a founder of the Alaska Visitors Association and the \nFairbanks Convention and Visitors Bureau. And he showed his commitment \nto public service by serving two terms in the Alaska House of \nRepresentative in Juneau from 1961 through 1964.\n  He was also a pioneer in improving communications in Alaska, serving \non the boards of Alascom, Pacific Corp. and later Pacific Telecom, \nhelping switch telecommunications in Alaska from an era of Government-\ncontrolled long-distance phone service to the modern era of satellite \ncommunication that included the arrival of live television to all parts \nof the State.\n  He received numerous awards, including being named the Alaskan of the \nYear and the Business Leader of the Year.\n  While I have lived in Anchorage for the past 25 years, I can never \nforget sitting in my parents' backyard along the Chena River in \nFairbanks. You could almost tell time by when Captain Binkley would \npilot the Discovery past our house, always waving his warm welcome as \nwe tooted a fog horn in reply as the sternwheeler rounded the small \nbends heading for the junction with the Tanana.\n  Alaska has lost a great pioneer and an even greater leader. I want to \nexpress my deepest condolences to his wife, Mary, to his son Johne, \nhimself a former leading member of the Alaska Legislature, to his sons \nJim, Jr. and Skip and to all his grandchildren. All of Alaska mourns \nhis passing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis of acute importance to my State, the State of Pennsylvania, and, I \nargue, to the traveling public throughout the east coast, in \nparticular. That is the situation of US Airways and the problem that US \nAirways is encountering in reorganizing the company and trying to get \nthe government loan provided here by legislation enacted after \nSeptember 11. The Air Transportation Stabilization Board has set forth \ncriteria that US Airways must meet in order to secure that loan and \ncontinue to operate. They are under a relatively tight timeframe and \nhave to go to court next Thursday, I believe, to get the reorganization \nplan approved.\n  There are several issues out there, but the most important and major \nissue is the issue of the pension plan that US Airways has and the \nexpense associated with that, and in particular, the pilots' plan. US \nAirways has been working now for a better part of a year to work with \nthe union and within its management to find cost savings, money \ndictated by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, and they have \ndone an excellent job. I will say that the US Airways unions have done \nan outstanding job in working with management to try to get the company \nto be an efficient and lower cost airline to survive in these very \ndifficult times in the airline industry.\n  One of the most important aspects of the reorganization, as I \nmentioned before, was the rather significant pension liability and, in \nparticular, because of the higher salaries of pilots, the pilot pension \nprogram. US Airways has been negotiating with the pilots now for quite \nsome time, and within the last month or so came up with an agreement to \nrestructure the plan--in fact, to terminate the plan and then restart \nthe plan--with a different benefit structure and having the cost of \nthose benefits amortized over a 30-year period.\n\n  They went to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government \nagency that oversees the pension plans and guarantees those plans, and \nasked for an approval to terminate and restart the plan with a 30-year \namortization. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation informed the \ncompany and union they believed they had no legal authority. Any time \nyou get two lawyers in a room you have five opinions; but in this case, \nsome lawyers on both sides suggested there was, and some suggesting \nthere was not, legal authority to terminate and restart.\n  I will say, for the purpose of the taxpayers, had the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation decided to accept the US Airways pilots' union \nplan, there would have been no liability to the PBGC, and no cost \nassociated with it. The airline would have terminated the plan but \nmaintained all the liability and simply amortized that cost over a 30-\nyear period. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation proposed in the \nalternative that they terminate the plan; PBGC take over the \nresponsibility for that plan; and US Airways move forward without a \npilot pension plan.\n  Such a plan, which I think you could make the argument, would be to \nthe financial benefit of US Airways and the management because they \nwould be released of this rather significant, roughly $3 billion, \nobligation of paying pilot pensions. But, US Airways management, \nworking together with their unions in a great spirit of cooperation, \ndid not want to have their pilot pensions reduced in the area of 75 \npercent. That would be the result of a takeover by the PBGC. So they \nhave pled with the PBGC to approve their plan which would result in, \nagain, a drastic reduction in the benefits of the pilots, but not as \ndraconian as the PBGC change.\n  Having said all that, they have been back and forth and back and \nforth and we are now at a point where there does not seem to be any \nhope for an agreement. We have been working together, myself and \nSenator Specter from Pennsylvania. I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, Senator Dole, be added as a \ncosponsor to S. 119--the bill I will call up in a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have been working together, the Senators from North \nCarolina, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and \nVirginia--Senator Warner is a sponsor of this resolution--to see what \nwe can do to be helpful in this process. The problem is, candidly, that \nthis plan has to be filed by next Thursday, a week from today. So the \nPBGC says they do not have the legal authority to approve the US \nAirways plan.\n  So the only way to get around that problem is for Congress to act to \namend the law, pension law, and allow for this agreement that US \nAirways and the pilots union have agreed to, to be a valid change in \nplan under the pension laws of this country.\n  So, I, in just a few minutes, am going to ask unanimous consent that \nwe bring up this legislation and that we debate it on the floor of the \nSenate and pass this legislation today. I understand this is an \nextraordinary thing to ask. I know the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee is here, as well as the former Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and now ranking member. They have been working diligently \ntrying to deal with this very complex issue. I understand there are a \nlot of companies who are in similar circumstances as US Airways. But \nthis is a dire situation.\n  This is the largest carrier on the east coast. This is probably the \nairline, I would argue, most affected by September 11. It was not one \nof the airlines targeted by the terrorists on September 11 but, as \neverybody knows, it is the dominant carrier in the cities that were \naffected by the terrorist incidents. So, in particular, Reagan National \nAirport, which was closed for a long period of time, is the most \nprofitable hub of US Airways. So it was dramatically impacted by \nGovernment action of shutting down airports, not just by the reduction \nin the air trafficking that was going on in the country, and the \ntraveling, but by Government action actually shutting down the \nfacility.\n  So I think we have a special obligation as a result of that to help \nthis particular airline because it was, again, arguably, most affected \nby what happened.\n  I understand that this is, as we term it here in the Senate, a \nrifleshot. And rifleshots are not looked upon kindly by the Finance \nCommittee and by this institution. But I would certainly make the \nargument that, if a rifleshot were ever warranted, this is a rifleshot \nthat certainly deserves to hit the target.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 119; that the Senate \nthen proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read \nthree times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague to withhold the \nrequest until I have had a chance to make a brief statement.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I withhold my request until the Senator from \nPennsylvania speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withheld.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sought recognition to join my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, in the presentation of this \nmatter which is of great importance, not only to Pennsylvania, but \ngreat importance to the country.\n  The US Airways system is the sixth-largest carrier in the United \nStates. It provides service on a national and international basis. As a \nresult of the problems of September 11, US Airways has had considerable \nfinancial problems and has moved forward to get a loan guarantee from \nthe Federal Government, $1 billion, and to accomplish that there have \nbeen major concessions made by labor and major concessions made by \nsuppliers to enable the airline to chart a course for the future on \nwhich they can succeed.\n\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has interpreted the law to \nsay\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\nthat they are not in a position to accept the termination of a plan and \nthe reinstatement unless there is a legislative change. If the bill, \nwhich Senator Santorum, Senator Dole and I are proposing, is not \nenacted, airline pilots will have a drastic reduction in their pension \nbenefits, and the taxpayers will have all of the obligations thrust \nupon the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation so that the taxpayers \nwill be hurt and the pilots will be hurt and, ultimately, consumers of \nairline travel will be hurt.\n  The legislation which we have proposed would authorize the PBGC to \nhave a discontinuance of the plan and then to have a reinstatement of \nthe plan. I think it is preeminently sensible.\n  I am not unaware of the prerogatives of the Finance Committee and \ntheir guardianship of the law generally, and I do not subscribe to \nrifleshot, buckshot--any shot. This is a proposal that makes sense. If \nother companies come in and can make a similar presentation, that makes \nsense, too.\n  So it is my hope that we will be able to consider this bill on the \nmerits. We are not too busy to take a little time of the Senate having \na discussion of the bill. It cannot be considered without a unanimous \nconsent agreement. But, if the unanimous consent agreement were entered \ninto, we could have debate.\n  If the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Montana disagree with \nthe substance of the bill, I can understand that. We can debate it, it \ncan be considered, and we can vote on it. But this is one of those \nsituations where I think a little extra consideration is in line.\n  If the unanimous consent request is granted, then we can have debate \non the merits, and I will go into these issues in some greater detail \nfor the edification of my colleagues whom I hope will have a chance to \nvote on this matter.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for yielding and for \nwithholding the unanimous consent request.\n  I have sought recognition today to join my colleague Senator Santorum \nin introducing legislation that would benefit American taxpayers by \nsaving them hundreds of millions of dollars in potential Federal \npension liabilities as well as protecting pension benefits of US \nAirways pilots. Senator Santorum and I believe this legislation is a \nwin-win proposition that benefits all parties involved, and it is good \npolicy that the American consumer will benefit from as well.\n  Sound transportation infrastructure is the backbone of a healthy and \nvibrant economy. The airline industry continues to struggle in the wake \nof the events of September 11. Though passengers are returning, the \nindustry is still operating at well below historic levels, and this is \nobviously affecting the industry's profitability.\n  US Airways, the Nation's sixth-largest air carrier, has been \nparticularly hard hit, filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on \nAugust 11, 2002, and laying off over 13,000 employees since. One unique \nchallenge faced by this airline is the fact that it has historically \nhad a large and lucrative operation at Washington's Ronald Reagan \nNational Airport, and so long as operations from this airport were \nconstrained due to post-September 11 security considerations, US \nAirways was losing a significant portion of its revenues.\n  US Airways is now in the final stage of obtaining approval for a $1 \nbillion loan guarantee from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, \nATSB. I have been assured that this loan guarantee will enable US \nAirways to emerge successfully from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings \nand again vie successfully for passengers in the international market.\n  But before this can happen, US Airways needs to restructure its \npension obligations, which are backed by the Federal Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, PBGC, and, ultimately, the American taxpayer. US \nAirways's pension liabilities increased significantly in recent months \ndue to poor market performance and a 41-year low in interest rates. \nFunding obligations for the pilots' pension plan is estimated to be \n$575 million for 2004 and $333 million for 2005. Given its current cash \nposition, US Airways cannot make these payments, and, additionally, the \nairline has indications from the ATSB that the ATSB will not approve \nits loan considering these large obligations.\n  But US Airways is proposing a simple and cost-saving solution that \nwould essentially terminate and then restore its pilots' pension plan, \na change that would allow the airline to amortize the plan's unfunded \naccrued liability and unfunded current liability in level payments over \na 30-year period. Simply put, payments that would have been made over a \n5-year period would be spread out over 30 years, a schedule that would \nallow US Airways to fully meet its pension obligations. This means that \nthe PBGC would not have to step in to cover liabilities US Airways \nwould not otherwise be able to meet, and the pilots are agreeable to \nthis proposal. This also means that US Airways would then likely have \nits loan guarantee approved and thus be able to emerge from bankruptcy \nprotection.\n  The only problem is that the PBGC has determined that it does not \nhave the legal authority to approve such a plan. Inaction would leave \nUS Airways with no option but to terminate its pilots' pension plan and \nregrettably transfer liability to the PBGC.\n  To avoid this unnecessary situation, we are proposing a legislative \nclarification that would specify that the PBGC has the legal authority \nto terminate and then restore US Airways's pilots' pension plan, \nthereby protecting the pilots' pensions while potentially saving the \nAmerican taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars annually. I want to \nemphasize that this is a simple statutory clarification, a clean bill \nthat provides no additional benefits to US Airways and is of no cost to \nthe Federal Government. In fact, successful and timely passage of this \nbill may very well save the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars over a \nperiod of many years.\n  US Airways will present its reorganization plan before U.S. \nBankruptcy Court on January 16, 2003, prior to which it must resolve \nthis pensions issue. Accordingly, time is of the essence, and this \nlegislative fix must be signed into law prior to January 16, 2003, for \nit to have any positive effect. It is thus with this sense of urgency \nthat Senator Santorum and I ask for the bill's immediate consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list of facts in support of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n\n                    Facts in Support of Legislation\n\n\n                           problem/background\n\n       US Airways is in the final stage of obtaining approval of \n     (1) a $1 billion loan guarantee from the Air Transportation \n     Stabilization Board (``ATSB''), (2) a $240 million equity \n     investment from the Retirement System of Alabama, and (3) a \n     plan of reorganization pursuant to which US Airways would \n     emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\n       On 12/20/02, US Airways filed a Plan of Reorganization and \n     Disclosure Statement with the bankruptcy court. A hearing is \n     scheduled for 01/16/03 on the adequacy of the Disclosure \n     Statement, and if approved, the Plan will be circulated with \n     voting materials to impaired creditors. It is expected that a \n     hearing on confirmation of the plan of reorganization will \n     take place in March 2003.\n       This progress is a direct result of unprecedented contract \n     modifications agreed to both during the summer and in the \n     last few weeks by the Air Line Pilots Association, \n     International (``ALPA''). These modifications will produce an \n     average savings of $633 million annually.\n       One of the remaining issues to be resolved is the \n     restructuring of US Airways's pension obligation, which has \n     increased significantly because of the poor market \n     performance and 41-year low interest rates. US Airways \n     sponsors defined benefit plans for its pilots, flight \n     attendants, mechanics and other employees and other \n     employees.\n       US Airways is facing estimated pension contributions of $1 \n     billion in 2004 and $800 million in 2005 for its defined \n     benefit plans. The pilot plan pension funding obligation \n     alone is estimated to be $575 million for 2004 and $333 \n     million for 2005. The Company can not make these payments, \n     given its cash position. Additionally, it has indications \n     from the ATSB and the ATSB will not approve its loan with \n     these large pension obligations. The ATSB is requiring that \n     US Airways develop a viable business plan for the 7-year ATSB \n     loan period.\n       The traditional funding waiver permitted under the Internal \n     Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     is not sufficient relief because a waiver applies only one \n     year at a time and the waived contribution is amortized over \n     only a 5-year period. A traditional waiver would actually \n     result in increased pension contributions, particularly in \n     years 2005, 2006 and 2007, which the Company cannot afford.\n       As of 01/01/02, the funded status (on a current liability \n     and market value of assets basis) of the US Airways pilot \n     defined benefit plan was 73.7 percent. Due to the proper \n     market performance and low interest rates, it is\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\n     estimated that the funded status of the plan will drop \n     significantly as of 01/01/03 (based on information as of 10/\n     31/02) to 50.1 percent.\n       US Airways and ALPA reached agreement on substantial \n     changes to the pilots' plan that eliminate and reduce \n     benefits accruing on and after 01/01/03. However, US Airways \n     must resolve the pension funding obligations for benefits \n     that accrued prior to 01/01/03 in order to get final approval \n     for the loan guarantee and emerge from bankruptcy.\n       There is tremendous urgency to resolving US Airways's \n     pension funding liabilities, which can be achieved in a \n     manner that: Insures the success of US Airways' \n     reorganization; protects the pension benefits of US Airways' \n     employees and retirees, who would lose hundreds of millions \n     of dollars in pension benefits that are not guaranteed by the \n     Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') in the event \n     of plan termination, and retirees, who would hundreds of \n     millions; protect the solvency of dollars in pension benefits \n     that are not guaranteed by the PBGC) in the event of plan \n     termination; and protects the PBGC by providing substantial \n     funding for a continuing plan in place of a plan termination \n     which leaves PBGC with billions of dollars in liabilities \n     that will not be recovered in the bankruptcy.\n       US Airways' bankruptcy filings emphasized the need to \n     resolve this crisis immediately by legislation, and made \n     clear the likely alternative was plan termination.\n\n\n                                solution\n\n       US Airways and ALPA have requested a special funding rule \n     for liabilities that have accrued under the US Airways pilot \n     defined benefit plan as of 12/31/02. Under the proposed bill \n     introduced today, the US Airways pilot defined benefit plan \n     will be treated as if terminated and restored as of 01/01/03, \n     with a restoration payment schedule that amortizes the plan's \n     unfunded liability and unfunded current liability in level \n     payments of a 30-year period.\n       With enactment of the proposed bill, US Airways would \n     continue to maintain and fund the pension plans for its \n     pilots. US Airways would successfully restructure. US Airways \n     would meet all funding obligations to the pilots' plan by \n     making substantial level pension contributions of \n     approximately $150 million on average per year under the \n     proposed payment schedule. Additionally, with enactment of \n     the proposed bill, the PBGC would avoid the liability and \n     responsibility resulting from the termination of an \n     underfunded pension plan.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If my colleague would withhold his request, I would \nlike to speak on this issue.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the two Senators from Pennsylvania to \nhelp these underfunded airline pension plans, particularly as it \nrelates to a company that is very important to the economy of their \nState. We are also in a situation where, as far as I know, the House \nWays and Means Committee has not acted on this issue and, consequently, \neven if the Senate were to pass it the measure would be subject to a \nblue slip, meaning, under the Constitution, a revenue measure needs to \nstart in the House of Representatives. So if we took action, what would \nthat do? It could not become law.\n  The legislation the Senator has introduced would create, as a matter \nof substance, perverse disincentives for all plans that paid premiums \nto the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The bill would permit a \nsingle airline to avoid the pension funding rules in the Internal \nRevenue Code, while every responsible plan sponsor funds its own plans. \nWe will need to deal with this particular problem when we deal with the \nrest of the funding rules and the pension interest rate problem because \nthat is a very real problem and several times we have tried to address \nit, just not successfully through the whole process. So we get to a \npoint that one set of rules for one company harms the nation's pension \nlaws applicable to the remaining plans.\n  I respectfully suggest that something this important would--surely \nought to be referred to the Finance Committee and that we should deal \nwith it under the regular rules of the committee, but particularly we \nneed a solution that would be nation-wide, not dealing with just one \ncompany. So I express opposition to this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request \nthat I stated previously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and I will \nobject, I deeply appreciate the concerns of both Senators from \nPennsylvania, the senior Senator and junior Senator, who spoke \neloquently about the problems facing those particular airlines, and I \nunderstand that. I think every Member of this body does. The fact of \nthe matter is, there are other airlines, too, facing very difficult \nfinancial problems these days. It is unfortunate but that is the fact.\n  I must say, too, as has the chairman of the Finance Committee, I have \nnot seen that proposal. All I know is what I hear on the floor now. I \nthink it would be inappropriate for the Senate to unanimously pass a \nchange in the pension laws which have not been reviewed by other \nSenators, certainly not by Members of the Finance Committee.\n  My good friend, Senator Grassley, soon to be chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, makes a very good point. Even if it were passed here, we \nwould have to wait until some other measure passed in the body so it \ncould be amended and have it considered. There are a lot of reasons--\nalthough I certainly appreciate the argument by the Senators--this is \nnot the appropriate time nor the appropriate way to take up this \nmeasure.\n  I ask my good colleagues to work with the committee and to work with \nSenator Grassley and myself over the next several days or next week--\nand also with other airlines because other airlines, frankly, are hurt \nby their request. I was contacted a couple hours ago by airlines that \nsaid: Wait a minute. It may be good for them, but it is not good for \nus.\n  We have to make sure that all airlines are treated fairly.\n  I very much look forward to working with my good friends from \nPennsylvania, and all Senators. But I just think because of propriety \nand doing it the right way to make sure this is the right solution that \nwe should not take it up at this time. There may be amendments and \nmodifications to the provision being requested that could be quite \nhelpful to meet some of the objections some others might have. This is \nthe first time we have heard of it. I haven't seen the language. It did \nnot come before our committee.\n  I must respectfully object to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Iowa and \nMontana for their responses. I appreciate their considerations.\n  It would be my hope, as I said earlier, that they would recognize the \nexigencies of this situation and permit us to proceed. But in light of \ntheir statements that they intend to object, which I understand will \nfollow, I inquire of my colleague from Montana, who is now chairman, \nand of my colleague from Iowa, who hopefully by this time tomorrow will \nhave the resolution passed to shift the chairmanship, whether there \nmight be an early hearing set in the Finance Committee.\n  I am in line to be chairman of the appropriations subcommittee having \njurisdiction over the Department of Labor. And Senator Harkin and I \nhave agreed to have a hearing on this next week. But the authorizing \ncommittee has the paramount responsibility. There is a U.S. Bankruptcy \nCourt hearing on this matter on Wednesday. I do not think we have a \nproblem about the solvency of US Airways being involved as I thought \nthere might have been several weeks ago. But I think the court might be \nwilling to defer action which touches upon these issues if there was \nknowledge that there was going to be expedited treatment.\n  So my question to the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee is whether it might be possible to schedule a hearing yet \nthis month which could then be used with the court to defer action with \nthe possibility or prospects of some action by the Senate on this \nissue, that is, US Airways, or the issue generally.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might say to my good friends that I \nthink that is a good idea. The Senator has my assurance--and I know the \nassurance of my colleague from Iowa--that we will look into the matter \ntomorrow, say, and determine if a hearing makes sense. It could well be \na very good idea. Maybe it can be resolved in some other way without a \nhearing.\n\n  But I would like to look at the issue and expeditiously, see if there \nis a way to resolve this matter. It could well be that we could have a \nhearing this week or sometime this month. It could be a very good idea. \nWe could well do that.\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\nBut I could really answer that question a little more after I look at \nthe issue more and know what is involved.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might direct a question through the \nChair to the Senator from Montana, he says he may well be able to have \na hearing this month. It depends upon his analysis of the legislation \nor the complexity of it. Would it be a fair statement that the \nrepresentation could be made to the court that there will be an effort \nmade, if possible, to have a hearing in finance this month?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a very fair representation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think that would be a yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Might I ask my colleague from Iowa, who will soon waive \nthe gavel, if he concurs in what the Senator from Montana said?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I might modify it just a little bit, but understand \nthat I am making this statement not having had a chance to think deeply \non it. But it would be in relationship to the extent to which there \nshould be a hearing just on this one company as opposed to a hearing on \nthe pension problem generally and in the larger context because I did \nvoice in my statement to the Senate that it seems to me that we do have \nto look into this area, and we have to look at it as a pension problem \nin a much broader context than just one company. Obviously, in that \ncontext, I have absolutely no opposition to looking at the problem of \none company. But I also think it ought to be looked into only in the \ncontext of the others because of the extent to which it might lead to \nother companies making the same request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may direct a question through the \nChair to the Senator from Iowa, the substance of what I understand he \nsaid is that if it is possible to have a hearing this month, \nconsidering whether it be on a single company or the complexity of \ntaking up a broader issue, that consideration would be given to having \na hearing this month if it can be done in a practical sense.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In the context of what I stated, the answer to that is, \nI would agree.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I take that also to be a yes.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we were not able \nto get unanimous consent. I certainly understand the position of my \ncolleagues from Montana and Iowa. But I just want to reemphasize that \nthe reason we sought to submit this extraordinary act is because of the \ntiming of the judicial submission a week from now. A revenue bill is \nbeing generated in the House. As an old House Ways and Means Committee \nmember, I was very jealous of that prerogative and wanted to make sure \nthat we enforced it with regularity if the Senate got out of \nconstitutional control. I thought it could act on these things \nunilaterally. But, again, I think there is a certain support on the \nWays and Means Committee for dealing with this issue. The request of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, hopefully, will not only be one \ncommunicated to the Finance Committee but also would be communicated to \nthe Ways and Means Committee in the House to seriously look into this.\n  I know many of my colleagues from Pennsylvania and other Congressmen \nfrom other states are going to be adversely affected--potentially \naffected--by what happens next Thursday. I hope a request will be made \nto the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to take a very \nsignificant look at this. I hope they will be moved to act in a way \nthat would be beneficial to this situation, and again other situations \naround the country of pensions failing.\n  But the point I want to reiterate is if this legislation were passed \nthere would be no cost to the Federal Government by picking up the \npensions of the pilots and others in the union of US Airways. Without \nthis legislation, the cost to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, \nand, therefore, to the taxpayers of the United States would be about $3 \nbillion. So this is a measure that will save $3 billion over a set \nnumber of years. That is not pocket change, even in Washington, DC.\n  I think there has been an attempt to try to address this issue in a \nway that does not--as the Senator from Iowa said--create an incentive \nfor companies not to fund their legal obligation. I don't think this \nnarrow provision is an incentive for any other corporation to not do \nwhat is required of them under the pension laws. But what we have is an \nextraordinary case where union and management come together to \ndramatically reduce the benefits of the pilots. And I underscore the \nwords ``dramatically reduce'' the benefits to the pilots. The pilots \nsigned off on it. They have signed off on this as a way for the company \nto continue to operate. It will save the taxpayers money, and it will \nsave these airlines and all of the employers--as well as the traveling \npublic in the Northeast and throughout the eastern part of the United \nStates.\n  I think this is a narrow exception. I think this is a special \ncircumstance. Whether we can effectually change something that would \nallow the kind of flexibility under very stringent rules--I would agree \nwith the Senator from Iowa. It allows the flexibility of the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation to look at the unique circumstances of \nthese petitions of companies and unions.\n  I just remind everyone, this is not the management going in \nunilaterally saying: We are going to cut benefits and restructure the \nprogram. This is the union and the management saying: This is what we \nwant to do. This is a very rare circumstance, indeed. So I do think we \nhave unique circumstances.\n  Again, I understand the precedent that this sets, but I am hopeful we \ncan work out a change in the law that will give the PBGC the \nflexibility to look at these unique circumstances, and unique \ncircumstances in the future with respect to other companies, to come up \nwith a solution that is best for the taxpayer as well as best for the \ncompanies and unions involved in these very difficult times.\n  Mr. President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I can proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S120-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S120-S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN DEFENSE OF THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the President has \nwasted no time in delivering his judicial nominations left behind in \nthe last Congress. The President's judicial nominees have proven to be \nsuperb and among the best I have seen in all my years of service in \nthis body.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I expect that my colleagues \non both sides are eager to do the people's business and move as \npromptly as President Bush to fill judicial vacancies.\n  Of course, I realize that the distortions have begun.\n  The usual special interest lobbies, pursuing their political and \neconomic interests, have already been busy painting a very scary \npicture with the usual shrillness and tired old tactics.\n  The President of the United States has nominated men and women who, \nwhatever their personal politics or views, are constitutionalists who \nare committed to enforcing the law as the people's elected \nrepresentatives have adopted, and who will interpret the Constitution, \nnot rewrite it as if they were in the room with the founding fathers--\nConstitutionalists, not Republican or Democrat, not liberal or \nconservative, who will approach their roles in a common sense manner.\n  But today, I rise to right one particular wrong. A recent report by \nPeople for the American Way, with, oddly enough, a remarkably biblical \ntitle, paints President Bush's nomination as an Armageddon. In reading \nthe report, one would well think the President is choosing judges from \nthe ranks of the Raelians.\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\n  But they especially go out of their way to malign the thousands of \nhonest, smart and hard-working lawyers and law students who are members \nof the Federalist Society as if these fine men and women wear the mark \nof the devil.\n  Mr. President, I am a member of the Federalist Society and I am proud \nof it. Last year, the Federalist Society celebrated its 20th \nanniversary, and we are all proud of that.\n  Of course, the childish games played against the Federalist Society \nare not new. Over the past 2 years, members of the Federalist Society \nhave been much maligned by some even in this body. The Federalist \nSociety has even been presented as an ``evil cabal'' of conservative \nlawyers. Its members have been subjected to questions which remind one \nof the McCarthy hearings of the early 1950s. Detractors have painted a \npicture which is surreal, twisted and untrue.\n  The truth is that liberal orthodoxies reign rampant and often \nunchecked in a majority of this country's law schools and in the legal \nprofession, and that the left is shocked that an association of honest, \nnon-partisan, constitutionalist lawyers would exist, much less include \nthe notable legal minds it does.\n  During the mid-1990s, Professor James Lindgren of Northwestern \nUniversity Law School conducted a survey of law school professors and \ncame to the following conclusion. At the faculties of the top 100 law \nschools 80 percent of law professors were Democrats or leaned left and \nonly 13 percent were Republicans or leaned right. These liberal \nprofessors promulgate their ideology in and outside the classroom.\n  Mr. President, anyone associated with America's campuses or law \nschools knows that non-liberal views are regularly stifled and those \nespousing those views are often publicly shunned and ridiculed. It was \nthis environment of hostility to freedom of expression and the exchange \nof ideas in universities that set the stage for the formation of the \nFederalist Society. And given my Democrat colleagues' reaction to the \nSociety, it appears to be fighting against narrow-mindedness still.\n  In 1982, the Federalist Society was organized, not to foster any \npolitical agenda, but to encourage debate and public discourse on \nsocial and legal issues. Over the past 20 years, the Federalist Society \nhas accomplished just that. It has served to open the channels of \ndiscourse and debate in may of America's law schools.\n  The Federalist Society espouses no official dogma. Its members share \nacceptance of three universal ideas: One, that government's essential \npurpose is the preservation of freedom; Two, that our Constitution \nembraces and requires separation of governmental powers; and, three \nthat judges should interpret the law, not write it.\n\n  Tell me if you disagree with any of these ideas. Most Americans do \nnot, but it seems like some in this town do.\n  For the vast majority of Americans, these are not controversial \nissues. Rather, they are basic constitutional assertions that are \nessential to the survival of our republic. They are truths that have \nunited Americans for more than two centuries.\n  Recently we have seen the emergence of some groups that seek to \nundermine the third of these ideas--that judges should not write laws. \nThese groups have attempted to use the judiciary to circumvent the \ndemocratic process and impose their minority views on the American \npeople.\n  This judicial activism is a nefarious practice that seeks to \nundermine the principle of democratic rule. It results in an unelected \noligarchy--government by small elite. Judicial activism imposes the \nwill of a small group of politicized lawyers upon the American people \nand undermines the work of the people's representatives.\n  Indeed, if the radical left, the abortion on demand lobby, and some \npredatory businessmen who happen to hold law degrees and call \nthemselves trial lawyers are successful; if we appoint judges that are \ncommitted to writing the law and Constitution and not interpreting it \nonly, then all of us can just go home. We can resign ourselves to live \nunder the oligarchic rule of lawyers--or should I say judges.\n  I happen to know a few lawyers, and please trust me when I say, this \nis not a good idea.\n  Not surprisingly in an association of lawyers, the truth is that \nbeyond acceptance of the Federalist Society's three key ideas: freedom, \nseparation of powers, and that judges should not write laws, it is \nchallenging, if not impossible, to find consensus among Federalist \nSociety members. Its members hold a wide array of differing views. They \nare so diverse that it is impossible to describe a Federalist Society \nphilosophy.\n  The assertion that members are ideological carbon copies of each \nother is at the very least ludicrous.\n  The Society revels in open, thoughtful, and rigorous debate on all \nissues. It rests on the premise that public policy and social issues \nshould not be accepted as part of a party line but, rather, warrant \nmuch thought and dialog. Any organization that sponsors debate on \nissues of public importance, as opposed to self-serving indoctrination, \nis healthy for us all and it is good for this body as well.\n  Now, how does the Federalist Society accomplish its goal? Not by \nlobbying Congress, writing amicus briefs, or issuing press releases. \nAnd, no, it does not threaten members with withdrawal of support in \ncampaigns or running negative smear ads, which some of the special \ninterest groups that smear this President's good judges engage in. The \nFederalist Society seeks only to sponsor fair, serious, and open debate \nabout the need to enhance individual freedom and the role of the courts \nin saying what the law is rather than what it should be. The Society \nbelieves that debate is the best way to ensure that legal principles \nthat have not been the subject of sufficient attention for the past \nseveral decades receive a fair hearing.\n  The Federalist Society's commitment to fair and open debate can be \nseen by a small sampling of some participants in its meetings and \nsymposiums. I venture to say the Federalist Society's meetings and \nsymposiums are among the most well attended and among the most widely \nattended and among the most diversely attended and among the best \nsymposiums held by anybody in the judicial field. But those \nparticipants who have participated--maybe we should look at some of \nthem. They have included scores of liberals such as Justices Ruth Bader \nGinsburg and Stephen Breyer, Michael Dukakis, Barney Frank, Abner \nMikva, Alan Dershowitz, Laurence Tribe, Steve Shapiro, Christopher \nHitchins, and Ralph Nader, to name a few.\n\n  I would like to include for the Record a list of 60 participants in \nFederalist Society events that demonstrates the remarkable diversity of \nthought of Federalist Society events. One of them is Nadine Strossen, \npresident of the ACLU, who many of us know, respect, and have worked \nwith, and who has participated in Federalist Society functions \nregularly and constantly since its founding, and who attended the \nrecent 20th anniversary dinner.\n  The ACLU's president has praised the Society's fundamental principle \nof individual liberty, its high-profile on law school campuses, and its \nintellectual diversity, noting that there is frequently strenuous \ndisagreement among members about the role of the courts. Ms. Strossen \nhas said that she cannot draw any firm conclusion about a potential \njudicial nominee's views based on the fact that he is a Federalist \nSociety member.\n  It seems to me that an organization that includes such a wide array \nof opinion serves this Nation well and does not deserve the \nvilification it gets from the usual suspects here in Washington.\n  There are many notable conservatives that also affiliate with the \nFederalist Society. But as the members of the Senate demonstrate, even \namongst those that are often labeled ``conservatives'' there is much \ndisagreement on most social and political issues. Some, unfortunately, \noften portray the Federalist Society as a tightly knit, well-organized \ncoalition of conservative lawyers who are united by their right-wing \nideology. This is far from true. Allow me to illustrate further.\n  Three years ago the Washington Monthly published an article entitled \n``The Conservative Cabal That's Transforming American Law,'' which \ncited a 1999 decision by a panel of the D.C. Circuit's Court of Appeals \nas the ``network's most far-reaching victory in recent years.''. The \ndecision overturned some of the EPA's clean-air standards\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\non the grounds that it was unconstitutional for Congress to delegate \nlegislative authority to the executive branch. C. Boyden Gray, a former \nWhite House Counsel for the first President Bush and a member of the \nFederalist Society's Board of Visitors, filed an amicus brief making \nthe winning argument.\n  However, this is not the smoking gun case that opponents of the \nFederalist Society would have us believe it to be to prove that it is \npart of the vast right wing conservative conspiracy. First, the case \nwas overturned on appeal by the Supreme Court, in a decision written by \nJustice Antonin Scalia, a frequent participant in Federalist Society \nactivities who was the faculty advisor to the organization when he \ntaught at the University of Chicago.\n  Second, the Washington Monthly piece also attacked Boyden Gray as a \nwater carrier for the Federalist Society for advancing Microsoft's \neffort against antitrust enforcement.\n  Of course, Mr. Gray serves on the Society's Board of Visitors with \nRobert Bork, who has been Microsoft's chief intellectual adversary. \nThey are on opposite sides.\n  There is not quite the vast right wing conspiracy hobgoblin some of \nthe special interest groups in this town would have the American people \nand members of this body believe in. Indeed, I urge my colleagues to be \nextra careful when and look at the record before they attack this fine \norganization or its members.\n  A close examination of the Federalist Society reveals not a tight-\nknit organization that demands ideological unity, but an association of \nlawyers, much like the early bar associations that first appeared in \nthis country in the late 19th century, made up of individuals from \nacross the political spectrum who are committed to the principles of \nfreedom and the rule of law according to the Constitution.\n  As a co-chairman myself, I am not surprised that the President has \nsought out its members to appoint for position on the bench and in the \ngovernment. I applaud his foresight and wisdom. I am proud that its \nmembers are solid constitutionalists, whether they are liberal or \nconservative, Democrat or Republican.\n  Mr. President, contrast that with People for the American Way, which \nhas waged every obnoxious rotten fight against President Bush's \nnominations that has been waged in the last year. This is a very well-\nheeled organization. It is totally ideological. If you disagree with \ntheir far left liberal viewpoints, then they vilify you and try to \nimpugn your motives. That is not what I call fairness in the debates \nthat we should have around this body. Yet it is amazing to me how some \nin this body seem to be absolutely in tune, or should I say marching to \nthe drumbeat of People for the American Way.\n  I started off by mentioning criticisms by the People for the American \nWay of the Federalist Society, and I have to say, if you add it all up, \nthis is a well-heeled, very liberal organization that is as partisan, \ncombative, obnoxious in many ways, and false in its arguments and \naccusations as any organization I have seen in this country.\n  In almost every case where there has been any type of conservative of \nstature nominated to the courts, they have come in and completely done \ntheir best to deliver body blows to that nominee. It all seems to come \ndown to basically one issue, and that is, if they suspect that a \nnominee is pro-life, then that is just an absolute no-no to them. It \nisn't just that. They have taken other nominees nominated by this \nPresident and others in the past, have taken their records and, in my \nopinion, have distorted in many ways their record. I don't think People \nfor the American Way should be in a position to criticize the \nFederalist Society which primarily conducts the best symposia in law in \nAmerica today. That is a fact.\n\n  I will never forget; I was invited to the University of Chicago by \nthe Federalist Society members--150 members at that time--to speak at \nthe law school at the behest of the Federalist Society. I figured there \nwould be 100 or 150 people there. They had this one hall rented. They \nhad to take me in the back way because of the protesters out front. \nAlthough I was willing to go through the protesters, they were afraid \nsome of them were violent. We went inside the hall, and they were \nabsolutely jampacked, people hanging from the rafters. Almost all of \nthose who disagreed with the Federalist Society principles--in other \nwords, principles that were not the left-wing principles--had a heavy \npiece of parchment paper. As I went to speak, they would stand up and \nrattle that paper. And that sound was deafening. You could not be \nheard. I have to say that what was going to be about a 20-minute speech \nturned out to be 145 minutes, or 2 hours by the time I could complete \nit.\n  I have to say I enjoyed the experience. But it was disconcerting that \npeople at a major university--these were not people from the law \nschool, in my opinion. And I am not sure they were even students at the \nuniversity, many of them--would try to stop discourse from a U.S. \nSenator or anybody else, for that matter, who came there in good faith \nto deliver points of view that certainly I felt were worthy of \nconsideration in this field of law.\n  I have to say there was one young lady three or four rows down who \nkept yelling epitaphs at me throughout my remarks. I tried to humor \nher, and I tried to go along and be reasonably thoughtful and kind to \nher. But, finally, I could tell she was getting on the nerves of almost \neverybody because she was really out of line and loud. I kind of \nenjoyed the confrontation to a degree. But it was getting old. Finally, \nafter about an hour and 15 minutes, I looked at her, and, I said, I \nfinally figured it out. You could not possibly be a member of this \ngreat law school, because, No. 1, you are so rude. I said, No. 2, you \nare so stupid. Of course, even at that point, even those who were there \nto oppose me and to rattle their parchment so I couldn't be heard \nstarted to cheer and applaud. I was able to end my remarks, which I \nfelt were remarkably good for anybody in the field of law, whether they \nwere from the left or the right or the center. I think in the end they \nwere good for everybody there.\n  That is what is going on in the debate on judges today. We have some \nof these well-heeled left-wing groups that don't care what the facts \nare and distort anybody's life by coming in and utilizing their \neconomic swat because they have all kinds of left-wing money behind \nthem to malign and to slander and sometimes libel very good nominees.\n  I know a number of people in People from the American Way, and I have \nrespect for some of them, but I have to tell you I hope they will \nelevate their discourse so that we will have true debates and not \ndistortions and slander and libel and complete ignorance of what people \nstand for and what their records are.\n  I think we are getting down to where we are getting very close in \nthis country to where single litmus tests are going to determine \nwhether we can have judges. And we are getting to the point where the \ngreat jurists of the future might not arise because we might have to go \nto the lowest common denominator.\n\n  Having said all of that, I look forward to working with every group \nin this coming year. Hopefully, we can get a greater sense of discourse \nand a greater sense of responsibility, and that when we raise \nobjections we hope they will be legitimate and honorable objections \nrather than objections geared to trying to smear somebody because of \ntheir disagreement. I think it is time we elevate the discourse around \njudges in this country, and I hope this year we can prove we can do \nthat. But, in any event, my hopes have not been fulfilled today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 60 diverse \nparticipants who have participated in Federalist Society events at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          60 Diverse Participants in Federalist Society Events\n\n\n                         Supreme Court Justices\n\n     1.

Mr. President, in my first act after taking the oath of \noffice for my second term, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Each day we are in session I have taken the opportunity to make sure \nanother example of a hate crime is published in the Record in an effort \nto sway my colleagues about the need for expanding current hate crimes \nlaw to include sexual orientation, gender and disability and to expand \nthe definition of what is a hate crime.\n  Hate crimes legislation will benefit our Nation as a whole, our \ncountry is a diverse one, made up of Muslims, Christians, and countless \nother religious faiths. Our society finds great strength in its Black \nand Hispanic communities as well as its gay and Jewish communities. \nGroups such as these represent not divisions but diversity, and that \ndistinction has built a great Nation. However, hate crimes touch all \nour communities and tear the very fabric that binds our Nation \ntogether.\n  Passage of a hate crimes bill will assure all Americans that the \nviolence done by a hate crime will not go unpunished. It will ensure \nthat the violence done to an American because of the color of his or \nher skin will not go unpunished and will make it easier to punish on \nthe Federal level. It will ensure Muslim Americans that they will not \nbe harassed because of their faith and make it easier to punish on a \nFederal level. It will ensure that sexual orientation and identity are \nnot reasons for a violent crime that goes unpunished.\n  As we move through these early weeks of the 108th Congress, I call on \nall my colleagues to consider hate crime legislation as a way to move \nforward on civil rights issues that are so important in our democratic \nsociety.\n  So, I rise today to describe yet another terrible crime that occurred \nJanuary 1, 2003 in Miami, FL. After leaving a New Year's Eve party in \nSouth Beach, a gay man was shot by two attackers. Earnest Robinson, 23, \nwas walking home when he was approached by two men, one of whom tried \nto pick him up.\n  Upon realizing that Robinson was not a woman, one of the men shot him \nand left him on the street. Police say one of the assailants shouted \nanti-gay slurs before shooting the victim. Robinson was treated at a \nlocal hospital and is in good condition.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. Hate crimes \nlegislation like the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is now a \nsymbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S123-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    POLICE OFFICERS ARE BEING KILLED\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, late last year, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation released its annual report on Law Enforcement Officers \nKilled and Assaulted in 2001. According to the report, there were 136 \nlaw enforcement officers killed in 30 States. The tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, claimed the lives of 72 officers. Excluding these \n72 lives, the number of officers killed in 2001 increased over 37 \npercent, from 51 officer fatalities in 2000 to 70 in 2001. A closer \nexamination of data shows that firearms were used in 61 of the officer \nmurders, and of those, handguns were responsible for 46. The handgun of \nchoice was the 9 millimeter. In my home State of Michigan, Clinton \nTownship, the city of Detroit, and the Federal Protective Service in \nDetroit each lost an officer in 2001. One of these officers worked in \nthe building in which my Detroit office is located.\n  In 1994, the Brady law established the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, NICS. The creation of this check system allows \nfederally licensed gun sellers to quickly determine whether an \nindividual is eligible to purchase a firearm. Since its inception, NICS \nchecks have prevented more than 156,000 felons, fugitives, and others \nnot eligible from purchasing a firearm without infringing upon any law-\nabiding individual's ability to buy a firearm. However, a loophole in \nthe law allows unlicensed private gun sellers to sell guns without \nconducting a NICS background check.\n  During the last Congress, Senator Reed introduced the Gun Show \nBackground Check Act. I cosponsored that bill because I believe it is a \ncritical tool in preventing guns from getting into the hands of \ncriminals and other ineligible buyers. This bill would simply apply \nexisting law governing background checks to individuals buying firearms \nat gun shows. As reflected in the FBI report, preventing easy and \nunchecked access to guns is critical in preventing police deaths and \ngun violence. That is why it is supported by major law enforcement \norganizations including the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Brotherhood \nof Police Officers, the Police Executive Research Forum, the Major \nCities Chiefs, the National Association of School Resource Officers, \nthe National Black Police Association, the National Organization of \nBlack Law Enforcement Executives, and the Hispanic American Police \nCommand Officers Association.\n  We must stand by our Nation's law enforcement community and take this \ncommonsense step to reduce gun violence. I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this legislation when it is reintroduced during \nthis Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S123-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nMount Union Purple Raiders football team, from Alliance, OH, on a \nnumber of outstanding achievements. The Purple Raiders recently won the \nDivision III National Championship for the sixth time in 7 years. \nMaintaining a perfect record of 14 victories this season, Mount Union's \nteam is 109 and 1 in the last 11 regular seasons, and since 1990 the \nRaiders\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\nhave won an incredible 162 out of 170 games.\n  I congratulate these fine young athletes on yet another championship \nseason and would like to recognize Raiders' coach Larry Kehres for his \ndedication and commitment to the school and the team. He has just been \nnamed the AFCA Division III National Coach of the Year, making him the \nfirst coach to win seven National Coach of the Year Awards. This is an \nunprecedented accomplishment, and I congratulate Coach Kehres and wish \nhim and the Purple Raiders all the best for next season and many more \nafter that.\n  While their execution of the split-back offense is flawless, it is \nMount Union's academic performance that is truly remarkable. The \nfootball team has graduated a near-perfect percentage of players in the \nlast 17 seasons. I applaud the Purple Raider players who exceed all \nexpectations on the gridiron, as well as in the classroom.\n  For the local residents of Alliance and the students of Mount Union, \nthere is so much to be proud of when it comes to the Purple Raiders. As \nthe fans crowd into the oldest college football stadium in Ohio every \nfall, they are not only cheering for the heroes of the Purple Raiders, \nbut also for future heroes, future leaders who will have learned the \nvaluable lessons that come with a solid education and a demanding \nathletic routine. These experiences will aid them in making a positive \nimpact many years from now.\n  Again, I congratulate head coach Larry Kehres and his Purple Raiders \non another perfect championship season. They are a shining example of \ntrue student-athletes.\n  I ask that the names of the Mount Union College Purple Raiders \nfootball team coaching staff and players be listed at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The list follows.\n\n\n                     purple raiders coaching staff\n\n       Larry Kehres, Don Montgomery, Jeff Wojtowicz, Joe Leigh, \n     Marty Cvelbar, Vince Kehres, E.J.

Mr. President, I rise in tribute to the late Joe \nRemcho, who died in a helicopter crash in California last Saturday. Joe \nwas a great American an accomplished attorney, a strong advocate for \ncivil liberties, a leading legal scholar, and a trusted advisor to many \npublic officials.\n  Joe's curriculum vitae is varied and impressive. After graduating \nfrom Yale University and Harvard Law School, he taught second grade for \na year at an inner-city public school. In the early 1970s, with the \nVietnam war at its height, the young attorney went to Saigon to serve \non the Lawyers Military Defense Committee. After returning to the \nUnited States, he moved to California to become the staff attorney for \nthe American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. Four years \nlater, he established a successful private practice specializing in \nfirst amendment, education, and election law. His clients included \nCalifornia's Governor and the State assembly. In 1988, he was honored \nby his colleagues as California's Trial Lawyer of the Year.\n  Despite his very full docket, Joe found time to serve as an adjunct \nprofessor of law at the University of San Francisco, a commissioner on \nthe California Fair Political Practices Commission, and a member of \nCalifornia's bipartisan State committees on internet political \npractices and the Political Reform Act.\n  Above all, Joe Remcho was a warm and wonderful human being a devoted \nfamily man, a loving husband and father, and a friend to those who were \nfortunate enough to know him.\n  I last saw Joe just 2 days before he died. Our families were \ntogether, and his strength and warmth were ever present.\n  Whether he was spending a quiet vacation with family and friends or \nfighting in court to defend the Constitution, Joe Remcho lived his life \nto the fullest. His death leaves a tremendous void in the lives of all \nthose who knew him, but his memory fills that space with love and \nadmiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S124-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S124-S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE SILVER ROSE\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, I would like to set aside a moment \nto reflect on the life of Mr. Leon N. Weiner upon his passing. Leon was \na good friend and a man who made remarkable contributions toward \naffordable housing for thousands of families in Delaware and many more \nbeyond our state's borders. He was a man with a kind heart, diverse \ninterests, great abilities, and boundless energy.\n  Leon was born in Philadelphia, PA. After graduating from Overbrook \nHigh School, he attended the University of Pennsylvania for 3 years \nbefore leaving to take up a job as an apprentice machinist at \nWestinghouse Electric Corp. in Essington, PA.\n  After serving his country in the Army Air Corps during World War II, \nLeon came to Delaware and joined his uncle in building Leedom Estates \nnear New Castle. This was one of the first suburban housing projects in \nNew Castle County and the first of more than 5,000 houses that Leon \nbuilt across New Castle County during his 54-year career. At the age of \n53, he turned his attention to the challenge of building housing for \nlow- and moderate-income families and seniors.\n  A very colorful character, Leon spoke with a booming voice and always \nwore suspenders, something that became his trademark. To the end of his \ndays his office was filled with honorary gavels, keys to cities, and \npictures of him with leading Democratic figures. In 1979 he was \ninducted to the National Housing Hall of Fame and subsequently was \ngiven the National Housing Man of the Year Award. His appointment to \nthe Kaiser Commission on Urban Housing led to the landmark Housing Act \nof 1968.\n  Leon leaves behind his wife of 53 years, Helen; as well as a \nstepdaughter; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He also \nleaves behind many friends, colleagues and several thousand families \nwho are living more productive, satisfying lives today because Leon was \ncommitted to building affordable housing.\n  Leon's lifelong dream was that low-income seniors and families would \nhave the opportunity to afford their own homes, in the communities they \ncalled home. He lived to see that dream largely fulfilled.\n  Leon's legacy will live on in the lives of those he helped shape, in \nthe rooms of affordable low-income housing he helped build, and in the \nhearts of those who were lucky enough to call him their friend. I rise \ntoday to commemorate Leon's life, to celebrate his life, and to offer \nhis family our support and our thanks for sharing with the rest of us a \ntruly remarkable human being. Although a resident of nearby \nPennsylvania, Leon embodied the best of Delaware where his firm, Leon \nWeiner and Associates, was headquartered. He will be sorely missed. I \nknow he can never be replaced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S125-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORIAM: MARYJANE DUNSTAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to remember and pay tribute \nto a most beloved and accomplished constituent, Maryjane Dunstan, who \ndied on December 20, 2002.\n  Although most of us knew her as a California resident for over 50 \nyears, Maryjane was born in Bethlehem, PA, on January 12, 1925, and \nwent on to serve in the Waves during WWII. Her pursuit of education \nbrought her to San Francisco where she earned both a BA and an MA at \nSan Francisco State University. For her excellence as a teacher, she \nwas awarded a Fulbright scholarship to Burma where for 4 years she \ntaught teachers on methods of teaching English, until the political \nclimate in Burma forced her departure in 1962.\n  Upon her return, she embarked on a 20 year career at the College of \nMarin in Kentfield, CA, including 12 years as the founder and \nchairwoman of the Communications Department where she developed one of \nthe most innovative classes anyone had ever seen: The Future. Her \ncoauthored textbooks, ``Worlds In The Making'' and ``Star Sight,'' were \ndesigned to help students project themselves into a possible and \ndesirable future, and to motivate them to create a human and humane \nfuture for all.\n  Those of us who didn't know her through the college, crossed her path \nas the owner of the Artists Proof Bookstore in Larkspur, Marin County, \nor through the Literary Luncheons which brought accomplished writers to \nthe community to share their talent.\n  In truth, Maryjane's greatest joy came as she continually provided a \nrich milieu for people interested in the large and small issues facing \nthe community, intent on her belief that each of us is responsible for \nimproving the quality of life around us. She never tired of working to \nhelp community groups analyze and explore problems and to inspire \nindividuals to seek solutions. She understood how to create positive \nchange by fostering thoughtful, informed action.\n  She was always gracious, willingly taking on the small tasks as well \nas the immense, seemingly impossible projects, always an inspiring role \nmodel with her passionate interest in the politics, economy and welfare \nof her community.\n  For all of this, she has been recognized by her town, her county, and \nher State. In 1989, she received the Larkspur Citizen of the Year Award \nfrom the Larkspur Chamber of Commerce. In April of 1999 the Marin \nCounty Commission on Women bestowed upon her the Women of Wisdom, \nPassion and Vision Award. The Marin County Board of Supervisors \nproclaimed June 13, 1999, Maryjane Dunstan Day. Also, in 1999 the \nCalifornia State Legislature gave her a Certificate of Recognition for \nher contributions to improve the lives of women. And the California \nState Senate gave her a Certificate of Recognition for distinguished \nservice in education. Thanks in large part to Maryjane's work on behalf \nof low cost and senior housing, the Larkspur City Council approved a \n24-unit workforce housing project in December 2002. The developer, the \nEcumenical Association for Housing will dedicate the building to her in \nhonor of her work for affordable housing.\n  Maryjane Dunstan leaves a legacy of hope and optimism for any \ncommunity that is willing to work collaboratively to enhance the \nquality of life and create viable, peaceful solutions to all kinds of \nchallenges.\n  Maryjane will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S125-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ROBERT HOLSTEIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the late Bob \nHolstein, an attorney in Riverside, CA. He is survived by his wife, \nLoretta, and five children. I know they will all miss him very much.\n  A former priest, Bob Holstein cared passionately about people. He did \nnot just speak about peace and social justice, but worked for it every \nday of his life. He and Loretta regularly provided both the inspiration \nand the financial means to make projects come to fruition. Riverside's \nlandscape and the lives of countless Californians were changed by their \ngenerosity.\n  Bob Holstein counted my late friend and colleague, Congressman George \nBrown, among his good friends, along with many other government \nofficials. He was also the friend of the University of California, \nRiverside, where he and Loretta endowed a chair in religious studies. \nIt was also under his careful guidance that the campus built St. \nAndrew's Newman Center.\n  Upon hearing of his friend's death, Bishop Gerald Barnes of the \nDiocese of San Bernardino said: ``In a world long on style, Bob \nHolstein was long on substance. He was genuine. Bob lived what he \nbelieved. And what he believed was justice and fairness for all \npeoples. Particularly the poor and disenfranchised.''\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring Bob Holstein, who \ndedicated his life to the betterment of his fellow men and women. He \nwill be sorely missed by his friends, colleagues, and by the countless \npeople who live better lives because of his actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S125-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S125-S126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WIND CAVE NATIONAL PARK CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nmilestone in South Dakota and the United States, the centennial of Wind \nCave National Park.\n  For years, American Indians in the Black Hills had told stories about \nholes that blow wind. In 1881, while exploring in southwestern South \nDakota, Jesse and Tom Bingham came upon one of those holes, Wind Cave. \nA man named\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\nCharlie Crary was the first person to enter the cave, and 6 years later \nit was reported to be 3 miles long. An early landowner was once heard \nsaying he had ``given up finding the end of Wind Cave.''\n  For nearly 20 years, the cave was held in private ownership through \nmining and homestead claims. In the late 1890s, the Department of the \nInterior took jurisdiction over the area after it ruled that no \nlegitimate mining development was occurring and that homesteaders were \nnot acting in good faith to occupy the land. On January 9, 1903, \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt, one of our Nation's most revered \nconservationists, signed legislation creating Wind Cave National Park, \nthe seventh national park in the country and the first ever in the \nworld to protect a cave. Later, Wind Cave officials were put in charge \nof managing new parks in the Black Hills area, including Devils Tower \nNational Monument and Mount Rushmore National Memorial, until those \nparks established their own management programs.\n  For 100 years, Wind Cave National Park has been one of the jewels of \nthe National Park System. Today, the cave is one of the world's longest \nand most complex cave systems, with more than 103 miles of mapped \ntunnels, with more passageways still being discovered. Indeed, we may \nnever find the cave's end. Cavers and tourists from around the world \nare attracted by the cave's unique boxwork, a honeycomb-shaped \nformation that covers the cave's ceilings and walls. And while that \npark's namesake is its focal point, the land above the cave is equally \nimpressive, with 28,000 acres of rolling meadows, majestic forests, \ncreeks, and streams. As one of the few remaining mixed-grass prairie \necosystems in the country, the park is home to abundant wildlife, such \nas bison, deer, elk and birds, and is a National Game Preserve.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, last year, I introduced the Wind \nCave National Park Boundary Revision Act. This legislation would \nenhance Wind Cave National Park's value to the public and help visitors \nenjoy it even more by expanding the park in it's southern ``keyhole'' \nregion. This land currently is owned by a ranching family that wants to \nsee it preserved for future generations. The land is a natural \nextension of the park, with mixed-grass prairie and ponderosa pine \nforests set off by a dramatic river canyon. The area also boasts \narchaeological sites, such as a buffalo jump over which early Native \nAmericans once drove the bison they hunted. The addition of this land \nwould enhance recreation for hikers who come for the solitude of the \npark's backcountry.\n  Wind Cave National Park is a national treasure, and I can think of no \nbetter way to help the park enter its next century than by approving \nthis expansion. The Senate approved the expansion last November, but \nunfortunately, it was not considered by the House before Congress \nadjourned for the year. I intend to reintroduce this legislative soon, \nand hope that my colleagues will again support its passage so we can \npermanently protect these extraordinary lands for future generations of \nAmericans to enjoy.\n  I congratulate the National Park Service and the staff of Wind Cave \nNational Park on the centennial of the park's founding, and wish them \nall the best for the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S126-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING JIM SEARS OF INDIANAPOLIS, IN\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jim Sears, a \nfellow Hoosier, an Indiana State Police officer, a family man and a \nfriend, who passed away on December 31, 2002.\n  As those who knew Trooper Sears would attest, his strong commitment \nto the city of Indianapolis was reflected in his distinguished career. \nIn 1962, he became the first African American to wear an Indiana State \nPolice uniform. He opened doors for other African Americans who aspired \nto become State Police officers and to break through barriers of all \nkinds. Marion County's first African American Sheriff, Frank Anderson \nwas a classmate of Sears' at Short Ridge High School in 1956 and was \nwith him on the day they both went downtown to apply for the force. \nState Police Superintendent Melvin Carraway referred to Sears as ``our \nmentor.''\n  Jim Sears' life was an example of kindness, gentleness and \nperseverance in the face of constant prejudice. His guiding principle \nwas to protect the dignity of the public, especially those whom he was \nforced to deal with for legal infractions. He once shared that if he \ncaught someone speeding, he would ask the person to step out of the car \nif children were present in an attempt to protect the children from \nwitnessing their parent in an embarrassing situation.\n  Trooper Sears sought to keep others from humiliation, although often \nhe was the recipient of cold, disparaging treatment from fellow \ntroopers and the public because of the color of his skin. Not easily \ndiscouraged Trooper Sears remained a perfectionist and a stickler for \nregulations, allowing others to benefit from his shining example. In \n1976, Trooper Sears and a group of other Black troopers settled a \nracial discrimination lawsuit with the State Police, which subsequently \nagreed to recruit and promote minorities. ``Despite the bad things that \nhappened, I'd do it all over again,'' Trooper Sears said after the \nsettlement. ``Because someone had to straighten out this mess of people \nnot being hired strictly on color. I helped open the door.''\n  After 15 years as a trooper, Jim Sears was transferred to the job he \ncalled ``the highlight of his career,'' serving on the security detail \nfor Gov. Otis Bowen from 1977 to 1980. After that detail, Sears was \nhead of the department's planning arm when he retired in 1992 after 30 \nyears of service. After retirement, Jim Sears graduated from Indiana \nUniversity-Purdue University of Indianapolis and worked for the Indiana \nBureau of Motor Vehicles.\n  Trooper Jim Sears opened doors for those who followed. He was a true \nleader and humanitarian whom the city of Indianapolis and the State of \nIndiana will miss tremendously.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to the late Jim Sears for his lifelong \nservice to Indiana and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S126-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S126-S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE 70TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF MILLARD AND HATTYE \n                               MAE BIDDLE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \n70th wedding anniversary of my dear friends Millard and Hattye Mae \nBiddle. Our friendship has spanned some three decades. I want to \ncongratulate them on behalf of all Delawareans wish them both the very \nbest in all that lies ahead.\n  As they celebrate this milestone in their lives, they will surely \nreflect on the many changes, successes, and accomplishments they have \nexperienced together over the last 70 years. Theirs is a journey of \nwhich they can be proud.\n  The Biddles have lived in the Dover community for many years. For a \nnumber of those years, they owned a bed and breakfast in Wyoming, DE. \nAt the start of my career, I worked in Kent County and lived in New \nCastle County in the northern part of out State. Their trademark \nhospitality was in full swing. I stayed so often as their guest, they \nfinally gave me my own bedroom and a key to the House! They have always \nmade me feel like a member of their family, and their home became, in \nmany ways, mine as well.\n  Both Millard and Hattye Mae have lived their lives in the service of \nothers. Long before it was popular, Hattye Mae recognized the \ntremendous need for early childhood education for kindergartners and \npreschool children in Kent County. She started a successful preschool \ncalled the Little School. Both the school and its students--hundreds of \nthem--have grown up, stronger under her watchful eye.\n  Hattye Mae volunteers at the Old State House in Dover, giving tours \nto the many visitors. She has served as a member of the board of \ndirectors and is now an honorary member of the Board of Directors of \nKent/Sussex Industries, a nonprofit organization that provides work \nopportunities for Delawareans each year. And no July in Harrington is \ncomplete without seeing her sweet smile at the annual Delaware State \nFair.\n  Millard started his career delivering milk for the Frear Milk \nCompany. After serving in World War II, Millard opened a grocery store. \nHe returned to public service as a Kent County assessor shortly \nthereafter, from which he happily retired.\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\n  Millard served as a member of the Dover Housing Authority and served \ntwo terms on the Dover City Council. He is, in fact, the oldest living \nformer council member. Millard has enjoyed many hours giving tours at \nthe E.R. Johnson Victrola Museum in Dover, reading about the talking \nmachines, records and other relics of the Victor Talking Machine \nCompany of Eldridge R. Johnson Manufacturing Machinists. A wiz at clock \nmaking, Millard enjoys using old Victrola records and transforming them \ninto clocks. They are, by all accounts, incredibly impressive.\n  Today, I rise to congratulate Millard and Hattye Mae on their 70th \nwedding anniversary. In a day and age where many marriages do not last \n70 months or even 70 weeks, the strength and durability of their union \nserves as a source of inspiration to us all. In addition, each of them \nhas demonstrated great devotion to their family, three children, nine \ngrandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, and to their community in \ntoo many ways to number. I know that their years together hold many \nbeautiful memories. It is my hope that those ahead will be filled with \ncontinued joy and contentment. They give true meaning to the words of \nthe poet who wrote, ``Grow old along with me, the best is yet to \nbe.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S127-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMES R. TILLING\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \npay tribute to James R. Tilling, who is retiring after 33 years of \nservice to the State of Ohio.\n  Mr. Tilling came to Ohio in September, 1969 to begin a career as a \npolitical science professor at my alma mater, Ohio University in \nAthens. He spent 6 years at Ohio University where he taught courses in \nAmerican national government, urban government and politics, and Soviet \ngovernment and foreign policy. In academic year 1973-1974, he was named \na ``University Professor,'' an honor given each year to the 10 best \nteaching professors at Ohio University.\n  Following his tenure as a distinguished Ohio University professor in \n1977, Mr. Tilling joined public service, as director of communications \nand research of the Ohio Senate's Republican caucus. He served twice as \nminority chief of staff, in 1979 to 1980 and 1983 to 1984. He was \nelected clerk of the senate for 1981 to 1982.\n  From January 1984 until April 1994, Mr. Tilling served as chief \nexecutive officer of the senate under then-senate presidents Paul \nGillmor and Stanley J. Aronoff. In that capacity, he was responsible \nfor the day-to-day operation of the senate's staff and also worked with \nsenate Republican members to develop their legislative policy agenda.\n  Through the years, Mr. Tilling made significant contributions which \nhelped improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Ohio \nLegislature. For example, in 1981 and 1992, he was the principal \ncoauthor of the bipartisan congressional redistricting plans which \ndetermined congressional district boundaries for the 1980s and 1990s. \nIn 1991, he served as the secretary for to the Ohio Apportionment \nBoard, where he helped craft the districting plan for the Ohio General \nAssembly in the last decade.\n  In addition to creating the redistricting plans that have been in \neffect for 20 years, Mr. Tilling has been a key advisor in major policy \ndebates in the Ohio Legislature, he has recruited candidates to run for \nthe U.S. Congress and he has the regard of legislators and policymakers \non both sides of the aisle.\n  I worked with him and appreciated his contributions when I was \nGovernor of Ohio during the 1990s. For the past 7 years Mr. Tilling has \nserved as chief of staff and chief policy advisor to Ohio Attorney \nGeneral Betty D. Montgomery. I recruited Betty Montgomery to run for \nattorney general and I know how valuable Mr. Tilling has been to her \nover the years.\n  James R. Tilling has over three decades of dedicated and \ndistinguished public service to the people of Ohio and our Nation. I \ncommend his intellect and his passion for public service which have \ninspired colleagues and students alike. His contributions are \nlonglasting and should be emulated for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S127-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the American people are facing \ndifficult economic times. The unemployment rate is at a 9-year high, \nand a growing number of both skilled and unskilled American workers are \nleft without jobs and without a way to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  I am so pleased that we finally passed S. 23 on Tuesday, which \nprovides a 5-month extension of the Temporary Extended Unemployment \nCompensation Act of 2002, and that the House passed it also. I believe \nthat it was critical for the Congress to address the issue or expiring \nunemployment insurance benefits on the very first day of the 108th \nCongress. Actually, if we had had it our way, my Democratic colleagues \nand I would have delivered this aid to unemployed workers last year \nbefore 780,000 workers had their benefits cut off. At the end of the \nlast Congress, Democrats asked for unanimous consent eight times to \npass a bill that would provide benefits for workers who were cut off \nfrom their benefits on December 28, for workers who had not yet \nreceived the extension, and for workers who had run out of their State \nand Federal benefits and had not yet found a new job. But each time \nRepublicans objected to this proposal. An agreement was finally reached \nbetween Senate Democrats and Republicans in December, but the Senate \nagreement was rejected by House Republicans.\n  S. 23 will help millions of Americans, 91,000 in Massachusetts alone, \nbut there is one deserving group that it won't help, the more than 1 \nmillion unemployed workers who have already exhausted their State and \nFederal unemployment benefits. On Tuesday, Senator Reed asked that the \nSenate not adjourn until it address the issue of unemployment insurance \nbenefits for workers who have already exhausted their benefits. \nUnfortunately, I was not present for Tuesday's vote because I was \ndetained at a doctor's appointment, but had I been present I would have \nvoted in favor of continuing the debate until we addressed the needs of \nthe long-term unemployed.\n  Over 2 million people's benefits have expired since the passage of \nthe Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Program in March 2001. \nOf those 2 million, 1 million are still working hard to find jobs. \nThere are 1.5 million fewer jobs today than there were in March 2001 \nand the economy remains weak. I have heard from so many of my \nconstituents about how difficult it is to find jobs in this economic \nclimate. Twenty percent of America's unemployed have been without work \nfor more than 26 weeks, and the percentage is still growing. We must \nnot leave the long-term unemployed and their families with no where to \nturn.\n  We have taken an important first step to help unemployed workers. But \nwe have not done nearly enough. And I will continue to urge my \ncolleagues to take action to help the long-term unemployed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S127-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S127-S128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BOB POTTER\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to day to congratulate Bob \nPotter, president of Jobs Plus in Coeur d'Alene, ID, on his retirement \nand a job well done.\n  Idaho found Bob Potter after he retired the last time enjoying life \nat his home on Hayden Lake. Thankfully, we had a few good salesmen in \nNorth Idaho who drew him out of retirement to head Jobs Plus, the then-\nnew economic development corporation for Kootenai County. Over the past \n16 years, Bob has done a stellar job. Jobs Plus, under his leadership, \nhas recruited over 70 companies that employ over 3,500 workers with a \npayroll just shy of $100 million. What a tremendous benefit to North \nIdaho.\n  Bob always jokes that the Governor of California ought to be on his \nboard because no one does more for his recruitment. However, the truth \nof the matter is that Bob's tireless efforts to recruit small and \nmedium size businesses is what gets results. The key to sales is to \nshow someone they have a need and that your product will meet it. Yes, \nCalifornia's business climate has created a need for businesses to \nlower costs, and Idaho is the perfect place to come to do that. \nHowever, folks wouldn't know about that unless Bob Potter was knocking \non their doors.\n  Over the years, I have answered many a call from Bob to help recruit,\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\nand I have visited many of the businesses that have chosen Idaho.

Mr. President, officially, the Congress that ended in \nDecember was the 107th Congress. But history will almost surely record \nit as the September 11th Congress. From the moment the first plane hit \nthe first tower until the last moments of the lameduck session, helping \nAmerica recover from that horrific day, bringing its plotters to \njustice and making changes to protect America from future terrorist \nattacks dominated the Senate's agenda.\n  We continued that work--even as we confronted unprecedented \nchallenges in the Senate: anthrax, the rise of new threats to our \nNation, and the loss of\n\n[[Page S135]]\n\nour friend and colleague, Paul Wellstone.\n  Through tragic and historic events, the 107th Senate under Democratic \ncontrol produced a number of important legislative accomplishments: \naviation security and counterterrorism legislation; the toughest \ncorporate accountability law since the SEC was created in 1934; the \nmost far-reaching campaign finance reforms since Watergate; the most \nsignificant overhaul of Federal education policies since 1965; and a \nnew farm bill to replace the failed Freedom to Farm Act.\n  However, other important legislation fell victim to special-interest \narm-twisting, and the other party's unwillingness to compromise on \ntheir proposals, or even consider ours. We saw that on proposals to \ndedicate greater resources to homeland security, a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, and a real, enforceable patients' bill of \nrights.\n  The proposals we are introducing today recognize that the American \npeople have real concerns about their security, and that Republicans \nand the Bush administration have not done enough to address those \nconcerns.\n  But they also recognize that security means more than national \nsecurity, and homeland security. It means economic security, retirement \nsecurity, and the security of knowing that our children are getting a \ngood education, and that, if you get sick, health care is available and \naffordable. It means giving people who work fulltime the security of \nknowing they can earn a decent wage--whether they work on a farm, in a \nfactory, or at a fast-food restaurant. It is the security of knowing \nthat our air is safe to breathe and our water is safe to drink, that \nAmerica is living up to its commitment to civil rights, and that we are \nkeeping our promises to our veterans.\n  Democrats are committed to tackling terrorism abroad, and making our \ncountry more secure.\n  One of our first priorities will be to make Americans safer by \nenhancing protections for our ports, borders, food and water supplies, \nand chemical and nuclear plants.\n  We are introducing a bill to commit real resources to doing all of \nthose things, and to hiring more police and first responders and \nproviding them the tools and training to do the difficult jobs we are \nnow asking them to do.\n  We also recognize that national strength also depends on economic \nstrength, and in the last 2 years, America's economy has weakened. In \nthe coming weeks, we will put forward our ideas for how best to \nstimulate the economy in the short term.\n  But, in the long term, one of the most important things we can do is \ngive people greater confidence that their private pensions will be \nthere for them. That is why another of our leadership bills is one to \nstrengthen pension protections, expand pension coverage, and crack down \non rogue corporations.\n  It has been said that almost every problem any society faces can be \nsolved with two things: good health, and a good education--and we have \nbills in each of those areas.\n  The Right Start for Children Act makes Head Start fully available for \n4- and 5-year-olds, and increases availability for infants and \ntoddlers. It will help improve childcare quality, make childcare more \naffordable for 1 million additional children, and strengthen child \nnutrition programs to reduce child hunger.\n  The Educational Excellence for All Learners Act builds on that \nfoundation by improving education every step of the way--from \nkindergarten, to college, to lifelong learning. It makes sure that we \nmatch the real reforms we passed last year with the real resources they \ndemand. It will help us recruit, hire, and train qualified teachers, \nbuild new schools, and make college and job training more affordable \nand more available.\n  President Bush pledged to leave no child behind, and then proposed \nmore than a billion dollars of education cuts. We are proposing to put \nour money where the Republicans' mouths are--and help secure a good \nstart, a good education, and good prospects for all Americans.\n  When it comes to health care, it was an outrage that 40 million \nAmericans were uninsured 2 years ago. In the past year, over 1 million \nmore Americans have lost health insurance. And those who are lucky \nenough to have health insurance are seeing their premiums skyrocket.\n  With the Health Care Coverage Expansion and Quality Improvement Act, \nwe hope to reduce the number of uninsured by making health care \ncoverage more available to small businesses, parents of children \neligible for CHIP and Medicaid, pregnant women, and others.\n  We also want to improve the quality of care people receive by \novercoming Republican resistance to a real, enforceable, patients' bill \nof rights.\n  We will also insist that mental illness be treated like any other \nillness--something that will not only honor Paul Wellstone's legacy, \nbut also help millions of families.\n  We are also committed to passing a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare, and lowering the price of prescription drugs for all \nAmericans. Last year, we passed a bill to lower the price of generic \ndrugs, but the House refused to take it up. And we had 52 Senators \nsupport our Medicare prescription drug benefit--but it was blocked on a \nprocedural motion.\n  The high cost of prescription drugs--combined with the increasing \nneed for such drugs--is destroying the life savings--and threatening \nthe dignity--of millions of older Americans. And that is simply \nunacceptable.\n  A couple of months ago in elections all across the country, and in \nwords spoken here in the Senate, we have seen that when it comes to \nprotecting equal rights, we still have a lot of work to do in changing \nhearts, minds, and laws.\n  That is why we are introducing The Equal Rights and Equal Dignity for \nAmericans Act. This bill will enforce employment nondiscrimination, \nfund the election-reform measures we passed last year, outlaw hate \ncrimes, and take other steps to see that as a nation, we live up to the \npromise of equal rights.\n  I hope those Republicans who have recently expressed their support \nfor civil rights will join us in expressing their support for this \nlegislation. I also hope they will join us in supporting our bill to \ncombat drug and gun violence, to crack down on new crimes like identity \ntheft, and to protect against and prevent crimes against children and \nseniors.\n  We also need to ensure greater dignity for our minimum wage workers, \nour farmers, and our veterans. The purchasing power of the minimum wage \nis now the lowest it has been in more than 30 years. And a full-time \nminimum wage income won't get you over the poverty line. If we can \nafford over a trillion dollars in tax cuts for those at the top of the \nincome scale, we can afford a dollar fifty more an hour for those at \nthe bottom.\n  We need to help our rural economy, and help those impacted by a \ndrought and other natural disasters that are being called among the \ncostliest for agricultural producers in our Nation's history.\n  And we need to maintain our commitment to those currently serving, \nand keep our promises to our veterans. One way we do that is by \nallowing our wounded veterans to receive both their full disability and \nretirement benefits. Another way is by addressing the current crisis in \nveterans' health care. With each of these proposals--we stand with the \nleading veterans organizations, and for those who served our country.\n  Finally, we are committed to stopping what is adding up to an all-out \nassault on our environment. By unilaterally abandoning the Kyoto \nprocess, the Bush administration took us out of position to lead the \nworld on the issue of climate change. The Global Climate Security Act \nwill help America reassert our position of world leadership on this \nvital issue of world health.\n  Each of these things is relevant, not revolutionary. If they seem \nfamiliar, it is because most of what is in them has been introduced \nbefore.\n  But they are not law, despite the support of the American people and, \nin some cases, a bipartisan majority of Senators.\n  They have been opposed by an extreme few, and their special interest \nsupporters. And while those bills have languished, we have seen the \nrise of more threats to our country; more people have lost their jobs \nand their health care; and more of our national challenges have gone \nunmet.\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\n  These are our priorities. In the last couple of days, the President \nhas made clear his priorities--more tax cuts for those who need them \nleast.\n  The President's plan won't help middle income families. It won't \ncontribute to economic growth; it won't make our homeland more secure; \nit won't expand educational opportunity for the young, or strengthen \nhealth care for the elderly.\n  Instead--by putting us deeper into deficit and debt--it makes all of \nthese things, and all of our other goals, harder to achieve.\n  Our bills will help us create an America that is stronger, safer, and \nbetter for all Americans--and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Biden, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dayton, \n        Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 22. A bill to enhance domestic security, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator Daschle \nand other Democratic Senators in introducing the Justice Enhancement \nand Domestic Security Act of 2003. This comprehensive crime bill builds \non prior Democratic crime initiatives, including the landmark Violent \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, that worked to bring the \ncrime rate down.\n  This year marked an unfortunate turn after a decade of remarkable \ndeclines in the Nation's crime rate. The decade of progress we made \nunder the leadership of a Democratic President helped revitalize our \ncities and restore a sense of security for millions of Americans. \nAccording to the latest FBI report, however, the number of murders, \nrapes, robberies, assaults, and property crimes is up across the United \nStates in all regions of the country except the Northeast, the first \nyear-to-year increase since 1991. This upswing has been fueled by the \nfaltering economy and high unemployment rates. The President's ill-\nconceived tax cut in 2001, along with the new cuts he proposes now, are \nlikely to exacerbate these economic woes by plunging us deeper into \ndeficit spending.\n  It is troubling that, at this crucial moment, the Bush Administration \nis proposing to reduce by nearly 80 percent the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services, COPS, program that has helped to put 115,000 new \npolice officers on the beat since 1994. I believe that we must fight to \nmaintain and extend the COPS program, which has proven its value in \nincreasing the security of our cities, towns, and neighborhoods.\n  The Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act is designed to get \nour Nation's crime rates moving downward, in the right direction, \nagain. It also aims to bolster our security against terrorists, and to \nimprove the administration of justice throughout the country.\n  This bill shows the way to making Americans safer. That objective \nwill not be achieved by partisan posturing, ``tough on crime'' \nrhetoric, and a few executions. It will be achieved by giving law \nenforcement the tools they need to do their job, focusing on both \nimmediate and long-term threats we face, and protecting the most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  Most importantly, we should not divert all our attention to fighting \nforeign terrorism and foreign wars only to discover that the safety of \nAmericans at home is jeopardized by losing the fight on crime. \nUnfortunately, the rising crime rate shows the risk of not paying \nattention to the domestic crime issue. The safety of our schools, \nhomes, streets, neighborhoods and communities cannot become a casualty \nof the economic downturn and our international engagements.\n  Among other things, the bill does the following: Provides $12 billion \nover three years to support public safety officers in their efforts to \nprotect homeland security and prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. \nIncreases border security by authorizing funds for additional INS \npersonnel and technology. Provides statutory authority for the \nPresident to use military tribunals to try suspected terrorists in \nappropriate circumstances. Targets crime against the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society: children and senior citizens. Combats the \ninsidious crime of identity theft. Provides enhanced rights and \nprotections for crime victims. Extends the COPS program and authorizes \nlaw enforcement improvement and training grants for rural communities. \nIncreases funding to reduce the backlog of untested DNA evidence in the \nNation's crime labs. Proposes important reforms to FBI policies on \nwhistleblowers and other issues critical to our security. Cracks down \non war criminals from other nations seeking sanctuary in the United \nStates. Protects against the execution of innocent individuals.\n  In sum, the bill represents an important next step in the continuing \neffort by Senate Democrats to enhance homeland security and to enact \ntough yet balanced reforms to our criminal justice system.\n  I should note that the bill contains no new death penalties and no \nnew or increased mandatory minimum sentences. We can be tough without \nimposing the death penalty, and we can ensure swift and certain \npunishment without removing all discretion from the judge at \nsentencing.\n  As we provide the necessary tools for Federal law enforcement \nofficials to protect our homeland security, we must remember that State \nand local law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency \npersonnel are our full partners in preventing, investigating and \nresponding to criminal and terrorist acts.\n  As a former State prosecutor, I know that public safety officers are \noften the first responders to a crime. On September 11, the Nation saw \nthat the first on the scene were the heroic firefighters, police \nofficers and emergency personnel in New York City. These real-life \nheroes, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, remind us of how \nimportant it is to support our State and local public safety partners.\n  Subtitle A of title I of the Justice Enhancement and Domestic \nSecurity Act establishes a First Responders Partnership Grant program, \nwhich will provide $4 billion in annual grants for each of the next \nthree years to support our State and local law enforcement officers in \nthe war against terrorism. First Responder Grants will be made directly \nto State and local governments and Indian tribes for equipment, \ntraining and facilities to support public safety officers in their \nefforts to protect homeland security and prevent and respond to acts of \nterrorism. Grants may be used to pay up to 90 percent of the cost of \nthe equipment, training or facility, and each State will be guaranteed \na fair minimum amount. This is essential Federal support that our State \nand local public safety officers need and deserve.\n  Our State and local public safety law enforcement partners welcome \nthe challenge to join in our national mission to protect our homeland \nsecurity. But we cannot ask State and local law enforcement officers, \nfirefighters and emergency personnel to assume these new national \nresponsibilities without also providing new Federal support. The First \nResponders Partnership Grants will provide the necessary Federal \nsupport for our State and public safety officers to serve as full \npartners in our fight to protect homeland security and respond to acts \nof terrorism.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Subtitle B of title I provides for additional increases in INS \npersonnel and improvements in INS technology to guard our borders. Just \nin the last few weeks, we have seen reports suggesting that numerous \naliens crossed our Northern border illegally with the intention of \nplanning terrorist act. Through the USA PATRIOT Act and the Enhanced \nBorder Security and Visa Reform Act, we have attempted to bolster our \nborders by creating additional positions. But our work is not done. \nThis legislation would authorize such sums as may be necessary for the \nINS to hire an additional 250 inspectors and associated support staff, \nand an additional 250 investigative staff and associated support staff, \nduring each fiscal year through FY2007. It would also authorize $250 \nmillion to the INS for the purposes of making improvements in \ntechnology for improving border security and facilitating the flow of \ncommerce and persons at ports of entry, including improving and \nexpanding programs for preenrollment and preclearance. Finally, this \nsubtitle requires the Attorney General to report\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\nto Congress about the Department's implementation of the border \nimprovements we have already legislated, and about his recommendations \nfor any additional improvements.\n\n\n                  Military Tribunal Authorization Act\n\n  On November 13, 2001, President Bush signed a military order \nauthorizing the use of military commissions to try suspected \nterrorists. This order stimulated an important national debate and led \nto a series of Judiciary Committee hearings with the Attorney General \nand others to discuss the many legal, constitutional, and policy \nquestions raised by the use of such tribunals. Our hearings, and the \ncontinued public discourse, helped to clarify the scope of the \nPresident's order and better define the terms of the debate.\n  Administration officials have taken the position that the President \ndoes not need the sanction of Congress to convene military commissions, \nbut I disagree. Military tribunals may be appropriate under certain \ncircumstances, but only if they are backed by specific congressional \nauthorization. At a minimum, as the distinguished senior senator from \nPennsylvania stated on this floor on November 15, ``the executive will \nbe immeasurably strengthened if the Congress backs the President.'' \nClearly, our government is at its strongest when the executive and \nlegislative branches of government act in concert.\n\n  Subtitle C of title I, the Military Tribunal Authorization Act of \n2003 would provide the executive branch with the specific authorization \nit now lacks to use extraordinary tribunals to try members of the al \nQaeda terrorist network and those who cooperated with them. \nSpecifically, this legislation authorizes the use of ``extraordinary \ntribunals'' for al Qaeda members and for persons aiding and abetting al \nQaeda in terrorist activities against the United States who are \napprehended in, or fleeing from, Afghanistan. It also authorizes the \nuse of tribunals for those al Qaeda members and abettors who are \ncaptured in any other place where there is armed conflict involving the \nU.S. Armed Forces.\n  The Military Tribunal Authorization Act defines the jurisdiction and \nprocedure of tribunals in a way that ensures a ``full and fair'' trial \nfor anyone detained. It incorporates basic due process guarantees, \nincluding the right to independent counsel. These procedures do not as \nsome have claimed provide greater protections to suspected terrorists \nthan we offer our own soldiers. These are rather, the very basic \nguarantees provided under various sources of international law. \nFinally, the bill comes down squarely on the side of transparency in \ngovernment by providing that tribunal proceedings should be open and \npublic, and include public availability of the transcripts of the trial \nand the pronouncement of judgment. Passage of authorizing legislation \nwould ensure the constitutionality of military tribunals and protect \nany convictions they might yield, while at the same time showing the \nworld that we will fight terrorists without sacrificing our principles.\n  Title I of our bill would also provide a new tool for law enforcement \nto deal with the problem of serious hoaxes and malicious false reports \nrelating to the use of biological, chemical, nuclear, or other weapons \nof mass destruction. These so-called ``hoaxes'' inflict both mental and \neconomic damage on victims. They drain away scarce law enforcement \nresources from the investigation of real terrorist activity. They \ninterrupt vital communication facilities. Finally, they feed a public \nfear that the vast majority of law abiding Americans are working hard \nto dispel.\n  Federal, State, and local law enforcement already have statutes which \nthey have been using aggressively to prosecute those who have taken \nadvantage of these times to perpetrate hoaxes about anthrax \ncontamination. Existing statutes create serious penalties for threats \nto use biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, for sending any \nthreatening communication through the mail, or for making a willful \nfalse statement of Federal authorities. Indeed, current Federal threat \nlaws do not require that the defendant have either the intent or \npresent ability to carry out a threat. However, while they carry high \npenalties, including a maximum of life imprisonment, these statutes can \nsometimes be awkward when applied in the hoax context.\n  The Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act provides a well-\ntailored statute that deals specifically with the problem of \nbiological, chemical, nuclear and other mass destruction hoaxes. For \ninstance, it gives prosecutors a means to distinguish between a person \nwho is actually threatening to use anthrax on a victim, and a person \nwho never intends to use it, but wants the victim or the police to \nthink they have done so. Another provision provides for mandatory \nrestitution to any victim of these crimes, including the costs of any \nand all government response to the hoax. An earlier Administration \nproposal, offered during the debate over the terrorism bill, would have \nlimited such restitution to the Federal government. As we know all too \nwell from recent events, however, it is State and local authorities, \nalong with private victims, who are often the first responders and \nprimary victims when these incidents occur. Our bill provides a \nmechanism so that they, too, can be reimbursed for their expenses.\n  The second title of the Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act \ncontains a several proposals aimed at protecting the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society: children and seniors.\n  First, part 1 of subtitle A would enhance the operation of the AMBER \nAlert communications network in order to aid the recovery of abducted \nchildren. It is disturbing to see on TV or in the newspapers photo \nafter photo of missing children from every corner of the Nation. As the \nfather of three Children, as well as a grandfather of two, I know that \nan abducted child is a parent's or grandparent's worst nightmare.\n  Unfortunately, it appears this nightmare occurs all too often. \nIndeed, the Justice Department estimates that the number of children \ntaken by strangers annually is between 3,000 and 4,000. These parents \nand grandparents, as well as the precious children, deserve the \nassistance of the American people and helping hand of the Congress.\n  The AMBER Plan was created as a reaction to the kidnapping and brutal \nmurder of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman of Arlington, Texas, By \ncoordinating their efforts, law enforcement, emergency management and \ntransportation agencies, radio and television stations, and cable \nsystems have worked to develop an innovative early warning system to \nhelp find abducted children by broadcasting information including \ndescriptions and pictures of the missing child, the suspected abductor, \na suspected vehicle, and any other information available and valuable \nto identifying the child and suspect to the public as speedily as \npossible.\n  The AMBER Alert system's popularity has raced across the United \nStates: since the original AMBER Plan was established in 1996, 55 \nmodified versions have been adopted at local, regional, and statewide \nlevels. Eighteen States have already implemented statewide plans. It is \nalso a proven success: to date, the AMBER Plan has been credited with \nrecovering 30 children.\n  The National AMBER Alert Network Act of 2003 directs the Attorney \nGeneral, in cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation and the \nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to appoint a Justice \nDepartment National AMBER Alert Coordinator to oversee the Alert's \ncommunication network for abducted children. The AMBER Alert \nCoordinator will work with States, broadcasters, and law enforcement \nagencies to set up AMBER plans, serve as a point of contact to \nsupplement existing AMBER plans, and facilitate regional coordination \nof AMBER alerts. In addition, the AMBER Alert Coordinator will work \nwith the FCC, local broadcasters, and local law enforcement agencies to \nestablish minimum standards for the issuance of AMBER alerts and for \nthe extent of their dissemination. In sum, our bill will help kidnap \nvictims while preserving flexibility for the States in implementing the \nAlert system.\n  Because developing and enhancing the AMBER Alert system is a costly \nendeavor for States to take on alone, our bill establishes two Federal \ngrant programs to share the burden. First, the bill creates a Federal \ngrant program, under the direction of the Secretary of Transportation, \nfor statewide notification and communications systems, including \nelectronic message\n\n[[Page S138]]\n\nboards and road signs, along highways for alerts and other information \nregarding abducted children. Second, the bill establishes a grant \nprogram managed by the Attorney General for the support of AMBER Alert \ncommunications plans with law enforcement agencies and others in the \ncommunity.\n  Similar legislation was proposed in the last Congress by Senators \nFeinstein and Hutchison and approved by both the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the full Senate by unanimous consent only one week after \nintroduction. When the bill passed, it had garnered 41 cosponsors from \nboth sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, despite our great efforts to \nhave the bill passed on its own merits, the House failed to pass it as \na stand-alone bill. Instead, it was included in a larger package of \nbills dubbed the Child Abduction Prevention Act, introduced by \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner. Most of the incorporated \nbills had passed the House but were stalled in the Senate due to \ncontroversial language.\n  Our Nation's children, parents, and grandparents deserve our help to \nstop the disturbing trend of child abductions. The AMBER Alert National \nNetwork Act ensures that our communications systems help rescue \nabducted children from kidnappers and return them safely to their \nfamilies.\n  Subtitle A of title II also includes the Protecting Our Children \nComes First Act of 2003, which would double funding for the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, (NCMEC), reauthorize the \nCenter through fiscal year 2006, and increase Federal support to help \nNCMEC programs find missing children.\n  As the Nation's top resource center for child protection, the NCMEC \nspearheads national efforts to locate and recover missing children and \nraises public awareness about ways to prevent child abduction, \nmolestation, and sexual exploitation, As a national voice and advocate \nfor those too young to vote or speak up for their own rights, the NCMEC \nworks to make our children safer. The Center operates under a \nCongressional mandate and works in cooperation with the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in \ncoordinating the efforts of law enforcement officers, social service \nagencies, elected officials, judges, prosecutors, educators, and the \npublic and private sectors to break the cycle of violence that \nhistorically has perpetuated such needless crimes against children.\n  NCMEC professionals have disturbingly busy jobs, they have worked on \nmore than 90,000 cases of missing and exploited children since its 1984 \nfounding, helping to recover more than 66,000 children. The Center \nraised its recovery rate from 60 percent in the 1980s to 94 percent \ntoday. It set up a nationwide, toll free, 24-hour telephone hotline to \ntake reports about missing children and clues that might lead to their \nrecovery. It also manages a national Child Pornography Tipline to \nhandle calls from individuals reporting the sexual exploitation of \nchildren through the production and distribution of pornography and a \nCyberTipline to process online leads from individuals reporting the \nsexual exploitation of children. It has taken the lead in circulating \nmillions of photographs of missing children, and serves as a vital \nresource for the 17,000 law enforcement agencies located throughout the \nUnited States.\n  Today, the NCMEC is truly a national organization, with its \nheadquarters in Alexandria, Virginia and branch offices in five other \nlocations throughout the country to provide hands-on assistance to \nfamilies of missing children and conduct an array of prevention and \nawareness programs. It has also grown into an international \norganization, establishing the International Division of the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, which works to fulfill the \nHague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. \nThe International Division provides assistance to parents, law \nenforcement, attorneys, nonprofit organizations, and other concerned \nindividuals who are seeking assistance in preventing or resolving \ninternational child abductions.\n  The NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with only a $10 million \nannual grant, which expired at the end of fiscal year 2002. We should \nact now both to extend its authorization and increase the center's \nfunding to $20 million each year through fiscal year 2006 so that it \ncan continue to help keep children safe and families intact around the \nnation. There is so much more to be done to ensure the safety of our \nchildren, and this provision will help the Center in its efforts to \nprevent crimes that are committed against them.\n  The Protecting Our Children Comes First Act also increases Federal \nsupport of NCMEC programs to find missing children by allowing the U.S. \nSecret Service to provide forensic and investigative support to the \nNCMEC. In addition, it facilitates information sharing by allowing \nFederal authorities to share the facts or circumstances of sexual \nexploitation crimes against children with State authorities without a \ncourt order, and by allowing the NCMEC to make reports directly to \nState and local law enforcement officials instead of only through \nFederal agencies.\n  I applaud the ongoing work of the NCMEC and hope both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives will support this effort to provide more \nFederal support for the Center to continue to find missing children and \nprotect exploited children across the country.\n  Finally, subtitle A of title II addresses the problems caused by \nhousing juveniles who are prosecuted in the criminal justice system in \nadult correctional facilities. It assists the States in providing safe \nconditions for their confinement and appropriate access to educational, \nvocational, and health programs. Improving conditions for juveniles \ntoday will improve the public safety in the future, as juveniles who \nare not exposed to adult inmates have a lower likelihood of committing \nfuture crimes.\n  As a Nation, we increasingly rely on adult facilities to house \njuveniles. Nearly all of our States house juveniles in adult jails and \nprisons, and only half maintain designated youthful offender housing \nunits. I believe that there is a will in the States to improve \nconditions for these juveniles, but resources are often lacking. The \nFederal Government can play a useful role by providing funding to \nStates that want to take account of the differences between juveniles \nand adults.\n  Although many juvenile offenders serving time in adult prisons have \ncommitted extraordinarily serious offenses, others are there because of \nrelatively minor crimes and will be released at a young age. Certainly, \nmany of these juveniles can be convinced not to commit further crimes. \nThe social and moral cost of not making that attempt is simply \nincalculable.\n  Many scholars have questioned whether housing juvenile offenders with \nadult inmates serves our long-term interest in public safety. Multiple \nstudies have shown that youth transferred to the adult system \nrecidivate at higher rates and with more serious offenses than youth \nwho have committed similar offenses but are retained in the juvenile \njustice system. We must ensure that juveniles are treated humanely in \nthe criminal justice system to reduce the risks that upon release they \nwill commit additional and more serious crimes. One of the ways we can \ndo that is by helping States improve confinement conditions.\n  Our bill creates a new incentive grant program for State and local \ngovernments and Indian tribes. These grants can be used for the \nfollowing purposes related to juveniles under the jurisdiction of an \nadult criminal court: 1. alter existing correctional facilities, or \ndevelop separate facilities, to provide segregated facilities for them; \n2. provide orientation and ongoing training for correctional staff \nsupervising them; 3. provide monitors who will report on their \ntreatment; and 4. provide them with access to educational programs, \nvocational training, mental and physical health assessment and \ntreatment, and drug treatment. Grants can also be used to seek \nalternatives to housing juveniles with adult inmates, including the \nexpansion of juvenile facilities.\n  It is important to note that States that choose not to house \njuveniles who are convicted as adults with adult inmates are still \neligible for grants under this bill. For example, they could use the \nmoney to train staff, or to provide education or other program for \njuveniles, or to improve juvenile facilities.\n  In addition to these grants, part 5 of subtitle II reauthorizes the \nFamily\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nUnity Demonstration Project, which provides funding for projects \nallowing eligible prisoners who are parents to live in structured, \ncommunity-based centers with their young children. A study by the \nBureau of Justice Statistics found that about two-third of incarcerated \nwomen were parents of children under 18 years old. According to the \nWhite House, on any given day, America is home to 1.5 million children \nof prisoners. And according to Prison Fellowship Industries, more than \nhalf of the juveniles in custody in the United States had an immediate \nfamily member behind bars. This is a serious problem that reauthorizing \nthe Family Unity Demonstration Project will help to address.\n  The remainder of title II includes a number of provisions designed to \nimprove the safety and security of older Americans.\n  During the 1990s, while overall crime rates dropped throughout the \nnation the rate of crime against seniors remained constant. In addition \nto the increased vulnerability of some seniors to violent crime, older \nAmericans are increasingly targeted by swindlers looking to take \nadvantage of them through telemarketing schemes, pension fraud, and \nhealth care fraud. We must strengthen the hand of law enforcement to \ncombat those criminals who plunder the savings that older Americans \nhave worked their lifetime to earn. Subtitle B of title II of our bill, \nthe Seniors Safety Act of 2003, tries to do exactly that, through a \ncomprehensive package of proposals to establish new protections and \nincrease penalties for a wide variety of crimes against seniors.\n  This legislation addresses the most prevalent crimes perpetrated \nagainst seniors, containing proposals to reduce health care fraud and \nabuse, combat nursing home fraud and abuse, prevent telemarketing \nfraud, and safeguard pension and employee benefit plans from fraud, \nbribery, and graft. In addition, this legislation would help seniors \nobtain restitution if their pension plans are defrauded.\n  Many of the proposals in this legislation are just common sense. For \nexample, we would authorize the Attorney General to block telephone \nservice to people using it to commit telemarketing fraud. We would also \nestablish a ``Better Business Bureau'' style clearinghouse at the \nFederal Trade Commission, so that senior citizens and their families \ncould call and find out whether a telemarketer who was bothering them \nhad a criminal record or had received past complaints.\n  We would make it a new criminal offense to engage in multiple willful \nviolations of the regulations or laws that protect nursing home \nresidents. We would also protect employees at nursing homes who blow \nthe whistle on the mistreatment of residents by giving them the power \nto bring a lawsuit for damages if they get fired as a result. And we \nwould tell the Sentencing Commission that if you commit a crime against \nsomeone who is old and vulnerable, you should get a longer sentence.\n  We want to fight health care fraud and pension fraud because these \nare benefits that older Americans have earned and that they count on \neveryday. We must do more to prevent crooks from robbing seniors of \ntheir security. That is why we want to create new criminal penalties \nfor pension fraud and give law enforcement more tools to root out and \nstop health care fraud.\n  The third title of the Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act \ncontains important provisions to prevent and punish identify theft, a \ncrime that victimizes thousands of Americans every year. Once a skilled \nscam artist gets his hands on a consumer's Social Security or bank \naccount number, he can wreak unimaginable havoc on a family's finances.\n  With society conducting more and more of its business electronically, \nthe incidence of identity theft in America is on the rise. In 2001, the \nFederal Trade Commission consumer hotline received 86,000 complaints of \nidentity theft. Through the first six months of 2002, it received \n70,000 such complaints. These complaints are mainly from people who \nhave been hurt by identify theft, but thousands of others come from \nconsumers worried about becoming an identity thief's next victim.\n  Our bill would help identity theft victims restore their credit \nratings and reclaim their good names. It gives victims the tools they \nneed, such as the right to obtain relevant business records and the \nability to have fraudulent charges blocked from reporting in their \nconsumer credit reports. It also includes provisions designed to thwart \nidentity theft, for example by requiring credit card companies to \nnotify consumers of any change of address request on an existing credit \naccount, by ensuring that credit card receipts no longer bear the \nexpiration date or more than the last five digits of the customer's \ncredit card number, and by entitling every citizen to a free credit \nreport once per year upon request. Finally, it includes important \nprovisions to prevent Social Security numbers from being sold, or \npublished without express consent.\n  Title III also represents the next step in Senate Democrats' \ncontinuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of \ncrime. It provides for comprehensive reform of the Federal law to \nestablish enhanced rights and protections for victims of Federal crime. \nAmong other things, it provides crime victims the right to consult with \nthe prosecution prior to detention hearings and the entry of plea \nagreements, and generally requires the courts to give greater \nconsideration to the views and interests of the victim at all stages of \nthe criminal justice process. Responding to concerns raised by victims \nof the Oklahoma City bombing, the bill would provide standing for the \nprosecutor and the victim to assert the right of the victim to attend \nand observe the trial.\n  Assuring that victims are provided their statutorily guaranteed \nrights is a critical concern for all those involved in the \nadministration of justice. That is why the bill establishes an \nadministrative authority in the Department of Justice to receive and \ninvestigate victims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate action on the \npart of criminal justice and victims' service providers. Department of \nJustice employees who fail to comply with the law pertaining to the \ntreatment of crime victims could face disciplinary sanctions, including \nsuspension or termination of employment.\n  In addition to these improvements to the Federal system, the bill \nproposes several programs to help States provide better assistance for \nvictims of State crimes. These programs would improve compliance with \nState victim's rights laws, promote the development of state-of-the-art \nnotification systems to keep victims informed of case developments and \nimportant dates on a timely and efficient basis, and encourage further \nexperimentation with the community-based restorative justice model in \nthe juvenile court setting. The bill also provides assistance for \nshelters and transitional housing for victims of domestic violence.\n  Of particular significance, title III would eliminate the cap on \ndistributions from the Crime Victims Fund, which has prevented millions \nof dollars in Fund deposits from reaching victims and supporting \nessential services. With violent crime on the increase and State \ngovernments struggling to overcome growing budget deficits, crime \nvictim compensation and assistance programs are facing dire threats to \ntheir fiscal stability. We should not be imposing artificial caps on \nspending from the Crime Victims Fund while substantial needs remain \nunmet. Our bill proposes replacing the cap with a self-regulating \nformula, which would ensure stability and protection of Fund assets, \nwhile allowing more money to go out to the States for victim \ncompensation and assistance.\n  While we have greatly improved our crime victims programs and made \nadvances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have more to do. \nThe Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act would help make \nvictims' rights a reality.\n  Title IV of the bill includes proposals for supporting Federal, State \nand local law enforcement and promoting the effective administration of \njustice.\n  An important element of this effort is the COPS program. As noted \nearlier, the Bush Administration has proposed to cut the COPS program \nby nearly 80 percent, despite the success of this program in putting \n115,000 new police officers on the beat since 1994. Title IV extends \nthe COPS program through fiscal year 2008, authorizing funding to \ndeploy up to 50,000 additional police officers, 10,000 additional \nprosecutors, and\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\n10,000 defense attorneys for indigents. It also authorizes $15 million \nper year for five years to help rural communities retain officers hired \nthrough the COPS program for an additional year.\n  In addition, title IV includes the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits \nAct, which would effectively erase any distinction between traumatic \nand occupational injuries when surviving families apply to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice Public Safety Officers Benefits, PSOB, Program. \nThe PSOB fund currently pays just over $260,000 to families of \nfirefighters, police officers and emergency medical technicians who die \nin the line of duty. The survivors of emergency responders who die of \nheart attacks while performing in the line of duty, however, are \nineligible to collect benefits. The Hometown Heroes bill would fix the \nloophole in the PSOB Program to ensure that the survivors of public \nsafety officers who die of heart attacks or strokes in the line of duty \nor within 24 hours of a triggering effect while on duty, regardless of \nwhether a traumatic injury is present at the time of the heart attack \nor stroke, are eligible to receive financial assistance.\n  The families of these brave public servants deserve to participate in \nthe PSOB Program if their loved ones die of a heart attack or other \ncardiac-related ailments while selflessly protecting us from harm. It \nis time for Congress to show its support and appreciation for these \nextraordinarily brave and heroic public safety officers by passing the \nHometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act.\n\n  Title IV would also correct a disparity in the law that denies \nFederal prosecutors the same retirement benefits as other Federal law \nenforcement officers. These lawyers, who are more and more often on the \nfront lines in the war on terrorism, deserve the same benefits as the \nother men and women with whom they work.\n  Also included in title IV of the bill is the FBI Reform Act of 2003, \nwhich stems from the lessons learned during a series of Judiciary \nCommittee hearings on oversight of the FBI that I chaired beginning in \nJune 2001. Even more recently, the important changes which are being \nmade under the FBI's new leadership after the September 11 attacks and \nthe new powers granted the FBI by the USA PATRIOT Act have resulted in \nFBI reform becoming a pressing matter of national importance.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax attacks last \nfall, we have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of \ncatastrophic terrorism that endanger the lives of the American people \nand the institutions of our country. The men and women of the FBI are \nperforming this task with great professionalism at home and abroad. I \nthink that we have all felt safer as a result of the full mobilization \nof the FBI's dedicated Special Agents, its expert support personnel, \nand its exceptional technical capabilities. We owe the men and women of \nthe FBI our thanks.\n  For decades the FBI has been outstanding law enforcement agency and a \nvital member of the United States intelligence community. As our \nhearings and recent events have shown, however, there is room for \nimprovement at the FBI. We must face the mistakes of the past, and make \nthe changes needed to ensure that they are not repeated. In meeting the \ninternational terrorist challenge, the Congress has an opportunity and \nobligation to strengthen the institutional fiber of the FBI based on \nlessons learned from recent problems the Bureau has experienced.\n  The view is not mine alone. When Director Bob Mueller testified at \nhis confirmation hearings in July 2001, he forthrightly acknowledged \n``that the Bureau's remarkable legacy of service and accomplishment has \nbeen tarnished by some serious and highly publicized problems in recent \nyears. Waco, Ruby Ridge, the FBI lab, Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hanssen and \nthe McVeigh documents--these familiar names and events remind us all \nthat the FBI is far from perfect and that the next director faces \nsignificant management and administrative challenges.'' Since then, the \nJudiciary Committee has forged a constructive partnership with Director \nMueller to get the FBI back on track.\n  Congress sometimes has followed a hands-off approach about the FBI. \nBut with the FBI's new increased power, with our increased reliance on \nthem to stop terrorism, and with the increased funding requested in the \nPresident's budget will come increased scrutiny. Until the Bureau's \nproblems are resolved and new challenges overcome, we have to take a \nhands-on approach. Indeed our hearing and other oversight activities \nhave highlighted tangible steps the Congress should take in an FBI \nReform bill as part of this hands-on approach. Among other things, \nthese hearings demonstrated the need to extend whistleblower \nprotection, end the double standard for discipline of senior FBI \nexecutives, and enhance the FBI's internal security program to protect \nagainst espionage as occurred in the Hanssen case.\n  When Director Mueller announced the first stage of his FBI \nreorganization in December 2001, he stressed the importance of taking a \ncomprehensive look at the FBI's missions for the future, and Deputy \nAttorney General Thompson's office has told us that the Attorney \nGeneral's management review of the FBI is considering this matter. \nDirector Mueller has stated that the second phase of FBI \nreorganizations will be part of a ``comprehensive plan to address not \nonly the new challenges of terrorism, but to modernize and streamline \nthe Bureau's more traditional functions.'' Thus, through our hearings, \nour oversight efforts, and the statements and efforts of the new \nmanagement team at the FBI, a list of challenges facing the FBI has \nbeen developed.\n  Our bill addresses each of these challenges. It strengthens \nwhistleblower protection for FBI employees and protects them from \nretaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It addresses the issue of a \ndouble standard for discipline of senior executives by eliminating the \ndisparity in authorized punishments between Senior Executive Service \nmembers and other federal employees. It establishes an FBI \nCounterintelligence Polygraph Program for screening personnel in \nexceptionally sensitive positions with specific safeguards, and an FBI \nCareer Security Program, which would bring the FBI into line with other \nU.S. intelligence agencies that have strong career security \nprofessional cadres whose skills and leadership are dedicated to the \nprotection of agency information, personnel, and facilities. It also \nrequires a set of reports that would enable Congress to engage the \nExecutive branch in a constructive dialogue building a more effective \nFBI for the future.\n  The FBI Reform Act of 2003 is designed to strengthen the FBI as an \ninstitution that has a unique role as both a law enforcement agency and \na member of the intelligence community. As the Judiciary Committee \ncontinues its oversight work and more is learned about recent FBI \nperformance, additional legislation may prove necessary. Especially \nimportant will be the lessons from the attacks of September 11, 2001, \nthe anthrax attacks, and implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act and \nother counterterrorism measures. Strengthening the FBI cannot be \naccomplished overnight, but with this legislation, we take an important \nstep into the future.\n  In addition to protecting, FBI whistleblowers, title IV of this bill \nprovides new and important protections for other whistleblowers who \nprovide information to Congress.\n  The 107th Congress was one of rejuvenated bipartisan oversight. On \nthe Judiciary Committee we convened the first series of comprehensive \nbipartisan FBI oversight hearings in decades after I assumed the \nChairmanship. The Joint Intelligence Committee conducted bipartisan \nhearings to ascertain what shortcomings on the part of our intelligence \ncommunity need to be corrected so as not the allow the 9-11 terrorist \nattacks to recur. The Senate Banking Committee conducted extensive \noversight of the SEC and its relationship with the accounting industry, \nto ascertain whether a new regulatory scheme was required. Both the \nSenate and House Judiciary Committees are still attempting to ascertain \nhow the new powers we provided in the USA PATRIOT Act are being used. \nThese are only a few examples.\n  A vital part of the increased oversight was the courage of the \nwhistleblowers who provided information. Their revelations have led to \nimportant reforms. The Enron scandal and the subsequent hearing led to \nthe most extensive corporate reform legislation\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nin decades, including the criminal provisions and the first ever \ncorporate whistleblower protections, which I authored. The testimony of \nthe rank and file FBI agents that we heard on the Judiciary Committee \nhelped us to craft bipartisan FBI reform legislation. The same day as \nColeen Rowley's nationally televised testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee, President Bush not only reversed his previous opposition to \nestablishing a new cabinet level Department of Homeland Security, but \ngave a national address calling for the largest government \nreorganization in 50 years. In the last year we have learned once again \nthat the public as a whole can benefit from a lone voice. Indeed, Time \nMagazine recognized the courage of these whistleblowers by naming them \nthe ``People of the Year'' for 2002.\n  Unfortunately, the people who very rarely benefit from these \nrevelations are the whistleblowers themselves. We have heard testimony \nin oversight hearings on the Judiciary Committee that there is quite \noften retaliation against those who raise public awareness about \nproblems within large organizations even to Congress. Sometimes the \nretaliation is overt, sometimes it is more subtle and invidious, but it \nis almost always there. The law needs to protect the people who risk so \nmuch to protect us and create a culture that encourages employees to \nreport waste, fraud, and mismanagement.\n  For those who provide information to Congress, that protection is a \nhollow promise. On one hand, the law is very clear that it is illegal \nto interfere with or deny, ``the right of employees, individually or \ncollectively, to petition Congress or a Member of Congress, or to \nfurnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or \nMember thereof . . .'' Amazingly, however, this simple provision is a \nright without a remedy. Employees who are retaliated against for \nproviding information to Congress cannot pursue any avenue of redress \nto protect their statutory rights. The only exception to this applies \nto employees of publicly traded companies, who are now covered by the \nwhistleblower provision included in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that we \npassed last year. Thus, under current law, government whistleblowers \nreporting to Congress have less protection than private industry \nwhistleblowers.\n  Title IV would correct this anomaly by providing government employees \nthat come to Congress with the right to bring an action in court when \nthey suffer the type of retaliation already prohibited under the law. \nThus, it does not create new statutory rights, but merely provides a \nstatutory remedy for existing law. That way, we can promise future \nwhistleblowers who come before Congress that their rights to access the \nlegislative branch is not an illusion. We can also assure the public at \nlarge that our efforts at Congressional oversight and improving the \nfunctions of government will be effective. This legislation is strongly \nsupported by leading whistleblower groups, including the National \nWhistleblower Center and the Government Accountability Project.\n  Title IV of the bill also aims to improve the effective \nadministration of justice by offering a two-pronged attack on sexual \nassault crime in America. First, it adds more Federal resources for \nStates and for the first time, makes those resources directly available \nto local governments as well, so that they may eliminate the backlog of \nuntested DNA samples, and in particular, the troubling backlog of \nuntested rape kits. Second, because tapping the potential of DNA \ntechnology requires more than eliminating existing backlogs, the bill \nprovides increased Federal support for sexual assault examiner \nprograms, DNA training of law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, \nand updating the national DNA database. To ensure that these grants are \neffective, the bill heightens the standards for DNA collection and \nmaintenance, and requires the Department of Justice to promulgate \nnational privacy guidelines. The bill also authorizes the issuance of \nJohn Doe DNA indictments for Federal sexual assault crimes, which toll \nthe applicable statute of limitations and permit prosecution whenever a \nDNA match is made.\n  Congress began to attack the problem of the DNA backlog when it \npassed the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000. That \nlegislation authorized $170 million over four years for grants to \nStates to increase the capacity of their forensic labs and to carry out \nDNA testing of backlogged evidence. Despite the new law and some \nFederal funding, the persistent backlogs nationwide make it plain that \nmore must be done to help the States. Our bill takes the next step and \nprovides more comprehensive assistance so that the criminal justice \nsystem can harness the full power of DNA.\n  A significant problem that arose during Special Prosecutor Kenneth \nStarr's investigation of President Clinton was the loss of \nconfidentiality that had previously attached to the important work of \nthe U.S. Secret Service. The Department of Justice and Treasury and \neven a former Republican President advise that the safety of future \nPresidents may be jeopardized by forcing U.S. Secret Service agents to \nbreach the confidentiality they need to do their job by testifying \nbefore a grand jury. I trust the Secret Service on this issue; they are \nthe experts with the mission of protecting the lives of the President \nand other high-level elected official and visiting dignitaries. I also \nhave confidence in the judgment of former President Bush, who has \nwritten, ``I feel very strongly that [Secret Service] agents should not \nbe made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might \nnot have seen or heard.''\n  Section 4502 of the Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act \nprovides a reasonable and limited protective function privilege so \nfuture Secret Service agents are able to maintain the confidentiality \nthey say they need to protect the lives of the President, Vice \nPresident and visiting heads of state.\n  Title V of this bill would create new treatment and prevention \nprograms to reduce drug abuse, and reauthorize existing successful \nones. Treatment and prevention efforts are often overshadowed by law \nenforcement needs. Indeed, a recent study by the Center on Addiction \nand Substance Abuse showed that of every dollar States spent on \nsubstance abuse and addiction, only four cents went to prevention and \ntreatment. The States and the Federal government have undeniably \nimportant law enforcement obligations, but we must do more to balance \nthose obligations with farsighted efforts to prevent drug crimes from \nhappening in the first place.\n  Heroin is an increasing problem in my State. In other States, \nmethamphetamines or other drugs present a growing challenge. This \nlegislation will help States address their most pressing drug problems, \nand places a particular emphasis on States that may not have been able \nto address their treatment and prevention needs in the past. Indeed, \namong other provisions, the bill offers funding for rural States like \nVermont to establish or enhance treatment centers. It instructs the \nDirector of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to make grants to \npublic and nonprofit private entities that provide treatment and are \napproved by State experts. This will allow the Vermont agencies looking \nto provide heroin treatment--or to prevent heroin abuse in the first \nplace, to acquire Federal funding to help in their efforts.\n  The bill also authorizes funding for residential treatment centers \nthat treat mothers who are addicted to heroin, methamphetamine, or \nother drugs. This will help mothers, and the children who depend on \nthem to rebuild their lives, it will keep families together. And I hope \nit will help avoid further stories like one that appeared in the \nBurlington Free Press in February 2001, in which a young mother told a \nreporter how heroin ``made it easier for [her] to take care of [her] \nkids.''\n  The bill also would fund drug treatment programs for juveniles, who \ncan see their lives quickly deteriorate under the influence of drugs. \nThis is why I have worked to provide Vermont with funding to establish \na long-term residential treatment facility for adolescents. I hope to \ncontinue that effort through this bill, in the hope that we may be able \nto prevent future tragedies.\n  We also would reauthorize substance abuse treatment in Federal \nprisons. It is critical that our prisons be drug-free, both because \nlawbreaking within our correctional system is a national embarrassment, \nand because prisoners who are released while still addicted to\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\ndrugs are far more likely to commit future crimes than prisoners who \nare released sober. At the same time we are extending the `carrot' of \ntreatment opportunities, we also authorize grants to States and \nlocalities for programs supporting comprehensive drug testing of \ncriminal justice populations, and to establish appropriate \ninterventions to illegal drug use for offender populations.\n  Among other additional provisions, we would extend the Safe and Drug-\nFree Schools and Communities Program, and authorize grants to establish \nmethamphetamine prevention and treatment pilot programs in rural areas.\n  I am particularly proud of title VI of the bill--the Innocence \nProtection Act, IPA, of 2003. For nearly three years, I have been \nworking hard with members on both sides of the aisle, and in both \nhouses of Congress, to address the horrendous problem of innocent \npeople being condemned to death. The IPA represents the fruits of those \nefforts. This landmark legislation proposes a number of basic, \ncommonsense reforms to our criminal justice system, aimed at reducing \nthe risk that innocent people will be put to death.\n  We have come many miles since I first introduced the IPA in February \n2000, along with four Democratic co-sponsors. There is now a broad \nconsensus across the country--among Democrats and Republicans, \nsupporters and opponents of the death penalty, liberals and \nconservatives, that our death penalty machinery is broken. We know that \nthe nightmare of innocent people on death row is not just a dream, but \na frequently recurring reality. Since the early 1970s, more than 100 \npeople who were sentenced to death have been released, not because of \ntechnicalities, but because they were innocent. Goodness only knows how \nmany were not so lucky.\n  These are not just numbers; these are real people whose lives were \nruined. Anthony Porter came within two days of execution in 1998; he \nwas exonerated and released from prison only because a class of \njournalism students investigated his case and identified the real \nkiller. Ray Krone spent ten years in prison, including three on death \nrow; he was released last year after DNA testing exculpated him and \npointed to another man as the real killer. These are just two of the \nmany tragedies we learn of every year.\n  Today, Federal judges are voicing concern about the death penalty. \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor has warned that ``the system may well be \nallowing some innocent defendants to be executed.'' Justice Ginsberg \nhas supported a state moratorium on the death penalty. Another \nrespected jurist, Sixth Circuit Judge Gilbert Merritt, has referred to \nthe capital punishment system as ``broken.''\n  We can all agree that there is a grave problem. The good news is, \nthere is also a broad consensus on one important step we must take, we \ncan pass the Innocence Protection Act.\n  At the close of the 107th Congress, the IPA was cosponsored by a \nsubstantial bipartisan majority of the House and by 32 Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle. In addition, a version of the bill had been \nreported by a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It \nis that version of the bill that we introduce today as title VI of the \nJustice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act.\n  What would the IPA do? In short, it proposes two minimum steps that \nwe need to take, not to make the system perfect, but simply to reduce \nwhat is currently an unacceptably high risk of error. First, we need to \nmake good on the promise of modern technology in the form of DNA \ntesting. Second, we need to make good on the constitutional promise of \ncompetent counsel.\n  DNA testing comes first because it is proven and effective. We all \nknow that DNA testing is an extraordinary tool for uncovering the \ntruth, whatever the truth may be. It is the fingerprint of the 21st \nCentury. Prosecutors across the country rightly use it to prove guilt. \nBy the same token, it should also be used to do what it is equally \nscientifically reliable to do, prove innocence.\n  Where there is DNA evidence, it can show us conclusively, even years \nafter a conviction, where mistakes have been made. And there is no good \nreason not to use it.\n  Allowing testing does not deprive the state of its ability to present \nits case, and under a reasonable scheme for the preservation and \ntesting of DNA evidence, the practical costs, burdens and delays \ninvolved are relatively small.\n  The Innocence Protection Act would therefore provide improved access \nto DNA testing for people who claim that they have been wrongfully \nconvicted. It would also prevent the premature destruction of \nbiological evidence that could hold the key to clearing an innocent \nperson and, as we recently saw in Ray Krone's case, identifying the \nreal culprit.\n  But DNA testing addresses only the tip of the iceberg of the problem \nof wrongful convictions. In most cases, there is no DNA evidence to be \ntested, just as in most cases, there are no fingerprints. In the vast \nmajority of death row exonerations, no DNA testing has or could have \nbeen involved.\n  So the broad and growing consensus on death penalty reform has \nanother top priority. All the statistics and evidence show that the \nsingle most frequent cause of wrongful convictions is inadequate \ndefense representation at trial. By far the most important reform we \ncan undertake is to ensure minimum standards of competency and funding \nfor capital defense.\n  Under the IPA, States may choose to work with the federal government \nto improve the systems by which they appoint and compensate lawyers in \ndeath cases. These States would receive an infusion of new Federal \ngrant money, but they would also open themselves up to a set of \ncontrols that are designed to ensure that their systems truly meet \nbasic standards. In essence, the bill offers the States extra money for \nquality and accountability.\n  A State may also decline to participate in the new grant program, In \nthat case, the money that would otherwise be available to the state \nwould be used to fund one or more organizations that provide capital \nrepresentation in that state. One way or another, the bill would \nimprove the quality of appointed counsel in capital cases.\n  This is a reform that does not in any way hinder good, effective law \nenforcement. More money is good for the States. More openness and \naccountability is good for everyone. And better lawyering makes the \ntrial process far less prone to error.\n  We can never guarantee that no innocent person will be convicted. But \nsurely when people in this country are put on trial for their lives, \nthey should be defended by lawyers who meet reasonable standards of \ncompetence and who have sufficient funds to investigate the facts and \nprepare thoroughly for trial. That bare minimum is all that the counsel \nprovisions in the IPA seek to achieve.\n  The Innocence Protection Act addresses grave and urgent problems with \nmoderate, fine-tuned practical solutions. It has passed out of \nCommittee in the Senate and is supported by a majority of the House. \nJustice demands that we pass it before more lives are ruined.\n  Title VII of the bill includes various proposals for strengthening \nthe Federal criminal laws, including, in subtitle A, the Anti-Atrocity \nAlien Deportation Act of 2003. This bill would close loopholes in our \nimmigration laws that have allowed war criminals and human rights \nabusers to enter and remain in this country. I am appalled that this \ncountry has become a safe haven for those who exercised power in \nforeign countries to terrorize, rape, murder and torture innocent \ncivilians. A recent report by Amnesty International claims that nearly \n150 alleged human rights abusers have been identified living here, and \nwarns that this number may be as high as 1,000.\n  The problem of human rights abusers seeking and obtaining refuge in \nthis country is real, and requires an effective response with the legal \nand enforcement changes proposed in this legislation. We have \nunwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with the oppressed for too \nlong. We should not let this situation continue. We need to focus the \nattention of our law enforcement investigators to prosecute and deport \nthose who have committed atrocities abroad and who now enjoy safe \nharbor in the United States.\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would provide a stronger bar \nto human rights abusers who seek to exploit loopholes in current law. \nThe Immigration and Nationality Act currently provides that 1. \nParticipants in\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\nNazi persecutions during the time period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, \n1945, 2. aliens who engaged in genocide, and 3. aliens who committed \nparticularly severe violations of religious freedom, are inadmissible \nto the United States and deportable. This legislation would expand the \ngrounds for inadmissibility and deportation to 1. Add new bars for \naliens who have engaged in acts, outside the United States, of \n``torture'' and ``extrajudicial killing'' and 2. remove limitations on \nthe current bases for ``genocide'' and ``particularly severe violations \nof religious freedom.''\n  The bill would not only add the new grounds for inadmissibility and \ndeportation, it would expand two of the current grounds. First, the \ncurrent bar to aliens who have ``engaged in genocide'' defines that \nterm by reference to the ``genocide'' definition in the Convention on \nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. For clarity and \nconsistency, the bill would substitute instead the definition in the \nFederal criminal code, which was adopted pursuant to the U.S. \nobligations under the Genocide Convention. The bill would also broaden \nthe reach of the provision to apply not only to those who ``engaged in \ngenocide,'' as in current law, but also to cover any alien who has \nordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in genocide. This \nbroader scope will ensure that the genocide provision addresses a more \nappropriate range of levels of complicity.\n  Second, the current bar to aliens who have committed ``particularly \nsevere violations of religious freedom,'' as defined in the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act of 1998, limits its application to \nforeign government officials who engaged in such conduct within the \nlast 24 months. Our bill would delete reference to prohibited conduct \noccurring within a 24-month period since this limitation is not \nconsistent with the strong stance of the United States to promote \nreligious freedom throughout the world.\n  Changing the law to address the problem of human rights abusers \nseeking entry and remaining in the United States is only part of the \nsolution. We also need effective enforcement, which I believe we can \nobtain by updating the mission of the Justice Department's Office of \nSpecial Investigations, or OSI. Our county has long provided the \ntemplate and moral leadership for dealing with Nazi war criminals. The \nOSI, which was created to hunt down, prosecute, and remove Nazi war \ncriminals who had slipped into the United States among their victims \nunder the Displaced Persons Act, is an example of effective \nenforcement. Since the OSI's inception in 1979, over 60 Nazi \npersecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship, almost 50 have been \nremoved from the United States, and more than 150 have been denied \nentry.\n  The OSI was created by the power of Attorney General Civiletti almost \n35 years after the end of World War II and it is only authorized to \ntrack Nazi war criminals. As any prosecutor, or, in my case, former \nprosecutor, knows instinctively, delays make documentary and \ntestimonial evidence more difficult to obtain. Stale cases are the \nhardest to make. We should not repeat the mistake of waiting decades \nbefore tracking down war criminals and human rights abusers who have \nsettled in this country. War criminals should find no sanctuary in \nloopholes in our current immigration policies and enforcement. No war \ncriminal should ever come to believe that he is going to find safe \nharbor in the United States.\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would for the first time \nprovide statutory authorization for the OSI within the Department of \nJustice, with authority to denaturalize any alien who has participated \nin Nazi persecution, torture, extrajudicial killing or genocide abroad. \nThe bill would also expand the OSI's jurisdiction to deal with any \nalien who participated in torture, extrajudicial killing and genocide \nabroad, not just Nazis. Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war \ncriminals to justice remains a matter of great importance. Funds would \nnot be diverted from the OSI's current mission. Additional resources \nare authorized in the bill for OSI's expanded duties.\n  Title VII of the Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act also \nincludes a proposal to increase the maximum penalties for violations of \nthree existing statutes that protect the cultural and archaeological \nhistory of the American people, particularly Native Americans. The \nUnited States Sentencing Commission recommended the statutory changes \ncontained in this proposal, which would complement the Commission's \nstrengthening of Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure more stringent \npenalties for criminals who steal from our public lands. Passage of \nthis legislation would demonstrate Congress' commitment to preserving \nour nation's history and our cultural heritage.\n  The Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act is a comprehensive \nand realistic set of proposals for assisting local enforcement, \npreventing crime, protecting our children and senior citizens, and \nassisting the victims of crime. I look forward to working on a \nbipartisan basis for passage of as much of this bill as possible during \nthe 108th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act of 2003\n\n\n                      Section-By-Section Analysis\n\n      TITLE I--COMBATING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING DOMESTIC SECURITY\n\n                Subtitle A--Supporting First Responders\n\n       Sec. 1101.

A bill to amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and the \nRevised Statutes of the United States, to prohibit financial holding \ncompanies and national banks from engaging, directly or indirectly, in \nreal estate brokerage or real estate management activities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief comments \nabout legislation I am introducing today. I also will talk briefly \nabout some of the agenda items I have been looking at for this year. \nObviously, having just been sworn into office today, we are putting \ntogether our agendas and beginning to think seriously about what kind \nof issues we would like to put forward.\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\n  The people of Colorado understand that, as we move into this session, \nmy priority is the cleanup of a number of our Superfund sites in \nColorado, staying on track with the cleanup of Rocky Flats by 2006, \ncleaning up the Shattuck waste site, as well as the cleanup of Pueblo \nDepot.\n  I will also be working on transportation issues which are important \nto States such as Colorado, Wyoming, the home State of the presiding \nofficer, as well as throughout the country. Transportation will be a \nbig issue as we move into this session.\n  Another issue I have spoken about is housing, which we will be \ndealing with in this session. I also plan to focus on missile defense \nand judiciary nominations.\n  The legislation I rise today to introduce is called the Community \nChoice In Real Estate Act of 2003. I am pleased to have Senators \nClinton, Shelby, Feingold, Burns, Sessions, and Harkin join me in \nintroducing this bill. This is something I am doing as part of the \neffort to keep the housing markets competitive and strong.\n  The Community Choice in Real Estate Act of 2003 is the continuation \nof an effort that I began in the 107th Congress. This bill would \nclarify Congressional intent that real estate brokerage and management \nare not financial activities and would therefore retain the separation \nof commerce and banking that we intended during consideration of the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act closed the unitary thrift loophole that \nallowed a single savings and loan to be owned by a commercial entity. \nThis clearly established that banking and commerce were not to mix. \nCongress explicitly defined several functions to be financial in nature \nor incidental to finance to clarify the separation. Real estate \nmanagement and brokerage services were not defined as financial \nactivities.\n  Congress already established a clear position regarding banks' \ninvolvement in real estate management and brokerage activities, and the \nbill I'm introducing with my colleagues would reiterate that \nprohibition. I believe that we should not permit federal regulators to \npreempt the intent of Congress.\n  The real estate and banking industries have served America well, and \nI believe that the current system provides consumers with many \nimportant options. I know that the regulators received many letter \nduring the comment period. I commend them for taking the time to allow \nall interested parties to comment and for their pledge to carefully \nreview all comments. I intend to continue to work with them to ensure \nthat Congressional intent is followed in this matter.\n  Realtors play a vital role in our economy, and housing has been one \nof the bright spots in our otherwise slow economy. Realtors are an \nintegral part of the housing industry share in the credit for this \npositive economic news.\n  Additionally, Realtors help fuel the economy as small businesses. As \na small businessman myself, I can appreciate the challenges of starting \nand running a small business. As a U.S. Senator I have worked hard to \nreduce rules and regulations hindering small businesses, as well as \nexcessive taxes. The Community Choice in Real Estate Act of 2003 will \nensure that small real estate businesses are able to continue to \nthrive.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to promptly consider this matter, \nand I would ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 98\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Allard from Colorado, today to introduce the Community Choice \nin Real Estate Act of 2003.\n  This critically important piece of legislation would clarify \nCongressional intent, by preventing the Federal Reserve Board and the \nTreasury Department from issuing a regulation permitting banks and \ntheir affiliates from engaging in real estate management and brokerage \nactivities, which are commercial--and not financial--in nature.\n  The legislation that Senator Allard and I are introducing today \nrecognizes the possible unintended consequences that implementation of \nsuch regulation could have on consumers and on the real estate \nindustry. The powers afforded banks under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act \nwould give banks a considerable competitive advantage over brokers and \nservice providers who lack access to customer financial information. I \nam concerned that this could force independent real estate brokers out \nof the market, and in turn lower the quality of service to consumers.\n\n[[Page S153]]\n\n  Congress has armed regulators with the flexibility to adapt to \nchanges in the marketplace. Indeed, in the coming years, I am confident \nthe Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department will determine \nthe effect that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is having on the financial \nmarket place and on consumers. As the effects are analyzed and changes \nconsidered, I urge that safeguards be included that ensure the \nprotection of consumers and existing businesses as well as compliance \nwith the intent of Congress. Until then, allowing banks in real estate \ncould create inherent conflicts of interest for the lenders and \nbrokers, and could place inevitable pressure on consumers and limit \ntheir choices in products and services.\n  Last year, there was tremendous support for this legislation in the \nHouse and Senate, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nagain this year to ensure the Treasury Secretary hears loud and clear \nthe intent of Congress to protect consumers, and to protect an industry \nfrom being put at a competitive disadvantage through executive action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S153-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S153-S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 107. A bill to prohibit the exportation of natural gas from the \nUnited States to Mexico for use in electric energy generation units \nnear the United States border that do not comply with air quality \ncontrol requirements that provide air quality protection that is at \nleast equivalent to the protection provided by requirements applicable \nin the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce \nlegislation at the start of this new Congress to protect those living \nalong the California-Mexican border from harmful power plant emissions.\n  This bill, which Congressman Duncan Hunter is also re-introducing \ntoday in the House of Representatives, will prevent power plants built \nin Mexico from using natural gas from the United States, unless firms \noperating these plants agree to comply with California's air pollution \nstandards.\n  Currently there are two new power plants planned for Mexicali, \nMexico, a city right across the border from Imperial County, \nCalifornia. The Imperial Valley produces much of our Nation's \nwintertime vegetables. The Valley is the region in Southern California \nthat will be impacted most by pollution from these power plants in \nMexico. And since Imperial County has some of the worst air quality in \nthe United States and one of the highest childhood asthma rates in the \nState, I believe these new plants must meet California emission \nstandards.\n  One of the Mexicali plants, which is being built by Sempra Energy, \nwill have pollution mitigation technology to minimize the impact of air \npollution on the residents of the Imperial Valley. However, the other \nplant, to be built by InterGen, will not. InterGen officials have \nrepeatedly stated that their Mexicali plant will meet ``domestic \nstandards or World Bank standards.'' The problem is these are not U.S. \nstandards and are far below California standards.\n  I am introducing this legislation today to make sure any plant that \ncomes online along the California-Mexican border meets the same air \nquality standards as plants in California.\n  The residents of Imperial County and the entire Southern California \nregion deserve nothing less.\n  I have heard from many constituents in Southern California concerned \nabout the InterGen plant and local officials in Imperial County are \nadamantly opposed to the InterGen plant because the company has refused \nto install pollution control devices on all four operating units.\n  This legislation has the support of the Imperial County Board of \nSupervisors, the Imperial District, the Coachella Valley Association of \nGovernments, and San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy.\n  This legislation will ensure energy plants along the border employ \nthe best technology available to control pollution and protect the \npublic health for residents of Southern California and other border \nregions in a similar situation.\n  The bill will prohibit energy companies from exporting natural gas \nfrom the United States for use in Mexico unless the natural gas fired \ngenerators south of the border meet the air standards prevalent in the \nUnited States. This will effectively cut power plants off from the \nnatural gas supply if they do not meet higher emissions standards.\n  This legislation will not constrain power plants that were put online \nprior to January 1, 2003. It will apply to plants built after the new \nyear and projects that come online in the future.\n  This bill will only apply to power plants within 50 miles of the \nU.S.-Mexican border.\n  And the legislation will only apply to power plants that generate \nmore than 50 megawatts of power. We do not want to block any moves to \nreplace dirty diesel back-up generators with cleaner natural-gas fired \nsmall power sources.\n  The bill calls for collaboration between the Secretary of Commerce \nand the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \ndetermine if a power plant is in compliance with relevant emission \nstandards.\n  I support the development of new energy projects for California \nbecause I believe we need to bring more power online. However, I do not \nbelieve the fact that we need more power in California should allow \ncompanies to take advantage of this need and use it as an excuse to \ndevote less attention to clear air and public health.\n  It is not unreasonable to ensure that companies making money in \nCalifornia energy market meet strict environmental standards. This \nlegislation is meant to strike a balance between promoting new sources \nof energy south of the border and protecting the environment throughout \nthe border region. It is not a final resolution of these cross-border \nissues, but I believe it is a good first step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 118. A bill to develop and coordinate a national emergency warning \nsystem; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, together with \nSenator Hollings, the Emergency Warning Act of 2003.\n  In the event of a terrorist attack or natural disaster, Americans \nmust know how to respond. In the first terrible hours on September 11, \n2001, in Washington, in New York, and across the country, most of us \ndidn't know what to do. We didn't know whether it was safer to pick our \nchildren up from school or safer to leave them there. We didn't know if \nwe should stay at work or head for home.\n  For everything that's happened since September 11, the reality is \nthat if an attack happened again, many of us still would not know what \nto do. That must change.\n  To prepare Americans to respond in time of attack, the first thing we \nneed to do is to update our emergency warning system. Today, that \nsystem depends heavily on television and radio, and it has two big \nproblems. First, the system doesn't reach millions of Americans who \naren't near a TV and radio at a given moment. How many of us would hear \na warning issued on TV at 3 a.m? Second, the system doesn't provide all \nthe information we need. For many of us, the new color-coded terrorism \nwarnings have proven more confusing than helpful. We need practical \ninformation about what we can do to respond to threats or attacks.\n  While the terrorist attacks have highlighted the need for effective \npublic warnings, they're also essential during natural disasters. In \nfact, most public warnings deal with weather hazards like hurricanes \nand floods. After Hurricane Floyd hit North Carolina, the Air Force had \nto rescue more than 200 people stranded in cars, on roofs, and in \ntrees, people who weren't told to evacuate their homes until it was too \nlate. More than 50 people died during that hurricane. In our State's \nneighbor, Tennessee, six people died during a 1999 tornado because \ntornado sirens failed. With all the technology that we have at our \ndisposal, we can do better.\n  In short, we have to make sure effective warnings get to every \nAmerican in time of danger, and we have to make sure those warnings \ntell folks just\n\n[[Page S154]]\n\nwhat they can do to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n  The Emergency Warning Act will help achieve that goal. This \nlegislation will require the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Commerce to make sure that comprehensive, easily \nunderstood emergency warnings get to every American at risk, Whether \nfrom flood, hurricane or terrorist attack. This bill instructs Commerce \nand DHS to work with the government agencies that currently issue \nwarnings, with first responders, with private industry, and with the \nmedia to make sure that our emergency warning system actually warns \nAmericans who are at risk.\n  There are a lot of things the system could do using existing \ntechnology. For example, it could alert Americans in their homes \nthrough a special phone ring. These warnings could reach people as they \nsleep in their homes. For people on the move, the system could use cell \nphones, which can already be programmed to broadcast emergency warnings \nto all users in a certain area--even if those folks are just passing \nthrough. Pagers and beepers can achieve the same result. Televisions \ncan be programmed to come on automatically and provide alerts in the \nevent of a disaster.\n  We also can make sure that warnings provide the specific information \npeople need--what to watch for, where to go, how to travel, what to \nbring. We should not have empty warnings. Instead, we should respond to \nspecific threats with specific information that people can use.\n  This legislation was developed with a lot of help from the \nPartnership for Public Warning. Their comprehensive study of the \nproblem, ``Developing a Unified All-Hazard Public Warning System,'' \npointed the way to what we are doing. I'm grateful for their help, as \nwell as the indispensable help of Senator Hollings.\n  Creating a better emergency warning system is only the first step we \nmust take in order to empower Americans to respond to terrorist attack. \nAs I've said in the past, I believe Americans want to contribute to our \nnation's defense, they are just looking for ways to do it. In the \ncoming weeks, I will introduce additional legislation to support \ncivilian defense efforts across America. But this bill makes an \nimportant contribution to our efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Burns, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 120. A bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty permanently in \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprovide permanent tax relief from one of the most egregious, anti-\nfamily aspects of the tax code, the marriage penalty. Relieving \nAmerican taxpayers of this burden has been one of my highest priorities \nas a U.S. Senator.\n  Today, millions of couples across America are penalized by our tax \ncode simply because they are married. The Treasury Department estimates \nthat 48 percent of married couples pay this additional tax, and, \naccording to a study by the Congressional Budget Office, the average \npenalty paid is $1,400 per couple.\n  Fortunately, the 107th Congress took a step in the right direction. \nThe Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 will \nprovide marriage penalty relief to millions of couples by increasing \nthe size of the standard deduction and the width of the 15 percent tax \nbracket, so those applied to a married couple will be twice the size of \nthose for an individual. In addition, the phase-out levels for the \nearned income tax credit will be adjusted so as to reduce the penalty \non married couples.\n  But once again, we face the infamous ``sunset provision'' that will \nwipe away these reforms in 2011. Another problem is that relief does \nnot begin to be phased in until 2005, with the full impact not taking \neffect until 2009. President Bush has called for making marriage \npenalty relief effective immediately as part of his economic stimulus \npackage.\n  I agree that this is an important step. Given the state of the \neconomy and the difficulty many families are having in making ends \nmeet, we cannot wait any longer to give young couples the break they \ndeserve.\n  The bi-partisan bill I am offering with Senator Bayh and others would \nmake the 2001 reforms effective immediately and permanently. People \nwill no longer have to decide between love and money.\n  The benefits for couples are significant. A couple earning $30,000 \ncould keep $800 they now pay in taxes, while a couple earning $80,000 \ncould save more than $1,300. 35 million couples will benefit from \nenacting marriage penalty relief in 2003, including 2.4 million Texas \nfamilies.\n  The tax code provides a significant disincentive for people to take \nmarriage vows. Marriage is a fundamental institution in our society and \nshould not be discouraged by the IRS. The benefits of marriage are well \nestablished. Children living in a married household are far less likely \nto live in poverty or to suffer from child abuse. Research indicates \nthey are less likely to be depressed or have developmental problems. \nScourges such as adolescent drug use are less common in married \nfamilies, and married mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  At the very least, marriage should not be a taxable event.\n  I call on the Senate to finish the job we started and say ``I do'' to \nproviding permanent marriage penalty relief today.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Hatch, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Miller, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Fitzgerald, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Biden, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n        Mr. Bennett, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Sessions, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Allard, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 121. A bill to enhance the operation of the AMBER Alsert \ncommunications network in order to facilitate the recovery of abducted \nchildren, to provide for enhanced notification on highways of alerts \nand information on such children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am introducing today with my friend \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, and 26 other senators, the National \nAMBER Network Act. This legislation will establish a National Amber \nNetwork and improve the current system of AMBER Alert plans that exist \nin various states. Our legislation recognizes the tremendous work that \nthose involved in AMBER alerts are doing and seeks to build on their \nefforts.\n  In 1996, 9-year-old Amber Hagerman of Arlington, Texas was abducted \nand brutally murdered. Her death had such an impact on the community \nthat local law enforcement and area broadcasters developed what is now \nknown as AMBER Alert, America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response. \nAn AMBER Alert is activated by law enforcement to find a child, when a \nchild has been abducted. An Alert triggers highway notification and \nbroadcast messages throughout the area where the abduction occurred.\n  As we have seen, AMBER plans in different communities have worked to \nbring children home safely. To date, AMBER Alert has helped recover 42 \nchildren nationwide. Many communities and States have outstanding AMBER \nplans. However, the vast majority of States do not yet have \ncomprehensive, statewide coverage and lack the ability to effectively \ncommunicate. This is a critical issue particularly when an abducted \nchild is taken across State lines.\n  The bill I am introducing today establishes an AMBER Alert \nCoordinator within the Department of Justice to assist states with \ntheir AMBER plans. Last year, President Bush ordered the Attorney \nGeneral to establish an AMBER Alert Coordinator, and this bill will \ncodify that position for future Administrations. While we have \nwitnessed successful stories of AMBER alerts helping to recover a child \nwithin a region, huge gaps exist among the AMBER plans around the \ncountry. The AMBER Alert Coordinator will facilitate appropriate \nregional coordination of AMBER alerts, particularly with interstate \ntravel situations, and will assist states, broadcasters, and law \nenforcement in establishing additional AMBER plans.\n  The AMBER Alert Coordinator will set minimum, voluntary standards to \nhelp states work together, and will help to reconcile the different \nstandards and criteria for issuing an AMBER Alert. In doing so, the \nCoordinator will work with the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, local and State law enforcement and broadcasters to \ndefine minimum standards. Overall, the AMBER Alert Coordinator's \nefforts will set safeguards to make sure the AMBER alert system is used \nto meet it intended purpose.\n  In addition, the bill provides for matching grants to states with \nAMBER programs. The grant program will help localities and States build \nor further enhance their efforts to disseminate AMBER alerts. To this \nend, Federal matching grants will fund road signs and electronic \nmessage boards along highways, broadcasts of information on abducted \nchildren, education and training, and related equipment.\n  Our bill has the strong support of the National Center of Missing and \nExploited Children and the National Association of Broadcasters, who \nplay essential roles in the AMBER Alert system. I urge the Senate to \nact expeditiously on this legislation to protect America's children.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nHutchison in re-introducing the National AMBER Alert Network Act. This \nlegislation builds on the proven successes of the AMBER Alert program.\n  AMBER Alerts are official bulletins transmitted over the airwaves to \nenlist the public's help in tracking down child abductors fleeing a \ncrime scene.\n  AMBER Alerts are such powerful tools because they can be issued \nwithin minutes of an abduction and reach a wide public audience.\n  Statistics show that children in the most dangerous abduction cases \nhave precious little time until their safety is compromised.\n  According to a study by the U.S. Department of Justice, 74 percent of \nchildren who were abducted, and later found murdered, are killed in the \nfirst hours after being taken.\n  Simply put, we need more AMBER Alerts because they may be the best \ntool law enforcement has to save kidnapped children facing imminent \ndanger.\n  Last Fall, Senator Hutchison and I first introduced the ``National \nAMBER Alert Network Act.'' The bill attracted tremendous support in the \nSenate. Just seven days after it was introduced, the bill passed the \nSenate.\n  While the legislation did not pass the House, President Bush issued \nan executive order putting some of the pieces of the National AMBER \nAlert Network Act into effect.\n  Specifically, on October 3, 2002, President Bush announced that the \nAdministration would create a national AMBER Alert coordinator in the \nDepartment of Justice, would draft national standards for AMBER Alerts; \nand allocate $10 million in funding for the creation of new AMBER Alert \nprograms.\n  While President Bush's actions were an important first step, we now \nneed to ensure the long-term viability of the national AMBER Alert \nprogram by enacting authorizing legislation.\n  The bill we introduce today has three key components.\n  First, the legislation would authorize $20 million to the Department \nof Transportation and $5 million to the Department of Justice in FY \n2004 to provide grants for the development of AMBER Alert systems, \nelectronic message boards, and training and education programs in \nstates that do not have AMBER Alerts.\n  To date, AMBER Alert systems exist in 33 States and a total of 83 \nlocal, regional and State jurisdictions. This bill would help the \nexpansion of AMBER Alerts to new jurisdictions.\n  Second, the bill would build upon the President's Executive Order by \nauthorizing a national coordinator for AMBER Alerts in the Department \nof\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\nJustice to expand the network of AMBER Alert systems and to coordinate \nthe issuance of region-wide AMBER Alerts.\n  Third, the bill provides a framework for the Department of Justice to \nestablish minimum standards for the regional coordination of AMBER \nalerts.\n  The Department of Justice, working with the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and other private organizations with \nexpertise in this area, would build upon the best standards currently \nin place.\n  Today, an AMBER Alert is typically issued only when: a law \nenforcement agency confirms that a predatory child abduction has \noccurred, the child is in imminent danger, and there is information \navailable that, if disseminated to the public, could assist in the safe \nrecovery of the child.\n  The effectiveness of AMBER Alerts depends on the continued judicious \nuse of the system so that the public does not grow to ignore the \nwarnings.\n  Furthermore, it is the specific intent of this bill not to interfere \nwith the operation of the 83 AMBER plans that are working today.\n  Participation in regional AMBER plans is voluntary, and any plan that \nwishes to go it alone may still do so.\n  I urge members to support this bill because AMBER Alerts have a \nproven track record.\n  Nationally, since 1996, the AMBER Alert has been credited with the \nsafe return of 42 children to their families, including one case in \nwhich an abductor reportedly released the child after hearing the alert \nhimself.\n  I would like to briefly describe two of these cases: the rescues of \n10 year-old Nichole Timmons from Riverside and four-year old Jessica \nCortez from Los Angeles.\n  Last fall, Nichole Timmons and her mother Sharon attended a hearing \nof the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment information on the AMBER Alert program.\n  In moving testimony, Sharon described how Nichole was abducted from \ntheir Riverside home on August 20, 2002 and how an AMBER Alert brought \nher daughter back to her within hours of the abduction.\n  In Nichole's case, an Alert was issued not just in California, but in \nNevada as well.\n  After learning about the Alert, a tribal police officer in Nevada \nspotted the truck of Nichole's abductor and stopped him within 24 hours \nof the abduction.\n  He was found with duct tape and a metal pipe.\n  The AMBER Alert was the only reason that Nichole was able to return \nhome to her mother, safe.\n  I can't think of any testimony in support of a bill more powerful \nthan the sight of a mother sitting next to her daughter who she thought \nmight be gone forever.\n  The second case I want to mention is that of Jessica Cortez. Jessica \ndisappeared from Echo Park in Los Angeles on August 11, 2002.\n  But when Jessica's abductor took her to a clinic for medical care, \nreceptionist Denise Leon recognized Jessica from AMBER Alert and \nnotified law enforcement.\n  Without the publicity generated by the Alert, Jessica could have been \nlost to her parents forever.\n  Through this legislation, we will extend to every corner of the \nNation a network of AMBER Alerts that will protect our children.\n  This program will increase the odds that an abducted child will \nreturn to his or her family safety.\n  But importantly, it will deter potential abductors from taking a \nchild in the first place.\n  As Mark Klaas said at a hearing on the bill last Fall, this \nlegislation will ``save kids lives.''\n  Once again, let me thank Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her \ntremendous leadership on this issue.\n  It is my hope that this bill will continue to see the strong, \nbipartisan support that led to its swift passage in the Senate last \nyear. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Bond, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Bunning, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Allard, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \n        Miller, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 122. A bill to extend the national flood insurance program; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``National \nFlood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2003.'' This bill, which \nis cosponsored by the Ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, \nSenator Sarbanes, as well as Senators Bond and Mikulski, the Chairman \nand Ranking Member, respectively, of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and \nIndependent Agencies Appropriations, will provide a one-year extension \nof the lapsed federal flood insurance program.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program, ``NFIP'', expired on December \n31, 2002. The expiration of the program has prevented homeowners and \nhome buyers from obtaining or renewing flood insurance policies in the \nintervening time. Since anyone buying or refinancing a home in a flood \nplan must have flood insurance, NFIP's expiration will block the path \nto home ownership for many Americans, and have a disruptive effect on \nresidential real estate and mortgage markets.\n  I have a December 6, 2002 letter from Anthony S. Lowe, the \nAdministrator of the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, \nwhich goes into greater detail regarding the consequences of the \nexpiration of the NFIP. As Director Low indicates in this letter the \nlapse of this authority could effect as many as 400,000 households in \nthe month of January alone. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The bill that I am introducing today simply extends the NFIP through \nthe end of this calender year, retroactive to January 1, 2003. As such, \nit's purpose is the same as S. 13, which the Senate passed last \nNovember 20th.\n  The House passed companion legislation this week, and it is our hope \nto have a short term extension of the NFIP enacted into law as soon as \npossible. This will permit the two Houses of Congress to consider the \nlarger issues confronting the NFIP in a deliberate manner, without \ncreating hardship for homeowners and undue turmoil in our nation's real \nestate markets.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                          Federal Emergency Management Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 2002.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On December 31, 2002, certain basic \n     authorities for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's \n     National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) will expire. The \n     continuing resolution (P.L. 107-294), which extends FY 02 \n     baseline funding through January 11, 2003, does not extend \n     NFIP authorization. This lapse in authority in January alone \n     could affect as many as 400,000 households seeking to obtain \n     or renew a flood insurance policy in nearly 20,000 \n     communities in all 50 States and territories.\n       In particular, the lack of authorization for NFIP to issue \n     and renew policies will cause significant disruption to \n     policyholders, the lending and real estate industries, \n     secondary mortgage market, many private insurance companies \n     writing flood insurance under arrangements with the NFIP, and \n     particularly those seeking home loans or mortgage refinancing \n     that requires flood insurance as a precondition to \n     settlement.\n       The lapse in authorization will also have a negative impact \n     on public entities that provide or require flood insurance, \n     including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together control \n     about 85% of the secondary mortgage market in the country. In \n     addition, since policy renewal billing is generally conducted \n     45-90 days prior to expiration of a policy, unless our \n     authority to renew policies is reauthorized immediately, many \n     more individuals will be impacted than the above initial \n     estimate.\n       The four authorities requiring reauthorization are sections \n     1309(a)(2), 1391, 1336 and 1376(c) of the National Flood \n     Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-448). Should they lapse, the \n     resulting uninsured flood losses could impose significant \n     hardship on citizens, and increase costs to the Federal \n     government and the States. I would urge Congress to act as \n     quickly as possible to reauthorize this important program \n     effective January 1, 2003. Should you have any questions on \n     this issue, please do not hesitate to contact our \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs Division at (202) \n     646-4500. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Anthony S. Lowe,\n\n                                                    Administrator,\n                  Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Shelby\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\nand others of my colleagues in introducing the National Flood Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act of 2003. This legislation is similar to \nlegislation I introduced last year S. 13, which would have reauthorized \nthe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), for one year, preventing a \nlapse in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's authority to \nadminister this important program. The Senate passed this bill on \nNovember 20, 2002, but unfortunately, the House of Representatives did \nnot consider it before adjourning for the year. FEMA's authority to \nmanage the NFIP expired on December 31, 2002.\n  FEMA has estimated that even a brief lapse in its authority to run \nthe NFIP could affect approximately 500,000 households seeking to \nobtain or maintain flood insurance, which in many cases is a \nprecondition for settlement of a mortgage or home loan. The NFIP was \ncreated by Congress in 1968 in response to the lack of such insurance \nbeing offered by the private sector. This program made flood insurance \navailable in communities that adopted flood plain management \nregulations designed to reduce future damages from flooding, and it is \nnow available in almost 20,000 participating communities nationwide. As \nof September 30, 2002, the NFIP had almost 4.4 million policies in \nforce, representing more than 90 percent of the flood insurance in the \nUnited States. The availability of flood insurance helps Americans \nprepare for floods, while reducing the need for federal disaster \nassistance after a flood.\n  The unfortunate lapse in FEMA's authority has caused confusion and \nuncertainty in the real estate industry for both lenders and borrowers. \nThe Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration within FEMA has \nmade efforts to work with the banking regulators, the lending \ncommunity, and other stakeholders to address their concerns about the \nlapse in FEMA's authority. While these efforts have been helpful, the \nonly effective solution is a rapid reauthorization of this program by \nthe Congress.\n  The legislation we are introducing today makes reauthorization of the \nNFIP retroactive to December 31, 2002, to minimize any disruption that \nwould be caused by a lapse in FEMA's authority. We have worked closely \nwith FEMA in developing this language, and it is supported by a \ncoalition of industry representatives, including America's Community \nBankers, the American Bankers Association, the American Insurance \nAssociation, the American Society of Appraisers, the Appraisal \nInstitute, Fannie Mae. Farmers Insurance Group, Freddie Mac, \nIndependent Insurance Agent & Brokers of America, the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation, the National Association of Homebuilders, the National \nAssociation of Mortgage Brokers, the National Association of \nProfessional Insurance Agents, and the National Association of \nRealtors.\n  Property owners and mortgage lenders throughout the country rely on \nthe NFIP to insure their properties against flood damage. Unless the \nNFIP is reauthorized, that protection will disappear. I urge my \ncolleagues to support swift passage of this urgently needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 123. A bill to exclude United States persons from the definition \nof ``foreign power'' under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978 relating to international terrorism; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 123\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION OF UNITED STATES PERSONS FROM DEFINITION \n                   OF FOREIGN POWER IN FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE \n                   SURVEILLANCE ACT OF 1978 RELATING TO \n                   INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.\n\n       Paragraph (4) of section 101(a) of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801(a)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(4) a person, other than a United States person, or group \n     that is engaged in international terrorism or activities in \n     preparation therefor;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 126. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to suspend \nfuture reductions of the highest income tax rate if there exists a \nFederal on-budget deficit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, with \nSenator Chafee, to freeze the top income tax rate at its current level \nof 38.6 percent, until such time as the Federal budget returns to \nsurpluses. We believe the ballooning deficit is bad for the economy, \nbad for interest rates, and bad for the health of the Nation.\n  Under current law, the top income tax rate is scheduled to drop from \n38.6 percent to 37.6 percent in 2004 and then to 35 percent in 2006. \nThis rate is applied to the adjusted gross income of those who earn \nover $312,000. This top rate freeze would save $88 billion between now \nand 2010, and $132 billion through 2012, every penny of which would go \ntoward reducing the Federal deficit.\n  Everyone should understand that this top tax rate is paid by just \n908,000 of the more than 128 million taxpayers nationwide, just 0.7 \npercent of American taxpayers. This is not a time for tax policies \nwhich benefit only a small portion of the population. It is a time for \nfiscally responsible policies that will ensure long-term growth and \nprovide an immediate stimulus to our economy.\n  In June 2001, I voted for the President's tax plan. It was truly a \ndifferent time: 9/11 had not taken place; war had not appeared on the \nhorizon; revelations of corporate fraud had not surfaced; and a \nrecession was not evident.\n  Those times are as different from today as day is from night. At the \ntime, Senator Chafee and I, along with twelve other Senators from both \nparties, supported a ``trigger'' on the 2001 tax reduction. This would \nhave frozen future tax reductions under the Bush Tax Cut if the budget \nreturned to deficit. Unfortunately, we were able to attract only 49 \nvotes on the amendment. I wish we had that trigger today.\n  Now, it is estimated that we face $1.4 trillion in cumulative budget \ndeficits between now and 2012. And that is why we return to the idea of \nthe trigger. I believe that we should not allow the rate reduction for \nthe top rate to proceed, until we return to budget surpluses.\n  And that brings us to the Bush Administration's $674 billion tax cut \nand economic stimulus package. In my view, this is the wrong plan at \nthe wrong time. It digs the Nation deeper into debt. It is not a \nstimulus. It is skewed to the wealthy. And it severely limits the \ngovernment's ability to pay for needed programs, like education, \ntransportation, and law enforcement.\n  First, the President's plan would be a major contributor to massive \nbudget deficits. The proposal would result in a budget deficit of \napproximately $482 billion this year alone, if the social security \ntrust fund surpluses were not used to fund the budget. Using the social \nsecurity trust fund, the deficit would still be $312 billion. This does \nnot include the costs of a possible war with Iraq, an extension of \nFederal unemployment benefits, and the FY 2003 and FY 2004 \nappropriations bills.\n  Furthermore, as the Federal debt increases, the government will spend \nbillions more in tax dollars on servicing the debt, instead of \npriorities like homeland security, healthcare, education, \ntransportation, or the environment. Interest on the debt over ten years \nis already projected to be $1.3 trillion higher than expected, even \nbefore this new package, and this package would add more than $100 \nbillion in new interest payments over the next ten years. Unlike home \nmortgage payments, interest on the debt is rolled over and compounds, \nwhich makes a rising debt extremely dangerous over the long-term.\n  Second, the President's tax cut is skewed to the wealthiest 1 percent \nof Americans. Taxpayers with income over 1 million would receive an \naverage of more than $88,000 in benefits, while the typical middle-\nincome taxpayer would only benefit by $265. This is clearly unfair. In \nfact one-third of all benefits would go to the wealthiest 1 percent, \nwhile less than 10 percent of the benefits would go to the 60 percent \nof taxpayers making under $54,000.\n  Third, the proposal is not stimulative. The central feature of the \nAdministration's plan, an elimination of\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\ntaxes on corporate dividends, would not begin to be felt until April \n2004. And when those savings do kick in, they would largely benefit the \nwealthiest people--with more than half the benefits, $225 billion, \ngoing to the top five percent of taxpayers. So to say this is a \nstimulus is simply inaccurate and misleading.\n  So, today we are urging the Senate to consider freezing a single \nelement of the 2001 tax package. I urge my colleagues to approve a \nfiscally responsible package of tax proposals that reduce the deficit \nand stimulate the economy, instead of a massive tax cut which will do \nneither.\n  Mr. President, I request that the attached table be included for the \nRecord with my statement of support for the Feinstein-Chafee Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Records, as follows:\n\n                           TABLE 2.--TOP FEDERAL TAX BRACKET TAXPAYERS, BY STATE

Model, Preliminary.\nCitizens for Tax Justice, May 7, 2001.\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 127. A bill to allow a custodial parent a bad debt deduction for \nunpaid child support payments, and to require a parent who is \nchronically delinquent in child support to include the amount of the \nunpaid obligation in gross income; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the child Support \nEnforcement Act. This bill will bring much-needed relief to the \nmillions of families who are not receiving the child support they \ndesperately need.\n  The importance of this bill is clear. Each year, nearly 60 percent of \nthe 20 million children who are owed child support receive less than \nthe amount they are due. And more than 30 percent receive no payment at \nall. California is no exception; preliminary findings from the 2000 \nCensus Report found that of more than 2.3 million Californians who were \nowed child support, only 39 percent received those payments.\n  Clearly, millions of individuals, largely women and children, are in \ncrisis when it comes to child support. It is time to treat delinquent \nchild support the same way all other bad debt is treated in the tax \nlaw.\n  The Child Support Enforcement Act would allow custodial parents to \ndeduct the amount of child support they are owed from their adjusted \ngross income on their income taxes. This is true for all taxpayers, \nregardless of whether they itemize.\n  This bill will also penalize the non-custodial parent who is not \npaying his or her legally obligated child support. It will force the \ndeadbeat parent to add the owed amount to his adjusted gross income.\n  This is not creating new tax law. It is extending current tax law on \nbad debts to delinquent child support payments. It's that simple.\n  The relief provided in this bill is extremely important for single \nparents. Child support payments can literally mean the difference \nbetween paying rent or being homeless; the difference between putting \nfood on the table or being forced to let children go hungry; the \ndifference between making ends meet or going on welfare.\n  I am pleased to be joined in the effort by Senator Snowe. And \nRepresentative Cox has introduced the House version of the bill this \nweek as well. As you can see, this is not a partisan issue. This is a \nfamily issue. It will help families and children nationwide. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 128. A bill to assist in the consernation of cranes by supporting \nand providing, through projects of persons and organizations with \nexpertise\n\n[[Page S159]]\n\nin crane conservation, financial resources for the conservation \nprograms of countries in activities of which directly or indirectly \naffect cranes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Crane \nConservation Act of 2003. I am very pleased that the Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu, has joined me as a cosponsor of this bill. I \npropose this legislation in the hope that Congress will do its part to \nprotect the existence of these birds, whose cultural significance and \npopular appeal can be seen worldwide. This legislation is important to \nthe people of Wisconsin, as our State provides habitat and refuge to \nseveral crane species. But this legislation, which authorizes the \nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service to distribute funds and grants \nto crane conservation efforts both domestically and in developing \ncountries, promises to have a larger environmental and cultural impact \nthat will go far beyond the boundaries of my home State. This bill is \nsimilar to legislation that I introduced in the 107th Congress, which \nwas reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee but \nunfortunately did not receive floor action before the Congress \nadjourned. I have incorporated many of the changes made to my bill by \nthe Environment Committee last year, and I hope that, by doing so, this \nbill can be swiftly reported and passed.\n  In October of 1994, Congress passed and the President signed the \nRhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The passage of this act provided \nsupport for multinational rhino and tiger conservation through the \ncreation of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund, or RTCF. \nAdministered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the RTCF \ndistributes up to $10 million in grants every year to conservation \ngroups to support projects in developing countries. Since its \nestablishment in 1994, the RTCF has been expanded by Congress to cover \nother species, such as elephants and great apes.\n  Today, with the legislation I am introducing, I am asking Congress to \nadd cranes to this list. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds \nin the world, with ten of the world's fifteen species at risk of \nextinction. Specifically, this legislation would authorize up to $3 \nmillion of funds per year to be distributed in the form of conservation \nproject grants to protect cranes and their habitat. The financial \nresources authorized by this bill can be made available to qualifying \nconservation groups operating in Asia, Africa, and North America. The \nprogram is authorized from Fiscal Year 2004 through Fiscal Year 2008.\n  In keeping with my belief that we should balance the budget, this \nbill proposes that the $15 million in authorized spending over five \nyears for the Crane Conservation Act established in this legislation \nshould be offset by rescinding $18 million in unspent funds from funds \ncarried over by the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology \nProgram in the Fiscal Year 2002 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. \nThe Secretary of the Interior would be required to transfer any funds \nit does not expend under the Crane Conservation Act back to the \nTreasury at the end of Fiscal Year 2007. I do not intend my bill to \nmake any particular judgments about the Clean Coal program or its \neffectiveness, but I do think, in general, that programs should expend \nresources that we appropriate in a timely fashion.\n  I am offering this legislation due to the serious and significant \ndecline that can be expected in crane populations worldwide without \nconservation efforts. The decline of the North American whooping crane, \nthe rarest crane on earth, perfectly illustrates the dangers faced by \nthese birds. In 1941, only 21 whooping cranes existed in the entire \nworld. This stands in contrast to the almost 400 birds in existence \ntoday. The North American whooping crane's resurgence is attributed to \nthe birds' tenacity for survival and to the efforts of conservationists \nin the United States and Canada. Today, the only wild flock of North \nAmerican whooping cranes breeds in northwest Canada, and spends its \nwinters in coastal Texas. Two new flocks of cranes are currently being \nreintroduced to the wild, one of which is a migratory flock on the \nWisconsin to Florida flyway.\n  This flock of birds illustrates that any effort by Congress to \nregulate crane conservation needs to cross both national and \ninternational lines. As this flock of birds makes its journey from \nWisconsin to Florida, the birds rely on the ecosystems of a multitude \nof states in this country. In its journey from the Necedah National \nWildlife Refuge in Wisconsin to the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife \nRefuge in Florida in the fall and eventual return to my home state in \nthe spring, this flock also faces threats from pollution of traditional \nwatering grounds, collision with utility lines, human disturbance, \ndisease, predation, loss of genetic diversity within the population, \nand vulnerability to catastrophes, both natural and man-made. Despite \nthe conservation efforts taken since 1941, this symbol of conservation \nis still very much in danger of extinction.\n  While over the course of the last half-century, North American \nwhooping cranes have begun to make a slow recovery, many species of \ncrane in Africa and Asia have declined, including the sarus crane of \nAsia and the wattled crane of Africa.\n  The sarus crane stands four feet tall and can be found in the \nwetlands of northern India and south Asia. These birds require large, \nopen, well watered plains or marshes to breed and survive.\n  Due to agricultural expansion, industrial development, river basin \ndevelopment, pollution, warfare, and heavy use of pesticides prevalent \nin India and southeast Asia, the sarus crane population has been in \ndecline. Furthermore, in many areas, a high human population \nconcentration compounds these factors. On the Mekong River, which runs \nthrough Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and China, human population \ngrowth and planned development projects threaten the sarus crane. \nReports from India, Cambodia, and Thailand have also cited incidences \nof the trading of adult birds and chicks, as well as hunting and egg \nstealing in the drop-in population of the sarus crane.\n  Only three subspecies of the sarus crane exist today. One resides in \nnorthern India and Nepal, one resides in southeast Asia, and one \nresides in northern Australia. Their population is about 8,000 in the \nmain Indian population, with recent numbers showing a rapid decline. In \nSoutheast Asia, only 1,000 birds remain.\n  The situation of the sarus crane in Asia is mirrored by the situation \nof the wattled crane in Africa. In Africa, the wattled crane is found \nin the southern and eastern regions, with an isolated population in the \nmountains of Ethiopia. Current population estimates range between 6,000 \nto 8,000 and are declining rapidly, due to loss and degradation of \nwetland habitats, as well as intensified agriculture, dam construction, \nand industrialization. In other parts of the range, the creation of \ndams has changed the dynamics of the flood plains, thus further \nendangering these cranes and their habitats. Human disturbance at or \nnear breeding sites also continues to be a major threat. Lack of \noversight and education over the actions of people, industry, and \nagriculture is leading to reduced preservation for the lands on which \ncranes live, thereby threatening the ability of cranes to survive in \nthese regions.\n  If we do not act now, not only will cranes face extinction, but the \necosystems that depend on their contributions will suffer. With the \ndecline of the crane population, the wetlands and marshes they inhabit \ncan potentially be thrown off balance. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting legislation that can provide funding to the local \nfarming, education and enforcement projects that can have the greatest \npositive effect on the preservation of both cranes and fragile \nhabitats. This small investment can secure the future of these \nexemplary birds and the beautiful areas in which they live. Therefore, \nI ask my colleagues to support the Crane Conservation Act of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kerry, \n        and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 130. A bill to amend the labeling requirements of the Dolphin \nProtection Consumer Information Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Truth in Tuna \nLabeling Act.'' This important legislation\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\nwill ensure that the fishing of tuna labeled ``dolphin safe'' does not \nkill, harm or attack dolphins, and that consumers are given accurate \ninformation on how the tuna they purchase is caught. My bill will \nguarantee that tuna products labeled ``dolphin safe'' will be truly \nsafe for dolphins.\n  In 1990, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, introduced \nby myself in the House and Senator Biden in the Senate, created a \n``dolphin safe'' label for consumers. This legislation was passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and it allowed American consumers to \nbuy tuna bearing the ``dolphin safe'' label with confidence, knowing \nthat their purchase did not trade dolphin mortalities for tuna fishing \nprofit.\n  Dolphin and yellowfin tuna tend to run together in some waters. \nDolphin swim closer to the surface to breathe. Under the destructive \n``chase and encirclement'' practice, helicopters spot the schools of \ndolphin. Speedboats deliberately encircle the dolphins and cast a mile-\nwide net, knowing that the tuna will be below. While the tunas are to \nbe harvested, the hope is that the dolphins will escape the edges of \nthe net and suffocation or capture. This practice is termed ``purse \nseine netting.''\n  According to the annual reports of the Marine Mammal Commission and \nthe Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, dolphin mortality in the \neastern tropical Pacific alone has decreased from more than 100,000 \ndolphin kills each year to fewer than 2,000 kills each year since the \npassage of the ``dolphin safe'' label in 1990.\n  Unfortunately, on New Year's Eve, the Commerce Department announced \nits plans to make the labeling standard largely meaningless by changing \nthe definition of ``dolphin safe'' tuna to allow the label to be put on \ntuna harvested through deadly purse seine netting.\n  This flies in the face of all available scientific information.\n  According to the Marine Mammal Commission, ``. . . the results of the \n[National Marine Fisheries] Service's research program . . . provide \nevidence that the practice of chasing and encircling dolphins is having \nadverse effects on the recover of depleted dolphin stocks and that the \nmagnitude of those effects, at both the individual and population \nlevels, may be significant.''\n  The report prepared by the Commerce Department reached a similar \nconclusion. It said, ``. . . despite considerable effort by fishery \nscientists, there is little evidence of recovery, and concerns remain \nthat the practice of chasing and circling dolphins somehow is adversely \naffecting the ability of those depleted stocks to recover.''\n  The new rule completely undermines the integrity of the ``dolphin \nsafe'' label, allowing ``dolphin safe'' labels to be placed on dolphin \ndeadly tuna, and misleading the public. These changes fly in the face \nof the bipartisan legislation that was enacted in response to public \noutcry and consumer demand.\n  As one who fought in the past to protect dolphins and inform \nconsumers, I believe that the effectiveness of the label will be \nseverely undermined by the change and will allow the continued \ndeterioration of dolphin populations. This administration has once \nagain continued its attack on the environment by weakening protections \nfor marine mammals, ignoring science, and providing yet another favor \nto industry.\n  Therefore, I am introducing the ``Truth in Tuna Labeling Act'' to \nreinstate the original ``dolphin safe'' label.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 131. A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy \nReorganization Act of 1974 to strengthen security at sensitive nuclear \nfacilities; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. Today I am joined by Senators Clinton, \nJeffords, Lieberman, Harkin and Edwards in introducing the Nuclear \nSecurity Act of 2003.\n  The tragedy of September 11 taught us many things. It taught us the \nvulnerability of our Nation's buildings and the strength of our \nnation's resolve. We also learned how important our first responders \nthe brave men and women who arrive at the scene when there is an \nemergency. Finally, we are reminded that we must be prepared for \ntoday's threats because they could become tomorrow's attacks.\n  Last year, I introduced legislation to improve the safety of our \nNation's nuclear power plants. Nearly one year has passed since the \nPresident warned us in his last State of the Union address how \nvulnerable these facilities are, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nhas still not taken any clear steps to improve the safety and security \nof our nation's nuclear power plants. That is not acceptable.\n  Recent reports by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Inspector \nGeneral paint a bleak picture of the NRC's commitment to safety and \nsecurity.\n  Just a few days ago, the Inspector General released a survey of NRC \nemployees.\n  According to the Associated Press that survey found that a third of \nthe Agency's employees question the agency's commitment to public \nsafety and nearly half are not comfortable raising concerns about \nsafety issues within the agency.\n  The survey also found that some NRC employees worry that safety \ntraining requirements for nuclear facilities are outdated and ``leave \nthe security of the nuclear sites . . . vulnerable to sabotage.''\n  So today, we are reintroducing legislation to protect our nation's \ncommercial nuclear facilities.\n  This legislation will fill the void that has been left by the NRC's \nunwillingness to challenge the industry when terrorists could.\n  In particular, it will: establish a task force--chaired by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC to take a comprehensive look at the \nsecurity of our nuclear facilities.\n  Assign a new Federal security coordinator to each nuclear power \nplant. Each plant should have a dedicated NRC employee responsible for \nensuring the appropriate coordination and communication between \nfederal, state, and local emergency response and law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Establish a new antiterrorism team, which will provide additional \nsupport to the existing private security forces. This team will be a \nmodel for how to protect other potentially vulnerable elements of our \nenergy infrastructure.\n  Require the NRC to update the threats nuclear power plants must \nprotect against; Require the NRC to make a comprehensive review of \nemergency and security plans; Require the NRC to establish a new threat \nlevel system for nuclear power plants; Require the NRC to revise and \nupdate their hiring and training standards.\n  Establish a new, rigorous program to test nuclear facilities against \nrealistic threats. This is the kind of training security guards are \nasking for.\n  In developing this bill, we listened to the concerns of guards and to \nthe concerns of Americans who live and work near these facilities.\n  In opposing this bill, the Administration continues to listen instead \nto the nuclear power industry.\n  It is time the Administration lived up to its commitments to make our \nnation's nuclear power plants more secure.\n  It is time the Administration listens to the people who really \nmatter, not the companies for whom only profit matters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 132. A bill to place a moratorium on executions by the Federal \nGovernment and urge the States to do the same, while a National \nCommission on the Death Penalty reviews the fairness of the imposition \nof the death penalty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this week, the University of Maryland \nreleased the findings of its landmark 2-year study on Maryland's death \npenalty system. The report reveals disturbing racial and geographic \ndisparities in the administration of the death penalty in Maryland. It \nconfirms the alarming conclusion that the administration of our \ncriminal justice system's ultimate punishment is flawed and far from \nfair or just.\n  That is why I rise today to reintroduce the National Death Penalty \nMoratorium Act. This bill seeks to apply the wisdom of out-going \nMaryland Governor Parris Glendening and out-going\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\nIllinois Governor George Ryan to the Federal Government and all States \nthat authorize the use of capital punishment. The bill would place a \nmoratorium on Federal executions and urge States to do the same. The \nbill would also create a National Commission on the Death Penalty to \nreview the fairness of the administration of the death penalty at the \nState and Federal levels. This Commission would be an independent, blue \nribbon panel of distinguished prosecutors, defense attorneys, jurists \nand others. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nLevin, Corzine, and Durbin, have joined me in cosponsoring this bill.\n  The University of Maryland study was conducted by Professor Raymond \nPaternoster of the University's Institute of Criminal Justice and \nCriminology, and is the most exhaustive study of Maryland's application \nof the death penalty in history. Professor Paternoster and other \nresearchers examined records of every homicide prosecution in which the \ndeath penalty could have been sought, dating back to 1978.\n  The study released this week found that blacks accused of killing \nwhites are simply more likely to receive a death sentence than blacks \nwho kill blacks, or than white killers. According to the report, black \noffenders who kill whites are four times as likely to be sentenced to \ndeath as blacks who kill blacks, and twice as likely to get a death \nsentence as whites who kill whites.\n  The study also confirms geographic disparity in Maryland's death \npenalty system. Those convicted of murder in Baltimore County, a \njurisdiction with a high number of white murder victims, are 26 times \nas likely to be sentenced to death as those convicted in Baltimore \nCity, and 14 times as likely as those convicted in Montgomery County.\n  Two years ago, when Governor Glendening learned of these suspected \ndisparities, he did not look the other way. Then last year, faced with \nthe rapid approach of a scheduled execution, he acknowledged that it \nwas unacceptable to allow executions to take place while the study he \nhad ordered was not yet complete. So, in May 2002, he placed a \nmoratorium on executions. That was the right thing to do.\n\n  I urge Governor-elect Ehrlich to do the right thing by extending the \nmoratorium. It would be contrary to our Nation's founding principles of \nfairness and justice to execute anyone in Maryland before the questions \nraised by the study are addressed.\n  The year 2002 was a landmark year for the examination of the death \npenalty. Last year the 102nd person was exonerated from death row in \nthe modern death penalty era; 102 innocent people have been exonerated, \nin some cases just days from execution, after being found innocent of \ncrimes for which they served sometimes years on death row. That is not \na small number. In the modern death penalty era, our Nation has \nexecuted 820 people. That means that according to our best estimates, \nsince the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, for every 8 people \nexecuted, one who had been convicted and sentenced to death has been \nfound innocent.\n  That is an unacceptable high error rate in the administration of a \npunishment for which errors caught too late cannot be fixed. That's a \nrate of error with which none of us should be comfortable.\n  We should learn from the example set by Governor Glendening and by \nGovernor Ryan. Their voices are two of the many that have chimed in \nover recent years to express doubt about the fairness of our Nation's \nsystem of capital punishment. As evidence of the flaws in our system \nmounts, it has created an awareness that has not escaped the attention \nof the American people. Layer after layer of confidence in the death \npenalty system has been gradually peeling away, and the voices of those \nquestioning its fairness are growing louder and louder. Now they can be \nheard from college campuses and court rooms and podiums across the \nnation, to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room, to the Supreme \nCourt. We must not ignore them.\n  In 2002, Governor Ryan's Commission on Capital Punishment issued its \nreport, which concluded with 85 recommendations for reforming the death \npenalty system. In June 2002, I held a hearing in the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Constitution on the report of the Illinois \nGovernor's Commission on Capital Punishment. We were fortunate to have \nGovernor Ryan and other members of the Commission testify about the \nmany flaws in the Illinois death penalty system and their \nrecommendations for reform.\n  The Illinois study and report are invaluable to the study of fairness \nin our justice system. Governor Ryan's Commission provides a model for \nthe nation for how we can respond to the indisputable proof of errors \nin our justice system. I am confident that as Governor Ryan leaves \noffice next week, his greatest legacy to our nation will be the courage \nhe showed three years ago when he suspended executions and acknowledged \nthat the death penalty system in Illinois was broken.\n\n  If we are prepared to admit, as Illinois and Maryland have, that \nthere are flaws in the death penalty system, then it is unconscionable \nto allow executions to continue without a thorough, nationwide review. \nThe problems in the Illinois and Maryland systems are not unique to \ntheir states. Since reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 81 \npercent of capital cases have involved white victims, even though only \n50 percent of murder victims are white. Nationwide, more than half of \nthe death row inmates are African-Americans or Hispanic-Americans. \nThere is evidence of racial disparities, inadequate counsel, \nprosecutorial misconduct, and false scientific evidence in death \npenalty systems across the country.\n  In 2002, we saw progress here in Congress in addressing problems \nplaguing the death penalty. The Innocence Protection Act, introduced by \nmy distinguished colleague and ranking member on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, was favorably reported from the Judiciary \nCommittee in July. This legislation takes an important step by \nrecognizing the need for access to modern DNA testing and certain \nminimum standards of competency for defense counsel in capital cases.\n  I commend Senator Leahy and the bipartisan effort of my colleagues \nwho helped move this important bill and I hope we will finish the job \nand enact it into law this year. But I also urge them and the rest of \nthe Senate to recognize that if we are prepared to admit that we need \nthese reforms, a time-out is also needed to ensure that we do not \nexecute a single innocent person. The stakes are too high and the \nconsequences are far too devastating to allow executions to proceed.\n  Also in 2002, in a significant turning point for our Nation, the \nSupreme Court reversed itself and ruled unconstitutional the execution \nof the mentally retarded in Atkins versus Virginia. The Court's \ndecision further confirms that our Nation's standards of decency \nconcerning the ultimate punishment are indeed evolving and maturing.\n  While last year's events are steps toward fairness and indications of \nprogress, they also serve as shocking reminders that our system is \nseriously flawed. The statistics reflecting unfairness and stories of \ninnocent people wrongly convicted are clear and disturbing to all \nAmericans who believe in the founding principles of our Nation, liberty \nand justice for all.\n  When examined collectively, these facts paint a devastating picture \nthat needs to be examined in much greater detail.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the \nNational Death Penalty Moratorium Act.\n  The courts in this country have already made, by our best, \nconservative estimates, 102 very grave mistakes. One hundred and two \nmistakes in the death penalty system qualifies as a crisis. And a \ncrisis calls for immediate action. The time for a moratorium is now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Death Penalty \n     Moratorium Act of 2003''.\n\n                TITLE I--MORATORIUM ON THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\n       (1) General findings.--\n       (A) The administration of the death penalty by the Federal \n     government and the States should be consistent with our \n     Nation's fundamental principles of fairness, justice, \n     equality, and due process.\n       (B) Congress should consider that more than ever Americans \n     are questioning the use of the death penalty and calling for \n     assurances that it be fairly applied.\n       (C) Documented unfairness in the Federal system requires \n     Congress to act and suspend Federal executions. Additionally, \n     substantial evidence of unfairness throughout death penalty \n     States justifies further investigation by Congress.\n       (2) Administration of the death penalty by the federal \n     government.--\n       (A) The fairness of the administration of the Federal death \n     penalty has recently come under serious scrutiny, \n     specifically raising questions of racial and geographic \n     disparities:\n       (i) Almost 75 percent of Federal death row inmates are \n     members of minority groups.\n       (ii) A report released by the Department of Justice on \n     September 12, 2000, found that 80 percent of defendants who \n     were charged with death-eligible offenses under Federal law \n     and whose cases were submitted by the United States attorneys \n     under the Department's death penalty decision-making \n     procedures were African American, Hispanic American, or \n     members of other minority groups.\n       (iii) The Department of Justice report shows that United \n     States attorneys in only 5 of 94 Federal districts--1 each in \n     Virginia, Maryland, Puerto Rico, and 2 in New York--submit 40 \n     percent of all cases in which the death penalty is \n     considered.\n       (iv) The Department of Justice report shows that United \n     States attorneys who have frequently recommended seeking the \n     death penalty are often from States with a high number of \n     executions under State law, including Texas, Virginia, and \n     Missouri.\n       (v) The Department of Justice report shows that white \n     defendants are more likely than black defendants to negotiate \n     plea bargains saving them from the death penalty in Federal \n     cases.\n       (vi) A study conducted by the House Judiciary Subcommittee \n     on Civil and Constitutional Rights in 1994 concluded that 89 \n     percent of defendants selected for capital prosecution under \n     the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 were either African American \n     or Hispanic American.\n       (vii) The National Institute of Justice has already set \n     into motion a comprehensive study of these racial and \n     geographic disparities.\n       (viii) Federal executions should not proceed until these \n     disparities are fully studied, discussed, and the federal \n     death penalty process is subjected to necessary remedial \n     action.\n       (B) In addition to racial and geographic disparities in the \n     administration of the federal death penalty, other serious \n     questions exist about the fairness and reliability of federal \n     death penalty prosecutions:\n       (i) Federal prosecutors rely heavily on bargained-for \n     testimony from accomplices of the capital defendant, which is \n     often obtained in exchange for not seeking the death penalty \n     against the accomplices. This practice creates a serious risk \n     of false testimony.\n       (ii) Federal prosecutors are not required to provide \n     discovery sufficiently ahead of trial to permit the defense \n     to be prepared to use this information effectively in \n     defending their clients.\n       (iii) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in \n     increasing isolation from the rest of the nation's law \n     enforcement agencies, refuses to make electronic recordings \n     of interrogations that produce confessions, thus making \n     subsequent scrutiny of the legality and reliability of such \n     interrogations more difficult.\n       (iv) Federal prosecutors rely heavily on predictions of \n     ``future dangerousness''--predictions deemed unreliable and \n     misleading by the American Psychiatric Association and the \n     American Psychological Association--to secure death \n     sentences.\n       (3) Administration of the death penalty by the states.--\n       (A) The punishment of death carries an especially heavy \n     burden to be free from arbitrariness and discrimination. The \n     Supreme Court has held that ``super due process'', a higher \n     standard than that applied in regular criminal trials, is \n     necessary to meet constitutional requirements. There is \n     significant evidence that States are not providing this \n     heightened level of due process. For example:\n       (i) In the most comprehensive review of modern death \n     sentencing, Professor James Liebman and researchers at \n     Columbia University found that, during the period 1973 to \n     1995, 68 percent of all death penalty cases reviewed were \n     overturned due to serious constitutional errors. In the wake \n     of the Liebman study, 6 States (Arizona, Maryland, North \n     Carolina, Illinois, Indiana, and Nebraska) have conducted \n     additional studies. These studies expose additional problems.\n       (ii) Forty percent of the cases overturned were reversed in \n     Federal court after having been upheld by the States.\n       (B) The high rate of error throughout all death penalty \n     jurisdictions suggests that there is a grave risk that \n     innocent persons may have been, or will likely be, wrongfully \n     executed. Although the Supreme Court has never conclusively \n     addressed the issue of whether executing an innocent person \n     would in and of itself violate the Constitution, in Herrara \n     v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), a majority of the court \n     expressed the view that a persuasive demonstration of actual \n     innocence would violate substantive due process rendering \n     imposition of a death sentence unconstitutional. In any \n     event, the wrongful conviction and sentencing of a person to \n     death is a serious concern for many Americans. For example:\n       (i) After 13 innocent people were released from Illinois \n     death row in the same period that the State had executed 12 \n     people, on January 31, 2000, Governor George Ryan of Illinois \n     imposed a moratorium on executions until he could be ``sure \n     with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing \n     a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate''.\n       (ii) Since 1973, over 100 innocent persons sitting on death \n     rows across the country have been exonerated, most after \n     serving lengthy sentences.\n       (C) Wrongful convictions create a serious public safety \n     problem because the true killer is still at large, while the \n     innocent person languishes in prison.\n       (D) There are many systemic problems that result in \n     innocent people being convicted such as mistaken \n     identification, reliance on jailhouse informants, reliance on \n     faulty forensic testing and no access to reliable DNA \n     testing. For example:\n       (i) A study of cases of innocent people who were later \n     exonerated, conducted by attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter \n     Neufeld with ``The Innocence Project'' at Cardozo Law School, \n     showed that mistaken identifications of eyewitnesses or \n     victims contributed to 84 percent of the wrongful \n     convictions.\n       (ii) Many persons on death row were convicted prior to 1994 \n     and did not receive the benefit of modern DNA testing. At \n     least 10 individuals sentenced to death have been exonerated \n     through post-conviction DNA testing, some within days of \n     execution. Yet in spite of the current widespread prevalence \n     and availability of DNA testing, many States have procedural \n     barriers blocking introduction of post-conviction DNA \n     testing. More than 30 States have laws that require a motion \n     for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence to be \n     filed within 6 months or less.\n       (iii) The widespread use of jailhouse snitches who earn \n     reduced charges or sentences by fabricating ``admissions'' by \n     fellow inmates to unsolved crimes can lead to wrongful \n     convictions.\n       (iv) The misuse of forensic evidence can lead to wrongful \n     convictions. A report from the Texas Defender Service \n     entitled ``A State of Denial: Texas and the Death Penalty'' \n     found 160 cases of official forensic misconduct including 121 \n     cases where expert psychiatrists testified ``with absolute \n     certainty that the defendant would be a danger in the \n     future'', often without even interviewing the defendant.\n       (E) The sixth amendment to the Constitution guarantees all \n     accused persons access to competent counsel. The Supreme \n     Court set out standards for determining competency in the \n     case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). \n     Unfortunately, there is unequal access to competent counsel \n     throughout death penalty States. For example:\n       (i) Ninety percent of capital defendants cannot afford to \n     hire their own attorney.\n       (ii) Fewer than one-quarter of the 38 death penalty States \n     have set any standards for competency of counsel and in those \n     few States, these standards were set only recently. In most \n     States, any person who passes a bar examination, even if that \n     attorney has never represented a client in any type of case, \n     may represent a client in a death penalty case.\n       (iii) Thirty-seven percent of capital cases were reversed \n     because of ineffective assistance of counsel, according to \n     the Columbia study.\n       (iv) The Texas report noted problems with Texas defense \n     attorneys who slept through capital trials, ignored obvious \n     exculpatory evidence, suffered discipline for ethical lapses \n     or for being under the influence of drugs or alcohol while \n     representing an indigent capital defendant at trial.\n       (v) Poor lawyering was also cited by Governor Ryan in \n     Illinois as a basis for a moratorium. More than half of all \n     capital defendants there were represented by lawyers who were \n     later disciplined or disbarred for unethical conduct.\n       (F) The Supreme Court has held that it is a violation of \n     the eighth amendment to impose the death penalty in a manner \n     that is arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. McKlesky v. \n     Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987). Studies consistently indicate \n     racial disparity in the application of the death penalty both \n     for the defendants and the victims. The death penalty is \n     disparately applied in various regions throughout the \n     country, suggesting arbitrary administration of the death \n     penalty based on where the prosecution takes place. For \n     example:\n       (i) Since 1976, 45 percent of death row inmates were white, \n     43 percent were black, 9 percent were Hispanic, and 2 percent \n     were of other racial groups. Of the victims in the underlying \n     murder, 81 percent were white, 14 percent were black, and 4 \n     percent were Hispanic. While over 80 percent of completed \n     capital cases involve white victims, nationally only 50 \n     percent of murder victims are white. These figures show a \n     continuing trend since reinstatement of the modern death \n     penalty of a predominance of white victims' cases and implies \n     that white victims are considered more valuable in the \n     criminal justice system.\n       (ii) Executions are conducted predominately in southern \n     States. Ninety percent of\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\n     all executions in 2000 were conducted in the south. Only 3 \n     States outside the south, Arizona, California, and Missouri, \n     conducted an execution in 2000. Texas accounted for almost as \n     many executions as all the remaining States combined.\n       (G) The Supreme Court recently reversed itself and has \n     ruled the execution of the mentally retarded unconstitutional \n     and in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

A bill to temporarily increase the Federal medical assistance \npercentage for the medicaid program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this budget cycle State legislators \nface the largest deficits in 50 years. To balance combined budget \ndeficits of $60 to $85 billion, most States will be forced to raise \ntaxes and cut spending. In July of last year, 75 Senators voted to \nprovide meaningful fiscal relief to the states. That is why I return to \nthe floor today to introduce ``The State Budget Relief Act of 2003,'' \nwith my friends and colleagues Senators Collins, Ben Nelson, and Gordon \nSmith. This bipartisan legislation will provide $20 billion in \nimmediate assistance to states to help pay for increases in Medicaid \nenrollment due to rising unemployment and to stop cuts in health \ninsurance coverage, child care, education and other social services due \nto state budget crises.\n  As one of the largest State programs, Medicaid has become \nincreasingly vulnerable as a target for cuts. In 11 States, legislators \nhave proposed and adopted cuts that when fully implemented will strip \nhealth insurance coverage from approximately one million low-income \npeople. Further, when governors release their budgets this month, that \nnumber is expected to climb much higher than one million. Most of these \npeople are parents and children in working families that will go \nuninsured without Medicaid coverage.\n  If States are forced to institute further Medicaid cuts, our most \nvulnerable Americans will be left out in the cold. In West Virginia, \nMedicaid provides coverage to 14 percent of the population. Just this \nweek, a West Virginia health clinic, which provides the only care for \nMedicaid patients in town, was forced to lay off 18 employees. The \nclinic is at risk because the State Medicaid program does not have the \nmoney to pay it for services.\n  These problems are not unique to West Virginia. Stories from across \nthe country show that many states will be forced to seek solutions to \ntheir budget crises at the expense of low-income people covered by \nMedicaid. On December 30th, the LA Times reported that California is \nconsidering proposals that would cut coverage for 500,000 people by the \nend of fiscal year 2004. This is more than one-third of the total \nnumber of people, nationally, who lost coverage in all of 2001.\n  Some Senators might ask why we should help the States. The answer to \nthat question is that the current economic downturn and the continuing \nState fiscal crises are hurting people across this country and a great \nmany more people will be hurt in the next 18 months. The budget \ndeficits are too large for States to cover alone without threatening \nthe health and welfare of millions of Americans.\n  The bipartisan ``State Budget Relief Act'' provides a temporary \nincrease in Federal Medicaid matching rates, which will help reduce the \npressure on states to cut health insurance coverage for low-income \nfamilies and individuals. It grants states money that they can use for \nsocial services such as education and child care. Finally, the bill \nholds States harmless for reduced Federal match rates in fiscal year \n2002. As a result of these provisions, West Virginia would receive $127 \nmillion to help balance its budget.\n  I want to stress that this proposal is a critical component of \neconomic stimulus. In this time of economic downturn, we need to ensure \nthat there will be a safety net for low-income people and that states \nare not placing a further drag on the economy in efforts to balance \ntheir budgets. Several States have completed Medicaid economic impact \nstudies within the last year. These reports conclude that in addition \nto the personal toll that loss of coverage takes on people, Medicaid \ncuts create an economic ripple effect by contributing to job and income \nlosses for individuals and reduced output for businesses. The \nPresident's proposed economic stimulus package ignores this storm \nbrewing in the States. It provides no fiscal relief for states and, in \nfact, worsens the problem by reducing state revenues by more than $4 \nbillion a year through the individual tax cut on dividends.\n  In contrast, our bipartisan proposal provides immediate, temporary \nrelief to States that will complement other economic stimulus \nstrategies while protecting the health of millions of Americans. It \nwill be effective for 18 months from April 2003. I am extremely \ndisappointed that the Administration failed to include any real relief \nfor the states in its own massive stimulus package. I think that is a \nserious mistake, and I will fight to include the proposal introduced by \nSenators Collins, Ben Nelson, Gordon Smith and myself in any stimulus \npackage we deal with in the Senate Finance Committee or on the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 138\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to \nintroduce legislation to assist State governments badly hurt by poor \neconomic conditions and declining revenue. This legislation, that I am \nproud to be introducing with my good friends Senators Collins and \nRockefeller, will provide $20 billion in Federal assistance to States.\n  Last July, 75 of our colleagues agreed with us that we need to help \nthe States and passed a similar plan that we authored. Unfortunately, \nthe House failed to act on our bill. In that timeframe, the budget \nsituation in the States has gotten worse, not better. New estimates \nshow the States facing a $60 to $85 billion shortfall next year. This \nis why I come to the floor today to introduce ``The State Budget Relief \nAct of 2003.''\n  The Federal and State governments are a partnership. When State \ngovernments are in a budget crisis, the Federal Government must step in \nand fulfill the obligations to the programs people rely on. We have the \nsame constituents and the same goals.\n  The bipartisan fiscal relief package will provide assistance through \na temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, \nFMAP, of Medicaid and $10 billion in social service block grants. This \nbill strikes a good balance by providing direct relief to Medicaid, \nwhich is one of the fastest growing programs in State budgets, while \ngiving Governors needed flexibility through the block grants. This 18-\nmonth package will provide over $104 million in new funds to Nebraska.\n  As a former Governor, I know how hard it is for States to maintain a \nbalanced budget. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \ntake that step to avert, at least in part, potentially damaging cuts to \nMedicaid as well as to other social services programs. If we do not \nhelp the States, any other Federal economic stimulus will likely be \nlost in State and local tax hikes and spending cuts.\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 139. A bill to provide for a program of scientific research on \nabrupt climate change, to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions in the United States by establishing a market-driven system \nof greenhouse gas tradeable allowances that could be used \ninterchangably with passenger vehicle fuel economy standard credits, to \nlimit greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and reduce \ndependence upon foreign oil, and ensure benefits to consumers from the \ntrading in such allowances; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator McCain, to introduce the first ever comprehensive \nlegislation to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases in the United \nStates. Today we take the first step up a long mountain road, a road \nthat will culminate with this country taking credible action to address \nthe global problems of our warming planet. The rest of the world is now \ntaking on the challenge this problem presents. The United States, as \nthe world's largest emitter of the gases and the home of the world's \nstrongest economy, must not have its head in the clouds.\n  Climate change is not a new problem. Recently, I had come across my \ndesk a 1979 document produced by the National Academy of Sciences at \nthe request of then-President Carter. The document says, ``When it is \nassumed that the CO2 content of the atmosphere has doubled, the more \nrealistic of the modeling efforts predict a global surface warming of \nbetween 2 degrees and 3.5 degrees with greater increases at higher \naltitudes.'' That is remarkably similar to last year's national \ncommunication on climate change that predicted a warming of 2.5 degrees \nto 4 degrees over the next century. So in some sense, we have known \nabout this problem for over two decades. That's two decades of neglect. \nWe don't need to spin our wheels in the mud any longer. It is time to \nget traction. It is time to take action.\n  I do not believe there is any longer any credible dissent on the \ncentral question: namely, whether human-caused climate change is \nhappening. The thermometer mercury is creeping up, glaciers are \nmelting, and waters are rising. According to a NASA study released last \nmonth, the permanent, summer ice cap over the Arctic Ocean is \ndisappearing far faster than previously thought and will at this rate \nbe gone by the end of the century. And just last week, two major new \nresearch studies said global warming is already posing a dire threat to \nthe world's plants and animals, a danger that is likely to rise \ndramatically, with the temperature, in the coming years.\n  The scientific evidence is potent and persuasive. But we've witnessed \nother changes across the globe that have anecdotally announced the \narrival of global warming to human populations. I noticed two examples \nrecently that resonated with me; both come from the Arctic north, and \nin my view are canaries in the climate change coalmine.\n  The first example comes from the Native American populations of \nAlaska and Northern Canada. In just the past few years, a robin \nappeared in an Inupiat village in Alaska. Unfortunately, the elders, \ndespite an intimate awareness of their 10,000 year old language, did \nnot know what to call the bird. You see, there is no word for robin in \ntheir language.\n  A second example comes from the town of Nenana, AK, which has an \nannual lottery to determine when a tripod placed on the frozen Tenana \nRiver would break through the ice. And over the past 50 years, that \nbreakthrough has occurred earlier and earlier.\n  So, it's not only in the language of statistics that climate change \nis occurring. It's in the language of everyday life.\n  The nature of this problem is that it gets worse every year we fail \nto face it head on. It's not unlike the federal budget deficit. The \nweight of the interest payments bearing down on us grow over time and \ndig us deeper and deeper into a hole of our own making. So too with \nglobal warming. Today the problem is manageable. Tomorrow, quite \nliterally, we could be up to our waists in it.\n  There are a few remaining skeptics who still doubt that human \ngreenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change but even \nthey should understand the wisdom of taking preventive action. Even \nthey should realize that reducing greenhouse gas emissions now is the \nbest insurance policy against the possibility of future catastrophe.\n  The question remains, then, what we should do about it. There is no \neasy fix. Carbon dioxide, once released, stays in our atmosphere for \nabout a century, so any solution needs to be long-term. But I believe \nthat the legislation we have drafted and will soon introduce will take \nus on the path to that ultimate solution, and do so in a way that can \nprovide an economic boost, not an economic burden, to American \nbusinesses. Given our flagging economy, this is a critical point for us \nall to absorb.\n  Our approach works like this. The country's overall emissions will be \ncapped, then individual companies will have the flexibility to find the \nmost innovative and cost-effective ways to drive their emissions down. \nThey will trade pollution credits, also called allowances, with each \nother rather than paying penalties to the government.\n  The result of that innovative model is that we will unleash and \nfocuses the genius of American enterprise to take on a critical common \nchallenge. And the innovation unleashed as companies compete will \ncreate a boomlet of new, high-paying jobs. It's no wonder the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page endorsed this approach saying that it \nwould achieve the same amount of overall pollution reduction at a lower \ncost than traditional regulation, and urging the Bush Administration to \nsign on.\n  In making its endorsement, The Wall Street Journal looked, as we did, \nat the record. Many similar programs have helped solve pollution \nproblems throughout the country and the world. The most well-known \nexample is the Acid Rain Trading Program in the 1990 Clean Air Act, one \nof the most successful environmental programs in history and something \nI was proud to have a hand in creating. This program secured strict \ncuts in sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants at less than a \nquarter of the predicted costs to industry.\n  We have some initial reaction to our proposal from our country's \nleading economists, and the response has been positive. For instance, \nSteven DeCanio, a professor of economics at the University of \nCalifornia, Santa Barbara and the former staff economist on this issue \nin the Reagan White House, stated the following about our proposal:\n\n       The Climate Stewardship Act of 2003 is a good first step \n     towards the ultimate goal of stabilizing levels of greenhouse \n     gas emissions that will prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate. The Bill embodies market \n     mechanisms that will enable emissions reductions to be \n     accomplished efficiently, and has provisions for an equitable \n     allocation of the emissions permits. Funds are set aside to \n     assist workers and communities that may be adversely affected \n     by the transition. The Bill permits flexibility in the manner \n     by which the emissions reductions are achieved, including \n     allowing credits for verifiable enhancement of carbon sinks \n     and limited international emissions trading. The proposed \n     legislation also encourages investment in energy-efficiency \n     technologies, as well as the establishment of a national \n     emissions database and funding for new research. All of these \n     features of the Bill are components of a strategy that can \n     enable the United States to begin to make meaningful \n     reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is \n     supportive of economic growth and beneficial to our standard \n     of living. It is entirely appropriate that the risks of \n     global climate change be addressed in specific legislation at \n     this time.\n\n  But this bill is more than a broad policy proposal. It is a detailed \nlegislative design for the system. Our staffs have been working \nardently over the past 16 months to craft a detailed proposal that \ncould find support both in the halls of industry and amongst the \nnation's leading environmental organizations. Hopefully that means that \nboth sides of the aisle in Congress will find something to their \nliking. I hope all involved realized that this is no marker bill; it is \na comprehensive proposal. Please indulge me as I run through a few of \nthe key details.\n  Our bill covers the four main sectors of the U.S. economy that emit \ngreenhouse gases: electric utilities, industrial plants, \ntransportation, and large commercial facilities. For each of these \nsectors, we ease back on the greenhouse gas accelerator, spreading the \nburden equally amongst the companies. The progress required is real but\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\nrealistic. By the year 2010, we ask only that they return to 2000 \nlevels. By 2016, we ask that they return to their 1990 levels, in \nkeeping with our treaty commitment under the Rio Convention.\n  In doing so, we provide each participant with a generous amount of \nflexibility on how to comply with their obligations. There is no limit \non the amount of allowances that they may obtain from other \nparticipants in the system. Moreover, companies in the system can avail \nthemselves of ``alternative compliance'' options, including \nsequestration projects, international reductions, and verified \nreductions made by parties outside the system. Such ``alternative \ncompliance'' options can be used to satisfy 300 percent of the average \ncompanies' obligation.\n  These alternative compliance options will have other benefits as \nwell. As many members of this committee already know, sequestration \nprojects can produce environmental benefits beyond the benefit to the \nclimate, including reduced deforestation and more sustainable \nagricultural practices. Such projects also bring a needed infusion of \nmoney into the farm economy not through subsidies, but through the sale \nof a new ``crop,'' sequestered carbon dioxide. Even now, with a purely \nspeculative market in greenhouse gases, Entergy Services and Pacific \nNorthwest Direct Seed Association brokered a deal for 30,000 million \nmetric tons of carbon over 10 years. The sale price was not divulged, \nbut the point is that the deal was made even in the absence of a real \nmarket. Our program would greatly increase the opportunity for these \ntypes of sales by farmers.\n  Our businesses will benefit dramatically from the regulatory \ncertainty that our bill will provide. Businesses now receive a \nconfusing set of messages from the Federal Government. On the one hand, \nthey know that, with climate change worsening every year, government \nwill somehow and sometime have to require them to reduce their \nemissions. As the Conference Board recently noted in a June 2002 \nreport, ``climate change is an issue business executives ignore at \ntheir peril.'' On the other hand, businesses are being left uncertain \nabout Washington's ultimate global warming policy plans, and therefore \nhave a perverse incentive to put off any real anti-pollution technology \ninvestments.\n  Indeed, our innovation economy more broadly is unwilling or unable to \nengage while the Federal Government continues to vacillate. As a \nresult, we are losing countless dollars in new market and job \nopportunities. Europe and Japan already have an early head start in the \npollution reduction industry. That lead will only grow if our \ngovernment stands pat.\n  Finally, I want to mention one other, perhaps unlikely reason to \nsupport this legislation beyond our economic and environmental well \nbeing, and that's foreign policy. Many of our most important allies are \nmuch more worried about climate change than we in the United States \nhave historically been. When the Bush administration plays down the \nrisks of global warming and shows no interest in devising a serious \nsolution, it frays our relationship with those allies. That's \nespecially true since we as a nation are responsible for about a \nquarter of the world's total climate change problem.\n  We should never compromise critical American policy simply to satisfy \nthe international community. But in this case, doing what's in our own \nbest environmental and economic interests will also earn respect and \nsupport around the world. And lest we forget it also happens to be the \nright thing to do.\n  The Earth is not only ours to use; we are stewards of it, who must \nhold it in trust for future generations to live in, breathe in, and, \nyes, prosper in. Regrettably, this Nation's climate change policy to \ndate has not respected our role as stewards. It is time we reverse that \ntrend, and our bill will help do exactly that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

BORROWING AGAINST FUTURE REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall establish a \n     program under which a covered entity may--\n       (1) receive a credit in the current calendar year for \n     anticipated reductions in emissions in a future calendar \n     year; and\n       (2) use the credit in lieu of a tradeable allowance to meet \n     the requirements of this Act for the current calendar year, \n     subject to the limitation imposed by section 312(b).\n       (b) Determination of Tradeable Allowance Credits.--The \n     Administrator may make credits available under subsection (a) \n     only for anticipated reductions in emissions that--\n       (1) are attributable to the realization of capital \n     investments in equipment, the construction, reconstruction, \n     or acquisition of facilities, or the deployment of new \n     technologies--\n       (A) for which the covered entity has executed a binding \n     contract and secured, or applied for, all necessary permits \n     and operating or implementation authority;\n       (B) that will not become operational within the current \n     calendar year; and\n       (C) that will become operational and begin to reduce \n     emissions from the covered source within 5 years after the \n     year in which the credit is used; and\n       (2) will be realized within 5 years after the year in which \n     the credit is used.\n       (c) Carrying Cost.--If a covered entity uses a credit under \n     this section to meet the requirements of this Act for a \n     calendar year (referred to as the use year), the tradeable \n     allowance requirement for the year from which the credit was \n     taken (referred to as the source year) shall be increased by \n     an amount equal to--\n       (1) 10 percent for each credit borrowed from the source \n     year; multiplied by\n       (2) the number of years beginning after the use year and \n     before the source year.\n       (d) Maximum Borrowing Period.--A credit from a year \n     beginning more than 5 years after the current year may not be \n     used to meet the requirements of this Act for the current \n     year.\n       (e) Failure to Achieve Reductions Generating Credit.--If a \n     covered entity that uses a credit under this section fails to \n     achieve the anticipated reduction for which the credit was \n     granted for the year from which the credit was taken, then--\n       (1) the covered entity's requirements under this Act for \n     that year shall be increased by the amount of the credit, \n     plus the amount determined under subsection (c);\n       (2) any tradeable allowances submitted by the covered \n     entity for that year shall be counted first against the \n     increase in those requirements; and\n       (3) the covered entity may not use credits under this \n     section to meet the increased requirements.\n\n     SEC. 315. OTHER USES OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Tradeable allowances may be sold, \n     exchanged, purchased, retired, or used as provided in this \n     section.\n       (b) Intersector Trading.--Covered entities may purchase or \n     otherwise acquire tradeable allowances from other covered \n     sectors to satisfy the requirements of section 311.\n       (c) Climate Change Credit Organization.--The Climate Change \n     Credit Corporation established under section 351 may sell \n     tradeable allowances allocated to it under section 332(a)(2) \n     to any covered entity or to any investor, broker, or dealer \n     in such tradeable allowances. The Climate Change Credit \n     Corporation shall use all proceeds from such sales in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 352.\n       (d) Banking of Tradeable Allowances.--Not withstanding the \n     requirements of section 311, a covered entity that has more \n     than a sufficient amount of tradeable allowances to satisfy \n     the requirements of section 311, may refrain from submitting \n     a tradeable allowance to satisfy the requirements in order to \n     sell, exchange, or use the tradeable allowance in the future.\n\n     SEC. 316. EXEMPTION OF SOURCE CATEGORIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator may grant an exemption \n     from the requirements of this Act to a source category if the \n     Administrator determines, after public notice and comment, \n     that it is not feasible to measure or estimate emissions from \n     that source category.\n       (b) Reduction of Limitations.--If the Administrator exempts \n     a source category under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall also reduce the total tradeable allowances under \n     section 321(a) as follows:\n       (1) 2010 limitation.--For the tradeable allowances under \n     section 311(a)(1), the Administrator shall reduce the total \n     by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that the exempted \n     source category emitted in calendar year 2000, as identified \n     in the 2000 Inventory.\n       (2) 2016 limitation.--For the tradeable allowances under \n     subsection 311(a)(2), the Administrator shall reduce the \n     total by the amount of green-house gas emissions that the \n     exempted source category emitted in calendar year 1990, as \n     identified in the 1990 Inventory.\n       (c) Limitation on Exemption.--The Administrator may not \n     grant an exemption under subsection (a) to carbon dioxide \n     produced from fossil fuel.\n\n    Subtitle B--Establishment and Allocation of Tradeable Allowances\n\n     SEC. 331. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations to establish tradeable allowances, denominated in \n     units of carbon dioxide equivalence--\n       (1) for calendar years beginning after 2009 and before \n     2016, equal to--\n       (A) 5896 million metric tons, measured in units of carbon \n     dioxide equivalence, reduced by\n       (B) the amount of emissions of greenhouse gases in calendar \n     year 2000 from non-covered entities; and\n       (2) for calendar years beginning after 2015, equal to--\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\n       (A) 5123 million metric tons, measured in units of carbon \n     dioxide equivalence, reduced by\n       (B) the amount of emissions of greenhouse gases in calendar \n     year 1990 from non-covered entities.\n       (b) Serial Numbers.--The Administrator shall assign a \n     unique serial number to each tradeable allowance established \n     under subsection (a), and shall take such action as may be \n     necessary to prevent counterfeiting of tradeable allowances.\n       (c) Nature of Tradeable Allowances.--A tradeable allowance \n     is not a property right, and nothing in this title or any \n     other provision of law limits the authority of the United \n     States to terminate or limit a tradeable allowance.\n       (d) Non-covered Entity.--In this section:\n       (1) In general.--The term ``non-covered entity'' means an \n     entity that--\n       (A) owns or controls a source of greenhouse gas emissions \n     in the electric power, industrial, or commercial sectors of \n     the United States economy (as defined in the Inventory), \n     refines or imports petroleum products for use in \n     transportation, or produces or imports hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride; and\n       (B) is not a covered entity, determined by applying the \n     definition in section 3(4) for the year 2000 (for the purpose \n     of subsection (a)(1)(B)) or the year 1990 (for the purpose of \n     subsection (a)(2)(B)).\n       (2) Exception.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an entity \n     that is a covered entity for any calendar year beginning \n     after 2009 shall not be considered to be a non-covered entity \n     for the purpose of either subsection (a)(1)(B) or subsection \n     (a)(2)(B) only because it emitted, or its products would \n     have emitted, 10,000 metric tons or less of greenhouse \n     gas, measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalence, in \n     the year 2000 or 1990, respectively.\n\n     SEC. 332. DETERMINATION OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall determine--\n       (1) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     each covered sector of that sector's Phase I and Phase II \n     allotments; and\n       (2) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     the Climate Change Credit Corporation established under \n     section 351.\n       (b) Allocaiton Factors.--In making the determination \n     required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) the distributive effect of the allocations on household \n     income and net worth of individuals\n       (2) the impact of the allocations on corporate income, \n     taxes, and asset value;\n       (3) the impact of the allocations on income levels of \n     consumers and on their energy consumption;\n       (4) the effects of the allocations in terms of economic \n     efficiency;\n       (5) the ability of covered entities to pass through \n     compliance costs to their customers; and\n       (6) the degree to which the amount of allocations to the \n     covered sectors should decrease over time.\n       (c) Allocation Recommendations and Implementations.--Before \n     allocating or providing tradeable allowances under \n     subsection(a) and within 24 hours after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary shall submit the determinations \n     under subsection (a) to the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, the Senate Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works, the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Science, and the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce. The Secretary's \n     determinations under paragraph (1), including the allocations \n     and provision of tradeable allowances pursuant to that \n     determination, are deemed to be a major rule (as defined in \n     section 804(2) of title 5, United States Code), and subject \n     to the provisions of chapter 8 of that title.\n\n     SEC. 333. ALLOCATION OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning with calendar year 2010 and \n     after taking into account any initial allocations under \n     section 334, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) allocate to each covered sector that sector's Phase I \n     and Phase II allotments determined by the Administrator under \n     section 332 (adjusted for any such initial allocations and \n     the allocation to the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section 351); and\n       (2) allocate to the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section 351 the tradeable allowances \n     allocable to that Corporation.\n       (b) Intrasectorial Allotments.--The Administrator shall, by \n     regulation, establish a process for the allocation of \n     tradeable allowances under this section, without cost to \n     facilities within each sector, that will--\n       (1) encourage investments that increase the efficiency of \n     the processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (2) minimize the costs to the government of allocating the \n     tradeable allowances;\n       (3) not penalize a covered entity for registered emissions \n     reductions made before 2010; and\n       (4) provide sufficient allocation for new entrants into the \n     sector.\n       (c) Point Source Allocation.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the tradeable allowances for the electricity \n     generation, industrial, and commercial sectors to the \n     entities owning or controlling the point sources of \n     greeenhouse gas emissions within that sector.\n       (d) Hydrofluorocarbons, Perfluoro- carbons, and Sulfur \n     Hexafluoride.--The Administrator shall allocate the tradeable \n     allowances for producers or importers of hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride one tradeable \n     allowance for every metric ton of hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride produced or \n     imported, measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalence.\n       (e) Special Rule for Allocation Within the Transportation \n     Sector.--The Administrator shall allocate the tradeable \n     allowances for the transportation sector to petroleum \n     refiners or importers that produce or import petroleum \n     products that will be used as fuel for transportation.\n\n     SEC. 334. INITIAL ALLOCATIONS FOR EARLY PARTICIPATION AND \n                   ACCELERATED PARTICIPATION.\n\n       Before making allocations under section 333, the \n     Administrator shall allocate--\n       (1) to any covered entity an amount of tradeable allowances \n     equivalent to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions \n     reductions registered by that covered entity in the national \n     greenhouse gas database if--\n       (A) the covered entity has requested to use the registered \n     reduction in the year of allocation;\n       (B) the reduction was registered prior to 2010; and\n       (C) the Administrator retires the unique serial number \n     assigned to the reduction under section 201(c)(3); and\n       (2) to any covered entity that has entered into an \n     accelerated participation agreement under section 335, such \n     tradeable allowances as the Administrator has determined to \n     be appropriate under that section.\n\n     SEC. 335. BONUS FOR ACCELERATED PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (A) In General.--If a covered entity executes an agreement \n     with the Administrator under which it agrees to reduce its \n     level of greenhouse gas emissions to a level no greater than \n     the level of its greenhouse gas emissions for calendar year \n     1990 by the year 2010, then, for the 6-year period beginning \n     with calendar year 2010, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) provide additional tradeable allowances to that entity \n     when allocating allowances under section 334 in order to \n     recognize the additional emissions reductions that will be \n     required of the covered entity;\n       (2) allow that entry to satisfy 20 percent of its \n     requirements under section 311 by--\n       (A) submitting tradeable allowances from another nation's \n     market in greenhouse gas emission under the conditions \n     described in section 312(b)(1);\n       (B) submitting a registered net increase in sequestration, \n     as registered in the National Greenhouse Gas Database \n     established under section 201, and as adjusted by the \n     appropriate sequestration discount rate established under \n     section 372; or\n       (C) submitting a greenhouse gas emission reduction (other \n     than a registered net increase in sequestration) that was \n     registered in the National Greenhouse Gas Database by a \n     person that is not a covered entity.\n       (b) Termination.--An entity that executes an agreement \n     described in subsection (a) may terminate the agreement at \n     any time.\n       (c) Failure to Meet Commitment.--If an entity that executes \n     an agreement described in subsection (a) fails to achieve the \n     level of emissions to which it committed by calendar year \n     2010--\n       (1) its requirements under section 311 shall be increased \n     by the amount of any tradeable allowances provided to it \n     under subsection (a)(1); and\n       (2) any tradeable allowances submitted thereafter shall be \n     counted first against the increase in those requirements.\n\n     SEC. 336. ENSURING TARGET ADEQUACY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Commerce for \n     Oceans and Atmosphere shall review the allowances established \n     by subsection (a) no less frequently than biennially--\n       (1) to re-evaluate the levels established by that \n     subsection, after taking into account the best available \n     science and the most currently available data, and\n       (2) to re-evaluate the environmental and public health \n     impacts of specific concentration levels of greenhouse gases,\n\n     to determine whether the allowances established by subsection \n     (a) continue to be consistent with the objective of the \n     United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change of \n     stabilizing levels of greenhouse gas emissions at a level \n     that will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with \n     the climate system.\n       (b) Review of 2010 and 2016 Levels.--The Under Secretary \n     shall specifically review in 2008 the level established under \n     section 311(a)(1) and, in 2012, the level established under \n     section 311(a)(2), and transmit a report on his reviews, \n     together with any recommendations, including legislative \n     recommendations, for modification of the levels, to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n     the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the \n     House of Representatives Committee on Science, and the House \n     of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\n             Subtitle C--Climate Change Credit Corporation\n\n     SEC. 351. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Climate Change Credit Corporation is \n     established as a nonprofit corporation without stock. The \n     Corporation shall not be considered to be an\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\n     agency or establishment of the United States Government.\n       (b) Applicable Laws.--The Corporation shall be subject to \n     the provisions of this title and, to the extent consistent \n     with this title, to the District of Columbia Business \n     Corporation Act.\n       (c) Board of Directors.--The Corporation shall have a board \n     of directors of 5 individuals who are citizens of the United \n     States, of whom 1 shall be elected annually by the board to \n     serve as chairman. No more than 3 members of the board \n     serving at any time may be affiliated with the same \n     political party. The members of the board shall be \n     appointed by the President of the United States, by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate and shall serve \n     for terms of 5 years.\n\n     SEC. 352. PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Trading.--The Corporation--\n       (1) shall receive and manage tradeable allowances allocated \n     to it under section 333(a)(2); and\n       (2) shall buy and sell tradeable allowances, whether \n     allocated to it under that section or obtained by purchase, \n     trade, or donation from other entities; but\n       (3) may not retire tradeable allowances unused.\n       (b) Use of Tradeable Allowances and Proceeds.--\n       (1) In general.--The Corporation shall use the tradeable \n     allowances, and proceeds derived from its trading activities \n     in tradeable allowances, to reduce costs borne by consumers \n     as a result of the greenhouse gas reduction requirements of \n     this Act. The reductions--\n       (A) may be obtained by buy-down, subsidy, negotiation of \n     discounts, consumer rebates, or otherwise;\n       (B) shall be, as nearly as possible, equitably distributed \n     across all regions of the United States; and\n       (C) may include arrangements for preferential treatment to \n     consumers who can least afford any such increased costs.\n       (2) Transition assistance to dislocated workers and \n     communities.--The Corporation shall allocate a percentage of \n     the proceeds derived from its trading activities in tradeable \n     allowances to provide transition assistance to dislocated \n     workers and communities. Transition assistance may take the \n     form of--\n       (A) grants to employers, employer associations, and \n     representatives of employees--\n       (i) to provide training, adjustment assistance, and \n     employment services to dislocated workers; and\n       (ii) to make income-maintenance and needs-related payments \n     to dislocated workers; and\n       (B) grants to State and local governments to assist \n     communities in attracting new employers or providing \n     essential local government services.\n       (3) Phase-out of transition assistance.--The percentage \n     allocated by the Corporation under paragraph (2)--\n       (A) shall be 20 percent for 2010;\n       (B) shall be reduced by 2 percentage points each year \n     thereafter; and\n       (C) may not be reduced below zero.\n       (c) Annual Report.--The Corporation shall issue an annual \n     report setting forth the results of its operations for the \n     year.\n\n            Subtitle D--Sequestration Accounting; Penalties\n\n     SEC. 371. SEQUESTRATION ACCOUNTING.\n\n       (a) Sequestration Accounting.--If a covered entity uses a \n     registered net increase in sequestration to satisfy the \n     requirements of section 311 for any year, that covered entity \n     shall submit information to the Administrator every 5 years \n     thereafter sufficient to allow the Administrator to \n     determine, using the methods and standards created under \n     section 204, whether that net increase in sequestration still \n     exists. Unless the Administrator determines that the net \n     increase in sequestration continues to exist, the covered \n     entity shall offset any loss of sequestration by submitting \n     additional tradeable allowances of equivalent amount in the \n     calendar year following that determination.\n       (b) Regulations Required.--The Secretary, acting through \n     the Under Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, \n     in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, the \n     Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator, shall issue \n     regulations establishing the sequestration accounting rules \n     for all classes of sequestration projects.\n       (c) Criteria for Regulations.--In issuing regulations under \n     this section, the Secretary shall use the following criteria:\n       (1) If the range of possible amounts of net increase in \n     sequestration for a particular class of sequestration project \n     is not more than 10 percent of the median of that range, the \n     amount of sequestration awarded shall be equal to the median \n     value of that range.\n       (2) If the range of possible amounts of net increase in \n     sequestration for a particular class of sequestration project \n     is more than 10 percent of the median of that range, the \n     amount of sequestration awarded shall be equal to the fifth \n     percentile of that range.\n       (3) The regulations shall include procedures for accounting \n     for potential leakage from sequestration projects and for \n     ensuring that any registered increase in sequestration is in \n     addition that which would have occurred if this Act had not \n     been enacted.\n       (d) Updates.--The Secretary shall update the sequestration \n     accounting rules for every class of sequestration project at \n     least once every 5 years.\n\n     SEC. 372. PENALTIES.\n\n       Any covered entity that fails to meet the requirements of \n     section 311 for a year shall be liable for a civil penalty, \n     payable to the Administrator, equal to thrice the market \n     value (determined as of the last day of the year at issue) of \n     the tradeable allowances that would be necessary for that \n     covered entity to meet those requirements on the date of the \n     emission that resulted in the violation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the National Academy of Science has said, \n``Greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere as a \nresult of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and \nsubsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, \nrising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely \nmostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some \nsignificant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural \nvariability.''\n  Over the past five years, the Commerce Committee has held eight \nhearings on climate change. Two the last five years, 1998 and 2002, \nhave been the warmest, in terms of average global temperatures, ever \nrecorded. According to a recent report from the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration NOAA, nine of the warmest years have \noccurred since 1990. As reported in the New York Times on December 31, \n2002, many experts think it is more likely than not 2003 will either \nmatch or exceed the 1998 average temperature record of 58 degrees \nFahrenheit.\n  Researchers at the University of Texas, Wesleyan University, and \nStanford University recently reported in the journal Nature that global \nwarming is forcing species around the world, from California starfish \nto Alpine herbs, to move into new ranges or alter habits that could \ndisrupt ecosystems. The report states there is ``very high \nconfidence,'' defined as having more than 95 percent of observed \nchanges which were principally caused by climate change, that climate \nchange is already affecting living systems. The end result off these \nchanges could be substantial ecological disruption, local losses in \nwildlife, and extinction of certain species.\n  This and many other reports over the years have highlighted time and \nagain the consequences of a warming climate system. We have seen the \ndestruction of over 70 percent of the heat-sensitive corals reefs, the \nmelting of glaciers at unprecedented levels, the increase of wildfires, \nand the spreading of diseases. A large German insurance company has \nestimated that global warming could cost $300 billion annually by 2050 \nin weather damage, pollution, industrial and agricultural losses, and \nother expenses.\n  Our international partners, the States, and private industry are \nreacting to this challenge. For example, California has enacted \nlegislation that will regulate tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. \nThe European Union just recently approved an emissions trading system. \nThe World Bank has estimated that greenhouse gas trading will be a $10 \nbillion market by 2005. Financial ratification of the Kyoto Protocol \nrests with Russia.\n  Industry is also paying attention to what's happening. Laws firms and \ninsurance companies are setting up business units to deal with climate-\nrelated risks.\n  Thus far, however, little has actually been accomplished to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The United States must do something, but it \nmust also do the right thing. Many have focused on what we do not know \nor the uncertainties are climate change. I prefer a more sound and \nscientific approach of starting with what is known or given and then \nproceeding to solve the problem at hand.\n  While we cannot say with 100 percent confidence what will happen in \nthe future, we do know the mission of greenhouse gases is not healthy \nfor the environment. As many of the top scientists through the world \nhave stated, the sooner we start to reduce these emissions, the better \noff we will be in the future.\n  In 2001, Senator Lieberman and I announced our intention to develop \nlegislation to require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases \nemissions and provide for the trading of emission allowances. We have \nbeen working with industry and the environmental community to develop \nlegislation to move the country in the right direction and demonstrate \nleadership on this important issue. It will be the first comprehensive\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\npiece of legislation in this area. Not only will it not place the \nburden on any one sector, it would allow for the partnering across \nsectors through the trading system to most effectively meet the \nrequired reductions.\n  The bill we are introducing will propose a ``cap and trade'' approach \nto reducing greenhouse gases emissions. It would require the \npromulgation of regulations to limit greenhouse gases emissions from \nthe electricity generation, transportation, industrial and commercial \neconomic sectors. The affected sectors request approximately 85 percent \nof the overall U.S. emissions for the year 2000. The bill also would \nprovide for the trading of emissions allowances and reductions through \nthe government provided greenhouse gas database, which would contain an \ninventory of emissions and a registry of reduction.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his commitment and leadership in \nbringing this piece of legislative initiative. We hope that our \ncolleagues in the Senate and the Administration will work with us to \nimprove upon and ultimately adopt this much needed legislation.\n  The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse \ngases emissions. It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to \naddress this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is \nthe form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S174-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S174-S175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 15--COMMENDING DAN L.

Con. Res. 1\n\n       Whereas members of the uniformed services of the United \n     States and civilian employees of the United States make \n     significant contributions to the general welfare of the \n     United States and are on the front lines in the fight against \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas civilian employees of the United States play a \n     crucial role in the fight against terrorism, as exemplified \n     by the civilian employees of the new Department of Homeland \n     Security who are working to ensure the security of the United \n     States, the civilian employees of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation who are \n     investigating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and \n     working to prevent further terrorist attacks, the numerous \n     civilian employees of the Federal Government who participated \n     in disaster response teams after such attacks, and the \n     civilian employees of the Transportation Security Agency who \n     are working to make our skies safer;\n       Whereas civilian employees of the United States will \n     continue to support and defend the United States during this \n     difficult time;\n       Whereas for fiscal year 2003 the Administration granted a \n     4.1 percent pay raise for members of the uniformed services \n     but only a 3.1 percent pay raise for the dedicated civilian \n     employees of the United States, a disparity in adjustments \n     that violates the traditional principle of parity of pay \n     adjustments; and\n       Whereas this disparity in pay adjustments goes against the \n     longstanding policy of parity for all those who have chosen \n     to serve the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that there \n     should continue to be parity between the adjustments in the \n     compensation of members of the uniformed services and the \n     adjustments in the compensation of civilian employees of the \n     United States.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Benjamin, and Warner in introducing a \nresolution that would express the sense of the Congress that parity in \nthe pay increases granted to Federal civilian and military employees \nshould be maintained. A comparison of military and civilian pay \nincreases by the Congressional Research Service finds that in 14 of the \nlast 17 years military and civilian pay increases have been identical. \nDisparate treatment of civilian and military pay goes against the \nlongstanding policy of parity for all those who have chosen to serve \nour Nation, whether that service be in the civilian workforce or in the \narmed services.\n  During this unpredented time in our Nation's history, both members of \nthe armed services and civilian Federal employees are fighting the war \non terrorism and making remarkable contributions to the safety of this \ncountry and our citizens. Both the armed forces and civilian employees \nare on the front lines in the fight against terrorism, and civilian \nemployees are playing a significant role in that fight.\n\n[[Page S175]]\n\n  For example, civilian employees of the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity are working to ensure the safety of our Nation. Air marshals \nand members of the Transportation Security Agency are making America's \nskies safer. Civilian employees of the Central Intelligence Agency and \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the events of \nSeptember 11th and working to prevent further terrorist attacks. And \nFederal employees at the State Department are working with other \ncountries in an international coalition against terrorism.\n  In addition, there are numerous Federal employees who participated in \ndisaster response teams on September 11th and during the anthrax \nattacks. And every day, thousands of civilian Federal employees \ncontinue to go to work and carry out their responsibilities in this \nunpredictable time.\n  This Senate Concurrent Resolution expresses the sense of the Congress \nthat parity between the adjustments in Federal civilian pay and \nmilitary pay should be maintained. For Fiscal Year 2003, President Bush \ngave a 4.1 percent pay raise to members of the armed services, but only \na 3.1 percent pay raise to our dedicated public servants. This \ndiscrepancy violates the traditional principle of pay parity, and does \nnot recognize the crucial work of the civilian Federal workforce. \nFurthermore, this discrepancy ignores the express wish of Congress that \nthe principle of pay parity be followed. Past budget resolutions and \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bills approved by the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives have included language expressing the ``sense \nof Congress that rates of compensation for civilian employees of the \nUnited States should be adjusted at the same time, and in the same \nproportion, as are rates of compensation for member of the uniformed \nservices.''\n  In this difficult time, the dedication and commitment of both the \narmed services and our civilian employees demonstrate the greatness of \nour Nation. The contribution of both should be recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S175-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on commerce, science, and transportation\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Crippen for \n     his service to Congress and the Nation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize the \nexemplary and faithful service that Dan L. Crippen has provided to his \ncountry and to the U.S. Congress. January 3, 2003, was Dr. Crippen's \nlast day as the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  In the four years that he has held that position, he has led CBO with \ndedication and integrity. As a respected and thoughtful steward of the \nagency, he has provided the Members of Congress with impartial analyses \nof a wide array of budgetary and economic issues and thereby provided a \nsound basis for Congressional decisions, and he has aided the American \npublic's understanding of these issues through his clear and forthright \nstatements.\n  Some of his particular accomplishments as Director include fostering \nthe development of long-term modeling and a long-range perspective in \nthe agency's analyses, bolstering research support, building a stronger \nand more diverse workforce, securing access to previously unavailable \ndata, and modernizing many support processes and much of the work \nspace.\n  Dan Crippen received a bachelor of arts degree from South Dakota in \n1974, a master of arts from Ohio State in 1976, and a doctor of \nphilosophy degree in public finance from Ohio State in 1981. He then \nset out on a remarkable career that has included positions of great \nresponsibility in both the public and private sectors. From 1981 to \n1985, he served in the United States Senate as Chief Counsel and \nEconomic Policy Adviser to the Senate majority leader, working on major \ntax and budget bills as well as other legislation. From 1985 to 1987, \nhe was Executive Director of Merrill Lynch International Advisory \nCouncil.\n  He then returned to public service, this time at the White House, as \nDeputy Assistant to the President from 1987 to 1988 and Assistant to \nthe President for Domestic Affairs from 1988 to 1989, in which capacity \nhe served as the President's adviser on domestic policy issues, \nincluding the preparation and presentation of the federal budget.\n  In 1989, he became Senior Vice President of the consulting firm \nDuberstein Group, and in 1996, he became Principal in the consulting \nfirm Washington Counsel.\n  From there, he was tapped again for Congressional service and became \nthe fifth director of the Congressional Budget Office, where he \nadvanced its already strong reputation for objective and insightful \nanalysis. For that reason and many others, he has earned the respect, \nadmiration, and affection of his colleagues at CBO and, once again, the \ngratitude of the U.S. Congress.\n  So on the occasion of Dan Crippen's departure from CBO, I want to \nsalute his accomplishments and contributions thus far in his career and \nto say that I look forward to his continued success as he takes on new \nresponsibilities in the next phase of his career.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related to \nthis matter be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority whip yield the floor?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 15) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 15\n\n       Whereas Dr. Dan L. Crippen has served as the fifth Director \n     of the Congressional Budget Office since February 3, 1999 and \n     now has ended his service on January 3, 2003;\n       Whereas during his tenure as Director, he has continued to \n     encourage the highest standards of analytical excellence \n     within the staff of the Congressional Budget Office while \n     maintaining the independent and nonpartisan character of the \n     organization;\n       Whereas he has provided expert testimony to all committees \n     of the United States Senate;\n       Whereas during his tenure as Director, he has expanded and \n     improved the accessibility of the Congressional Budget \n     Office's work products to the Congress and the public;\n       Whereas he had led the agency's development of an \n     independent long-term economic modeling capability that \n     examines demographic changes and their critical impact on \n     economic and budget estimates;\n       Whereas he has performed his duties as Director at a time \n     of extreme personal loss with courage, dignity, and \n     intelligence; and\n       Whereas he has earned the respect and esteem of the United \n     States Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States commends Dr. \n     Dan L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 16 submitted \nearlier by Senator Bunning and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 16) honoring the Hilltoppers of \n     Western Kentucky University from Bowling Green, Kentucky, for \n     winning the 2002 National Collegiate Athletic Association \n     Division I-AA Football Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate \nthe players and coaches of the Western Kentucky University Hilltopper \nfootball team on winning the 2002 NCAA Division I-AA National \nChampionship.\n  When people take a look back at Western's championship season, they \nwill certainly wonder how in the world a team which lost three of its \nfirst five games wound up winning the national title? The answer lies \nin the hearts and minds of every single member of Western Kentucky's \nteam, from the coaches to freshmen walk-ons. Not only did this team \nrefuse to give up, they made it their mission to work harder on and off \nthe field to achieve their dreams and goals. Head Coach Jack Harbaugh \ndeserves special recognition for his ability to right Western's ship \nbefore it veered too far off course.\n  Having to go on a six game win streak simply to reach the post-\nseason, Western entered the Division I-AA playoffs as a longshot. To \neven reach the championship game, Western had to beat the number two \nand three rated teams in the nation. Once in the title game, Western \nwas simply too strong to be stopped. They beat the number one rated \nMcNeese State Cowboys by a score of 34-14, exacting revenge on the team \nwhich had beat them early in the season. Quarterback Jason Michael \nthrew for a career-high 185 yards and running back Jon Frazier added \n159 yards on the ground in the national title match. This was Western \nKentucky University's first NCAA football championship.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my fellow colleagues join me in \ncongratulating the Hilltopper football players, Head Coach Jack \nHarbaugh, Athletic Director Dr. Wood Selig and Dr. Gary Ransdell on \nwinning the 2002 Division I-AA National Championship. This win reflects \nvery highly on Western Kentucky University and the entire Commonwealth \nof Kentucky. Who said Kentucky wasn't a football State?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. \nBunning, for introducing this resolution congratulating the Western \nKentucky University Hilltoppers on capturing the National Collegiate \nAthletics Association's NCAA Division I-AA championship, and I would \nurge the Senate to adopt it.\n  Mr. President, the story of Western Kentucky University's 2002 \nfootball season is one of perseverance and determination in the face of \nlong odds. After a disappointing start, in which Western Kentucky \ndropped three of its first five games, Coach Jack Harbaugh rallied the \nHilltoppers to victories in their last six regular season games. This \nlate-season charge helped Western Kentucky secure one of the final \nspots in the Division I-AA playoffs. Once in the NCAA tournament, \nWestern was faced with a daunting path to the championship which \nrequired them to defeat each of the top three ranked teams on \nconsecutive weekends. However, Western Kentucky rose to the challenge \nand even exacted a measure of revenge by defeating Western Illinois and \nMcNeese State, two of the teams that had previously defeated the \nHilltoppers during the regular season. With its 34 to 14 victory over \nMcNeese State on December 20, 2002, Western Kentucky University \ncaptured the first NCAA football championship in the program's proud \neighty-nine year history.\n  I want to congratulate the Hilltopper football team, head Coach Jack \nHarbaugh, Athletic Director Dr. Wood Selig, and President Gary Ransdell \non capturing the 2002 Division I-AA national championship and thank \nthem for the outstanding manner in which they represented Western \nKentucky University and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements related thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 16) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 16\n\n       Whereas on December 20, 2002, the Western Kentucky \n     University Hilltoppers from Bowling Green, Kentucky, won the \n     2002 NCAA Division I-AA Collegiate Football Championship;\n       Whereas this championship is Western Kentucky University's \n     first NCAA Football Championship since its football program \n     began in 1913;\n       Whereas the Hilltoppers had an impressive and overall \n     record of 12 wins and 3 losses, including 10 consecutive wins \n     and winning the championship game;\n       Whereas the Hilltoppers showed tremendous dedication to \n     each other, appreciation to their fans, sportsmanship to \n     their opponents, and respect for the game of football \n     throughout their 2002 season;\n       Whereas Western Kentucky University was represented with \n     integrity and principled leadership under the direction of \n     its head coach Jack Harbaugh, athletic director Dr. Wood \n     Selig, and president Dr. Gary A.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto spread on the record the fact that I want to congratulate the \nmajority whip, Senator McConnell, for his elevation to this job. I look \nforward to working with him. We have worked together on a number of \nissues over the years, and I have found him to be a gentleman and a \ngood legislator. There is so much we have to do this year in this \nCongress. A lot that happens will depend on how he and I manage the \nfloor. I am very happy he is going to be spending a lot of time on the \nfloor. I look forward to working with him. With his advocacy and the \nwork that I hope I will be able to do, we should be able to move the \nlegislation along, maybe better than it has in the past. So I look \nforward to working with Senator McConnell. He was in a meeting that I \nattended yesterday with the President, and it was clear that we have so \nmuch to do for the good of the country. I hope we can set aside \npartisan differences most of the time and look forward to accomplishing \nwhat the people in this country--those from Kentucky, Nevada, and \nGeorgia--really need.\n\n  Senator Daschle and I pledge our support to do that and I hope we can \ndo that in the months to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, look forward to working with \nSenator Reid. I have known him for many years and have admired his \ngreat work. I am confident that we will get along well and advance the \nbusiness of the people to the maximum extent possible, and whatever \npartisan differences develop along the way, I know neither of us will \ntake that personally. As we know, the most important vote is always the \nnext one. So I look forward to continuing our good relationship. We \nwill be spending a lot of time together in this Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/09/senate-section/article/S177-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate will be in session tomorrow. \nIt is the leader's hope that we will be able to pass the respective \nparty committee resolutions. As he mentioned previously, it is \nimportant that we get that done so that the committees can begin their \nwork. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible during Friday's session. \nNormally, these routine committee resolutions are agreed to by consent. \nI hope that will be the case in this instance.
