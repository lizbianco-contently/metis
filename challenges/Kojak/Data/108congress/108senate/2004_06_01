Mr. President, the Senate returns to business today \nfollowing the Memorial Day recess. I hope everyone had a safe and \nproductive break.\n  Today, we will be in a period for morning business until 12:30 p.m., \nwith the time equally divided between both sides of the aisle. At \n12:30, we will recess until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly Republican policy \nluncheon. I understand the Democratic policy luncheon will occur \ntomorrow.\n  As a reminder, prior to the Memorial Day break, we tried to reach \nconsent to begin consideration of the class action fairness bill. I \nreiterate that it has always been my hope we could finish the Defense \nauthorization and the class action bill in a reasonable and timely way. \nUnfortunately, after spending a week on the Defense authorization bill \nwe were still unable to reach an agreement for an amendment limitation.\n  In addition, there was an objection to proceeding to the class action \nfairness measure. A cloture vote is currently scheduled for 5:30 p.m. \ntoday on the motion to proceed to the class action bill. I hope it will \nnot be necessary.\n  I will be talking with the Democratic leadership to see if we can \nfind a way to finish the Defense authorization bill and begin the class \naction fairness bill without unnecessary delay.\n  We need to reach an agreement on how and when we will complete this \nimportant Defense authorization bill, and then we will begin the class \naction bill without the need for cloture.\n  I hope to announce shortly that we have reached an agreement for \nvitiating the 5:30 p.m. vote and that we will continue on the Defense \nbill with the expectation that Members will cooperate with the two \nmanagers to allow us to finish this Defense authorization bill.\n  I also should remind my colleagues that we will continue to work on \njudicial nominations as we proceed forward. I will be setting votes on \nthose nominations each day. If we are able to vitiate the cloture vote \ntoday, we will schedule a vote on a judicial nomination today in its \nplace as we will have a vote at 5:30 p.m. today.\n  Again, I will announce the voting schedule shortly.\n  Finally, we have 4 weeks during this legislative period. We have a \nlot to accomplish over that period of time. I hope we can use our time \nefficiently and get our work done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6253-6", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6253-S6254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DRUG DISCOUNT CARDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also very briefly want to comment on the \ndrug discount cards that are being made available and which take effect \nthis month. This is June 1 and they take effect beginning today.\n  The discount cards, as my colleagues know, are a product of \nlegislation signed by the President last December. The reality is that \nwe have seniors today who are literally choosing between paying for \ntheir rent and paying for their food and obtaining prescription drugs.\n  One of the objectives set out in this piece of legislation and set \nout by the President of the United States was that we need to get help \nto those people who need help the most in terms of their prescription \ndrugs. Thus, although this is a more comprehensive approach, affordable \naccess to prescription drugs for seniors does not begin to take place \nfor about a year and a half from now. I am delighted that just several \nmonths after passage of this bill and the signing into law by the \nPresident these prescription drug cards are available. They are \navailable today, and they will have an impact today.\n  There are a couple of quick points that I would like to make: First \nof all, they are available to all Medicare enrollees who lack \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Second, the card itself will give a discount on average of about 17 \npercent. Seniors who do not have access through affordable access to \nprescription drugs can get these cards and on average get a discount of \nabout 17 percent, which is a huge discount that can start literally \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\n  Third, and what I am most excited about, those seniors who really \nneed it the most and who simply can't afford prescription drugs will \nget a value on this card in addition to the 17-percent discount of $600 \nfor the remainder of this year, and another $600 for next year. Thus, \nover the next 18 months they will get $1,200 in value, like a voucher, \nto purchase prescription drugs.\n  Again, that is a huge benefit for the millions of seniors who qualify \nfor this low-income benefit as well. There are about 4 million low-\nincome seniors whose incomes do not exceed the $12,500 level for \nindividuals and about the $16,800 level for couples and who can have \nthis direct and immediate benefit with this card.\n  I am very excited about the fact that these cards are available. They \nare available today. You can call the 800 Medicare number or go on the \nMedicare Web site to get more information.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6254-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my wife and I, during the Memorial Day \nbreak, had a wonderful, patriotic week. It is always good to get back \nto the regular schedule. We started out visiting Fort Carson just south \nof Colorado Springs, CO, and had an opportunity to welcome home the 3rd \nArmored Calvary Regiment of Fort Carson, the Mountain Post.\n  Having done that, we met with a number of constituents after flying \nback to Washington, DC, to meet with hundreds of Coloradans who decided \nto come to Washington, DC, to celebrate the Memorial Day weekend here \nand to celebrate the opening of the World War II Memorial, which was a \nlong time in coming.\n  It was a great time. My wife and I were both caught up in the \nenthusiasm of both generations--the current generation fighting for \nfreedom and security in Iraq, and the past generation, the World War II \ngeneration who fought and literally changed the world because of their \nefforts, dedication, and heroism during World War II. We were caught up \nin the enthusiasm of the World War II generation and found ourselves \ndancing to music of that era, having a wonderful time, meeting many \nwonderful Coloradans who were obviously excited about the fact they \ncould come to Washington, DC, and celebrate the opening of the World \nWar II Memorial.\n\n\n                    The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment\n\n  I rise today to commend the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment for its long \nhistory of service to our Nation and for its more recent heroic \naccomplishments in Iraq.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to attend a welcome home ceremony \nfor the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Carson, CO. Unlike most \nwelcome home ceremonies, this one was steeped in tradition.\n  Few units in the U.S. Army can claim as distinguished history as the \n3rd Armored Cavalry. And, even fewer have had so many of its soldiers \nawarded medals for valor on the battlefield.\n  The 3rd Armored Cavalry's service to our country did not begin in \nIraq, or during World II. Indeed, not even in the past century. Rather, \nit began on May 19, 1846, by an Act of the 29th Congress of the United \nStates. On that date, Congress authorized the creation of a regiment of \nmounted riflemen for the purpose of establishing military stations on \nthe route to Oregon. Unbeknownst to Congress, this regiment would go \nfar beyond this limited mission in its service to our country.\n  A year after its creation, in 1847, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, \nthen called the Mounted Riflemen, was sent into battle in the Mexican-\nAmerican War. Leading the assault on the fortress of Chapultepec, a key \ncitadel outside Mexico City, Mounted Riflemen charged through heavy \ncannon fire to seize the castle and capture an enemy artillery battery.\n  Later in the war, the Mounted Riflemen were sent to capture another \nenemy artillery battery halfway to the Belen Gate outside Mexico City, \nand then on to capture a third battery in the assault on the gate \nitself. It was extraordinarily successful in all three assaults.\n  General Winfield Scott, the Commander of U.S. forces during the \nMexican War, was so impressed with the bravery and toughness of the \nMounted Riflemen that he gave this commendation:\n\n       Brave Rifles, veterans--you have been baptized in fire and \n     blood and come out with steel. Where bloody work was to be \n     done, ``the Rifles'' was the cry, and there they were. All \n     speak of them in terms of praise and admiration. What can I \n     say? What shall I say? Language cannot express my feelings of \n     gratitude for your gallant conduct in this terrible conflict \n     . . .\n\n  Due to the bravery of their service, 11 troopers were commissioned \nfrom the enlisted ranks and 19 officers received brevet promotions for \ngallantry in action.\n  At the time of the start of the Civil War, the First Regiment of \nMounted Riflemen was redesignated as the 3rd U.S. Cavalry Regiment. \nDuring the war, the 3rd Cavalry Regiment fought at the battle of \nChattanooga, and in minor battles in New Mexico, Alabama, Tennessee, \nand Arkansas. During the campaign in New Mexico, the 3rd Cavalry \nRegiment fought alongside the 1st Colorado Infantry Regiment, and \nColonel ``Kit'' Carson, who commanded the 1st New Mexico Infantry \nRegiment.\n  Following the Civil War, the 3rd Cavalry Regiment was sent to the \nAmerican West to the fight in the Indian Wars. The experiences of the \nIndian Wars were traumatic and brutal for the troopers of the 3rd \nCavalry Regiment, but they continued on. During the largest battle of \nthe Indian Wars, the Regiment again distinguished itself. Four 3rd \nCavalry troopers received the Medal of Honor for their heroism during \nthe battle.\n  In 1898, the regiment's mettle was again tested in the Spanish-\nAmerican War. The 3rd Cavalry regiment, along with five other regular \nU.S. Cavalry regiments, was given the nearly impossible mission of \nassaulting the hills surrounding San Juan in Cuba. In the dismounted \nattack, the 3rd Cavalry Regiment's U.S. Flag was the first to be raised \non the point of victory.\n  With the turn of the century, armies began to turn to mechanized \nwarfare. It was not until World War II, however, that the 3rd Cavalry \nRegiment was reorganized and redesignated as the 3rd Armored Group and \nsent to the European theater.\n  The troopers of the 3rd Cavalry group became the spearhead of General \nPatton's drive across German-held France. In fact, because this unit \nwas everywhere and nowhere at the same time, it was nicknamed the \n``Ghosts'' by the Germans. And, on November 17, 1944, the 3rd Cavalry \nGroup became the first element of Patton's army to enter Germany.\n  At the war's end, the unit received high praise from its commanding \ngeneral. General Patton commented with these words:\n\n       The 3rd Cavalry has lived up to the accolade bestowed upon \n     it at Chapultepec by General Scott. As horse cavalry you were \n     outstanding; I have never seen a better regiment. To your \n     performance as mechanized cavalry, the same applies. It is a \n     distinct honor to have commanded an army in which the 3rd \n     Cavalry served.\n\n  During the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment \nagain distinguished itself on the field of battle. On February 22, \n1991, the Regiment led the U.S. forces across the Iraqi border. One \nhundred hours later, the regiment had moved over 300 kilometers north \nand left the remnants of three Iraqi Republican Guard divisions in its \nwake.\n  The purpose of reviewing the storied past of one of Army's most famed \nunits is for each of us to understand just how important it was to \nthese troopers that they live up to the unit's reputation in battle \nduring Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n  Unlike past conflicts, Operation Iraqi Freedom was, for the 3rd \nArmored Cavalry, a battle of a different kind. It was for the hearts \nand minds of the Iraqi people. It was securing the peace and preventing \nterrorist attacks. It was for rebuilding a nation devastated by war, \nbrutality, and corruption.\n  The regiment was responsible for controlling about a third of Iraq, \nincluding the hostile cities of Ramadi and Fallujah and Iraq's western \nborders with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria. Yet, the troopers \nperformed their mission with excellence. They were determined in the \nface of opposition. They overcame unforeseen challenges. They worked as \nnever before.\n  They also cared deeply about the Iraqi people. In one case, the \nregiment helped three rural villages in rebuilding their decimated \ncommunities. The troopers worked alongside families repaired and \nreconstructed facilities damaged and neglected for 30 years under the \nformer regime. Schools, medical clinics and houses were rebuilt so that \nchildren could return to school and health care could be provided to \nall.\n  In other cities, troopers from the regiment helped build sewer and \nwater projects, rebuild schools, and provide clothes, blankets, and \nfood to needy adults and children.\n  These are only a few examples of the outstanding work these troopers \ndid in Iraq. And, now, as these troopers reflect upon their service, \nthey can say with pride that they accomplished their mission and made a \ndifference in the lives of the Iraqi people.\n  However, their service did not come without a high cost.\n  PFC Armando Soriano joined the Army so that he could help his \nparents, who had immigrated to the United States in the 1980s. His goal \nwas to save enough money to buy his parents and his four siblings a \nhouse.\n  Yet, it was his love for his comrades that made him stand out, and as \na result, he became one of the best young soldiers in the 3rd Armored \nCavalry. At 5 feet 6 inches, PFC Soriano weighed barely more than the \n100-pound artillery shells he hefted as part of his job driving a 155 \nmm cannon through Iraq.\n  But that didn't stop him. He was faster than any of his comrades in \nlifting these huge shells.\n  He was known in the unit as a soldier who would do anything for his \nfellow troopers. He was always positive and kept everyone going despite \nthe tough conditions. His fellow soldiers described him as ``simply the \nbest.''\n  Sadly, PFC Armando Soriano died on February 2, 2004, in a truck \naccident in Iraq.\n  SP Brian Penisten, one of the unit's best mechanics, loved fishing, \nfixing cars and woodworking. He was a devoted family man with a 4-year \nold son. And, he was proud that he got to wear the uniform of the \nUnited States Army.\n  ``He could make us look forward to doing our jobs every day,'' \naccording to one of his fellow soldiers. ``He would be the one to make \nus shine and laugh and cry and everything else.''\n  ``He was always doing something to make things better,'' said \nanother.\n  SP Brian Penisten was headed home for his wedding to his longtime \ngirlfriend when his transport helicopter was shot down on November 2 by \na guerrilla missile near the city of Fallujah.\n  He was buried on the day he was supposed to be married.\n  These are only two stories of the 49 soldiers from Colorado who have \ndied while serving our Nation in Iraq. And, another 233 were wounded.\n  Despite the high cost, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment embraced \ntheir mission and worked each and every day to better the lives of the \nIraqi people.\n  Troopers like SFC Dean Lockhart have continued to demonstrate a \ndevotion to the Army and our country despite the high price he has had \nto pay.\n  On July 23, Sergeant Lockhart was manning his Humvee machine gun when \na roadside bomb demolished his Humvee. Shrapnel from the bomb pierced \nhis back, shattering his pelvis and leg. After numerous surgeries and \nendless days of pain, Sergeant Lockhart is back in Colorado recovering \nfrom his injuries.\n  Despite the physical and psychological toll, Sergeant Lockhart has \nnot given up. He still wants to spend 7 more years in the Army and he \nstill believes in the U.S. mission in Iraq. He doesn't blame anyone for \nhis injuries and has no regrets. If his unit was back in Iraq, he would \nreturn in a moment's notice.\n  Mr. President, I cannot begin to express to you and to the rest of my \ncolleagues how thankful I am for the service these brave men and women \nfrom the 3rd Armored Cavalry have given to our country. Over 400 of \nthese troopers earned medals of valor, including 200 Purple Hearts. \nThey sacrificed much, but they never gave up. They accomplished their \nmission, fought with dignity and honor, and continued the heroic legacy \nof the 3rd Armored Cavalry.\n  Last week, I watched in amazement as the troopers of the 3rd Armored \nCavalry Regiment were told that they had both literally and \nfiguratively earned their spurs. Each of them are now allowed to wear \nthose spurs in public in recognition of the unit's historic past and \nmore, importantly, in appreciation for the unit's heroic service to our \ncountry in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, these are fine troopers who deserve our honor, our \npraise, and our admiration. I commend the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment \nfor its service to our Nation, and I and the rest of the State of \nColorado welcome them home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ENZI). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nconsumed during the previous quorum call be divided between the two \nsides; provided further that the time spent in additional quorum calls \nduring this period of morning business be equally divided, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6255-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6255-S6257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express a deep sense of gratitude to all \nthose involved in this magnificent recognition of those who served in \nWorld War II, not only the 16 million men and women in uniform, but the \nhomefront by ten times that number. Every American was involved.\n  This weekend was magnificent. I was privileged to have a very modest \nrole in this event with Senator Dole and many others, joining in the \nfeature of the weekend, the afternoon, 2 to approximately 3:30, when on \nThe Mall over 150,000 individuals gathered to pay their respects to \nwhat is referred to as ``the greatest generation'' and hear from those \nwho had taken a leading role, including Senator Dole, the American \nBattle Monuments Commission under the former commandant of the Marine \nCorps, Fred Smith, who was a key part of the team that raised the \nmoney, and, of course, we were fortunate the President of the United \nStates came and addressed not only the crowd, not only our Nation, but \naddressed the world as a reminder of the human sacrifice all over the \nglobe as a consequence of that struggle for the preservation of \nfreedom.\n  Of course, we all remember the United States involvement started on \nDecember 7, 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Prior thereto, the \nNazi armies had marched into Poland in late 1939, and the war in Europe \nwas well underway. Then on September 2, 1945, the Japanese signed the \nofficial surrender aboard the Missouri in Tokyo Bay, and prior thereto, \nMay 8 or 9, or a little later, the formal recognition of the surrender \nof the German forces.\n  So the great war to end all wars, as it was referred--as was also \nreferred in World War I--had come to an end, with 16 million uniformed, \nover 400,000 of whom died, and triple that number bearing the wounds of \nthat war.\n  It is interesting how this all started. On May 25, 1993, nearly 48 \nyears after the end of the war, Public Law 103-32 was signed, \nauthorizing the American Battle Monuments Commission to establish a \nWorld War II memorial in Washington, DC, or its environs to honor the \nspirit, sacrifice, and commitment of those people. And 11 years have \nfollowed after that fundraising, design, selection, and debate.\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\n  It is legitimate and important that we have voices on both sides \nexpress their views with regard to the utilization of the precious few \nacres between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial and, \nindeed, the Capitol on the other end.\n  Primarily under the leadership of Bob Dole and Fred Smith--Bob Dole, \nhaving been an extraordinary hero in the closing days of World War II, \nhaving suffered wounds in Italy in September of 1945 that required him \nto undergo many years of medical treatment and sheer mental \ndetermination to survive and to go on and provide America with his very \ndistinguished career, including a seat he occupied as majority leader \nonce in the Senate. The design by Friedrich St. Florian, Rhode Island \narchitect, was chosen after reviewing approximately 400 design \nsubmissions, and Leo A. Daley, an internationally known architect who \nresides in Washington, DC, a very distinguished American, was selected \nto give overall management to the project.\n  I also acknowledge the name Carter Brown. He was at that time the \nforemost figure at the National Gallery of Art for many years as its \ndirector. He had a keen sense with regard to artistic matters. I \nremember calling him--I think others did, too--but prevailing him to \nenter the debate about the design of this memorial.\n  Some years before, I had again been a participant in the construction \nof the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and it was a very strong and, at \ntimes, ferocious debate. In my office, as a U.S. Senator, right here in \nthe Capitol, one time it erupted almost into fisticuffs over the design \nof the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The debate on this memorial was \nequally serious, equally thoughtful on both sides, but, nevertheless, I \nhave always believed that Carter Brown, through his strong hand and \nenormous respect, entered the fray and quelled the waters such that a \ndesign finally emerged. So we owe a debt of gratitude to so many.\n  Bob Dole and Fred Smith and others had raised more than $195 million \nfrom the private sector, incidentally from more than 600,000 separate \ncontributions; that is, from individuals, some of them for a dollar, \nsome for many dollars, but that is an extraordinary number of \nindividuals. I also recognize that every State in the Union, all 50 \nStates and Puerto Rico, contributed $1 for every citizen of that State \nwho wore the uniform, male and female, in World War II. What a \nremarkable record of the breadth of participation across the land.\n  Some $16 million was provided by the Federal Government, again not \nnecessarily for the construction and design of the memorial, but really \nfor a lot of the infrastructure that had to be put in place. I refer to \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. On October \n30, 2000, we were able to find within the Armed Services authorization \nbill some $6 million to be transferred to the American Battle Monuments \nCommission. I will put into the Record the technical details of how we \ndid that and the purpose for the funds, but basically it was for \ninfrastructure. Congress had a modest hand, but I believe the important \nemphasis should be put on how the private sector came forward to make \npossible the construction.\n  As I reflect on this weekend and my opportunity to observe and walk \namong the many veterans who were gathered there on Saturday afternoon, \non a fairly warm and intense day, and the joy in their hearts--and of \nthe 16 million, I think, somewhere between 6 or 7 million, perhaps, are \nstill on planet Earth. So many of their colleagues, therefore, who had \npassed on in that period of time and since that period of time were on \ntheir minds. But there was joy in everyone's heart. It was a coming \ntogether, to use the words of Bob Dole, paralleled, really, only by the \nWorld War II period when all of America was so united strongly behind \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces. It was a magnificent \nreenactment, so to speak, of that cohesion that prevailed throughout \nAmerica in that critical period from 1941 to late 1945.\n  Those of us who were privileged to be part of it--and I was just a \nyoung sailor at the tail end of the war in training command, but, \nnevertheless, I remember so well how America opened its arms to the \nveterans of that period and how this country perhaps made its best \ninvestment, for educational purposes, the best investment in the \nhistory of the Federal Government's participation in education, which \nwas the GI bill, from which I benefited and many others.\n  I have often said, standing at this very spot on the Senate floor, \nthat I would not have been privileged to serve in the Senate had it not \nbeen for the GI bill I received for modest service in World War II and \nthen modest service again in the second period during the Korean \nconflict, with service in the Marines. I mention that only in the \ncontext of the value of the GI bill to those of us who received that \ngift of the American people. That is why I try to work hard today with \nmany others, particularly those on the Armed Services Committee, to do \nwhat we can for this generation of young men and women who are in the \nArmed Forces and their families as a means of payback for what was done \nfor previous generations. I am proud of the record of the Armed \nServices Committee over the many years I have been able to participate \nand serve on that committee.\n\n  I will come to the phrase momentarily. Bob Dole said it I think best \nof all when we chatted together quietly, and I think he also said it \npublicly in a number of interviews he found the time to give; and that \nis, perhaps it is time to pass on the baton of the ``greatest \ngeneration'' to this generation of young men and women who are now \nserving in the Armed Forces of the United States because the Nation, I \nbelieve, is behind them. It is strongly behind them. There may be \ndifferences of view, honest differences of viewpoints about the war--\nshould we have done it, should we not have done it--but we will save \nthat debate for a later date and just look forward.\n  It was remarkable when we arose this morning, after a weekend of \ndeliberations by many people in Iraq, the United Nations, Ambassador \nBremer, and others, that we suddenly realize that the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil, which I think has done some very credible work in its short \nlifetime, has suddenly decided to dissolve, pick a President, a Prime \nMinister, some 20-odd ministers, and begin to lay the foundation for \nIraq to govern itself. I personally am very heartened by these moves, \nwidely reported in today's press.\n  But also in today's press again is the expression of many--I am not \nsuggesting it is thoughtless, but, nevertheless, it is strongly in \nconflict with my own views--that we ought to establish a pullout date. \nOur President has steadfastly said we are going to remain until such \ntime as the Iraqi people have enabled themselves to establish their \ngovernment, hopefully to hold an election, before any dramatic \nwithdrawal of the coalition forces in large numbers because that \nsecurity system must be in place.\n  These are going to be critical, stressful, and difficult times after \nthe transition on July 1. But we have to all remain steadfast in our \nconviction that we have to give this fledgling new Iraqi government a \nchance to put its roots into the ground and grow and gain strength and \ntrain their own force structure for the purposes of security.\n  But, nevertheless, as widely reported, a number of groups say, let's \nestablish an arbitrary date--well, maybe not arbitrary but establish a \ndate for pullout. To me, that would be a grave mistake. It would set a \ntarget, and targets are not a wise step in these types of situations, \nnot at all. It is better that we go day by day, week by week, month by \nmonth, and gradually see how quickly the Iraqi government can \nconstitute itself, establish its training programs, and eventually \nestablish its own security forces. In the meantime, citizens of this \ncountry and other coalition nations have provided the funds for the \nrefurbishment and, indeed, the modernization of their economic \ninfrastructure.\n  So this must go forward, recognizing, again, that it is going to be a \nstressful and dangerous period because there are, regrettably, many \nengaged in open warfare to stop the evolution of a new and free Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I close with those remarks, saying only that I believe \nit was an opportune time for this memorial to be dedicated this \nweekend, to bring America together, to instill in\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\nAmerica a consciousness of the sacrifice that has preceded in our own \nNation. Hopefully that measure of sacrifice can be extrapolated into \nthe challenges that face America today and the sacrifice now of over \n800 young men and women who have died in the conflicts in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, primarily Iraq, and the many more thousands who have been \nwounded. Yes, that does not compare, certainly by way of numbers, with \nthe over 400,000 in World War II, but in my heart it compares. Every \nsoldier counts. Every sailor, every airman, every marine counts.\n  It is not just the total number. To the family who bereaves the loss \nof their loved one, it is painful, irrespective of the total. It is a \nbig total in my judgment, a significant total, a serious total and a \nserious loss to the country. Each us in this Chamber deeply grieves \nthose losses.\n  Coming together this weekend, focusing on the sacrifices, on where \nour Nation is today as the leader of the free world, I hope will better \nenable Americans to understand the sacrifice of these young men and \nwomen, be they killed or wounded, and the hardships to the family. It \nis worth it because it is all part of a long, step-by-step trek toward \nnot only achieving freedom for other nations but maintaining our \nfreedom here at home, freedom against terrorism and other threats \nthroughout the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a minute this morning to \ntalk about an issue that has been of some concern for us in Wyoming, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, for some time; yet we have not been able \nto move forward on it. It has to do with work permits that allow people \nto come and work for a seasonal time, for a relatively short time, in \nour case, generally, for the tourism around Yellowstone Park.\n  In that business, they have offered these jobs to anyone, of course, \nover the years, but they have been filled largely by people coming from \nother countries--mostly Mexico--for a fairly short period of time on \nwhat is called an H-2B visa. This is a category of visa that allows for \nseasonal and temporary nonagricultural workers to come. These workers \nare employed in all kinds of industries that include fisheries, timber, \nhotels, restaurants, and others. Even ice skating shows have been \ntalked about recently.\n  Businesses must file a petition with the State department of labor to \ncertify that no local workers are available. They have always done \nthat, of course. Workers are certified for a specific period of time. \nWhen that time has expired, they must return to their home country. I \nthink this program has been in place for a good long time. I think it \nis one of the unique ones where there has been a record of returning.\n  One of the problems is--and this has come up as a problem, of course, \nin the last several months or a year--there has been a lot of \nconversation about illegal immigrants in this country, and properly so. \nThere has been a great deal of conversation about outsourcing and \npaying less because you can get people to come from other places. Those \nthings are true, but they are not applicable in this particular \ninstance because, No. 1, these people are certified to be here. They go \nback when the time is over.\n\n  In the past, they have been able to come back on the same permit over \na period of time. It has kind of worked that way. The wages have been \nreasonable wages paid in these particular areas. It is a fact and it is \ntrue that the jobs are not always the kind of jobs that a lot of young \npeople want in our country. They are working in hotels and motels; \nnevertheless, they are jobs that are available and reasonably paid.\n  I think, though, because of the situation we have had and other kinds \nof problems with immigrants and illegals, this has become a more \nrealistic issue than it would have been otherwise. This year, the \nnumber of H-2Bs was capped, and the number happened to be 66,000 per \nyear. The fact is, this is really the first time that cap has been \nenforced. It is the first time people have ever thought in terms of a \ncap. Much of it had to do with the timing. People were talking, as our \nfolks do in Jackson, about the summer season. They had not worried too \nmuch about doing this until the spring when they have traditionally \ndone it; and it turns out that because of the cap, those numbers had \nbeen reached in other places. Therefore, it excluded the involvement of \nany more H-2Bs.\n  This is not an issue that is unique particularly to Wyoming. Other \nStates, such as New Hampshire, Maine, Alaska, Virginia, Ohio, and North \nCarolina, have specifically spoken out as we have about the problem \nthat exists in Wyoming.\n  Last year, they had petitions roughly for 1,800 workers in Wyoming. \nAbout 1,600 went, as I mentioned, to Jackson Hole. So we tried to find \na solution to this situation because it seemed, more than anything, to \nbe a question of timing. If we are going to have a limit, that is fine, \nbut the limit ought to be known so that people, if they are going to \nneed workers in the summer, can make application at an appropriate time \nearlier in the year so that the timing is not an issue. That is the way \nit has been this year.\n  So for the last number of months, since we all heard about this--the \nfirst was in March before we even knew about the limit--the Senators \nand staff have been working to address this issue in a fair and \nconsistent manner, to make good immigration policy. None of us are \nlooking for illegal immigrants who are trying to extend illegal \nopportunities. This is a program that has been in place, has been \nuseful, and has been legal. These are legal people who come and then \nthey return, so the question of illegal immigration doesn't really fit \nin here.\n  So I need to make the point that this is something that we could \nproceed with. As a matter of fact, there have been opportunities in the \nSenate to move forward, and many suggestions that have been made are \nreasonable. I am trying to emphasize the fact that we need to move to \ndo this and not simply write off the 2004 season. I will have to admit \nit is now very late and people are looking for other ways to fill these \nspots, and some of them can be, and that is fine.\n  I was in Wyoming this weekend at a place where they have similar \nseasons. They had set up a parking lot beside this motel where people \ncould bring their trailers and their travel vehicles and stay there \nduring the summer. These were older folks, pretty much retired, who \nwanted to work part time in the summer, and they would bring their \ntrailer and stay. Some of the jobs can be filled that way, and they \nare. The fact is, businesses are going to be hurt if we don't do \nsomething. Certainly, we need to do that. There are some propositions \nthat have been put forward on the Senate floor. We have had a couple \nfolks objecting to them, so nothing has been done.\n\n  I think it is time. If people want to change the proposition, they \ncan do that if they are comfortable with it. But we ought to move \nforward with the problem, which we can fix or require to be fixed or \nask to be fixed, so that there is a reasonable opportunity for people \nto continue in the business of doing the same thing they have been \ndoing, where now they are prohibited because of the timing proposition.\n  So I am hopeful we can continue to take a look at it. If it is too \nlate for this year, I am sorry, but we ought to fix it now. But if we \nare not able to fix it this year, we will know what we are faced with \nfor the next year. I understand the system in the Senate, but it is too \nbad when we have something that affects most people, and it can be held \nup and not allowed to even be discussed and moved forward. I think this \nis under the leadership of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to share some thoughts on that issue instead \nof waiting and letting this continue to be\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\na problem in another season. Perhaps there is still time in some cases \nto be of assistance in this season. It is a plan and a program that has \nbeen in place and has worked over the years. We need to continue to \nallow people to participate in that plan.\n  I urge us to move forward and address the problem and make some kind \nof solution and not let it just die out and impact visitors, as well as \nemployees and employers, in places such as Jackson, WY, and other \nplaces where people come for the summer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to report to you and our \ncolleagues on the latest Board of Visitors meeting for the U.S. Air \nForce Academy.\n  Ordinarily, I don't do this, but in light of what has been happening \nfor the last year and several months as far as the Air Force Academy, I \nfeel compelled to give a report to the Senate to keep it updated on how \nmatters are progressing at the Air Force Academy.\n  The Board of Visitors primary responsibility is advisory at the \nAcademy. But in the process of monitoring the administration of the \nAcademy and to be a voice for the students at the Academy, the Board of \nVisitors meets in mid-May at the Academy to review the activities of \nthe Academy, assess current programs, discuss current disciplinary \nissues, and address proposed congressional legislation impacting the \nAcademy and the Board of Visitors.\n  First, let me say I was pleased by the attendance and contribution of \nthe board members and welcomed involvement of the board's newest \nmembers, including Senator Mark Pryor. It is clearly apparent that the \nboard is united in its purpose and serious about its responsibilities.\n  The meeting we had here was probably the best board meeting we have \nhad since I have had the honor to serve on the Board of Visitors at the \nAir Force Academy.\n  Let me also say that Governor Gilmore continues to provide \nexceptional leadership and has done an excellent job of keeping the \nboard on track and focused.\n  During the meeting, Air Force and Academy leaders briefed the board \non several important issues. First, the board discussed the retention \nrates of the Academy graduates. Based on the statistics provided by the \nAir Force, it appears the Academy graduates have high retention rates, \nincluding in some professions rates of nearly 50 percent. Retention \nrates for Academy graduates continue to be higher than ROTC and OTS \ngraduates.\n  Next, we discussed recent climate surveys. The Academy is wisely \nsurveying faculty, civilian staff, and administrative staff, as well as \nthe cadets. The Department of Inspector General also surveyed the cadet \nbody in April. The result of the surveys is expected in July.\n  The Academy did share some preliminary results which include \nimprovements regarding respect for women, the use of alcohol, and \nimproved response to sexual assaults.\n  The new officer development program currently being implemented \nappears to be making a difference. Under this new system, cadets are \ntaught leadership skills each year instead of just in their first \nyears. This new system is consistent with that being used at the West \nPoint and the Naval Academy.\n  Lastly, the board discussed three legislative proposals. I plan to \nwork with the leadership on these proposals, perhaps as amendments, \nsometime during the deliberations on this bill. The first proposal \nwould require the dean of the faculty for the Air Force to have some \nprior military service. The second proposal would repeal the \nrequirement that the Academy superintendent retire after serving the \nAcademy. The Board of Visitors indicated its support for these two \nproposals.\n  The third proposal would have structured the Board of Visitors. At \nthis time, this proposal requires additional work. I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Warner on refining that particular proposal.\n  I take a moment to compliment the superintendent of the Air Force \nAcademy, Superintendent Rosa, and also his commandant, General Weida, \nwho stepped in at a very difficult time at the Air Force Academy. They \nhave shown exemplary leadership in working with the student body and \ncharting out a new course for the Air Force Academy. It is a course \nthat will allow oversight bodies, including members of the Armed \nServices Committee in both the House and the Senate, the Secretary of \nthe Air Force, the President, and the members of the Board of Visitors, \nto review what is happening at the Academy. In other words, they have \nput a system in place that is much more accountable, which will make it \neasier for those who have the responsibility of oversight at the Air \nForce Academy to follow what is actually happening.\n  I thank the Congress for its concern about the welfare of the \nstudents at the Academy and for the opportunity to discuss the latest \nBoard of Visitors meeting.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6258-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6258-S6260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, last week, my wife and I had the \nopportunity to spend 3 days in the troubled country of Haiti. I want to \ntake a couple of minutes to report to my colleagues about the situation \nin Haiti. I believe it is particularly of importance because the United \nStates still has troops in Haiti, and we had the opportunity to visit \nwith a number of these wonderful young men and women.\n  Our trip coincided with the horrible flooding that occurred last week \nin Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In fact, I had the chance to fly \nout with our troops to a village in Haiti, Fonds Verettes, about 35 \nmiles east of Port-au-Prince. I saw our troops doing a tremendous job \nto take food and water and shelter to the Haitians who had been \ndevastated by this flooding.\n  Our trip was also timely because it is during this period of time \nthat our troops are beginning to leave Haiti, or were scheduled to \nbegin to leave Haiti,\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nand the U.N. troops are scheduled to start to come in. The country in \nthis endeavor will be Brazil.\n  Let me make a few observations first, starting with the flooding. As \nI said, I went out to this village, Fonds Verettes. What I saw when I \ngot there was just an absolutely unbelievable sight. I saw a village \nthat was in ruins. I had the opportunity to talk to several of the \nvictims. I talked to a man who told me he had lost four of his \nchildren. Absolutely unbelievable. He lost four of his children, and he \nwas still in a state of shock and could barely talk above a whisper. It \nis hard to believe that someone could lose four kids. We talked also to \na woman by the name of Luciani Joseph. She was just sitting on a box \nwhen we saw her. It was the only possession I think she had left in the \nworld. We walked up to her and talked to her. She had lost her 6-year-\nold son. I know in that village there were dozens and dozens of other \nstories. Well over 100 people had lost their lives, and hundreds and \nhundreds of people lost every possession they had.\n  The only good news, I guess, is that U.S. troops were in the country. \nThe only way you could reach this village was because U.S. troops were \nthere. We had helicopters, and that is how they were able to reach the \nvillage because nobody could have reached the village any other way. I \nbelieve it is important that our troops stay in Haiti until enough food \nand goods and relief is delivered to these small villages that have \nbeen impacted by this flood. There is no other country that has the \nresources down there. Nobody has the airlift capabilities besides the \nUnited States.\n  Again, what an inspiration it was to talk to our young men and women \nwho were assisting in this flood. The seriousness of the flood that hit \nHaiti is indicative to us and the international community as to the \nproblems Haiti faces. We have all read, I believe, that Haiti is a \ncountry that is 97 to 98 percent deforested. This didn't come up \novernight; it is something that has happened over the years. This \ndeforestation has exacerbated the seriousness of the flooding.\n  I had the opportunity to talk to the village leader of this community \nI visited, Father Pierre Etienne Belneau. I said: Father, what \nhappened? Have you had floods before? He said: Yes, but never as \nserious as this. Each time a flood comes, each time the water comes, it \nis more serious. He said: There is the reason. He pointed up to the \nhills, the mountains. He said: They keep cutting down the trees. As \nrecently as just after President Aristide left, people--sometimes not \neven from our area--came up and went into the national forest and cut \ndown more trees.\n  When the water comes, he says, it just goes right down the mountain; \nthere is nothing to stop it. It washes everything down into their \nvillage. This priest in this rural village understood what has happened \nto Haiti--that Haiti is an ecological disaster.\n  So as we and the international community look to help the new \nGovernment of Haiti, if we are serious about long-term help for Haiti \nand the people of Haiti, reforestation of this country has to be part \nof that help. A sustainable agriculture is essential to the assistance \nof Haiti.\n  One of the great problems we find in Haiti is malnourishment. My wife \nFran and I held children in our arms in Haiti on this past trip and \nprevious trips, some of whom could be saved and some of whom, \ntragically, were not going to live. They were simply not getting \nnutritious food. They were not getting protein.\n  There are children all over Haiti who are not well fed, who are not \ngetting enough to eat, who are not getting enough nutritious food. This \nis due to the fact that this country, which at one time was the crown \njewel of the French empire as far as food production, today cannot \nproduce a fraction of the food for its own people.\n  If we are talking about long-term assistance, what the United States \nand other countries have to do is help them develop a sustainable \nagriculture. It is one thing to give them food--and we should do that--\nbut in the long run, what we really need to do is help them help \nthemselves through better agricultural practices.\n  Now I will turn to another issue that we talked about when we were in \nHaiti. I had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Latortue. We \nhad a very good conversation. The day I arrived the United States had \njust announced an additional $100 million in assistance for the new \nGovernment of Haiti. This money will assist this Government to survive.\n  I think it is so very important for the new Government to show \nresults to the people. The people are looking for results. In the short \nterm, they are looking to have the lights on. They only have the lights \non in Port-au-Prince 2 hours a day. They need the lights on and the \ngarbage picked up. The Government needs to show that people who commit \nserious crimes will be arrested, they will be held accountable, and \nthey will be brought to justice.\n  In the long run, Haiti must have good judicial reform. The police \nmust be trained. A new police force must be stood up. They must develop \ngood land titling so that people will know the land they own is truly \ntheirs. They will not have good international investment until people \nknow that if they invest in property, invest in land, they will be able \nto sustain that investment.\n  Another issue that was talked about a lot while I was in Haiti--I was \napproached by many business people, many political leaders--was their \nsupport for a bill that I have introduced in the Senate and that has \nbeen introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Clay \nShaw, and that is the bill we call the Hero bill, a bill that would \ngive Haiti some trade preferences, a bill that would create tens of \nthousands of jobs in Haiti.\n  I cannot tell my colleagues how many people came up to me and said: \nSenator, please tell your colleagues we appreciate the aid, we \nappreciate the assistance, but if they really want to help Haiti and \nthe Haitian people, what we need is jobs, and the way you can help us \nget jobs is to pass the bill that you have introduced. The Haitian \npeople want to work. This bill will give us the opportunity to work.\n\n  Finally, if the new Haitian Government is to succeed, it can only \nsucceed if there is security in the country. The U.S. Armed Forces who \nare in Haiti today will be phasing out over the next few weeks. They \nwill be replaced by U.N. forces. It is imperative that the U.N. forces \nbe at least as strong in their actions as the U.S. troops have been.\n  The U.N. troops will be tested. They will be tested by the thugs. \nThey will be tested by the shamirs. They will be tested by Aristide's \ngangs. They will be tested by the rebels. In essence, they will be \ntested by both sides in what would have been a civil war. Let's keep in \nmind that the U.S. troops that came in and have done such a wonderful \njob for the last several months prevented a blood bath in Haiti. They \nprevented a civil war. The U.N. troops will have to be equally as \nstrong, and when the U.S. forces leave and the U.N. troops come in, the \nU.N. troops will be tested.\n  The U.N. troops will have to be equally as strong, they will have to \nbe tough, and they will have to fire back. If they do not, then Haiti \nwill revert to chaos. So the next several months will be a very crucial \ntime for these U.N. troops and a very crucial time for Haiti.\n  The one very good piece of news forthcoming during our trip was on \nthe AIDS front. Haiti has been for some time a country that has had the \nhighest incidence of AIDS. The good news is there have been doctors in \nHaiti who have been at the forefront in the battle against AIDS. Dr. \nPaul Farmer in the rural area and Dr. Bill Pape in Port-au-Prince have \nbeen at the forefront in the battle against AIDS, not just in Haiti but \nthroughout the world.\n  We had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Pape on our most recent \nvisit. He shared with me a statistic. The statistic is this: The \nincidence of AIDS in Haiti has now been cut in half. That is an \nastounding figure. It has been the result of some very aggressive work \nby a number of people.\n  I will come back to the Chamber sometime in the next few weeks to \ntalk about this issue of AIDS in more detail because I think it is of \nsuch great importance. I think Haiti can be looked at as a model for \nthe rest of the world as to how to dramatically cut the incidence of \nAIDS.\n  This poor country that certainly has not been governed very well in \nthe last few years still managed in spite of that\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nto dramatically cut the incidence of AIDS. There is a lot to be learned \nfrom what has been going on in Haiti.\n  In addition to cutting the incidence of AIDS, we have also seen in \nHaiti the dramatic increase in the use of antiretroviral drugs.\n  So when my wife Fran and I walked into an orphanage run by the \nSisters of Charity, whereas just a year ago none of the children who \nhad AIDS were on antiretroviral drugs, this year when we came back and \nwalked in we would see some of the children who were HIV positive, who \nwere in need of drugs, who actually this time were on antiretroviral \ndrugs.\n  We saw one little boy who we were told had come in just a few months \nbefore. He was very critically ill and he would have died but the \nsisters, because of Dr. Pape and because of good assistance coming in \nto Haiti, were able to get that child antiretroviral drugs and we saw a \nvery healthy, chubby little boy running around this orphanage. Because \nof very good care from the nuns and because he has antiretroviral \ndrugs, that boy is going to make it.\n  That is the type of miracle we are now beginning to see in Haiti, and \nI think it is something for which we can be very proud. That is what we \nwant to see replicated around the world.\n  So when I come to the Senate floor and ask my colleagues to vote for \nmore money for AIDS assistance around the world, it is that little boy \nI am going to be citing. It is this type of little boy who we can save \naround the world because if it can be done in a poor country such as \nHaiti, it can be done in other countries as well.\n  That is very good news coming out of Haiti from our last trip.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6260-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6260-S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENERGY INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am quite troubled by what we \nhave seen happen over the course of the weekend with the storming of \nthe residential complex in or near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the eastern \nportion of Saudi Arabia, the oil-producing portion of Saudi Arabia. The \nstorming of this residential complex and the taking of hostages at a \nresidential complex that held people from many nations portends of what \nis to come. That is very troubling to the United States and the world \ncommunity.\n  In today's paper, I see headlines such as ``Saudis storm complex to \nfree hostages.'' It says, ``Saudi leaders say the recent attacks won't \naffect the oil supplies.'' Then in another piece in the same newspaper, \nit says, ``Latest terror attack increases the doubts about the ability \nof Saudi Arabia to pump more oil.''\n  Is it not interesting that we as a world community, and especially as \nthe United States, have to be concerned about the pumping of that Saudi \noil in order to feed the voracious appetite we have for energy. Is it \nnot interesting the United States had some painful lessons we learned \nin the early '70s, and again in the late '70s, when the oil cartel \nlocked down limited production and almost brought the industrialized \nworld to its knees, and we became so much more dependent, realizing we \nneeded that foreign oil to feed our appetite; that as a Nation, we said \nwe are not going through this anymore; we are going to head on a path \nfor energy independence. Then we lulled ourselves back into the \nseductive price of cheap oil and continued allowing our voracious \nappetite to go unabated, with the result that even though we have tried \nall kinds of alternative measures, the fact is we are importing more \nthan half of our daily oil consumption, and that figure is moving \nupward to 60 percent of our daily oil consumption.\n  Right off the bat, that tells you that is not a good position to be \nin when it comes to the defensive interests of this country. Think how \nmuch of a freer hand we would have, as we conceive and develop our \ndefense plans for this country, if we and the free industrialized world \ndidn't have to depend on that oil coming out of that gulf region. But \nwe are dependent. So when we see an attack by al-Qaida directly on \nthose oil interests, we better start examining further the need for us \nto set energy independence as a major policy of the U.S. Government.\n  We know that the United States is, in fact, al-Qaida's target, but \nthere should be no doubt now that Saudi Arabia is also the target of \nal-Qaida. It is a target where al-Qaida has a better chance of success \nbecause it has the desired goal of overthrowing the Royal Family of \nSaudi Arabia.\n  Saudi society presented them with many opportunities: weak \ninstitutions, an alienated population, and nearby terrorist operating \nbases. Al-Qaida's strategy is becoming increasingly clear. What they \nare doing is stoking the dissatisfaction of Saudi citizens with their \ngovernment and the Royal Family by demonstrating the Royal Family's \nweakness by conducting their al-Qaida attacks in Saudi Arabia.\n  The attacks this past weekend indicate where they are now headed: to \ncut off Saudi Arabia's lifeline by destroying their oil facilities and \ndiminishing their oil-producing capability. It is a strategy that has \nsome chance of success. If the attack that happened this past weekend \nhad interrupted the flow of Saudi oil, then the Saudi Royal Family \nwould, indeed, have some cause for concern that they could stay in \npower because overnight they would lose the one tool they have to keep \nsome of the popular discontent in their country under wraps, and that \nis oil money.\n  The Saudi rulers have not helped matters over the years by ignoring \nthe obvious, which is the threat to their own self-interest posed by \nIslamic extremists. Why? Because the Saudi Royal Family has played \nfootsy for far too long with the radicals, thinking they could buy them \noff and paying money to the extremist religious schools, called \nmadrasas, hoping that Saudi money, spread around the Muslim world where \nthe most extreme ideology and hatred is taught, was going to buy them \npeace. But I think the Saudi Royal Family is beginning to wake up.\n  The United States has tried to be Saudi Arabia's defender. We had \nthousands of troops based over there in the 1990s. Clearly, when Saddam \nHussein in the early nineties moved on Kuwait and it was very clear \nthat he was intent on moving into Saudi Arabia, the United States \nresponded. But Saudi Arabia did not like us having troops on their \nland. We did not particularly want to be there because we were the \nconstant source of attack, such as the Khobar Towers bombing which took \n19 American lives.\n  The United States could not build a defensive wall around Saudi \nArabia to protect them--now especially that is so--even if we wanted \nto, which we don't, but that is especially so because many of the \nthreats now come right from within Saudi Arabia itself. So all we can \ndo is impress upon Saudi Arabia the need for reform in their society as \nquickly as they can to isolate the extremists, to institute democratic \ninstitutions, and to diversify their economy. But those prospects are \nnot good because if the Saudi Royal Family were to fall and if it is \nsucceeded by an Islamic radical regime, then I fear for the rest of the \nMiddle East and the gulf region that we would see a risk of those \nregimes falling like dominos. With a radical Saudi successor regime in \ncontrol of all that oil, one can imagine the damage it could do by \nholding the West hostage economically.\n  That is what we are facing. Sometimes we get lost in seeing the \nentire forest for the particular trees, but I think we need to pull \nback and see that this threat of radical terrorists is now being \ndirected not only at us in the homeland, but it is being directed at a \nsource of energy upon which the western industrialized world has become \ndependent. If the attacks we have seen just a few days ago do not \nconvince us to curtail our addiction to oil, then I do not know what \nwill.\n\n  Why don't we do some reasonable things? I remember the junior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts offering an amendment to do something real simple, \nsuch as lower the miles per gallon for SUVs,\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nand we got beat and beat badly. That is an easy one to do, not even to \nspeak of shifting to alternative sources of energy, not even to speak \nof additional conservation efforts, not even to speak of production \nefforts where it is not going to harm the fragile environment where, \nindeed, there are the reserves, not even to speak of using our \ntechnology in a crash course such as we did when we went to the Moon in \nthe Apollo project. We set a goal and we said we were going to achieve \nit. We marshaled the resources, we marshaled the will, we got the \nsupport of the American people, and within 9 years we were able to go \nto the Moon and return safely. And so, too, we need an Apollo-type \nproject for energy independence to wean ourselves from that dependence \non foreign oil.\n  We need to invest massive manpower and effort into developing \nalternative energy sources so that the possible collapse of unstable \noil regimes in the Middle East will not hold us hostage. Lord knows, \nlet's hope that does not happen, but we need to wake up and see the \ninsatiable appetite we have for that foreign oil.\n  I believe energy independence is one of the top priorities for \nprotecting U.S. national security. There are a lot of Senators who \nsupport that goal and yet we allow ourselves to be beat time and time \nagain by certain special interests and lobbies that have their own \ninterests at the forefront instead of the national interest.\n  The events of this past weekend make the need for energy independence \na national priority. These events make it clearer than ever.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

Madam President, I have discussed the upcoming schedule \nwith the Democratic leader. We currently have a cloture vote scheduled \nfor 5:30 today on the motion to proceed to the class action fairness \nbill. In a moment, I will ask unanimous consent to vitiate that cloture \nvote.\n  As I mentioned earlier this morning, it has been our hope to finish \nboth the Defense authorization bill and the class action legislation in \na timely way. To expedite completion of the Defense authorization bill, \nwe will need to limit amendments so the managers of the bill can begin \nto schedule amendments accordingly.\n  In addition, we would like to reach an agreement to begin the class \naction bill immediately upon the conclusion of the Defense \nauthorization with no need for the motion to proceed. Having said that, \nI am prepared to ask unanimous consent but will withhold for any \ncomment.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the 5:30 cloture vote be vitiated \nand that the Senate begin consideration of S. 2062, the class action \nfairness bill, at the conclusion of the pending Defense authorization \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that at \n5:20 today the Senate proceed to executive session for the \nconsideration of calendar No. 558, the nomination of F. Dennis Saylor, \nIV, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Massachusetts; \nprovided further that be there 10 minutes equally divided for debate \nprior to the vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate \nthen resume legislation session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the amendment list I sent to the desk is \na large amendment list. Some of the amendments on the list do not have \nanything to do with the Defense authorization. I want to make it clear \nthat I don't believe many of the amendments are appropriate to the \nDefense bill. This is indeed true on both sides, both the lists \nsubmitted from this side of the aisle and on the other side of the \naisle.\n  We are locking in this list so we don't find ourselves with twice as \nmany amendments if we wait until later tonight or tomorrow.\n  Having said that, we have a limited universe of amendments. We have \nnot agreed to consider each and every one of the amendments, but we do \nhave this limited universe. There is no reason, I believe, that we \nshould not be able to finish the bill either late this week or early \nnext week.\n  I hope the Democratic leader agrees and will work with us to ensure \nthe bill is completed in a reasonable time next week.\n  All of this agreement has been reached through conversations with the \nDemocratic leadership and the managers on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I share the view expressed by the \nmajority leader. He and I have had conversations about the scheduling. \nI think it is the right decision. We made some progress on the bill \nbefore the recess.\n  I think the excellent manager relationship we have on both sides of \nthe aisle with regard to this particular bill will serve us well as we \nwork through amendments. There are a lot of place holders. There are a \nlot of amendments where Senators simply wanted to be protected, and we \nrespect that. But as we do with the number of bills, we will work with \nour managers to constructively come up with a more manageable and \npractical list as the next day or so unfolds. I think we can complete \nour work in a timely way.\n  As I have indicated to the majority leader, it is not our desire to \noppose going to the class action bill once the work on the DOD bill has \nbeen completed. We will have a good number of amendments on that bill \nas well. But this sequence makes the most sense given our circumstances \nright now. We need to finish our work on the DOD bill given our \ncircumstances in Iraq in particular, and I think this schedule will \naccommodate that need. I think we are where we need to be at this \npoint.\n  I will continue to work with both of our managers to see that we \nfinish our work on this bill as we expected we would prior to the \nrecess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nboth leaders. Senator Levin and I have handled this bill for many \nyears. This list is not unlike what we have had before.\n  The Senate will work its will. I know some Senators think perhaps \ntheir amendments should have been on the list. But I have experienced \ncooperation on my side to not have several amendments on the list; I \nexpect my colleague from Michigan did likewise; the Senate is anxious \nto have a lot of issues addressed. But this is a very key piece of \nlegislation which is a must on behalf of the men and women of the Armed \nForces.\n  I thank the leadership.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is important we were able to work out \nthe arrangements we have made to go to this most important Defense \nauthorization bill. As Senator Daschle mentioned, the two managers are \nexperienced; they have dealt with these issues for many years. This is \nthe time to work on the Defense authorization bill, not some side issue \nthat, important as it might be, does not compare to the importance of \nthis Defense bill.\n  We had five soldiers killed yesterday in Iraq. During the months of \nApril and May, we averaged two soldiers a day being killed. Now over \n800 have been killed in Iraq. We are approaching 5,000 who have been \nwounded, some of whom have lost legs, eyes, and are paralyzed.\n  I cannot imagine we would move off this piece of legislation. It is \nimportant Members of the Senate have the opportunity to offer their \nviews on what should be done or what should not be done with this \nDefense authorization bill. There are going to be a number of \namendments, but this is nothing new. Even when we do not have two \nsoldiers killed every day, we spend a lot of time on this bill. With \n120 of our men and women having been killed in 60 days, they and those \npeople who are now over there in the trenches, so to speak, deserve our \nfull time and attention on this most important piece of legislation.\n  I am glad we are now able to work on this bill and not set it aside \nand come back at a subsequent time. We were beginning to have some \nmomentum when there was a decision made to pull off the bill. There are \namendments that will take a little bit of time, but I don't think we \nshould worry about that. When we get to class action, we will get to \nclass action. When we finish this bill, it will be for the good of the \ncountry, especially if there has been a full debate.\n  I have just returned from home, as have the other 99 Senators. There \nis not a single issue that we should be dealing with other than our \nmilitary forces, based on the conversations I had with people at home. \nWhether it is talk radio, town hall meetings, or campaign events, the \nNo. 1 issue is Iraq. We in the Senate cannot hide our heads in the sand \nand pretend it is not important; it is.\n  I look forward to the management of this legislation by our two fine \ncommittee leaders, Senator Warner and Senator Levin.

Madam President, I welcome the action of the leadership \nin taking up the nomination of Dennis Saylor to the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts. I urge the Senate to \nconfirm him.\n  Mr. Saylor has received impressive support from a broad spectrum of \nleaders of the bar. They are confident of his ability, his good \njudgment, and his fairness. I am confident he will be a distinguished \nmember of the court.\n  Mr. Saylor has past experience in the executive branch. I am \nconfident he understands the importance of the independence of the \njudicial branch.\n  He is currently a partner at the highly respected law firm of Goodwin \nProcter in Boston, where he joined as an associate after graduating \nfrom Harvard Law School in 1981. He later served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in Boston. From 1990 to 1993, he served as the chief of staff \nof the Assistant Attorney General, Robert Mueller, in the criminal \ndivision of the Department of Justice, providing litigation and policy \nadvice, and served as a liaison with Congress and outside \norganizations.\n  He returned to Goodwin Procter as a partner in the litigation \ndepartment and currently specializes in white-collar criminal defense \ncases and other complex legal issues involving individuals and \ncorporations.\n  His impressive background, legal expertise, and experience make him \nwell qualified for this position and inspire confidence that he will be \na judge in which Massachusetts will take pride.\n  The Federal district supreme court in Massachusetts is one of the \nmost efficient and effective district courts in the country, and its \njudges are highly regarded and respected. It dispenses justice fairly \nand takes seriously its role as part of an independent branch of our \ngovernment. I am sure Mr. Saylor will contribute to the distinguished \nwork of this court. I urge the Senate to approve his nomination.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DENNIS SAYLOR IV TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                       DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the nomination of F. Dennis \nSaylor IV, of Massachusetts, which the clerk will report.\n  The journal clerk read the nomination of F. Dennis Saylor IV, of \nMassachusetts, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of F. \nDennis Saylor, nominated to the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. Saylor is a highly regarded litigator with a history of public \nservice. Upon graduating from Harvard Law School, Mr. Saylor joined the \nlaw firm of Goodwin Proctor where he worked for several years before \njoining the United States Attorney's Office for the District of \nMassachusetts.\n  He left his Assistant U.S. Attorney position in 1990 to serve as the \nSpecial Counsel and Chief of Staff to the Assistant Attorney General \nhere in Washington, D.C. In 1993, Mr. Saylor rejoined Goodwin Proctor \nas a partner where he remains to this day.\n  This highly respected attorney has focused much of his professional \ncareer on criminal matters, however--as his record illustrates--he has \ndistinguished himself on the civil side as well.\n  Mr. Saylor will bring 20 years of legal experience and sharp acumen \nto the Federal bench. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we vote to confirm another district \ncourt nominee of President Bush, Frank Dennis Saylor, IV, to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts. Mr. Saylor is a \npartner at the firm of Procter Goodwin. He is supported by both of his \nhome-State Senators, who deserve much credit for his confirmation \ntoday.\n  Today's confirmation will make the 77th judge confirmed this Congress \nand the 177th judicial nominee named by this President to be confirmed \nby the Senate. We confirmed 100 in the 17 months that Democrats led the \nSenate. We are now confirming the 77th in the other 24 months that have \ntranspired during this most divisive presidency.\n  With 77 judicial confirmations this Congress, the Senate has \nconfirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during the entire 2 \nyears of 1995 and 1996, when Republicans controlled the Senate and \nPresident Clinton was in the White House. It also exceeds the two-year \ntotal for the last 2 years of the Clinton administration in 1999 and \n2000, when Republicans controlled the Senate. So, we have exceeded the \ntotals for the last two Congresses leading up to presidential \nelections.\n  With 177 total confirmations for President Bush in 3\\1/2\\ years, the \nSenate has confirmed more lifetime judicial appointees of this \nPresident than were allowed to be confirmed in President Clinton's \nentire term from 1997 through 2000. We have already surpassed the \nnumber of judicial confirmations during President Reagan's entire term \nfrom 1981 through 1984, and he is acknowledged to have appointed more \nFederal judges than any other President in our history.\n  Democratic support for the confirmation of Mr. Saylor, an active \nRepublican who was championed by Republican Governor Mitt Romney for \nthe bench, is yet another example of our extraordinary cooperation. Mr. \nSaylor's Republican credentials are not in doubt--he was even on some \nshort lists for Bush Administration Executive Branch positions. We take \ninto account his experience and his career as a litigator who has \nserved as both a Federal prosecutor and a defender of those accused of \ncrimes.\n  I congratulate Mr. Saylor, his wife, Catherine Adams Fiske, who is an \nattorney with the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the \nDepartment of Justice, and their family on his confirmation today.\n  While this confirmation is another demonstration of good faith and \ncooperation by Democratic Senators, we, again, see partisan Republicans \nseeking confrontation. Last week, the President used his recess \nappointment powers to place Republicans on what should be bipartisan \nboards and commissions. A good example is the U.S. Parole Commission. \nWhile Isaac Fullwood's nomination is being bottled up by Republicans, \nthe President proceeds to recess appoint Deborah Spagnoli. In addition, \nthe President has yet to follow through on Democratic recommendations \nto longstanding vacancies on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. This week \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee will end the short-lived \ncooperation on judicial nominations and force votes and hearings on \ncontroversial nominees, apparently in response to pressure from the \nright wing of the Republican Party. Republicans are insisting that the \nCommittee break with tradition and proceed on judicial nominees opposed \nby home-state Senators.\n  Thus, while this nomination marks historic progress in Democratic \nSenators' cooperation with the White House, partisan Republicans refuse \nto take yes for an answer and insist on ignoring the progress that we \nhave made. We have treated President Bush's judicial nominees far more \nfairly than Republicans treated President Clinton's. Still, no good \ndeed we do goes unpunished.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof F. Dennis Saylor IV, of Massachusetts, to be U.S. District Judge for \nthe District of Massachusetts. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr.\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\nBunning), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), and the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Ms. Murkowski) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``yea''.\n  Mr. REID.

Corporal Codner was killed on May 26, 2004, in the Anbar \nprovince in Iraq while performing security and stability operations. He \nwas 19 years old. CPL Matthew Henderson of Lincoln, NE, a good friend \nof Codner, was killed in the same explosion.\n  Corporal Codner grew up on a farm east of Shelton, NE, and graduated \nfrom Shelton High School in 2003. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps in \nJune 2003, and was deployed to Iraq in February of this year. He was \nassigned to 1st Combat Engineer Battalion, 1st Marine Division, 1st \nMarine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, CA. Codner was one of \nthousands of brave American service men and women serving in Iraq.\n  Corporal Codner is survived by his parents, Dixie and Wain Codner of \nShelton; sister, Melissa; and fiancee, Megan Kirkover. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with them at this difficult time. America is proud of Kyle \nW. Codner's service and mourns his loss.\n  For his service, bravery, and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring Lance Corporal Codner.\n\n\n                            Hesley Box, Jr.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave \nArkansan who gave his life in the defense of his Nation. SSG Hesley \nBox, Jr., 24, of Nashville, AR, died on May 6, 2004, in Baghdad, Iraq, \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Staff Sergeant Box died when a \ncar bomb detonated near his guard post.\n  Hesley, or ``Tanky'' as his family called him, joined the Guard in \n1997. He was just 24 years old when he left for Iraq in March with the \n39th Infantry Brigade. Even though he was a young soldier, Hesley was \nalready a veteran of two other deployments in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia.\n  Our condolences and prayers go out to Hesley's wife, Alexia; his two \nsons Zacheas and TaDarius; his parents, Hesley, Sr., and Barbie Box, \nand his brother, Tarcus Kyron Box.\n  Hesly's wife Alexia recounted the impact he had on peoples' lives and \nthe love he showed for their children.

He joined \nthe Army National Guard almost 20 years ago and was assigned to the \nGuard's counterdrug program. For the last 10 years he worked with the \nArkansas State Police in the criminal investigation division's office \nof investigative support.\n  Leon showed the kind of heroism that makes all Arkansans proud. He \nlost his life protecting other men in his unit. He has been awarded the \nBronze Star and Purple Heart.

Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments \ntoday to reflect on the life of Army SSG Joseph Garyantes. Joe \nepitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who are \nfighting to free Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. \nHe exhibited unwavering courage, dutiful service to his country, and \nabove all else, honor. In the way he lived his life--and how we \nremember him--Joe reminds each of us how good we can be.\n  Joe was born in Wilmington, DE, to Geraldine and the late James \nGaryantes. When he was 5 years old, his family moved to the Rehoboth \nBeach area. Joe attended Rehoboth Elementary School and Epworth \nChristian School. At Epworth, Joe was remembered was a man with a \ndynamic personality and a good sense of humor. He always was loyal to \nhis fellow friends and teammates and won the most valuable player award \nin 10th grade for basketball. His family later moved to Florida.\n  When Joe was 18, he seriously considered spending life in the \nministry helping people. Ultimately, though, this Delaware native \nenlisted in the Army and became a soldier at the young age of 20. His \nmission always remained the same though--helping people. When Joe was \nstationed in Kosovo before going to Iraq, he asked his family to send \ncare packages. These packages were not for him. They were meant for \nneedy kids in the area. During the holiday season, Joe would bring over \nsingle soldiers for Christmas dinners and make them feel as though they \nwere part of the family.\n  Joe spent the last several years in Germany, where he lived with his \nwife, Monika, and their two sons, Tevin, 6, and Ryan, 4. He was killed \nby a sniper in Muqdadiyah, Iraq. Joe was assigned to B Company, 1st \nBattalion, 63rd Armor Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, Vilseck, \nGermany.\n  I rise today to commemorate Joe, to celebrate his life, and to offer \nhis family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss. \nOur country is deeply grateful for his noble service to others, his \nidealism and for the example that he provided to all Americans by the \nway he led his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6265-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        KOBY MANDELL ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Koby Mandell \nAct of 2003. This bill is intended to ensure that all terrorists who \ncommit violent acts against American citizens overseas are punished to \nthe full extent of the law. I have already been working to ensure that \nthe Koby Mandell Act is considered by the Senate and, I expect passed \ninto law.\n  Three years ago, Koby Mandell was beaten to death in a cave near the \nJewish settlement of Tekoa on the West Bank in Israel. Koby Mandell was \n13 years old. No one was caught or charged with responsibility for this \nmurder. This tragic story is only one among dozens in which U.S. \ncitizens have been harmed by terrorists, and the U.S. Government has \nbeen hindered in its ability to hunt down and prosecute the criminals.\n  The bill would establish within the Department of Justice an office \nto ensure that all American citizens who are killed or injured by \nterrorists operating overseas receive equal treatment by the U.S. \nGovernment in its efforts to solve the crime and bring the perpetrators \nto justice. There would be no difference among cases based on the \norigin of the terrorists or where they carry out their heinous acts. \nThe investigators and prosecutors associated with this new DOJ office \ncould investigate each incident aggressively, whether the victim is a \ndiplomat, a volunteer teacher like Ted Burgon of Oregon, who was killed \nin Indonesia in 2002, or a child like Koby Mandell.\n  Specifically, this bill will create the Office of Justice for Victims \nof Overseas Terrorism. The Office will ensure that rewards are offered \nfor the capture of terrorists involved in attacks that harm American \ncitizens. It will advertise such rewards and publicize the names and \nphotos of suspects. The Office will establish a notification system to \nkeep victims' families updated on the status of investigations and \nefforts to capture suspects in each case. It will seek to ensure that \nsuspects are not able to obtain visas to travel to the U.S. In \naddition, the Office will seek to determine if terrorist suspects who \nare believed to have participated in attacks on American citizens are \nemployed by local or national police forces. If it finds that suspects \nare so employed, the Office will seek to curtail any American foreign \nassistance to those forces. Finally, the Office will undertake a \ncomprehensive assessment of indictments and prosecutions by the U.S. \nGovernment against suspected terrorists. It will seek to identify any \npatterns that would determine the reasons for the absence of \nindictments in certain cases or in certain countries. This assessment \nwill be conveyed to the Attorney General with recommendations for \ncorrecting any shortcomings in attempts to pursue, capture, and \nprosecute suspects.\n  Just as we must do all we can to prevent terrorist attacks from \noccurring on our soil, we must take additional steps to protect our \ncitizens from attack overseas. Where they are targeted and harmed, it \nis the duty of the U.S. Government to pursue each case of murder or \ninjury vigorously until every terrorist knows that he or she will not \nescape justice. The Koby Mandell Act is a step toward honoring those \nwho have been lost or harmed, and a step toward deterring future \nattacks. I am honored to join Senator Smith, Senator Wyden, and the \nother sponsors of this measure as a cosponsor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6265-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that adds new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  On Long Island, NY, in November 2000, Michael Ashley was charged with \nallegedly assaulting his roommate.

RES. 364\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to express my support as a \ncosponsor for S. Res. 364, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \naddresses growing concern about oil markets. Over the past few months, \noil prices have skyrocketed to a high of over $40 per barrel. High \ngasoline prices are inextricably linked to high crude oil prices, and \nthese high oil and gas prices hurt Americans across the Nation and from \nall walks of life. Farmers, teachers, and small business owners across \nthe country and in Wisconsin in particular, are getting hit hard by \nthese outrageous costs. This week the people in my home State of \nWisconsin are seeing gas prices of over $2.00 a gallon. Making matters \nworse, a recent refinery breakdown in Minnesota may further reduce the \nsupply of gasoline in the State.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this resolution because it sends a powerful \nmessage to the administration that it needs to directly, and \naggressively, confront this oil and gasoline problem now. First, the \nresolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the administration \nshould directly confront OPEC and challenge OPEC to immediately \nincrease oil production. The eleven countries that make up the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, produce 40 percent \nof the world's crude oil and control three-quarters of proven reserves, \nincluding much of the spare production capacity. Ensuring access to and \nstable prices for imported crude oil for the United States and major \nallies and trading partners of the United States is vital to United \nStates foreign and economic policy.\n  The 2004 OPEC production cuts have resulted in outrageous increases \nin oil prices. OPEC instituted its production cut in February 2004, \nwhich reduced production by 2,000,000 barrels per day.\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\nFrom February to March 2004, crude oil prices rose from $28 to $38 per \nbarrel. In April, OPEC announced its commitment to further cut oil \nproduction by 1, 000,000 barrels a day, and crude oil prices now exceed \n$40 per barrel. We cannot allow this foreign oil cartel to wreak havoc \non our economy. The administration must use its diplomatic pressure to \npersuade OPEC to increase production. The actions of this cartel have \nreal consequences for Americans.\n  Second, the resolution states that the administration should direct \nthe Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to exercise \nvigorous oversight over the oil markets to protect the American people \nfrom price gouging. Mega-mergers throughout the oil industry have \nresulted in consolidation in the market, and we have, in essence, \nrebuilt the Rockefeller trust through these mergers. The gasoline \nmarket in Wisconsin and at least 27 other States are now considered to \nbe ``tight oligopolies'' with 4 companies controlling more than 60 \npercent of the gasoline supplies. In tightly concentrated markets, \nnumerous studies have found oil company practices are driving \nindependent wholesalers and dealers out of the market.\n  Investigations have also found large consolidated oil companies \ncontrol not just the buying choices of local gas stations, but also the \nselling prices of gasoline distributors. As a result, independent \nstations must buy their gasoline directly from the oil company, usually \nat a higher price than the company's own brand-name stations pay. With \nthese higher costs, the independent stations cannot compete. The \ncompany bases prices not on the cost of producing gasoline, but on the \nmaximum a neighborhood will pay. The FTC and the Attorney General must \nkeep a watchful eye on these anticompetitive practices and use all the \ntools available to them to protect consumers from price fixing and \nother practices that result in escalating gas prices.\n  Finally, the resolution calls upon the administration to suspend \ndeliveries of the oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and release \n1,000,000 million barrels of oil a day for 30 days. History indicates \nthat releasing oil from the SPR provides consumers with relief from \nhigh gas prices. Within hours of the first air strike against Iraq in \nJanuary 1991, the first President Bush authorized a drawdown of the \nSPR. The day after the plan was approved, crude prices dropped by \nnearly $10 a barrel. During the fall of 2000, the Clinton \nadministration decided to release oil from the SPR. The day after the \noil was released from the SPR, crude prices oil prices fell from $37 a \nbarrel to less than $ 31 a barrel. In addition, releasing the oil will \nnot affect our security interests because the SPR is almost full. It \ncurrently holds 659 million barrels, and its capacity of the is 700 \nmillion barrels. The resolution only calls for releasing 30 million \nbarrels. American consumers need relief from high gas prices now. I \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6266-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6266-S6267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF DEBBIE HERSMAN\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senate recently confirmed Debbie \nHersman to become a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. \nShe has served the Commerce Committee for 5 years, and all of us will \nmiss her presence. We all wish her the best in her new position and \nknow that she will serve with honor and integrity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following statements that are part \nof the hearing record on her nomination be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Senator Ernest Hollings on the Nomination of Debbie \n                                Hersman\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I know Senator Hutchison would agree that the \n     most important character a member of the National \n     Transportation Safety Board can have is independent thinking. \n     I don't want someone going to an accident, mind already made \n     up, sharp elbows telling everybody what they are supposed to \n     find, and everything like that.\n       What I want is someone who can look at all sides of the \n     issue. Someone who can challenge people to make the right \n     decisions. Someone who can manage the non-partisan \n     professionals doing the work. And someone, who at the end of \n     the day, will give a fair and unvarnished response on what \n     happened.\n       I pick NTSB members like George Bush picks vice presidents. \n     You can search the country, far and wide, but the best of the \n     best in transportation safety, is right here in the room, \n     everyday with us, Debbie Hersman.\n       She has worked for the committee for almost 5 years. I've \n     had her focus on rail, because of the tremendous needs we \n     have to modernize Amtrak and improve passenger and safety \n     issues.\n       But she also has taken on oversight of truck and bus \n     safety, pipeline safety, hazardous materials transportation \n     safety. And post 9-11, I've asked her to oversee \n     transportation security issues, insofar as air, rail, ports, \n     and trucking. In other words, she is well-rounded in all \n     aspects of transportation. Her experience belies her youthful \n     appearance.\n       Prior to joining our staff, Debbie was the staff director \n     for Congressman Bob Wise of West Virginia, who served on key \n     transportation and infrastructure committees. She holds a \n     bachelor's degree from Virginia Tech and a master's degree \n     from George Mason.\n       We still have much work to do on this committee on \n     transportation issues, and I hate to lose my right arm. She \n     is as hard a worker, as smart as any, as competent a \n     professional as any Senator could ask for. But I know the \n     country is better off, if Debbie is at NTSB, and I proudly \n     endorse her nomination.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we hold many nomination hearings in \nthis committee, and we say many things about the nominees, usually in \npraise of them, but at times questioning them. This nomination is a \npersonal one for many of us, as we have all watched Debbie work \ntirelessly on behalf of us and our constituents.\n  Before I discuss all of the reasons that Debbie is absolutely the \nright person for this position, I want to proudly state she is a West \nVirginian. Both of her parents were raised in Roane County, WV. In \naddition, she has many proud relatives in Spencer and Charleston, WV. I \nknow that the people of West Virginia share my pride in all of Debbie's \naccomplishments.\n  Before coming to the Senate Commerce Committee, Debbie worked for \nthen Congressman Wise of West Virginia in many capacities, including \nchief of staff. Governor Wise called me to support her nomination, and \nwe wholeheartedly agreed that there was no better person for the job. \nDebbie has spent a career for the people of West Virginia, and I know \nthe entire country will benefit from her presence on the National \nTransportation Safety Board.\n  Each of us has had to call on the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, or watched on CNN, the work that they do in sifting through a \ndisaster site and in dealing with family members following an aviation \ntragedy. We rely on their independence to provide Congress and the \ntransportation regulatory agencies recommendations to improve safety. \nIt is a critical role that they play, and one divorced from politics \nand partisanship. The National Transportation Safety Board deals with \nsituations where tragedies affect many people and that makes it all the \nmore important that we select someone with both the technical knowledge \nto contribute to the board's work and the human compassion needed in \nthe context of these tragedies. Debbie melds these two important \nrequirements in a particularly special manner.\n  Each Board member is an independent source of knowledge and \ninformation. While the Board votes on matters, and we hope that all \nagree on the safety recommendations, each is charged with independently \nmaking a decision based on the facts and analysis of its expert staff. \nA small agency, with some 429 employees, its expertise and knowledge is \nrecognized around the world.\n  Debbie, who has worked on this committee for 5 years, has worked with \nall of us on transportation safety and regulatory issues, using her \nexpertise and talents to push for improvements. Her primary focus has \nbeen surface transportation, but I know that she has spent a \nconsiderable amount of time on aviation safety issues, and helped with \naviation security matters following 9/11. I know she worked on the \nhighway bill while a House staff member, and that knowledge will help \nher in her new position.\n  Her talents, wit, charm and expertise will be sorely missed. I wish \nher the best of luck in her new position, and while none of us hope to \nsee her about a tragedy in our states, we know that whatever the \nsituation, the NTSB will be in good hands with Debbie there.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today we are honored by the nomination of\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\nDebbie Hersman to serve as a member of the National Transportation \nSafety Board. Along with Senator Hollings, I have spent a great deal of \ntime over the last 5 years working with Debbie. She has always provided \nme with excellent counsel and I can count on her to know the facts and \nunderstand the points of view of all sides.\n  Debbie's experience in all modes of transportation qualifies her well \nfor this position. In 1999 she spent countless hours drafting \nlegislation that ultimately resulted in the creation of the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration at the Department of \nTransportation, with the primary purposes of reducing large truck \nfatalities on our nation's highways. In 2001 Debbie and I worked \nthrough many legislative issues on the floor along with Senator McCain \nand his staff to pass a pipeline safety bill. The pipeline safety \nlegislation was prompted by several fatal accidents that were also \ninvestigated by the NTSB. We rely on the Board to provide us with \nindependent and honest answers about accidents and what needs to be \ndone to prevent them in the future. I know that we can count on Debbie \nto understand the import of the Board's work and the interplay between \nthe Board's recommendations and the legislative and regulatory \nprocesses.\n  While it is hard for us to let one of our own go, I have every \nconfidence that she possesses the professionalism, credibility, and \nwith the necessary insight to do the job well. Debbie always sees the \nbig picture yet she pays attention to the details. Her tenacity and \nability to hold people's feet to the fire will serve her well in her \nnew position as she sifts through the facts at accident scenes and \nworks through staff recommendations.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Debbie on a multitude of \ntransportation issues. I have always been impressed with her diligence \nand professional demeanor. While I will miss her, on both a \nprofessional and personal level, I know that Debbie will serve on the \nNTSB with distinction. It is my hope that we can move her nomination \nand get her over to the NTSB quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6267-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6267-S6268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           U.S. INVESTMENT IN INTERNATIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I address the Senate on the matter of \nthe need for continued U.S. investment in energy efficiency projects in \nother countries, as well as our own. I recently submitted my view on \nthis matter to a publication of the Alliance to Save Energy, but I feel \nnow, particularly in these times of high gasoline prices, that I should \nmake a few remarks to the full Senate on this issue.\n  Fluctuating energy prices and instability in the Middle East once \nagain are prompting calls for energy independence for the United \nStates. In our efforts to meet that goal, we cannot forget that the \nenergy use of other countries directly effects both the supply and \nprice of our energy resources here at home.\n  Federal efforts to ensure freedom from fluctuations in energy prices \nhave been advocated by every President, both Republican and Democrat, \nsince 1973 and the infamous oil boycott. As Americans we count on \nenergy to protect our security, to fuel our cars, to provide heat, air \nconditioning and light for our homes, to manufacture goods, and to \ntransport supplies. In all of these needs, we, as consumers, pay the \nprice for fluctuations in the global energy market.\n  Our efforts to guarantee adequate energy supplies in the U.S. should \nprompt us to again take a hard look at energy efficiency not only here, \nbut abroad. We are reminded that the international energy efficiency \nprograms and projects run by our Federal Government protect and enhance \nthe economies and standard of living of developing nations around the \nworld. Given that we have a single integrated global petroleum market \nthese efficiency programs directly benefit American consumers: by \nlessening demand for oil abroad, we are helping to loosen supply and \nhold down price pressures domestically. Quite simply, lowered oil \ndemand in Madras helps truckers in Montpelier. Lowered oil use in Sao \nPaolo helps drivers in Santa Fe.\n  A visitor to the capital of almost any developing country, be it \nBangkok, Cairo, Manila, or Mexico City, will have a common experience. \nThese places have already seen extraordinary increases in energy use. \nPeople who last saw these places 10 or 15 years ago are struck by the \nmassive increase in air pollution from automobiles, trucks, and \nfactories. As development takes hold and growth accelerates, energy use \nincreases dramatically. But in many cases developing countries do not \nuse energy efficiently. They often require two to four times more \nenergy than industrial countries to produce the same output. This fuel \nconsumption speeds up the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere, contributing to global warming. In addition, fuel \ncombustion is often dirty and incomplete, generating local pollution.\n  U.S. Government-funded efforts energy-efficient programs that provide \nequipment and improved energy management practices can greatly reduce \nenergy consumption. Over the last 10 to 15 years, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, U.S. AID, launched a number of energy \nconservation projects aimed at energy use. These projects helped create \nan interest in energy efficiency, trained local engineers in energy \nmanagement, and sponsored energy audits and demonstration investments. \nThe projects were technically successful and had good economic rates of \nreturn, and the Alliance to Save Energy has been involved in several of \nthese projects. In most cases, fuel savings paid for the cost of \ninvestments in a year to two. By reducing energy consumption, the \nmeasures also reduced pollution.\n\n  One of the most successful examples of a national energy conservation \nprogram has been Brazil's National Electricity Conservation Program \nPROCEL. With support from U.S. AID, PROCEL has developed demonstration \nand education programs to foster energy efficiency savings and reduce \nthe need for new construction of costly power plants. The country has \ndeveloped energy efficiency standards, regulatory measures, and joint-\nventure projects that have become a model for the rest of Latin \nAmerica. PROCEL's energy efficiency measures have resulted in direct \nsavings of over 1200 gigawatt-hours per year.\n  The need for programs such as these are overwhelming. According to \nthe Energy Information Administration's most recent International \nEnergy Outlook world energy consumption will rise by 54 percent from \n2001 to 2025, driven by rising demand for power in China, India and \nother parts of the developing world.\n  The report, issued on April 15, 2004, says oil will remain the \ndominant energy source worldwide through 2025, in Asian markets as well \nas in the United States. Combined, Asian and U.S. consumers will \naccount for nearly 60 percent of the increase in world oil demand, \nwhich is projected to rise from 77 million barrels per day in 2001 to \n121 million barrels per day in 2025. To meet that rising demand, the \nworld's producers would have to increase daily production by more than \n44 million barrels.\n  And for electric power generation, coal dominates energy markets in \nChina, India, and other developing Asian countries. EIA projects \nextensive increases in coal use in China and India. EIA also projects a \nnear doubling of worldwide net electricity consumption by 2025, from \n13,290 billion kilowatt hours to 23,072 billion kilowatt hours--again \npropelled by rising demand for electricity in the developing world.\n  Unfortunately, despite these successes there is an alarming and \ndecreasing trend in funding for energy efficiency programs at U.S. AID. \nDuring the past few years these programs have received a cut in \nfunding--with the fiscal year 2004 request ($8 million) cut to 50 \npercent of the fiscal year 2001, $16 million funding. And the current \nproposal will not reverse this trend.\n  In a century likely to contain many surprises and new challenges, the \nimportance of U.S. energy security can only increase. In achieving \nenergy security we must be mindful of a few things. We must assist \ndeveloping countries in cultivating a responsible energy policy which \nsupports sound economic and social development for the betterment of \ntheir population and the global environment. This mutually beneficial \npartnership will enhance our energy security while providing sorely \nneeded revenues for health care, education, and infrastructure abroad. \nWe\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\nalso must remember that it takes continued federal investment to \nachieve this worthy goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6268-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER JAMES MATHIEU\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate and honor LCDR James Mathieu \nof Sanbornville, NH on the occasion of his retirement after 28 years of \nhonorable service to the United States as a member of the United States \nCoast Guard.\n  Rising through the ranks from recruit to his current rank, LCDR \nMathieu distinguished himself on numerous occasions. From his Honor \nGraduate status in Recruit Training, through his successful completion \nof various training and vocational schools, to the achievement of ever \nincreasing rank, LCDR Mathieu has upheld the Coast Guard motto of \nSemper Peratus, Always Ready.\n  Jim's afloat assignments included Coast Guard cutters Hamilton, \nChase, Bibb, Unimak, and Vigilant. His operational ashore and staff \nassignments include the Coast Guard Academy, Group Woods Hole, Group \nPortland, Coast Guard Headquarters, and Station Miami Beach as \nCommanding Officer of a 400 man detachment in Miami Beach. Tasked with \nsearch and rescue, law enforcement and environmental response, LCDR \nMathieu led his team in the Coast Guard's busiest multi-mission \nstation. With an impressive record of rescues and other successful \nmissions, LCDR Mathieu proved that his unit was ready for countless \ntasks in support of the United States' maritime interests. Jim retires \nfrom the Office of Coast Guard Congressional Affairs, serving as \nGovernmental Liaison to the United States Coast Guard.\n  A proud husband, father and grandfather, LCDR Mathieu is married to \nthe former Lori Anne Dowd, herself a career Coast Guard officer. \nTogether, they have raised a family of one son, James Michael II, and \none daughter, Melissa. As a family, they were often faced with the \nchallenges borne by so many who serve our country. They were also \nrewarded by the satisfaction of knowing they have participated in a \nnoble and just cause.\n  Throughout his entire career, LCDR James Mathieu has set his \nstandards high and striven to meet them in every endeavor. Through the \njunior ranks, leadership positions, and as a family man James Mathieu \nhas continually distinguished himself.\n  Jim exemplifies the words of Daniel Webster who said:\n\n       ``God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are \n     always ready to guard and defend it.''\n\n  Because of his efforts, the liberty of this country is made more \nsecure.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate this year's \nwinners of the New Hampshire Excellence in Education Awards. The \n``ED''ies are awarded to those individuals, schools and educational \nprograms that have made significant contributions to public education \nand have met the highest standards of excellence. Educators and schools \nwho are selected have demonstrated a high standard in areas such as \ncurriculum and instruction, teaching and learning process, student \nachievement, leadership and decisionmaking, community and parental \ninvolvement, and school climate. On June 5, 2004, the leadership and \nachievement of these 33 individuals and 12 schools in New Hampshire \nwill receive acknowledgment. I add my voice on behalf of the citizens I \nrepresent in similarly recognizing our appreciation and respect for \nthese professionals who make countless sacrifices and contributions in \nour schools.\n  The ``ED''ies are presented in various categories of excellence, such \nas math and science teaching, curriculum development, and environmental \neducation. The specific criteria for the ``ED''ies, which is developed \nby the board of directors for the New Hampshire Excellence in Education \nAwards, has been applied to elementary, middle, and secondary schools, \nalong with teachers, administrators and other education professionals \nperforming at each of these levels, as well as higher education. The \nselection committees consist of some of New Hampshire's finest \neducators and community leaders who have the responsibility of applying \nthese standards and evaluating the nominees. The committees make their \nselections after careful review of the nominees, school applications \nand assessments based on on-site visitations.\n  The teachers recognized here have clearly had a profound impact on \ntheir students just as many of my own teachers had on me. The teachers \nfor whom I have the fondest memories created a positive learning \nenvironment and necessary direction that were key elements to my growth \nas a person and as a public servant. They impressed\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\nupon me the importance of one's contribution at the community level and \nthe important role a sound public education plays in our society. Now, \nas a parent, I can more fully appreciate how delicate the task of \neducating can be, and understand more now than ever the vital resource \nour schools and teachers provide to the parents in the towns and cities \nof New Hampshire.\n  The educators and community leaders chosen this year to receive \n``ED''ies have demonstrated superior dedication to their students, \nschools and communities. They deserve this prestigious honor for the \nimportant roles they play in helping our children reach their goals and \nsucceed in school. The individuals and schools being commended this \nyear have provided students with the tools they need to become \nproductive and engaged citizens, and are our State's most treasured \nrole models--setting positive examples for the children that surround \nthem, teaching personal responsibility and hard work, and shaping the \ncharacter of young minds. For these achievements, our State and our \ncountry owe them a great deal of gratitude.\n  Since first elected to Congress in 1996, I have made improving \neducation a legislative priority of mine. I am cognizant of the fact \nthat the men and women on the front lines of our classrooms tackle the \ntoughest of challenges and enable students to reach their full \npotential. We, in New Hampshire, enjoy an outstanding education system \nthat is a true model for the country. This success is due in large \nmeasure to the contributions and leadership of the many educators and \nschools recognized here today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the 2004 New Hampshire \nExcellence in Education Award winners be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     2004 New Hampshire Elementary School Representatives of \n         Excellence\n     Canterbury Elementary School, Canterbury\n     Gilford Elementary School, Gilford\n     Elementary School Finalists: Grinnell Elementary School, \n         Derry; James Mastricola Elementary School, Merrimack; \n         Mast Way Elementary School, Lee; Tuftonboro Central \n         School, Tuftonboro\n     NH Environmental Educators\n     Valerie Ford and Jon Marshall, Bartlett Elementary School, \n         Elementary Level\n     Esther Cowles, NH Project Learning Tree, Nonformal Division\n     Scott Semmens, Hopkinton High School, Secondary Level\n     NH Charitable Foundation Christa McAuliffe Sabbatical\n     Sue S.

Mr. President, I rise to co-sponsor, along with my \ncolleague Senator Grassley, the Drug Impaired Driving Research and \nPrevention Act. This legislation will help us combat an often \noverlooked killer on our Nation's roads--drugged driving.\n  Drivers who are drugged are not as easy to catch as drivers who are \ndrunk. We have not yet developed technology to quickly identify drivers \nwho operate vehicles under the influence of drugs. States do not have \nconsistent laws to punish drugged driving. And law enforcement does not \nhave adequate training to detect and prosecute drugged drivers.\n  To help make our roads safer, this legislation takes a tough stance \nwhile respecting State's traditional law enforcement powers.\n  First, the bill directs the U.S. Department of Transportation to \ndraft a model law to suggest to the States. That model law will make it \na crime for an individual to drive with ``any detectable amount'' of a \ncontrolled substance in his or her system, or when drugs noticeably \naffect mental or physical abilities. For the worst repeat offenders, \nthe law has tough penalties to show that we mean business--over a year \nin jail.\n  Second, the law calls for research into technology to let us detect \ndrugged drivers quickly. Right now, there is nothing like a \n``breathalyzer'' test for drugs.\n  And third, this legislation will have the Department of \nTransportation develop training programs so that law enforcement \ndepartments throughout the Nation can learn how to better detect \ndrugged drivers.\n  Why do we need this bill? Because drugged drivers are a reckless \ndanger to everyone else on the roads. Consider the following: In 2002, \n11 million people drove while under the influence of drugs in the \nUnited States. Those numbers translate into tragedy. Illegal drugs are \nused by about 10 to 22 percent of drivers involved in all motor vehicle \ncrashes.\n  Despite this documented risk, drugged driving is tricky to catch. We \ncatch drugged drivers less often than we catch drunk drivers. Too few \npolice officers have received training that would help them take \ndrugged drivers off the streets. And in the fifty States, there is \nsimply no consistent method to identify drugs in the bodies of drivers.\n  Not surprisingly, this legislation has wide support. The federal \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy is backing it. So is the \nPartnership for a Drug Free America, the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America,\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\nand other groups. The House of Representatives has already voted to \napprove the legislation, as part of the Transportation Equity Act.\n  This legislation will help the states keep drugged drivers off our \nroads. It will do so by encouraging the States to make the laws against \ndrugged driving uniform, by researching better technology to test for \ndrugs, and by giving law enforcement more training.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6270-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO VERMONT HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nVermont Housing Finance Agency, which on June 3rd will mark its 30-year \nanniversary of making affordable housing possible for Vermonters \nthroughout the State. The Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA), which \nis celebrating this significant milestone in my home State, has \nthroughout its history been a consistent leader in financing safe, \ndecent, and affordable housing for low- and moderate-income Vermonters. \nThis is no small feat given the shortage of affordable housing options \nthroughout the State.\n  The upcoming celebration gives us the opportunity to recognize the \nhard work and dedication of the leadership and staff of this agency. \nExecutive Director Sarah Carpenter, Board of Commissioners' Chair Lisa \nRandall, and the 41 staff members and 7 commissioners work tirelessly \nto promote this agency's worthy goals. Over 24,000 Vermont families \nhave directly benefited from the extraordinary assistance that VHFA has \nprovided since its inception.\n  VHFA is an agency that each and every Vermonter should be very proud \nof. I admire the work that VHFA does and frequently look to its staff \nfor guidance regarding affordable housing matters in Vermont. I am \ndelighted to stand before you today in recognition of this great \nagency, which exceeds the standards of excellence in so many ways. I \noffer VHFA my deepest congratulations for its 30 years of service to \nthe people of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6270-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM GREENBLATT\n\n Mr. TALENT.

Under his leadership, the size of the Lexington Police \nDepartment has more than tripled and it has received many awards for \nits efforts in public and youth safety. Roth exhibits an innovative and \nhands-on approach to law enforcement that has greatly benefited the \npolice department and the Lexington community through the establishment \nof new safety services and the creation of outreach programs to \nindividuals of all ages.\n  Roth was instrumental in the creation of local school-based \nprogramming such as School Resource Officers and DARE classes for \nelementary and middle school students. Roth oversaw the creation of an \n``Adopt-a-Cop'' Program within the Lexington Police Department that was \nrecognized as the 2003 Public Safety Program of the Year by the \nMunicipal Association of South Carolina and as a Model Cities Program \nby the National League of Cities at their annual conference.

BART BARLOGIE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague \nSenator Mark Pryor to honor Dr. Bart Barlogie, professor of medicine \nand pathology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, UAMS, \nthe Arkansas Cancer Research Center, ACRC, and director of the Myeloma \nInstitute for Research and Therapy, MIRT.\n  For his lifelong work to find innovative treatments for myeloma \ncancer, Dr. Barlogie received the International Myeloma Foundation's \nSecond Robert A. Kyle Lifetime Achievement Award on May 8, 2004, in \nLittle Rock, AR.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Barlogie has been recognized as one of the \nmost innovative, creative, and knowledgeable minds in the field of \nmyeloma clinical research and treatment. His leadership has made \nArkansas home to the foremost center for myeloma research and treatment \nin the world.\n  Innovations pioneered under Dr. Barlogie's leadership include the \naccepted use of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplants \nthat have resulted in better clinical outcomes for myeloma patients. In \nfact, the MIRT has performed more than 4,400 bone marrow transplants, \nfar more than anywhere else.\n  Dr. Barlogie's work will thalidomide as a treatment for myeloma has \ndramatically changed how patients are treated. His use of anti-\nangiogenesis as a cancer treatment is now widely accepted and used in \nnot only myeloma but many other forms of cancer.\n  Over the last 10 years, Dr. Barlogie's work has led to the widespread \nuse and acceptance of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, and positron \nemission tomography, PET, scans for myeloma patients. His work is also \non the forefront of the movement toward effective molecularly targeted \ntherapies and treatments. These techniques continue to improve the \nmeans by which physicians can combat cancer.\n  Dr. Barlogie is totally devoted to his patients. He is continually \ndriven to find better therapies, prolonged remission rates, a better \nquality of life, and, ultimately, a cure to one of the most challenging \nand misunderstood of all cancers.\n  I am proud to honor Dr. Barlogie today, and I am happy that he, his \nwife Kathleen, and their three children, Britta, Eva, and Bart, have \nmade their home in Little Rock, AR. They have made significant \ncontributions to our State and community.\n  I know all Arkansas join me in thanking Dr. Barlogie for making \nArkansas the center of his professional and personal life. His \nachievements have helped make our stellar medical institutions, the \nUniversity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Arkansas Cancer \nResearch Center, and the Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, \ngain worldwide prominence in the fight against cancer.\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Blanche Lincoln, to honor Dr. Bart Barlogie.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to publicly commend Dr. \nBarlogie for his unyielding dedication and stalwart leadership in the \nfield of oncology research and treatment. His hard work has led to the \ndevelopment of innovative and comprehensive approaches to treatment of \npatients with multiple\n\n[[Page S6271]]\n\nmyeloma, which has translated better therapies, prolonged remission \nrates for cancer survivors and improved the quality of life for many of \nhis patients. Moreover, his commitment may ultimately lead to a cure \nfor the most challenging and misunderstood of all cancers.\n  On May 8, 2004, Dr. Barlogie was awarded the International Myeloma \nFoundation's Second Robert A. Kyle Lifetime Achievement Award. This \naward, which is being given for only the second time, recognizes the \nsignificant and revolutionary work of his professional career. This \naward follows an already long and distinguished line of \naccomplishments.\n  Arkansas was well on its way to becoming the center for myeloma \nclinical research and treatment when Dr. Barlogie accepted the position \nof director of hematology/oncology, and director of research at the \nArkansas Cancer Research Center, (ACRC), at the University of Arkansas \nfor Medical Sciences, (UAMS, and founding director of the Myeloma and \nTransplantation Research Center, MTRC, within the ACRC. His research \nteam has developed innovative and comprehensive approaches to the \ntreatment of patients with multiple myeloma. Because of his leadership \nrole in the area of myeloma research and treatment, he was named the \nfirst director of a newly established Myeloma Institute for Research \nand Therapy.\n  During Dr. Barlogie's 15-year tenure at UAMS, more myeloma patients \nhave been treated in Arkansas than anywhere else in the world. Yet, \ndespite his gains in this area, myeloma continues to affect thousands. \nThis year, approximately 15,000 Americans will be diagnosed with \nmyeloma. Looking to the future, Dr. Barlogie envisions a satellite-\nbased intensive training program which will reach physicians worldwide \nso that many of these patients treated at the institute will have \naccess to specialized medical care upon returning to their home States \nor countries.\n  Of paramount importance to Dr. Barlogie are his wife Kathleen and \ntheir three children, Britta, Eva, and Bart. He loves them dearly and \ncredits their support for his success. They have made their home in \nLittle Rock, AR, and have added a number of their own contributions to \nour community and State.\n  We thank Dr. Barlogie for making Arkansas the center of his \nprofessional and personal life. His past and future achievements have \ntruly helped make the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the \nArkansas Cancer Research Center, and the Myeloma Institute for Research \nand Therapy very respectable among the premier health care institutions \nin the State. More importantly, through his work, Dr. Barlogie has had \nconcrete and positive impacts on the everyday lives of thousands of his \npatients. His commitment to this cause is incredible: he is saving \nlives and providing hope for millions more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6271-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ALLAN RAMSAY, JR.\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH.

Serving the citizens of \nthe great State of Ohio for over 22 years, Judge Ramsay was one of \nthose individuals. His dedication to his profession and to helping \nothers reflected his compassion and devotion to his fellow citizens.\n  Appointed to the Cleveland Hearing Office of the Social Security \nAdministration as an administrative law judge in 1982, Judge Ramsay \nworked tirelessly to improve the lives of more than 15,000 people who \nturned to the Social Security Administration in their times of need. \nFrom 1992 to 1997, he served as the chief administrative law judge in \nthe Social Security Hearing Office in Columbus, OH. In 1997, he \nreturned to Cleveland as the chief judge of that office, and in 1999 he \nbecame the assistant regional chief administrative law judge, while \nmaintaining his leadership position in the Cleveland Hearing Office.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Judge Ramsay touched the lives \nof countless individuals. His career is a shining example of public \nservice of which the people of Ohio and the rest of the Nation should \nbe proud.\n  Judge Ramsay held himself to a high standard and his service to our \nNation reflects that. Judge Ramsay is survived by his wife, Beatrice, \nand his two children. In this time of great loss, my condolences go out \nto the entire Ramsay family. I can only hope that they will find solace \nin the thoughts and prayers of loved one, friends, and all those whose \nlives were bettered through his work.\n  May God bless Judge Allan Ramsay and his entire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6271-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO R. PRESTON WOODRUFF, JR.\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nArkansan who has committed over a quarter of a century of his life \ncreating programs that enhance access to higher education for \nArkansans.\n  During his tenure as chairman of the board of directors and then as \nexecutive director for the Arkansas Student Loan Authority, ASLA, Mr. \nR. Preston Woodruff, Jr., has unselfishly shared his knowledge and \ntalents to ensure that students are equipped with the financial \nresources needed to become future leaders in our State and our Nation.\n  Programs established under Preston's leadership include: EdLoan--a \nspecial loan for Arkansas teachers which offers incredibly low interest \nrates for those who choose to remain in Arkansas to teach in grades K \nthrough 12. Student Outreach Services--a program available to all \nArkansas schools which provides materials and seminars to high school \ncounselors and their students in order to promote the benefits of \nhigher education and the means to achieve a higher education. Student \nAdvantage Scholarships--25 scholarships awarded annually by ASLA. This \nprogram was formed as a means to create interest in the financial aid \nprocess and to provide funds to assist in gaining access to higher \neducation. Honor Roll Student Loan Borrower Benefit Program--a program \nthat offers the lowest student loan interest rates available to \nArkansas students.\n  Preston was also instrumental in establishing the Education Finance \nCouncil, EFC, an association of not-for-profit State student loan \nsecondary markets that played an important role in influencing \nlegislation regarding the Federal Family Education Loan Program.\n  On June 30, 2004, Preston will officially retire from his position as \nexecutive director for ASLA. He is a living example of the many \noutstanding Americans who were born and educated in Arkansas, and I am \nprivileged to recognize his tireless commitment to Arkansas students \nand outstanding leadership as executive director of the Arkansas \nStudent Loan Authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6271-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6271-S6272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING ERIC SIMON, GRADUATING SENIOR OF NEW PRAGUE HIGH SCHOOL, NEW \n                               PRAGUE, MN\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a fine young \nman, Eric Simon, who will be graduating from New Prague High School in \nMinnesota on Friday, June 4, 2004.\n  Eric Simon has earned my respect because of the extraordinary courage \nhe has demonstrated in confronting one of life's most difficult \nchallenges. Eric's father has AIDS, and he has lost his mother and \nsister to AIDS.\n  During the early 1980s, Eric's father, Douglas Simon, served in the \nArmy National Guard at Fort Benning, GA and during his service he was \ninjured and required emergency medical surgery. During surgery, Douglas \nSimon required a nine-unit blood transfusion. The blood he received had \nnot been screened as it should have been, and it contained the AIDS \nvirus.\n  Eric and his brother, Brian, were spared from the ravages of the \ndisease, but they have had to shoulder adult responsibilities since \nthey were children. Since he was a boy, Eric has handled the grocery \nshopping, worried about paying the bills and cared for his father.\n  Sometimes Eric has had to listen to some unpleasant and even mean-\nspirited comments from people who don't understand what his family has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\nthrough. As a young person, Eric has often been challenged to be the \nbigger man, and to keep from being hurt by unkind remarks. It has not \nbeen easy.\n  Eric has also committed himself to his education. I understand at \ntimes that has been frustrating and, like all young men, Eric has \nsometimes been tempted to study less and hang out more. As the occasion \nof his graduation attests, however, Eric has risen to the challenge and \nsucceeded.\n  In closing, I would like to extend my best wishes to Eric Simon on \nhis high school graduation from New Prague High School. His commitment \nto his education and family are commendable and greatly admired. I am \nvery proud of this young man.

Mr. President, today I publicly congratulate Dr. \nFred Cholick on a very successful career as the dean of the College of \nAgriculture and Biological Sciences at South Dakota State University. \nHe has accepted the position as the new dean of agriculture at Kansas \nState University.\n  Over the years, Fred has been extraordinarily committed to South \nDakota agriculture and SDSU. He is one of the most effective \nagriculture spokespersons the State has ever had. He speaks with \ncompassion about the benefits of agriculture to our State's economy.\n  On a personal level, Fred quickly struck a close working relationship \nwith my staff. He enjoyed working with my office when I secured a seat \non the Senate Appropriations Committee and Fred experienced the same \nlearning curve we did as we explored various ways to secure Federal \nfunding for SDSU. Despite some setbacks, Fred always kept a positive \noutlook on the very precarious appropriations process and was \nincredibly honored that he had the opportunity to work on projects to \nbenefit SDSU and South Dakota's agricultural community. Fred is a real \nambassador for agriculture in the State and has done a very effective \njob at outreach to get everyone in South Dakota to understand the value \nof our agriculture economy.\n  Fred worked hard to ensure SDSU was a reputable university with \nrespect to animal health, dairy, ruminant nutrition, biotech and other \nareas of research. He should be given particular credit for working \nwith Associate Dean Kevin Kephart to develop the Sun Grant Initiative \ninto something that may soon become a reality. His vision for the role \nrenewable energy can play in agriculture is cutting edge. Fred has \nalways been an effective advocate for all land grant universities, and \nthat is why his colleagues around the country selected him as their \nspokesperson. So while always loyal to South Dakota, Fred could \neffectively speak on behalf of all land grant schools across the United \nStates.\n  He has developed strong relationships with his students as a teacher, \nas well as the dean of agriculture. He worked hard to ensure the \nstudents in the College of Agriculture were getting personal attention \nand a top-notch education. He cared deeply for those graduating and \nwould help them find employment in their respective fields.\n  Fred was a real champion of value-added agriculture and worked hard \nto get farmers in South Dakota to understand how to capture larger \nprofits from adding value to the raw goods produced on their \noperations.\n  Losing Fred is a huge loss to South Dakota and SDSU, and I personally \nknow that he struggled with the decision to leave SDSU for Kansas \nState. But, in the end, I think it is his undying commitment to \nagriculture that led him to decide that Kansas State was the right \nmove. His kind of leadership and character is exactly what the \nagricultural community needs to evolve and survive in the future. I \nwish nothing but the best for him and his family. It is with great \nhonor that I share his impressive accomplishments with my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6272-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JANE HINTON HART\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, today I honor a fellow Georgian, \nMrs. Jane Hinton Hart. Mrs. Hart is retiring after more than 30 years \nof service in the U.S. Government. She was raised in Thomson, GA, where \nshe graduated from Thomson High School in 1966, and Stephen F. Austin \nState University in Nacogdoches, TX, in 1970. She returned to Georgia \nand taught school in Augusta from January 1970 to June 1973.\n  Mrs. Hart began her Federal Government career on the staff of former \nSenator Sam Nunn, where she served the people of Georgia from 1973 to \n1991. During her 18 years of service in Senator Nunn's office, Mrs. \nHart worked the full spectrum of positions found in a congressional \noffice. She began as a staff assistant and became a senior legislative \nassistant to the Senator and the liaison between the Senator's office \nand the military installations in the State of Georgia.\n  In 1991, Mrs. Hart moved from the Hill to the Office of Legislative \nAffairs, Headquarters Marine Corps, where she has served four \ncommandants, Generals Mundy, Krulak, Jones, and Hagee. As a legislative \nspecialist, she has been responsible for reviewing and researching \nnumerous legislative issues to determine their impact on the U.S. \nMarine Corps. She has provided guidance and drafted legislative \nproposals for inclusion in the Department of Defense omnibus \nlegislative packages. She works closely with the Legislative Affairs \nOffices of the Department of the Navy and Department of Defense.\n  In addition to Mrs. Hart's Government service, she has been an active \neducation advocate through various PTAs in Arlington County, VA, a \nvolunteer in the Boy Scouts of America, a Sunday school teacher, and \nshe reads monthly at a homeless shelter. She will complete her masters \nin reading education this fall and plans to return to the classroom and \nteach.\n  I wish Mrs. Hart, her husband, Jim, and their son, John, all the \nbest. I am delighted that she came here from Georgia seeking to serve \nour Nation, and has done so with distinction for more than 30 years. \nGeorgia is proud of Mrs. Hart's dedication, hard work and patriotism, \nand I wish for her many more years of continuing success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6272-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6272-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6272-5", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 2003, the \nSecretary of the Senate, during the adjournment of the Senate, on May \n24, 2004, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2092.

A bill to require that notices to consumers of health and \nfinancial services include information on the outsourcing of sensitive \npersonal information abroad, to require relevant Federal agencies to \nprescribe regulations to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive \npersonal information outsourced abroad, to establish requirements for \nforeign call centers, and for purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcern about an issue that illustrates the continuing erosion of \nAmericans' privacy rights. My concern is related to the practice of \noutsourcing. When U.S. companies outsource sensitive customer \ninformation for processing overseas, they may be outsourcing our \nprivacy rights along with it.\n  We all know that recently it has become popular for American \ncompanies to send internal paperwork to be done in other countries, by \nforeign companies.\n  When a U.S. company allows a foreign company to process customer \ndata, the foreign company may be given access to the most sensitive \ntypes of customer information. Our health records, bank account \nnumbers, social security numbers, tax forms, and credit card numbers \nare now being shipped abroad--without the knowledge of the customer and \nbeyond the reach of U.S. privacy laws.\n  This phenomenon means that consumers are almost powerless to stop \nforeign scam artists from misusing their sensitive information. What \ntypes of abuses can occur under this scenario?\n  In one recent shocking example, a U.S. hospital hired a medical \ntranscriber in Pakistan through a subcontractor to work with sensitive \npatient health information. Later, the foreign worker claimed that she \nhad not been paid for her work.\n  So, you know what she did? She threatened to post patients' medical \nrecords online unless she was paid. Luckily, she got her paycheck and \ndoesn't seem to have posted anything online.\n  But this situation shows us the potential for gross violations of \nconsumer privacy. The U.S. hospital said that it never even knew that \nthe foreign transcriber had been hired through a subcontractor and it \ntherefore had never bound her contractually to follow any privacy or \nsecurity standards.\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\n  Another potential abuse of offshoring sensitive customer data is \nidentity theft. The illegal theft of someone's identity is a profoundly \ndisturbing and costly problem in this information age.\n  Moreover, illegal misuse of sensitive information can also have \nnational security implications. For example, data about some of our \nNation's power grids allegedly has been outsourced to companies \noverseas. Imagine the harm that terrorists might do if they got hold of \nthat type of confidential information.\n  As our global economy expands at such a rapid pace, we simply cannot \ntolerate the outsourcing of Americans' privacy rights overseas. We need \nto be proactve on this potentially explosive issue. Make no mistake, \nthe Pakistani transcriber incident is not the first or the last time \nthat sensitive customer information becomes endangered in a foreign \ncountry. The time to act is now, instead of reacting only after our \nprivacy rights are further eroded.\n  In light of these circumstances, today I am introducing a bill--along \nwith Senator Feinstein--that begins to address these privacy and \nsecurity concerns. The bill is called the INFO Act, which is short for \nThe Increasing Notice of Foreign Outsourcing Act.\n  The INFO Act is designed to help ensure that sensitive consumer \ninformation is protected and that U.S. companies can be held \naccountable for breakdowns in the security of customer information.\n  Specifically, the INFO Act that we are introducing today would \nrequire the following things: First, U.S. companies in the health care \nindustry and the financial industry must tell their customers that \ntheir sensitive health information and financial information is being \nprocessed by companies in foreign nations, where privacy safeguards may \nbe less stringent.\n  Second, U.S. companies in the health care industry and the financial \nindustry must promise their customers that they are complying with U.S. \nprivacy laws, which are designed to keep sensitive customer information \nsecure even when it is outsourced.\n  Third, U.S. companies in the health care industry and the financial \nindustry must make sure that each foreign company that is handling \nsensitive customer information has agreed by contract to meet U.S. \nprivacy standards and to keep sensitive customer information secure.\n  Fourth, U.S. companies may examine the business operations of the \nforeign company to make sure the foreign company is meeting privacy \nstandards and is keeping sensitive customer information secure.\n  Fifth, a foreign company must notify the U.S. company of any data \nsecurity breach. The U.S. company must then notify the U.S. regulatory \nagency, which can then hold the U.S. company accountable for the \nactions of the foreign company.\n  Finally, an employee of a foreign call center must tell a U.S. \ncustomer where the employee is located, if the U.S. customer asks for \nthis information.\n  I strongly believe that we need to act now, before the privacy issues \nraised by offshoring begin to explode.\n  Let me emphasize that I see this bill as both pro-consumer and pro-\nbusiness. Consumers will be informed about how their sensitive \ninformation is handled and they can learn when security breaches occur. \nAdditionally, foreign companies that handle customer data will be held \naccountable to the U.S. company that gives them their work. And U.S. \ncompanies will be upfront in informing their customers about offshoring \nsensitive data before customer backlash occurs.\n  With this sort of system in place, we hopefully can reduce the \nchances of customer data being misused, and allow U.S. companies to \nplay on a level playing field where all interested parties know the \nrules of the game.\n  I have a history of trying to solve consumer issues in ways that are \nnot needlessly burdensome to U.S. businesses. That is why my office, as \nwell as Senator Feinstein's office, has met several times with industry \nrepresentatives during the development of this bill.\n  I was interested to find ways for businesses to protect consumer \nprivacy rights without having to sharply raise prices or limit products \nand services. I believe that the INFO Act has achieved those goals.\n  Consumer privacy has always been one of my top priorities. Now, as \nalways, I look forward to working with all interested parties to \nresolve this consumer privacy issue in a timely and effective manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Marine Protection, Research, and \nSanctuaries Act of 1972 to prohibit the dumping of dredged material in \ncertain bodies of water; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long \nIsland Sound Protection Act on behalf of myself and Senator Schumer. \nThis legislation, which Congressman Bishop will be introducing in the \nHouse, would ensure that contaminated dredge materials are not dumped \nin Long Island Sound.\n  The need for this legislation is that the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency is finalizing the process of designating several \nsites in Long Island Sound as long term disposal sites under the Marine \nProtection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. Once this designation is \ncomplete, the sites will be open to receive dredged material \nindefinitely.\n  I recognize that there has been and will continue to be a need to \ndredge harbors and marinas around the Sound to support commerce and \nnavigation. But I am concerned that EPA has not looked hard enough at \nalternatives to dumping in the sound. While not all dredged materials \nare contaminated, we know that some are contaminated with heavy metals \nand other toxins. In my view, we should not use the Sound as a dumping \nground for those materials.\n  We must look more thoroughly for alternatives to dumping contaminated \nwaste in Long Island Sound. We need careful planning that involves a \nstrong role for the State of New York in this process. That is why this \nlegislation is so important--we cannot let short term economics \novertake long term environmental concerns.\n  The Long Island Sound Protection Act would require the Corps of \nEngineers and the EPA to work with other federal agencies and the \nstates of New York and Connecticut to develop a dredged material \nmanagement plan (DMMP) that would govern dumping in the sound.\n  The Long Island Sound Protection Act would require the DMMP to meet a \nset of objectives, including: Identifying the major sources and \nquantities of dredge material and contamination that require disposal; \ndetermining management actions that are to be taken to reduce sediment \nand contaminant loading of dredged areas; thoroughly assessing \nalternative locations, treatment technologies and beneficial uses for \ndredged material; ensuring that dumping is the disposal option of the \nlast resort after all other options have been exhausted; securing \nalternative methods of disposal of contaminated dredge materials, \nincluding decontamination technologies, and alternative uses of \nmaterials, including upland disposal, containment, beach nourishment, \nmarsh restoration, habitat construction, and other beneficial reuses; \nand confirming the specific roles of Federal, State, and local agencies \nwith respect to various aspects of dredged material management.\n  The Long Island Sound Protection Act also would stipulate that no \ndumping can occur in Long Island Sound, except in accordance with a \nDMMP that has been approved by the Governors of New York and \nConnecticut.\n  In addition, the bill would provide for public hearings in both New \nYork and Connecticut during the development of the DMMP.\n  To me this is a common sense solution to the current dredge disposal \nproblem. It would enable both New York and Connecticut to play a \nstronger role in determining what we put in the Sound. And it would \nprovide for a much harder look at upland disposal and beneficial reuse \nas alternatives to dumping in the Sound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2482\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2004, the \nrates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \nand the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nsurvivors of certain disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today to provide a cost-of-living, COLA, \nadjustment for certain veterans' benefits programs. This COLA \nadjustment would affect payments made to nearly 3 million Department of \nVeterans Affairs, VA, beneficiaries, and would be reflected in \nbeneficiary checks that are received in January 2005, and thereafter.\n  An annual cost-of-living adjustment in veterans benefits is an \nimportant tool which protects veterans' cash-transfer benefits against \nthe corrosive effects of inflation. The principal programs affected by \nthe adjustment would be compensation paid to disabled veterans, and \ndependency and indemnity compensation, DIC, payments made to the \nsurviving spouses, minor children and other dependants of persons who \ndied in service, or who died after service as a result of service-\nconnected injuries or diseases.\n  The President's budget anticipates inflation to be at a 1.3-percent \nlevel at the close of this year as measured by the consumer price \nindex, CPI, published by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. If inflation is held to the 1.3-percent level, that will be \nthe level of COLA adjustment under this legislation since it ties the \nincrease directly to the CPI increase as measured by the Department of \nLabor. Whatever the CPI increase eventually turns out to be, however, \nveterans' and survivors' benefits payments must be protected by being \nincreased by a like amount. The Senate has already concurred with that \njudgment with passage of a budget resolution which assumes an increase \nequal to the CPI, and which sets aside the funds necessary to finance \nthe COLA increase envisioned by this legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this vital legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-\n     of-Living Adjustment Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND \n                   DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Rate Adjustment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall, effective on December 1, 2004, increase the dollar \n     amounts in effect for the payment of disability compensation \n     and dependency and indemnity compensation by the Secretary, \n     as specified in subsection (b).\n       (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be \n     increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:\n       (1) Compensation.--Each of the dollar amounts in effect \n     under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the \n     dollar amounts in effect under sections 1115(1) of such \n     title.\n       (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount in effect under \n     section 1162 of such title.\n       (4) New dic rates.--The dollar amounts in effect under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1311(a) of such title.\n       (5) Old dic rates.--Each of the dollar amounts in effect \n     under section 1311(a)(3) of such title.\n       (6) Additional dic for surviving spouses with minor \n     children.--The dollar amount in effect under section 1311(b) \n     of such title.\n       (7) Additional dic for disability.--The dollar amounts in \n     effect under sections 1311(c) and 1311(d) of such title.\n       (8) DIC for dependent children.--The dollar amounts in \n     effect under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of such title.\n       (c) Determination of Increase.--(1) The increase under \n     subsection (a) shall be made in the dollar amounts specified \n     in subsection (b) as in effect on November 30, 2004.\n       (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), each such amount \n     shall be increased by the same percentage as the percentage \n     by which benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) are increased effective \n     December 1, 2004, as a result of a determination under \n     section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).\n       (3) Each dollar amount increased pursuant to paragraph (2) \n     shall, if not a whole dollar amount, be rounded down to the \n     next lower whole dollar amount.\n       (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary may adjust \n     administratively, consistent with the increases made under \n     subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation payable \n     to persons within the purview of section 10 of Public Law 85-\n     857 (72 Stat. 1263) who are not in receipt of compensation \n     payable pursuant to chapter 11 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.\n\n       At the same time as the matters specified in section \n     215(i)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     415(i)(2)(D)) are required to be published by reason of a \n     determination made\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\n     under section 215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2005, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the Federal \n     Register the amounts specified in subsection (b) of section \n     2, as increased pursuant to that section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (by request):\n  S. 2484. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to simplify \nand improve pay provisions for physicians and dentists, to authorize \nalternate work schedules and executive pay for nurses; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have today introduced, at the request of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, S. 2484, a proposed bill to simplify and improve pay \nprovisions for physicians and dentists, and to authorize alternate work \nschedules and executive pay for nurses. The Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs submitted this proposed legislation to the President of the \nSenate by letter dated July 18, 2003.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. In this case, I delayed introduction of \nthis measure so that certain provisions of the proposed legislation, \nwhich proposes extensive changes in the physician pay policies of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), might be reviewed by the \nCommittee's staff, and by potentially-interested parties, prior to its \nintroduction. I am pleased to state that many constructive ideas have \nbeen expressed, and the Committee's staff, working with the VA, the \nNational Association of VA Physicians and Dentists, the American \nFederation of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal \nEmployees, and other representatives of VA's labor force, have \nidentified prospective modifications to the proposed bill's text which, \nall appear to agree, would represent improvements over the language of \nthe legislation forwarded to the Senate in July 2003.\n  Even so, the bill I introduce today is the bill which the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs sent to the Committee in July 2003. I have \nintroduced that bill so that the original ``by request'' legislation \nmight be available to the Senate, and to the public, as part of the \npublic record. As is always my policy with respect to any such ``by \nrequest'' legislation, I reserve the right to oppose the provisions of, \nas well as any amendment to, this legislation. Indeed, as I have \nindicated, the Committee's staff, with the assistance of VA and other \ninterested parties, is already working on modifications to the bill as \nproposed by the administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and a \nsection-by-section analysis which accompanied it.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2484\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Health Care Personnel Enhancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES TO TITLE 38, UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this \n     Act an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT AND SIMPLIFICATION OF PAY PROVISIONS FOR \n                   PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS.\n\n       (a) Chapter 74 is amended--\n       (1) In section 7404(b)--\n       (A) by striking ``(1)'' after ``(b)''.\n       (B) by striking the list of position grades under the \n     caption, ``PHYSICIAN AND DENTIST SCHEDULE'' and inserting in \n     lieu thereof the following:\n       ``Physician grade.\n       Dentist grade.''\n       (C) by striking paragraph (2) in its entirety.\n       (2) In section 7404(c) by striking ``special''.\n       (3) By striking Subchapter III in its entirety and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following new sections:\n\n            Subchapter III--Pay for Physicians and Dentists\n\n     Sec. 7431. Pay authority.\n\n       (a) In order to recruit and retain highly qualified \n     physicians and dentists in the Veterans Health \n     Administration, the Secretary shall establish and \n     periodically adjust the rates of pay for physicians and \n     dentists based upon the factors specified in subsection (b). \n     Total pay shall be benchmarked to representative salaries of \n     non-Department physicians, dentists, and health care \n     clinician-executives.\n       (b) Pay for physicians and dentists employed in the \n     Veterans Health Administration shall have three components:\n       (1) Base pay.--This shall be a uniform pay band applicable \n     nationwide. The minimum rate shall be the maximum rate for \n     Chief grade in the Veterans Health Administration Physician \n     and Dentist Pay Schedule in effect on the day before the date \n     of enactment of this Act. The maximum rate may not exceed the \n     rate of basic pay authorized by section 5316 of title 5 for \n     Level V of the Executive Schedule. The Secretary shall adjust \n     annually the minimum rate by the same percentage as the \n     adjustment under section 5303 of title 5 in the rates of pay \n     for the General Schedule, and the maximum rate in accordance \n     with section 5318 of title 5. Administration facilities, \n     under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, may set \n     individual base pay anywhere within the pay band.\n       (2) Market pay.--This shall be a variable pay band based on \n     geographic area, specialty, assignment, personal \n     qualifications, and individual experience, and shall be \n     established and adjusted locally in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed under subsection (c). Administration \n     facilities will set individual market pay in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The Under Secretary \n     for Health shall periodically review and recommend to the \n     Secretary adjustments to the market pay band based on \n     published healthcare workforce employment and compensation \n     data. The Secretary may adjust the market pay band \n     periodically based on the recommendations of the Under \n     Secretary and in response to changing health-care labor \n     trends.\n       (3) Performance pay.--\n       (A) There shall be a variable pay band linked to the \n     physician's or dentist's achievement of specific corporate \n     goals and individual performance objectives. Physicians and \n     dentists other than those specified in subsection (f)(1) \n     shall not be eligible for this component during the first \n     year of appointment. The amount payable to a physician or \n     dentist for this component may vary based on individual \n     achievement. The performance component paid to any physician \n     or dentist other than those specified in subsection (f)(1) \n     will be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the \n     Secretary and may not exceed $10,000 in a year.\n       (B) In accordance with regulations prescribed by the \n     Secretary, ten percent of the benchmarked total pay for \n     physicians and dentists specified in subsection (f)(1) shall \n     be linked to the physician's or dentist's achievement of \n     specific corporate goals and individual performance \n     objectives as a performance component. Administration \n     facilities may set the performance pay in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary.\n       (c) Compensation paid under this subchapter shall be \n     considered pay for all purposes, including but not limited to \n     retirement benefits under chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, \n     United States Code, and other benefits. Notwithstanding the \n     preceding sentence, amounts paid for performance pay under \n     subsection (b)(3)(A) shall not be considered pay for \n     retirement benefits under chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, \n     United States Code.\n       (d) Any decrease in pay that results from an adjustment to \n     the market or performance component of a physician's or \n     dentist's total compensation does not constitute an adverse \n     action.\n       (e) In no case may the total amount of compensation paid to \n     a physician or dentist under this title in any one year \n     exceed the amount of annual compensation (excluding expenses) \n     specified in section 102 of title 3, United States Code.\n       (f)(1) Covered Positions.--This subsection applies to \n     physicians and dentists in the following positions: Chiefs of \n     Staff or equivalent facility-level and Network-level clinical \n     management positions (including Network Clinical Service \n     Managers), facility and Network or Regional executive \n     positions (including Network Service Line Coordinators and \n     Medical Center/Health Care System Directors), Central Office \n     executive positions, and such other positions under this \n     title as the Secretary may determine in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed in accordance with section 7434(a).\n       (2) Notwithstanding the special relationships of the \n     Veterans Health Administration with affiliated institutions \n     under section 7302, physicians and dentists serving in \n     covered positions and receiving compensation under this \n     subchapter may not receive any compensation on or after the \n     date specified in regulations issued by the Secretary, \n     through employment or contract with, or negotiate or accept \n     any offer of employment from, any institution or other entity \n     that is affiliated with the VA medical center to which they \n     are assigned, or affiliated with a VA medical center which \n     falls under their official responsibilities. This limitation \n     shall include receiving compensation through or from practice \n     groups or any other entities associated with the affiliated \n     institution(s), or from entities under contract with the \n     affiliated institution(s). Compensation includes anything of \n     monetary value, including but not limited to honoraria, \n     salary, and any fringe benefits such as: tuition waiver, \n     insurance protection, contributions to a retirement fund, \n     payment for books, below-\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\n     market interest loans, or employee discounts. Nothing in this \n     section precludes physicians and dentists in covered \n     positions from holding uncompensated appointments as other \n     than officer, director, or trustee with affiliated \n     institutions in furtherance of section 7302.\n       (3) Subject to any conditions the Secretary may by \n     regulation prescribe, the Secretary may, on a case-by-case \n     basis, suspend or waive the limitation in paragraph (2) to an \n     individual physician or dentist, when necessary and \n     appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 7302, to \n     assist communities or practice groups to meet medical needs \n     which otherwise would not be met, or where the Secretary \n     determines that suspension or waiver would be in the best \n     interest of the United States. The Secretary shall make any \n     suspension or waiver made pursuant to this paragraph in \n     writing.\n\n     Sec. 7432. Transition to new pay system.\n\n       (a) All current special pay agreements entered into under \n     the provisions of this subchapter in effect on the day before \n     the date of enactment of this Act shall terminate on the date \n     of enactment of this Act. Any physician or dentist in receipt \n     of special pay on that date shall continue to be compensated \n     as if such agreement were still in effect until the date \n     specified in regulations issued by the Secretary implementing \n     this new subchapter.\n       (b) Physicians and dentists appointed or reassigned on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, but before \n     implementation of this subchapter shall be compensated in \n     accordance with sections 7404, 7405, 7433, 7434, 7435, and \n     7436, as applicable, in effect on the day before the date of \n     enactment of this Act. Any such physician or dentist shall \n     continue to be compensated at the applicable rates until such \n     date specified in regulations issued by the Secretary \n     implementing the new pay system.

Pay for Under Secretary for Health\n\n       (a) Section 5314 of title 5 establishes the base pay for \n     the Under Secretary for Health at Level III of the Executive \n     Schedule.\n       (b) In addition to base pay under section 5314 of title 5, \n     the Under Secretary for Health shall be eligible for Market \n     Pay under section 7431(b)(2).\n       (c) Transition. The current special pay agreement of the \n     Under Secretary for Health entered into under the provisions \n     of this subchapter in effect on the day before the date of \n     enactment of this Act shall terminate on the date of \n     enactment of this Act. The incumbent Under Secretary for \n     Health on the date of enactment of this Act shall continue to \n     receive special pay as if such agreement were still in effect \n     until the date specified in regulations issued by the \n     Secretary implementing this new subchapter.

   (3) A nurse who works a 7/7 work schedule described in this \n     subsection who is absent on approved sick leave or annual \n     leave during a\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\n     regularly scheduled 12-hour tour of duty shall be charged for \n     such leave at a rate of eight hours of leave for seven hours \n     of absence.\n       (d) 9-Month Work Schedule.--The Secretary may authorize a \n     registered nurse appointed under section 7405, with the \n     nurse's written consent, to work full-time for nine months \n     with three months off duty, within a fiscal year, and be paid \n     at 75 percent of the full-time rate for such nurse's grade \n     for each pay period of such fiscal year. Such employee shall \n     be considered a .75 full-time equivalent employee in \n     computing full-time equivalent employees for the purposes of \n     determining compliance with personnel ceilings. Service on \n     this schedule shall be considered part-time service for \n     purposes of computing benefits under chapters 83 and 84 of \n     title 5.\n       (f) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the \n     implementation of this section.\n       (b) The title and list of sections for Subchapter IV in the \n     table of sections at the beginning of Chapter 74 is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n     Subchapter IV--Pay for Nurses and Other Health-Care Personnel\n\n7451.

ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION.\n\n       (a) Chapter 74 is amended by adding a new section 7427:\n\n     Sec. 7427. Functions.\n\n       The functions assigned to the Secretary and other officers \n     of the Department of Veterans Affairs under this chapter are \n     vested in their discretion.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herein a draft \n     bill ``To amend title 38, United States Code, to simplify and \n     improve pay provisions for physicians and dentists, to \n     authorize alternate work schedules and executive pay for \n     nurses.'' We request that it be referred to the appropriate \n     committee for prompt consideration and enactment.\n       The revised physician and dentist pay system and nursing \n     provisions were included in the President's budget. They \n     would be effective on the first day of the first pay period \n     on or after the later of April 1, 2004, or six months after \n     the date of enactment.\n\n                     Enhanced Physician/Dentist Pay\n\n       This bill will greatly enhance ability of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) to recruit and retain the highest \n     quality physicians and dentists to treat the Nation's \n     veterans. It would completely revise the VA physician and \n     dentist pay system to allow VA to adjust physician and \n     dentist compensation levels according to market forces. The \n     system's simplicity and flexibility would ensure that VA \n     physician and dentist compensation levels and practices do \n     not become outdated over time due to statutory limits. This \n     system also would ensure that VA pay levels do not fall \n     drastically behind while awaiting adjustment to the statutory \n     authority. It will be a living system that adjusts to \n     changing forces in the healthcare labor market. Generally, \n     amounts paid under this system will be considered pay for all \n     purposes, including retirement benefits under chapters 83 and \n     84 of title 5, United States Code, and other benefits. \n     However, amounts paid under the performance pay component \n     will not be considered pay for retirement benefits.\n\n\n                         VA Staffing Challenges\n\n       The VA compensation structure for physicians and dentists \n     has not changed since 1991. The current system is extremely \n     complex, comprising seven or eight different special pay \n     components in addition to basic pay. The system offers \n     insufficient flexibility to respond to the changing \n     competitive market for many of the medical specialties, \n     especially for the highest paid medical subspecialties. VA is \n     no longer able to compete for these critical subspecialties. \n     Also, although Congress increased special pay for dentists in \n     2000, those increases did not bring VA pay up to the levels \n     in private dental practice. The effects of noncompetitive pay \n     and benefits are reflected in dramatic increases in VA's \n     scarce specialty, fee basis, and contractual expenditures.\n       VA is facing a critical situation. Its compensation system \n     for physicians and dentists is unable to respond to the \n     demands of the current market. Severe shortages of qualified \n     physician specialists currently exist throughout the country \n     in specialties critical to VA's health care mission, such as \n     Anesthesiology, Radiology, Cardiology, Urology, \n     Gastroenterology, Oncology, and Orthopedic Surgery. These \n     shortages have driven compensation levels dramatically \n     upward. In these shortage specialties, VA total compensation \n     lags behind the private or academic sectors by 35 percent or \n     more. Such compensation gaps make recruitment almost \n     impossible and retention becomes more difficult. This \n     legislation will enable VA to compete for physicians in the \n     higher-paid, critical specialties and will protect other \n     physicians' and dentists' pay. Moreover, VA will be able to \n     offer to all physicians and dentists the prospect, now and in \n     the future, of market-sensitive pay rates, with a portion of \n     their compensation based on achievement of specific \n     performance goals.\n       The problems with the current system are clear: special pay \n     rates are fixed in statute, so over time their values are \n     eroded by inflation, and VA pay eventually falls behind the \n     market. The mechanisms available to VA to adjust physician \n     and dentist pay are not able to respond to fluctuations in \n     market levels of incomes for the different specialties. VA \n     physician and dentist base salary rates increase by the \n     amount of the annual national comparability adjustment that \n     Federal employees generally receive; however, there is no \n     increase in special pay amounts. Compensation for many \n     specialties has risen significantly in the private sector, \n     and VA pay cannot be increased to keep pace. VA is already \n     paying the maximum authorized amounts for scarce specialists; \n     there is no discretion under existing statute to pay more to \n     retain employees.\n       Additionally, the current system does not adequately \n     recognize disparities in pay among specialties. This results \n     in serious pay compression and makes it difficult for VA to \n     compete for the most highly paid specialists. For example, \n     the difference between the average pay of non-Federal \n     cardiologists vs. primary care practitioners is about 100 \n     percent; in VA, the difference averages about 20 percent.\n       VA historically had been able to use the Federal benefits \n     package as a major recruitment tool. To offset pay \n     disparities with the private sector, VA publicized its \n     benefits, such as the generous leave policies, opportunities \n     to pursue research and education activities, and formal \n     relationships with academic affiliates. More and more, \n     though, the private sector offers comparable or better \n     benefits. Some benefits widely available in the private \n     sector exceed VA's offerings including paid relocation as a \n     recruiting incentive, cafeteria-style benefit plans, payment \n     for courses to acquire continuing medical education (CME) \n     credits for license and board renewal, disability insurance, \n     and retirement benefits.\n       Increased enrollment by veterans for Veterans Health \n     Administration, VHA, services and the need for more \n     comprehensive care to aging veteran patients will result in \n     an increase in workload across the system over the next 5 \n     years. Current trends indicate a steady decrease in the \n     number of physicians and dentists VHA will be able to employ \n     over the same period. This decrease will result from \n     increased retirements, losses to the private sector, a \n     shrinking dentist labor supply, and increasing difficulty in \n     recruiting replacements. These factors will combine to create \n     significant gaps between VHA's staffing needs and available \n     resources for most physician specialties.\n       Without the flexibility to adjust pay in response to market \n     pressures and improve its competitive position in recruiting \n     and retaining physicians, the Department will be unable to \n     meet the demands of its increasing workload. VHA will be \n     forced to rely more heavily on scarce medical specialist \n     contracts and fee basis care, which often cost more than \n     using VHA physicians. It is critical that VHA be able to \n     offer more competitive compensation for physicians and \n     dentists.\n\n\n              Proposed New VA Physician/Dentist Pay System\n\n       We propose a three-tiered system of base pay, market pay, \n     and performance-based pay. VA would benchmark the sum of all \n     three bands to the 50th percentile of the Association of \n     American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Associate Professor \n     compensation\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\n     (for physicians) and 75 percent of American Dental \n     Association (ADA) net private practice income (for dentists). \n     The base pay component would be increased by the annual \n     comparability adjustments to Federal pay authorized by \n     Executive Order.\n       First Tier--Base Pay. A uniform base pay band will apply to \n     all positions in VHA, without grade distinctions. The \n     proposed range is Chief grade, step 10 of the VA Physician/\n     Dentist Schedule to Level V of the Executive Schedule, from \n     roughly $110,000 to $125,000. This change will dramatically \n     simplify hiring and employment and facilitate reassignments \n     and position changes. Placement in this band would be based \n     on the individual's qualifications. This band would form the \n     floor below which no individual's pay would ever go.\n       Second Tier--Market Pay. The second tier, the market pay \n     band, will be determined according to geographic area, \n     specialty, assignment, personal qualifications and individual \n     experience. It would be indexed to the salaries of similarly \n     qualified non-Department physicians, dentists, and health-\n     care executives at the entry, mid-career, and senior levels. \n     The flexibility of this tier allows VA to keep pace with the \n     market, both on upward and downward trends. VA would link the \n     market band for clinicians to AAMC faculty compensation. For \n     executives at the Chief of Staff (COS) level and above, the \n     benchmarks would be hospital and HMO executive compensation \n     levels. For dentists, the benchmark will be American Dental \n     Association (ADA) net private practice income.\n       Third Tier--Performance Pay. The third band will be linked \n     to performance, and would be paid for discrete achievements \n     in quality, productivity, and support of corporate goals. The \n     measures will be flexible and generally set locally; national \n     objectives could also be mandated. VA facilities may \n     authorize performance pay of up to $10,000 for physicians and \n     dentists below the Chief of Staff (COS) level. For managers \n     at the COS level and above, ten percent of their benchmarked \n     pay would be at risk, and would be payable to the extent that \n     performance goals are met. This will address a concern that \n     has been raised by the General Accounting Office and others \n     of a disconnect between employees' performance and their pay.\n       The draft bill also would prohibit senior title 38 \n     officials at the Chief of Staff level and above from \n     receiving any compensation, whether from employment or \n     contract, and from accepting any offers of future employment, \n     from medical schools affiliated with their respective VAMCs. \n     This prohibition will reduce the risk of potential conflicts \n     of interest, and will ensure that the Department's interests \n     in agreements with affiliated medical schools are adequately \n     protected. It is highly desirable to have an independent \n     senior clinical official at each facility. VA's \n     implementation of the bill will increase executive \n     compensation to a level that would offset any loss of outside \n     income resulting from this provision. In limited \n     circumstances, the Secretary could suspend or waive this \n     prohibition.\n\n\n                  Details of VA's Implementation Plan\n\n       Salary benchmarks will be set at the national level and \n     communicated to networks. Local facilities would set pay \n     levels within a range (10 percent of the \n     benchmark) according to local circumstances. Any decision to \n     set pay outside the 10-percent band will require higher-level \n     approval.\n       Benchmark salaries will be set for each specialty and \n     location, at entry, mid-career, and senior levels. Increments \n     and graduated benchmarks will be set to reflect varying \n     levels of experience and to provide for reasonable income \n     growth over a period of time.\n       VA will use ADA net private practice income to set VA \n     dentist salary benchmarks. About 93 percent of all practicing \n     dentists are employed in private practice, so VA's primary \n     competition in the marketplace is private practice income.\n       Specific amounts of each tier and the total payable for \n     each clinician will be set at the local level. This continues \n     the VA practice of local pay setting based on national policy \n     (used for physician and dentist special pay, nurse locality \n     pay system, and special salary rates):\n       This proposal will greatly enhance VA's ability to compete \n     for the full range of skilled medical and dental services at \n     the most reasonable cost. VA will be able to offer \n     competitive compensation to full-time, part-time, or \n     occasional staff, or pay on contract, according to the most \n     clinically appropriate and efficient option.\n       This proposed physician and dentist pay aligns with the \n     President's budget and would be effective on the first day of \n     the first pay period on or after the later of April 1, 2004, \n     or six months after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                                Examples\n\n       An example of how this system will work for Internal \n     Medicine:\n\n     VA internist with 10 years of experience, 2003: $142,682; \n         AAMC Associate Professor median salary, 2001-2002: \n         $142,000; Benchmark for VA Salary (10% of \n         AAMC): $127,800-156,200; Targeted Increase: $0-$13,518.\n\n       An example of how this system will work for Therapeutic \n     Radiologists:\n\n     VA radiologist with 10 years of experience, 2003: $190,682; \n         AAMC Associate Professor median salary, 2001-2002: \n         $248,000; Benchmark for VA Salary (10% of \n         AAMC): $223,200-272,800; Targeted Increase: $32,518-\n         82,118.\n\n       An example of how this system will work for General \n     Dentists:\n\n     VA general dentist with 10 years of experience, 2003: \n         $131,682; ADA net private practice income (minus \n         benefits), 2002: $134,928; Benchmark for VA Salary \n         (10% of ADA): $121,435-148,421; Targeted \n         Increase $0-$16,739.\n\n\n                        Estimated Costs/Savings\n\n       VA estimates the first year costs to be $69.42 million, \n     with ten-year costs of $1.59 billion. There are expected \n     savings from productivity and the avoidance of costly \n     specialty contracts resulting from more competitive pay. The \n     net first year costs are $48.47 million, with net ten-years \n     costs of $636.25 million. A detailed explanation is in the \n     attached charts.\n\n                        Enhancements for Nurses\n\n       Over the next several years the projected increase in the \n     number of aging veterans and increased enrollment in the VA \n     healthcare system by veterans of all ages will increase \n     workload across the VA healthcare system. Between 2000 and \n     2010, the number of veterans age 75 and above will increase \n     from 4 million to 4.5 million and within that number, those \n     veterans age 85 and older will triple from 422,000 to 1.3 \n     million. Veteran enrollees in the VA healthcare system will \n     increase from approximately 6 million in FY 2002, to \n     approximately 7.75 million in FY 2007. This increasing and \n     aging population of veterans will exhibit higher comorbidity \n     and require more comprehensive care both as inpatients and as \n     outpatients.\n       At the same time, national nursing leaders and healthcare \n     organizations project a shortage of registered nurses that \n     will be unlike any experienced in the past. Changes in \n     healthcare delivery requiring larger numbers of professional \n     nurses to perform increasingly complex functions in hospitals \n     and the community has heightened the demand for professional \n     nurses. Given the aging of the current registered nurse \n     workforce (average age nationally, 45.2 yrs., in VA, 46 \n     yrs.), and the decreasing number of students who choose \n     nursing as a career, the future availability of professional, \n     registered nurses (RN) will be insufficient to meet our \n     national healthcare needs. Negative perceptions of nursing as \n     a profession (i.e., perceived negative work environment and \n     pay inequities between nurses and a wide range of alternative \n     career options that require less education and have less \n     responsibility) have exacerbated this situation. VA already \n     is experiencing some staffing difficulties. VA's nurse \n     vacancy and turnover rates have greatly increased since 1998. \n     VA must better position itself to attract the nurses to meet \n     current and future healthcare needs.\n       Nurse shortages, complex healthcare environments and \n     growing administrative demands require highly skilled nurse \n     executives at facility and national levels with the knowledge \n     and experience to develop responsive care delivery models in \n     an ever-changing healthcare environment. VA nursing \n     leadership must be highly qualified and capable of \n     implementing cutting edge, innovative changes. Current VA pay \n     for nurse executives is not comparable to private sector pay \n     and perquisites. As a result, VA often is not in a position \n     to hire and retain nurse executives with exceptional skills. \n     The current pay structure offers little or no incentive for \n     current VA nurse executives and potential nurse leaders to \n     take on progressively more responsible and complex \n     assignments. Moreover, the current VA pay structure is \n     generally not attractive to highly skilled and experienced \n     non-VA nurse executives.\n       Approximately 55 percent of all VA Nurse Executives are \n     eligible for retirement by 2005; 69 percent will be eligible \n     by 2008. In addition, 35 percent of all current VA registered \n     nurses are eligible to retire by 2005. When coupled with the \n     national shortage, this potential loss of nurses could \n     jeopardize VA's ability to accomplish its healthcare mission.\n       Thus, we propose legislation enabling VA medical centers \n     (VAMCs) to offer flexible tours, and establishing a nurse \n     executive special pay program.\n\n\n                             Flexible Tours\n\n       The proposed legislation would authorize VA to offer \n     registered nurses the following flexible tours:\n       (1) three 12-hour tours (36 hours) in a workweek paid as 40 \n     hours;\n       (2) 7 ten-hour days/7 days off in a pay period, with pay \n     for 80 hours;\n       (3) 9 months of work with 3 months off, with pay \n     apportioned over a 12-month period.\n       Inflexibility in work schedules is a major cause of \n     dissatisfaction in nurse employment. A 2000 survey conducted \n     by the American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE), \n     found that after salary, the top benefit sought by nurses was \n     ``flexible scheduling and control over shifts.'' Providing \n     different options for scheduling would be a way of bringing \n     more nurses into the workplace and retaining their services.\n       VAMCs across the country must compete in local employment \n     markets that offer a variety of flexible working schedules \n     and pay practices to professional nurses. Such options are \n     popular among nurses because it allows them to accommodate \n     individual lifestyles and personal obligations. The proposed \n     changes would allow VAMCs to implement flexible pay and work-\n     schedule options common in many job markets. The ability to \n     offer options comparable to those offered by their \n     competitors would enhance VAMCs'\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\n     ability to remain competitive employers. These flexible nurse \n     tour proposals align with the President's budget and would be \n     effective on the first day of the first pay period on or \n     after the later of April 1, 2004, or six months after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n\n                      Nurse Executive Special Pay\n\n       The proposed legislation also would authorize VA to approve \n     special pay to the nurse executive at each VA medical center \n     or VA Central Office. The special pay would range from a \n     minimum of $10,000 to a maximum of $25,000, based on factors \n     such as the grade of the nurse executive, the scope and \n     complexity of the nurse executive position, the nurse \n     executive's personal qualifications, the characteristics of \n     the of the healthcare facility, e.g., tertiary, single site \n     or multi-site, nature and number of specialty care units, \n     demonstrated recruitment and retention difficulties, and such \n     other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       This proposed nurse executive pay aligns with the \n     President's budget and would be effective on the first day of \n     the first pay period on or after the later of April 1, 2004, \n     or six months after the date of enactment.\n       There are significant inadequacies in the VA nurse locality \n     pay system (LPS) as it relates to nurse executive \n     compensation. There are difficulties in obtaining comparative \n     survey data on non-VA nurse executive positions to use in \n     making an informed determination concerning locality pay. \n     Non-VA employers often do not cooperate in the survey \n     process. Nurse executive positions are often one-of-a-kind \n     positions making it difficult to match VA and non-VA jobs. \n     Non-VA employers typically do not include nurse executives in \n     compensation surveys. With the organizational changes and \n     scope of responsibilities changes for nurse executives \n     occurring in both VA and non-VA healthcare facilities, lines \n     of authority and levels of responsibilities for executive \n     nurses are changing. Thus, job and pay matching for nurse \n     executives at VAMCs and non-VA healthcare facilities is \n     extremely difficult. Furthermore, nurse executives work in a \n     national labor market, or at least a regional one. LPS \n     compares jobs on a local basis. Another major problem is that \n     VA nurse executives are capped at Level V of the Executive \n     Schedule (EL-V), $125,400. There is no such cap in the non-VA \n     healthcare industry. The EL-V rate is no longer competitive \n     with non-VA nurse executive positions. Moreover, non-VA \n     employers negotiate nurse executive compensation as a total \n     compensation package, often including bonuses and other \n     incentives in addition to base pay. VA is unable to do that.\n       The proposal derives from a recommendation of the VHA \n     Future Nursing Workforce Planning Group. This group, composed \n     of Medical Center Administrators, Nurse Executives, Network \n     Managers and clinicians, has identified the $10,000-$25,000 \n     range as the amount that most commonly would mirror salary \n     and/or community based prerequisites of non-VA nurse \n     executives, while not making VA the pay leader within the \n     community. It is also consistent with the range of special \n     pay currently available to VA physician executives.\n       Responsibilities of VA nurse executives are rapidly \n     changing and becoming more varied and complex. VA's pay \n     system for them must address this growing variety and \n     complexity.\n\n\n                                 Costs\n\n                             Flexible Tours\n\n       (1) Three 12-hour tours (36 hours) paid as 40 hours.\n       Assumptions: Based on a 36 hour work week/72 hours per pay \n     period for selected RNs. 40 hours/wk (Full-time) - 36 hours/\n     wk (Full-time requested) = 4.\n       Average VA RN hourly wage = $29.02 (using FY02 avg RN \n     salary = $56,679, adjusted by 3.2% annual pay increase = \n     $60,364, divided by 2,080).\n       Cost is 4 hours per week/208 hours per year per nurse.\n\n     Cost per RN per week: 4 $29.02 = $116.08; Cost per RN per \n         year: 208 $29.02 = $6036.\n\n       Based on an estimated 25 nurses per facility, the cost \n     would be as follows:\n\n     25 (RNs) $6036 = $150,900; 162 (VAMCs) $150,900 = $24.4 \n         million.\n\n       FY 2004 costs would be $12,222,900 (half-year \n     implementation).\n       Costs in future years increased by 3.2%.\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nFY05.............................................................$25.22\nFY06..............................................................26.03\nFY07..............................................................26.86\nFY08..............................................................27.72\nFY09..............................................................28.61\nFY10..............................................................29.53\nFY11..............................................................30.47\nFY12..............................................................31.45\nFY13..............................................................32.45\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n    Total (over 10 years).......................................$270.56\n       (2) 9 months of work with 3 months off, with pay \n     apportioned over a 12-month period.\n       This is an authorization to pay RNs who are hired under \n     this provision less than full time pay for full time worked. \n     RNs would work a full nine months prior to pay continuance \n     for 3 months.

         Analysis of Draft Bill\n\n       The first section provides a title for the bill, the \n     ``Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Personnel \n     Enhancement Act of 2003''.\n       Section 2 specifies that, unless otherwise expressly \n     provided, references throughout are to title 38, United \n     States Code.\n       Section 3 establishes a new pay system for VA physicians \n     and dentists.\n       Section 3(a)(1) amends section 7404(b)(1) to revise the \n     Physician and Dentist Schedule such that there now are two \n     grades: Physician grade and Dentist grade. It strikes \n     paragraph (2) as a conforming amendment as the Director and \n     Executive grades no longer exist.\n       Section 3(a)(2) strikes ``special'' before ``pay'' because \n     Section 3(a)(3) repeals the special pay provisions, but the \n     individuals concerned will still be paid under subchapter \n     Ill.\n       Section 3(a)(3) strikes existing Subchapter III in its \n     entirety and inserts in lieu thereof new sections 7431-7434:\n       Section 7431 establishes a new pay system for VHA \n     physicians and dentists composed of three tiers, base pay, \n     market pay, and performance pay. It additionally provides \n     that compensation under the new system shall be considered \n     pay for all purposes, that downward adjustments do not \n     constitute adverse actions, and that total pay may not exceed \n     that of the President. In order to reduce the risk of \n     potential conflicts of interest, this section also would \n     prohibit certain senior title 38 officials from receiving any \n     compensation, whether from employment or contract, from \n     medical schools affiliated with their respective VAMCs.\n       Section 7432 provides for transition to the new pay system: \n     written special pay agreements are terminated, but current \n     pay levels continue until the new provisions are implemented \n     on a date to be specified in VA regulations. Upon conversion \n     to the new system, incumbent employees will be paid at least \n     as much as they were paid under the old system. All pay under \n     the new system, except performance pay, as well as special \n     pay under the previous system, is fully creditable in \n     computing retirement benefits.\n       Section 7433 contains provisions for pay for the Under \n     Secretary for Health. In addition to base pay at Executive \n     Level III, the Under Secretary would be eligible for market \n     pay under the new system. The current Under Secretary's \n     written special pay agreements are terminated, but would \n     continue to be paid at current pay levels until the new \n     provisions are implemented on a date to be specified in VA \n     regulations. If a new Under Secretary were to be appointed \n     during the interim, he/she would be paid under current law \n     until a date to be specified in VA regulations.\n       Section 7434 contains several administrative provisions: \n     (a) the Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations; (b) \n     current employees will not have their pay reduced when they \n     move to the new system; (c) beginning eighteen months after \n     issuance of regulations implementing the new pay system and \n     annually thereafter for the next ten years, the Secretary \n     would be required to provide a report to the Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives \n     on the implementation of the new system.\n       Section 3(b) makes a conforming amendment to the title and \n     list of sections for Subchapter III in the table of sections \n     at the beginning of Chapter 74.\n       Section 4 provides for alternate work schedules.\n       Section 4(a) amends Chapter 74 to add a new section 7456a, \n     Alternate Work Schedules:\n       Section 7456(a) specifies that this section applies to \n     chapter 74 registered nurses.\n       Section 7456(b)(1) authorizes the Secretary, when necessary \n     to obtain or retain registered nurses at any Department \n     health-care facility, to provide for such nurses to work \n     three regularly scheduled 12-hour tours of duty within a \n     workweek, and for such tour to be considered for all purposes \n     (except computation of full-time equivalent employees for the \n     purposes of determining compliance with personnel ceilings) a \n     full 40-hour basic workweek.\n       Section 7456(b)(2) provides the formula for determining the \n     hourly rate, and sets forth rules for overtime pay.\n       Section 7456(c)(1) authorizes the Secretary, when necessary \n     to obtain or retain registered nurses at any Department \n     health-care facility, to provide for such nurses to\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\n     work seven regularly scheduled 10-hour tours of duty, with \n     seven days off duty, within a two-week pay period, and for \n     such tour to be considered for all purposes (except \n     computation of full-time equivalent employees for the \n     purposes of determining compliance with personnel ceilings) a \n     full 80-hour pay period.\n       Section 7456(c)(2) provides the formula for determining the \n     hourly rate, and sets forth rules for overtime pay.\n       Section 7456(d)(1) authorizes the Secretary to provide for \n     nurses to work full-time for 9 months with 3 months off, and \n     be paid at 75 percent of the full-time rate over a full 12-\n     month period over a fiscal year, and for employees working \n     such tours to be considered .75 full-time equivalent \n     employees. Service on this schedule shall be considered part-\n     time service for purposes of computing retirement benefits.\n       Section 7456(e) provides the formula for determining leave \n     charges for nurses working 36/40 or 7/7 work schedules.\n       Section 7456(f) directs the Secretary to prescribe \n     implementing regulations.\n       Section 4(b) makes a conforming amendment to the title and \n     list of sections for Subchapter IV in the table of sections \n     at the beginning of Chapter 74 to add new section 7456a.\n       Section 5 establishes special pay for VA nurse executives.\n       Section 5(a) adds a new subsection (f) to section 7452:\n       Subsection (f)(1) authorizes, when necessary to recruit or \n     retain nurse executives, special pay for the nurse executive \n     at each Department health-care facility or at Central Office.\n       Subsection (f)(2) sets the range of special pay to be a \n     minimum of $10,000 and a maximum of $25,000, and specifies \n     the factors in determining the amount paid to each nurse \n     executive.\n       Subsection (f)(3) specifies that special pay is in addition \n     to any other pay (including basic pay) and allowances to \n     which the nurse executive is entitled, and that it is be \n     considered pay for all purposes.\n       Section 6 sets the effective date for rates of pay \n     established pursuant to section 7431, as added by section \n     3(a), and sections 4 and 5, as the first day of the first pay \n     period on or after the later of April 1, 2004, or six months \n     after the date of enactment. All other provisions are \n     effective on the date of enactment.\n       Section 7 adds an administrative provision concerning \n     functions under chapter 74. It provides that functions of the \n     Secretary and other Department officers under chapter 74 are \n     vested in their discretion. The purpose of this provision is \n     to make clear that the exercise of those functions 5 U.S.C. \n     701(a)(2) exempts the exercise of those functions from \n     judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (by request):\n  S. 2485. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve and \nenhance the authorities of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs relating \nto the management and disposal of real property and facilities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have introduced today, at the request of the Secretary of \nVeterans' Affairs, S. 2485, a proposed bill to modify provisions of law \nrelating to the administration of real property assets by the \nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs, VA. The Secretary of Veterans' Affairs \nsubmitted the elements of this proposed legislation to the President of \nthe Senate by letters dated August 15, 2003, and October 3, 2003.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. In this case, however, I have departed \nfrom my usual course of simply introducing administration-advanced \nmeasures as forwarded to me. Measures that the administration forwarded \nin August and October, 2003, relate to similar subject matter, namely \nthe administration of VA-controlled real property assets. It is my \nbelief that these provisions, inasmuch as they are related, might be \nconsidered in a more orderly fashion as parts of a single piece of \nlegislation. To facilitate that, I have included sections 401-403 of \nthe administration's August 15, 2003, request, and sections 5-6 of the \nadministration's October 3, 2003, request, in the single bill which I \nhave introduced today. As is always my policy with respect to any such \n``by request'' legislation, I reserve the right to oppose the \nprovisions of, as well as any amendment to, this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES TO TITLE 38, UNITED STATES \n                   CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Real Property and Facilities Management \n     Improvement Act of 2004''.\n       (b) References to Title 38 United States Code.--Except as \n     otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an \n     amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, \n     or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \n     shall be considered to be made to a section or other \n     provision of title 38, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO USE PROJECT FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT OR \n                   RELOCATE SURFACE PARKING INCIDENTAL TO A \n                   CONSTRUCTION OR NON-RECURRING MAINTENANCE \n                   PROJECT.\n\n       Section 8109 is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(j) Funds in a construction account or capital account \n     that are available for a construction project or non-\n     recurring maintenance project may be used for the \n     construction or relocation of a surface parking lot \n     incidental to such project.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENTS OF ENHANCED-USE LEASE AUTHORITIES.\n\n       (a) Business Plan Criteria.--Section 8162 is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)(B), by striking ``the Under \n     Secretary for Health for applying the consideration under \n     such a lease to the provision of medical care and services'' \n     and inserting ``one of the Under Secretaries for applying the \n     consideration under such a lease to the programs and \n     activities of the Department''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(4)(A), by striking ``on the leased \n     property''.\n       (b) Consideration of Proposals for Leases.--(1) Section \n     8163 is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by striking the first sentence and \n     inserting the following new sentence: ``If the Secretary \n     proposes to enter into an enhanced-use lease with respect to \n     certain property, the Secretary shall conduct a public \n     hearing before entering into the lease.'';\n       (B) in subsection (b), by striking ``of the proposed \n     designation and of the hearing'' in the matter preceding \n     paragraph (1) and inserting ``on the proposed lease and the \n     hearing to the congressional veterans' affairs committees and \n     to the public''; and\n       (C) in subsection (c)--\n       (i) in paragraph (1)--\n       (I) by striking ``to designate the property involved'' and \n     inserting ``to enter into an enhanced-use lease of the \n     property involved''; and\n       (II) by striking ``to so designate the property'' and \n     inserting ``to enter into the lease'';\n       (ii) in paragraph (2), by striking ``90-day'' and inserting \n     ``45-day''; and\n       (iii) by striking paragraph (4).\n       (2)(A) The heading of such section is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 8163.

Proposals for property to be leased.''.\n\n       (c) Disposal Authority.--Section 8164 is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``by requesting the Administrator of \n     General Services to dispose of the property pursuant to \n     subsection (b)''; and\n       (B) by striking the last sentence;\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by striking ``and the Administrator of General Services \n     jointly determine'' and inserting ``determines''; and\n       (B) by striking ``and the Administrator consider'' and \n     inserting ``considers''; and\n       (3) in subsection (c), by striking ``90 days'' and \n     inserting ``45 days''.\n       (d) Use of Proceeds.--Section 8165 is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Funds received'' and \n     inserting ``Except as provided in paragraph (2), funds \n     received'';\n       (B) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3);\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new \n     paragraph (2):\n       ``(2) Funds received by the Department under an enhanced-\n     use lease implementing a business plan proposed by the Under \n     Secretary for Benefits or the Under Secretary for Memorial \n     Affairs and remaining after any deduction from such funds \n     under subsection (b) shall be credited to applicable \n     appropriations of the Veterans Benefits Administration or \n     National Cemetery Administration, as the case may be.''; and\n       (D) in paragraph (3), as so redesignated, by striking \n     ``nursing home revolving fund'' and inserting ``Capital Asset \n     Fund established under section 8122A of this title'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(b)''\n       (B) in paragraph (1), as so designated, by striking ``for \n     that fiscal year''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) The Secretary may also deduct from the proceeds of \n     any enhanced-use lease an amount to reimburse applicable \n     appropriations of the Department for any expenses incurred by \n     the Secretary in the development\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\n     of additional enhanced-use leases.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve and \nenhance education, housing, employment, medical, and other benefits for \nveterans and to improve and extend certain authorities relating to the \nadministration of benefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation which I have introduced today which would, among other \nthings, improve the education and housing benefits of our Nation's \nveterans. Education and housing benefits administered by the Department \nof Veterans Affairs, VA, were the essence of one of the most \nsignificant pieces of legislation in the 20th Century, the 1944 GI Bill \nof Rights. Sixty years later, the Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act \nof 2004, which I introduce today, would build on that historic legacy.\n  Section 101 of the bill would allow for significant increases in \nMontgomery GI Bill, MGIB, educational assistance benefits by expanding \non ``buy up'' legislation which I authored in 1999 and which was \nenacted as part of Public Law 106-419. Under the provisions of the \nexisting ``buy up'' program, active duty service members can increase \ntheir monthly MGIB ``pay-out'' by making voluntary in-service \ncontributions of up to $600 in addition to the $1,200 aggregate \ncontribution which is made to secure basic eligibility for MGIB \nbenefits. In return for this added $600 ``investment,'' a veteran can \nsecure an increase in his or her monthly MGIB benefit of $150 per \nmonth. Assuming the veteran completes a 36-month course of full-time \nstudy, the added benefit amount to $5,400, an effective yield of $9 for \nevery added dollar contributed. The legislation which I have introduced \ntoday would expand the ``buy-up'' program by allowing service members \nto voluntarily contribute more--up to $2000--to the program, in return \nfor which they could ``buy'' up to an additional $18,000--or $500 per \nmonth over 36 months--in potential MGIB benefits. A service member who \ncontributes the full $2,000 could thus increase his or her aggregate \nMGIB entitlement to $53,460, the amount that the College Board, an \nassociation of over 4,000 colleges and other educational organizations, \nestimates is necessary today to finance the average cost of tuition, \nfees, books, room and board, transportation, and expenses for a \nresident student at a four-year public institution of higher learning.\n  Section 102 of this bill would authorize VA to carry out a 4-year \npilot program under which veterans could extend, for up to 2 years, \ntheir eligibility period to use MGIB education benefits. Current law \nstates, in summary, that a veteran is entitled to 36 months of MGIB \nbenefit, but only during a 10-year ``delimiting period'' beginning on \nthe date of discharge from service. Section 102 of my bill would allow \na veteran with a ``left-over'' entitlement to apply for a one-time \nextension of the delimiting period so that he or she might gain \nvocational or job readiness skills necessary to obtain or maintain \nemployment. I believe that as the workforce evolves, so too must \nworkers in order to stay competitive. Providing veterans with some \nflexibility in the use of a benefit they have earned--at a point in \nlife beyond the ``delimiting period''--is a sensible approach to \nhelping veterans obtain the skills they may need to stay competitive in \na 21st Century workforce.\n  Section 103 of this legislation would prohibit veterans' education \nbenefits from being considered when determining a veteran's entitlement \nto Federal financial aid administered by the Department of Education. \nUnder current law, such benefits are already excluded from eligibility \ncalculations in determining eligibility for some forms of assistance \ngranted by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, e.g., Pell \ngrants and subsidized Stafford loans, but not for other forms of \nassistance, e.g., unsubsidized Stafford loans and campus-based aid. \nThis legislation would rectify that anomaly by excluding veterans' \neducation benefits from all such eligibility determinations.\n  Section 104 of the bill would fix yet another anomaly of law \napplicable to Reservists who are called to active duty. Current law \ngenerally specifies that such Reservists are eligible for MGIB benefits \nif they have served a minimum of 2 consecutive years of active duty. \nCurrent law also requires that service members contribute $100 a month \nduring their first 12 months of service to gain eligibility for MGIB \nbenefits. Because the Department of Defense (DoD) activates Reservists \nfor indefinite periods of time, it is impossible for a Reservist to \nknow at the beginning of his or her activation period--when a decision \nhas to be made on contributing the requisite $100 per month--whether he \nor she will, in fact, end up serving 2 consecutive years of active duty \nand, thus, whether he or she will become eligible for MGIB benefits. \nDue to that uncertainty, activated Reservists are, quite reasonably, \nhesitant to make the requisite contributions. The DoD and VA have \nworked around this problem; they permit Reservists who end up serving 2 \nconsecutive years to pay the $1,200 contribution at some later point--\nbut the law does not explicitly authorize that allowance. This \nlegislation would update the law to authorize these ``late'' \ncontributions.\n\n  Section 201 of this legislation would increase the maximum amount of \nthe VA home loan guaranty from $60,000 to $83,425. A guaranty of \n$60,000 allows a veteran to purchase, without a down payment, a home \nwith a value of four times that amount, or $240,000. In many areas of \nthe country, the median cost of housing is over $300,000, effectively \nlimiting the utility of this benefit. This legislation would raise the \nVA guaranty limit to make the effective amount of a VA loan equal to \nthe so-called conforming loan rate in the non-VA secondary mortgage \nmarkets.\n  Sections 202 and 203 of this bill would expand on legislation I \nauthored in 2002 that added a pilot adjustable rate mortgage, ARM, \nfeature to VA's loan guaranty program. Currently, the pilot program, \nwhich expires on September 30, 2005, allows VA to guarantee only so-\ncalled ``hybrid'' ARMs. Even then, restrictive adjustment caps have \neffectively limited the program to only one type of hybrid ARM \nfinancing. This bill would give VA permanent authority to guaranty a \nfull range of ARM financing, to include traditional 1-year ARMs and \nhybrid ARMs with interest rates fixed for periods of 3, 5, 7, or 10 \nyears, consistent with the ARM provisions of the National Housing Act. \nI believe the housing benefit for veterans should, at the very least, \nequal that of benefits available for non-veterans through the FHA \nprogram.\n  Section 204 of this legislation resurrects legislation that was \napproved by the Senate during the 106th Congress, but which failed to \npass the House. Current law mandates that VA collect a funding fee when \nveterans obtain a loan with a VA guaranty, but it also allows for a \nwaiver of the funding fee if the veteran seeking housing assistance has \nsuffered a service-connected disability. For the funding fee to be \nwaived under current law, however, the veteran must already be \nreceiving compensation, an event which can only occur after the service \nmember has been discharged from service. Because VA has a presence at \nover 136 military discharge sites (where it conducts pre-discharge \nmedical examinations), it is common for someone who is still in service \nto be adjudged disabled by VA. But because such a service member cannot \nyet receive veterans' compensation, VA cannot waive the funding fee \neven though an active-duty service can make use of his or her \nentitlement to a VA-guaranteed home loan while still in\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\nservice. This legislation would rectify that situation by, \nprospectively, allowing VA to waive funding fees for active duty \nservice members who are eligible to receive compensation as a result of \na pre-discharge examinations, but who are not yet discharged from \nservice.\n  Section 301 of this legislation would rectify what I perceive to be \nan unintended oversight of the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of \n1998. That statute granted Federal job preferences to two classes of \nveterans--those who are ``preference eligible'' due to service during \nwartime or because of service-connected disability, and those who \nserved on active duty for at least three years. The statute also \nauthorized administrative and judicial redress but, by oversight, it \nlimited such redress to the ``preference eligible'' class of veterans \nonly. This legislation would extend current remedies to all veterans \nwho are eligible for Federal job preferences.\n  Section 311 of this legislation would prohibit the collection of co-\npayments from veterans receiving VA-provided hospice care. The \nrequirement for co-payments for hospice care is, I think, unduly \nburdensome in cases where the end of life is near. The Bush \nadministration concurs; it requested this exemption in its fiscal year \n2005 budget proposal. I am glad to advance this provision on behalf of \nthe President.\n  Section 321 of this bill would extend three non-controversial \nstatutory authorities that are now scheduled to expire. The first would \nextend, until 2009, the requirement that the VA's Advisory Committee on \nFormer Prisoners of War submit a biennial report of its recommendations \nfor improvements to benefits afforded to former prisoners of war. The \nsecond would make permanent VA authority to provide counseling and \ntreatment services to veterans who have experienced sexual trauma while \nin service. The third would extend, until December 31, 2009, a \nreporting requirement imposed on VA's Special Medical Advisory Group. \nFinally, Section 331 of my legislation would update the definition of \nminority group members for purposes of the work of VA's Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Veterans.\n  Mr. President, the principal thrust of this legislation is to improve \nand modernize aspects of VA education and housing programs which were \nfirst conceived 60 years ago. These improvements, and others contained \nin this bill, merit the support of the Senate. I request that support, \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AMERICA'S NATIONAL WORLD WAR \n                   I MUSEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, \n     was built in 1926 in honor of those individuals who served in \n     World War I in defense of liberty and the Nation.\n       (2) The Liberty Memorial Association, a nonprofit \n     organization which originally built the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum, is responsible for the finances, operations, and \n     collections management of the Liberty Memorial Museum.\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\n       (3) The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum \n     in the Nation that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the experiences of the United States and its \n     allies in the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the \n     battlefield and on the home front.\n       (4) The Liberty Memorial Museum project began after the \n     1918 Armistice through the efforts of a large-scale, grass-\n     roots civic and fundraising effort by the citizens and \n     veterans of the Kansas City metropolitan area. After the \n     conclusion of a national architectural design competition, \n     ground was broken in 1921, construction began in 1923, and \n     the Liberty Memorial Museum was opened to the public in 1926.\n       (5) In 1994, the Liberty Memorial Museum closed for a \n     massive restoration and expansion project. The restored \n     museum reopened to the public on Memorial Day, 2002, during a \n     gala rededication ceremony.\n       (6) Exhibits prepared for the original museum buildings \n     presaged the dramatic, underground expansion of core \n     exhibition gallery space, with over 30,000 square feet of new \n     interpretive and educational exhibits currently in \n     development. The new exhibits, along with an expanded \n     research library and archives, will more fully utilize the \n     many thousands of historical objects, books, maps, posters, \n     photographs, diaries, letters, and reminiscences of World War \n     I participants that are preserved for posterity in the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum's collections. The new core \n     exhibition is scheduled to open on Veterans Day, 2006.\n       (7) The City of Kansas City, the State of Missouri, and \n     thousands of private donors and philanthropic foundations \n     have contributed millions of dollars to build and later to \n     restore this national treasure. The Liberty Memorial Museum \n     continues to receive the strong support of residents from the \n     States of Missouri and Kansas and across the Nation.\n       (8) Since the restoration and rededication of 2002, the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum has attracted thousands of visitors \n     from across the United States and many foreign countries.\n       (9) There remains a need to preserve in a museum setting \n     evidence of the honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifice of \n     those Americans who offered their services and who gave their \n     lives in defense of liberty during World War I, evidence of \n     the roles of women and African Americans during World War I, \n     and evidence of other relevant subjects.\n       (10) The Liberty Memorial Museum seeks to educate a diverse \n     group of audiences through its comprehensive collection of \n     historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the \n     participants on the battlefield and the home front and the \n     impact of World War I on individuals, then and now. The \n     Liberty Memorial Museum continues to actively acquire and \n     preserve such materials.\n       (11) A great opportunity exists to use the invaluable \n     resources of the Liberty Memorial Museum to teach the \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' to the Nation's schoolchildren through \n     on-site visits, classroom curriculum development, distance \n     learning, and other educational initiatives.\n       (12) The Liberty Memorial Museum should always be the \n     Nation's museum of the national experience in the World War I \n     years (1914-1918), where people go to learn about this \n     critical period and where the Nation's history of this \n     monumental struggle will be preserved so that generations of \n     the 21st century may understand the role played by the United \n     States in the preservation and advancement of democracy, \n     freedom, and liberty in the early 20th century.\n       (13) This initiative to recognize and preserve the history \n     of the Nation's sacrifices in World War I will take on added \n     significance as the Nation approaches the centennial \n     observance of this event.\n       (14) It is fitting and proper to refer to the Liberty \n     Memorial Museum as ``America's National World War I Museum''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, \n     Missouri, including the museum's future and expanded \n     exhibits, collections, library, archives, and educational \n     programs, as ``America's National World War I Museum'';\n       (2) recognizes that the continuing collection, \n     preservation, and interpretation of the historical objects \n     and other historical materials held by the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum enhance the knowledge and understanding of the \n     Nation's people of the American and allied experience during \n     the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the battlefield \n     and on the home front;\n       (3) commends the ongoing development and visibility of \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' educational outreach programs for \n     teachers and students throughout the Nation; and\n       (4) encourages the need for present generations to \n     understand the magnitude of World War I, how it shaped the \n     Nation, other countries, and later world events, and how the \n     sacrifices made then helped preserve liberty, democracy, and \n     other founding principles for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3252.

As a result, local educational \n     agencies are being severely impacted by increased student-age \n     populations.\n       (5) Local educational agencies are struggling under \n     increasing financial burdens as a result of State budget cuts \n     that have reduced the rate of growth for education spending \n     to its lowest point since the 1990-1991 recession and this \n     burden is exacerbated by a stagnate Federal education budget \n     that actually cuts total education funding in fiscal year \n     2006 through fiscal year 2009 by $5,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Department of the Army should support, through a \n     dedicated fund, the construction of schools in local \n     educational agencies whose student populations are severely \n     impacted by housing developed through the Residential \n     Communities Initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3256.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AMERICA'S NATIONAL WORLD WAR \n                   I MUSEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, \n     was built in 1926 in honor of those individuals who served in \n     World War I in defense of liberty and the Nation.\n       (2) The Liberty Memorial Association, a nonprofit \n     organization which originally built the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum, is responsible for the finances, operations, and \n     collections management of the Liberty Memorial Museum.\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\n       (3) The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum \n     in the Nation that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the experiences of the United States and its \n     allies in the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the \n     battlefield and on the home front.\n       (4) The Liberty Memorial Museum project began after the \n     1918 Armistice through the efforts of a large-scale, grass-\n     roots civic and fundraising effort by the citizens and \n     veterans of the Kansas City metropolitan area. After the \n     conclusion of a national architectural design competition, \n     ground was broken in 1921, construction began in 1923, and \n     the Liberty Memorial Museum was opened to the public in 1926.\n       (5) In 1994, the Liberty Memorial Museum closed for a \n     massive restoration and expansion project. The restored \n     museum reopened to the public on Memorial Day, 2002, during a \n     gala rededication ceremony.\n       (6) Exhibits prepared for the original museum buildings \n     presaged the dramatic, underground expansion of core \n     exhibition gallery space, with over 30,000 square feet of new \n     interpretive and educational exhibits currently in \n     development. The new exhibits, along with an expanded \n     research library and archives, will more fully utilize the \n     many thousands of historical objects, books, maps, posters, \n     photographs, diaries, letters, and reminiscences of World War \n     I participants that are preserved for posterity in the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum's collections. The new core \n     exhibition is scheduled to open on Veterans Day, 2006.\n       (7) The City of Kansas City, the State of Missouri, and \n     thousands of private donors and philanthropic foundations \n     have contributed millions of dollars to build and later to \n     restore this national treasure. The Liberty Memorial Museum \n     continues to receive the strong support of residents from the \n     States of Missouri and Kansas and across the Nation.\n       (8) Since the restoration and rededication of 2002, the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum has attracted thousands of visitors \n     from across the United States and many foreign countries.\n       (9) There remains a need to preserve in a museum setting \n     evidence of the honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifice of \n     those Americans who offered their services and who gave their \n     lives in defense of liberty during World War I, evidence of \n     the roles of women and African Americans during World War I, \n     and evidence of other relevant subjects.\n       (10) The Liberty Memorial Museum seeks to educate a diverse \n     group of audiences through its comprehensive collection of \n     historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the \n     participants on the battlefield and the home front and the \n     impact of World War I on individuals, then and now. The \n     Liberty Memorial Museum continues to actively acquire and \n     preserve such materials.\n       (11) A great opportunity exists to use the invaluable \n     resources of the Liberty Memorial Museum to teach the \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' to the Nation's schoolchildren through \n     on-site visits, classroom curriculum development, distance \n     learning, and other educational initiatives.\n       (12) The Liberty Memorial Museum should always be the \n     Nation's museum of the national experience in the World War I \n     years (1914-1918), where people go to learn about this \n     critical period and where the Nation's history of this \n     monumental struggle will be preserved so that generations of \n     the 21st century may understand the role played by the United \n     States in the preservation and advancement of democracy, \n     freedom, and liberty in the early 20th century.\n       (13) This initiative to recognize and preserve the history \n     of the Nation's sacrifices in World War I will take on added \n     significance as the Nation approaches the centennial \n     observance of this event.\n       (14) It is fitting and proper to refer to the Liberty \n     Memorial Museum as ``America's National World War I Museum''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, \n     Missouri, including the museum's future and expanded \n     exhibits, collections, library, archives, and educational \n     programs, as ``America's National World War I Museum'';\n       (2) recognizes that the continuing collection, \n     preservation, and interpretation of the historical objects \n     and other historical materials held by the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum enhance the knowledge and understanding of the \n     Nation's people of the American and allied experience during \n     the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the battlefield \n     and on the home front;\n       (3) commends the ongoing development and visibility of \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' educational outreach programs for \n     teachers and students throughout the Nation; and\n       (4) encourages the need for present generations to \n     understand the magnitude of World War I, how it shaped the \n     Nation, other countries, and later world events, and how the \n     sacrifices made then helped preserve liberty, democracy, and \n     other founding principles for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3252.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING RESIDENTIAL \n                   COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\n       (1) There are approximately 750,000 school-aged children of \n     members of the active duty Armed Forces in the United States.\n       (2) Approximately 650,000 of those students are currently \n     being served in public schools across the United States.\n       (3) The Department of the Army has embarked on a housing \n     initiative, the Residential Communities Initiative, which \n     will result in 70,770 new family housing units at 34 \n     installations and a corresponding increase in the number of \n     school-aged children housed at those installations.\n       (4) The Secretary of the Army is authorized to include new \n     school facilities in privatized housing contracts; however, \n     the Secretary of the Army has not been using this authority \n     to its fullest advantage. As a result, local educational \n     agencies are being severely impacted by increased student-age \n     populations.\n       (5) Local educational agencies are struggling under \n     increasing financial burdens as a result of State budget cuts \n     that have reduced the rate of growth for education spending \n     to its lowest point since the 1990-1991 recession and this \n     burden is exacerbated by a stagnate Federal education budget \n     that actually cuts total education funding in fiscal year \n     2006 through fiscal year 2009 by $5,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Department of the Army should support, through a \n     dedicated fund, the construction of schools in local \n     educational agencies whose student populations are severely \n     impacted by housing developed through the Residential \n     Communities Initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3256.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6296-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the DOD authorization bill.\n  Earlier today we were able to lock in a final list of first-degree \namendments to the bill. While this will help Senators Warner and Levin \nbegin working on a schedule for the consideration of amendments, I was \ndisappointed the list included, unfortunately, 200 possible amendments. \nI encourage Senators on both sides of the aisle to show restraint in \noffering amendments. Nothing requires all 200 of those amendments, in \nfact, be offered. With everyone's cooperation, we should be able to \nfinish this bill this week.\n  With that being said, the chairman and ranking member will be here \ntomorrow working through those amendments. We do expect rollcall votes \nthroughout the day tomorrow in relation to these amendments and \nSenators will be notified when the first vote is scheduled.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my distinguished colleague will yield for \nme to comment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are so grateful we are now moving to the \nDefense bill, getting off the cloture vote. This was a good move. We \nappreciate that very much.\n  Realistically, we have about 140 amendments. The majority has over 90 \namendments. That is a lot of amendments. Many of the amendments, as we \nknow, will not be offered. There are a large number of irrelevant \namendments which are just a ``holder'' in case something comes up that \nis not anticipated. However, we still have scores of amendments that \npeople will offer. A number of these amendments, the managers will work \nthrough and we will be able to dispose of one way or the other.\n  However, we are not going to finish the bill Thursday. There is an \nimportant trip Members are taking to commemorate the anniversary of the \nNormandy invasion and a number of Senators will be leaving for that \nsometime Thursday evening, I understand.\n  I further note we will not be able to work on this bill Friday. That \nis my understanding, at least. Certainly there will not be any votes.\n  We want to work to finish this bill. As I mentioned earlier today, \nthere is not anything we can be more importantly engaged in than \nworking on this Defense bill. Yesterday, five soldiers were killed. We \nhave averaged two deaths a day for the last 2 months. We are \napproaching 5,000 of our military personnel who have been injured, many \nof those grievously injured.\n\n  We are going to be as cooperative as we can. This is a bill we want \nas much as the majority. That is why we raised this issue a week ago \nlast Friday and did not want to move off the Defense bill to go to the \nimportant class action legislation.\n  This may be our only opportunity to talk about this issue this year. \nI hope people are not thinking we were not cooperating. We cannot \nfinish it in 2 days. It is impossible, legislatively impossible. We \nshould get off that and understand that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the assistant Democratic leader has \nindicated we have had some casualties this week. It is also important \nto point out this is the smallest number of casualties of any major war \nin the history of the United States by far.\n  We just had an opportunity this past weekend to open the World War II \nMemorial and remember the over 400,000 Americans who were lost in that \ngreat conflict. It is impossible to fight the war on terrorism with no \ncasualties. We regret every single death and every single injury, but \ngiven the enormous task, we have already completed liberating over 50 \nmillion people in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. It has been done in an \nextraordinarily effective way with minimum loss of life on our side. We \nall agree our military forces are quite extraordinary in the task they \nare undertaking.\n  Speaking of World War II, in addition, tomorrow at 5 p.m., there will \nbe a reception honoring Senators Akaka, Hollings, Lautenberg, Inouye, \nStevens, and Warner, all of whom served in World War II. We will devote \nthe hour prior to the reception to speeches in the Senate honoring \ntheir service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/01/senate-section/article/S6296-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
