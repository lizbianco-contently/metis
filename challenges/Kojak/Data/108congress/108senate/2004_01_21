The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I look forward to having further \ndiscussions with the majority leader with regard to taking the next \nlegislative step with regard to the Omnibus bill. I am sure we will be \nable to reach some understanding as to how we might complete our work \non this legislation.\n  I do think it is important, as we said yesterday, for the Senate to \nfocus its attention on some of the issues we cited yesterday as real \npolicy concerns. There were procedural concerns about how we got here, \nbut the policy concerns are the ones that can be addressed and can be \nfixed. If we are not able to fix them in this legislation, I certainly \nwant to assure my colleagues we will look for other vehicles and other \nways to address each of these issues over the course of the next \nseveral weeks and months.\n  I will have more to say about that later in the day, but I will \ncertainly work with our majority leader in addressing the schedule and \nproviding options for ways in which we can complete our work on this \nbill perhaps this week.\n  I urge colleagues to recognize the opportunity the day presents to \ndiscuss some of these issues. I know there are many on our side who \nintend to do that. The time is equally divided. We certainly intend to \nuse the time that will be allocated to this side throughout the day to \ndiscuss many of these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the two leaders are here--I have not \nhad an opportunity to discuss this with either of them--floor staff has \nindicated when the majority leader finishes his statement Senator \nDorgan is here wishing to speak. Following that, Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland would like to speak, and then Senator Boxer. We understand if \nthere are Republicans, we will alternate, but I wanted to give them the \nroll of those who indicated they would like to come prior to Senator \nByrd and Senator McCain speaking this afternoon.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we can talk during the speeches, but my \nunderstanding is we will alternate back and forth.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nnow proceed to consideration of S. Res. 285, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 284) recognizing 2004 as the ``50th \n     Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution commemorating the 50-year history of rock 'n' roll. Senator \nFrist, the sponsor of this resolution, and myself are both from the \nState where rock 'n' roll was born--Tennessee. On July 5, 1954, Elvis \nPresley recorded his first record, ``That's All Right,'' at the \nlegendary Sun Studio in Memphis and rock 'n' roll was officially born.\n  Memphis being the birthplace of rock 'n' roll should be of no \nsurprise, since rock 'n' roll isn't the first genre of music to be \nofficially born there. During the Civil War era another musical \ntradition was born from the sons and daughters who followed freedom up \nthe Mississippi River. The soul-wrenching folk melodies of black \nSoutherners laid the foundation for what would become the blues. \nMemphis has a vast history of being the center of American musical \ninnovation.\n  The heart of this music innovation is grounded in the cultural life \nof Beale Street. It was Beale Street where W.C. Handy, a wandering \nblack musician and composer, was the first to put down on paper the \nsometimes grim but always hopeful fix of field hollers, gospel songs, \ncotton-baling calls, and African tribal songs. Forty years later, Beale \nStreet and those same rhythms infected a young, aspiring musician named \nElvis Aaron Presley. Elvis Presley came to Sun Records to make a record \nfor his mother and ended up forever changing music and society.\n  Sun Studios is the place where Sam Philips created his Rockabilly \ndynasty with Carl Perkins, B.B. King, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Jerry \nLee Lewis and Elvis. Rock 'n' roll evolved in the 1950s from rhythm and \nblues, and was characterized by the use of electric guitars, a strong \nrhythm with an accent on the offbeat, and youth-oriented lyrics. Last \nJuly, Senator Frist and I joined Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton \nin a singing ceremony, which designated Sun Records recording studio as \na National Historic Landmark. Sun Records in Memphis, TN, is the true \nhome of the blues and the birthplace of rock 'n' roll.\n  No other city in the United States can claim equal influence on the \nmusic of this Nation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 285) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 285\n\n       Whereas Elvis Presley recorded ``That's All Right'' at Sam \n     Phillips' Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee, on July 5, 1954;\n       Whereas Elvis' recording of ``That's All Right'', with Bill \n     Black on bass and Scotty Moore on guitar, paved the way for \n     such subsequent Sun Studio hits as Carl Perkins' ``Blue Suede \n     Shoes'' (1955), Roy Orbison's ``Ooby Dooby'' (1956), and \n     Jerry Lee Lewis' ``Whole Lotta Shakin'' (1957)--catapulting \n     Sun Studio to the forefront of a musical revolution;\n       Whereas the recording in Memphis of the first rock 'n' roll \n     song came to define an era and forever change popular music;\n       Whereas the birth of rock 'n' roll was the convergence of \n     the diverse cultures and musical styles of the United States, \n     blending the blues with country, gospel, jazz, and soul \n     music;\n       Whereas the year 2004 provides an appropriate opportunity \n     for our nation to celebrate the birth of rock 'n' roll, and \n     the many streams of music that converged in Memphis to create \n     a truly American sound known throughout the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes 2004 as the 50th Anniversary of rock 'n' \n     roll;\n       (2) commemorates Sun Studio for recording the first rock \n     'n' roll record, ``That's All Right''; and\n       (3) expresses appreciation to Memphis for its contributions \n     to America's music heritage.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the resolution just agreed to is a \nresolution recognizing the year 2004 as the ``50th Anniversary of Rock \n'n' Roll.'' Indeed, it was 50 years ago in a small recording studio in \nMemphis, TN, that a young Elvis Presley recorded his first record. It \nwas called ``That's All Right.'' And at that point, rock 'n' roll was \nborn. That recording by legendary producer Sam Phillips at the now \nfamous Sun Studio in Memphis paved the way for such subsequent hits \nwhich titles we all know: Carl Perkins' ``Blue Suede Shoes'' in 1955, \nRoy Orbison's ``Ooby Dooby'' in 1956, and Jerry Lee Lewis's ``Whole \nLotta Shakin'' in 1957. These early hits catapulted Sun Studio and \nMemphis to the forefront of that musical revolution.\n  Throughout the 1950s, the unique sound, tremendous vision, and \nincredible talent coming out of Memphis, TN, with such artists as Elvis \nPresley, the ``King of Rock 'n' Roll,'' B. B. King, Johnny Cash, Jerry \nLee Lewis, and Carl Perkins, just to name a few, became the hallmark of \nthat Sun Studio and later the hallmark of American rock 'n' roll music.\n  Indeed, some of the most meaningful contributions to American music \nwere made at that Sun Studio. It is where our country, in many ways, \ncame together and spoke with a new, a uniquely American voice that was \nand still is heard around the world.\n  The fact that rock 'n' roll was born in Memphis is no coincidence. \nThat city's location on the banks of the Mississippi River made it a \nplace where the diverse cultures and musical styles of our Nation came \ntogether, where they converged, blending the blues with country and \nwith gospel and with jazz. That merging of cultures and styles \ncontinues today.\n  The year 2004 provides the opportunity for our Nation to celebrate \nthe birth of rock 'n' roll and those many streams of music that \nconverged in Memphis to create a truly American sound known throughout \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S62-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S62-S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at this juncture, on this second day of the \nnew session of the 108th Congress, I will spend a few moments reviewing \na bit but also looking ahead, setting the stage for what we are likely \nto expect in this body.\n  Last night, the President of the United States delivered a powerful \nchallenge to the U.S. Congress and to the American people. He told us \nthe state of the Union is strong and confident. The substance of the \ntalk last night reflected just that.\n  There is much to celebrate as we enter this second session of the \n108th Congress. Perhaps most important is the capture of Saddam \nHussein. It was only 1 month ago that the world woke up to those \nastonishing images--the President described it last night--of Saddam \nHussein in a hole and now in a cell. They were images of that dirty and \ndishevelled dictator emerging out of that spider hole.\n  Our brave and resourceful soldiers caught the ``butcher of Baghdad.'' \nAs the President said last night, Saddam Hussein now is in a cell, a \nmilitary prison, awaiting his fate. He will be brought to justice by \nthe Iraqi people whom he so mercilessly terrorized, and he will be \njudged as the entire world looks on.\n  Today, because of the war on terror, the capture of Saddam, the death \nof his two sons, and the destruction of his wicked regime, America and \nher allies are safer and more secure. As we enter the new year, we are \nalso stronger. America's vibrant economy is beginning once again to \nhum. The Federal Reserve confirms that the recovery we began to observe \nlast fall is gaining momentum each and every day. Worker production is \nup. Industrial production is up. Exports are on the rise. Home \nconstruction is booming. More Americans than ever own their own homes. \nTheir total household wealth is approaching historic highs. Businesses \nare investing. Manufacturing is at its highest level in 20 years. In \nshort, those tax cuts, those jobs and growth packages are working.\n  The first round of tax cuts indeed helped end that recession that \nbegan in the year 2000. The second round of tax cuts put America on a \npath to solid growth. Americans today have more money to save, invest, \nand spend as\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nthey, as individuals, choose. Business owners have more opportunities \ntoday to realize their entrepreneurial spirit and potential. America is \nmoving forward because President George Bush and the Republican-led \nCongress believed in that creativity, in that ingenuity, in that common \nsense of individuals, the American people. The risk-taking, willingness \nto invest, irrepressible optimism of the American people is in truth \nwhat has turned this economy around from recession to where today we \nare in the midst of the fastest growing economy in not just the last 5 \nyears, 10 years, or 15 years but the fastest growing economy in this \ncountry in the last 20 years, since 1984.\n  As the President pointed out last night, now is not the time to rest. \nWe cannot really rest until that economic recovery is complete. Every \nAmerican who is looking for work should be able to get a job and should \nbe able to get that work. Thus, we have to have smart pro growth fiscal \npolicy to lead this country to job creation.\n  Looking to the future--and our obligation is to look to the future--\nthere are critical structural problems that we in this body need to \ntake head on, not to shy away from but to go right after, to tackle \nhead on.\n\n  The one area that is critical to job growth--the President mentioned \nit last night--is tort reform. Over the last decade, class action \nlawsuits have exploded. State court class action filings have \nskyrocketed by over 1,300 percent in just the last 10 years. It is \nreally not just the statistic, not just the figure, but it is the \nresult. The result of this glut of claims is to clog our court system, \nour State courts. They simply cannot handle them all. It is inefficient \nin terms of government. It wastes taxpayer dollars. It stifles the \ninnovation to which I just referred. That innovation and that \nentrepreneurship that is so crucial to taking a growing economy and \ntranslating it into job growth is stifled, is shackled, is handcuffed \nby this glut of claims.\n  Last night the President also mentioned medical liability, another \naspect of tort reform. The President said ``frivolous lawsuits,'' and \nit was wonderful for me to see the Members of Congress stand up, but \nnow we need to act. We cannot just talk about it; we need to act. Those \nfrivolous lawsuits are exploding health insurance premiums. So when we \nare talking about the 44 million people uninsured, and we are talking \nabout the cost of insurance and frivolous lawsuits are driving those \npremiums sky high out of the reach of hard-working men and women, we \nmust respond. We must address it directly.\n  I encourage my colleagues to talk to their own doctors and ask them \nwhat the impact of this exploding malpractice, medical liability is \ndoing to their own practice, how it affects the quality of care. I was \njust in a town meeting 3 days ago with physicians. I just come straight \nin. Being a physician I can sort of cut through a lot of the \nconversation. I said: What is the biggest problem today in terms of the \nquality of care that you give that patient coming into the room?\n  It was pretty amazing. That group of physicians, without any \nhesitation, just one after another, said medical liability, medical \nmalpractice premiums; I cannot afford it; it affects quality; it \naffects access; it affects the way I practice medicine in a negative \nway.\n  Being a doctor, I receive letters about this problem from doctors all \nover America. It is real. The problem is increasing, and thus we in \nthis body must respond to it. It is driving doctors out of the practice \nof medicine. When babies are being delivered, in some States the tax on \nthat baby is as much as $1,000 the mom or family has to pay, somebody \nhas to pay, at the end of the day. That $1,000, being a tax, goes to \nmedical liability service. It hurts access to care. It hurts the \nquality of care. It is threatening our health care system. It is \ncosting the country billions of dollars.\n  As a physician, I am concerned about the care and the quality end of \nit, but even though the numbers are hard to calculate, if we just stand \nback and look in the aggregate, it is expensive. Well-researched \nreports predict that if we reform the medical liability system, make \nsure that there is equity, fairness, and appropriate compensation, if \nwe have appropriate reform, we will save the economy anywhere from $70 \nto $126 billion a year. Just the Federal Government would save about \n$14.9 billion over 10 years through savings just in the Medicare and \nthe Medicaid programs.\n  So when we are talking about what is the biggest issue in health care \ntoday, clearly this issue of the uninsured and the cost of health care \nmust be put on the forefront.\n  Staying with this whole area of tort liability, I very much would \nlike to address the issue of asbestos litigation. Right now things are \nout of control. A very good law has run amok over time and the intended \nconsequences no longer are being accomplished, but they are unintended \nconsequences which are hurting America.\n  The torrent of asbestos litigation has wreaked havoc on the victims \nof asbestos. Many of them develop either cancer or a type of cancer \ncalled mesothelioma. It has wreaked havoc on Americans' jobs. Companies \nare going bankrupt. About 20 companies have gone bankrupt from the cost \nof this out-of-control asbestos litigation system over the last 2 \nyears. And it is wreaking havoc on the economy. The approximately \n600,000 claims that have been filed already have cost $54 billion in \nsettlements, judgments, and litigation costs.\n\n  The sad thing is that even with all of these billions of dollars that \nare being spent in the system, the current asbestos tort system has \nbecome nothing more than a litigation lottery. A few victims receive \nadequate compensation. But far more, far more today, the way the system \nis constructed, the way it has evolved, suffer long delays for \nunpredictable awards, for inequitable awards--if they receive anything \nat all. This is the victims, the people who have been hurt by asbestos.\n  It is a system where, if you look at it, there is only one real \nwinner. It is not who was intended to win in the initial legislation or \nthe laws or the regulations; that is, the victim or potential victim of \nexposure to asbestos. No, the only one real winner today is the \nplaintiffs' trial lawyers, the only certain winner. They are taking \nabout half of every dollar that is awarded to victims. So you have a \nvictim, you have a system with a lot of money going to it, but only 50 \npercent of it ends up going to the victim. The other 50 percent gets \nlost in the system. There can be a system where there is fair and \nadequate compensation both for the lawyers and especially for the \nvictims.\n  While the attorneys collected their fees, the asbestos-related \nbankruptcies have already cost about 60,000 Americans their jobs. These \njob losses are unnecessary. If we act and update and modernize the \nasbestos tort system and bring everybody to the table, and do it in a \nbipartisan way, we can stop this unnecessary job loss--60,000 jobs to \ndate. For those who lose their jobs, the average personal loss in wages \nover a career is as much as $50,000. That is in wages. That doesn't \neven include the losses in health benefits as well as in lost \nretirement.\n  Remember, when I say 20 companies in the last 2 years have gone \nbankrupt, these are big companies, big employers. About 60 companies \nhave gone bankrupt over the last two decades because of the asbestos-\nrelated matters.\n  So passing this asbestos reform will create enormous economic \nbenefits. It will benefit the victims themselves. The certainty that \nflows from the bill itself will also stimulate capital investment which \nwill go to preserve existing jobs and create new jobs. Again, I mention \na bipartisan spirit. We have to have everybody at the table. We began \nthe work in the last session. I would like to finish it in this session \nin a bipartisan spirit to accomplish this reform.\n  In early February we will be turning to the highway system. It will \nbe shortly--February 2, hopefully, somewhere, depending upon when we \nfinish the appropriations bills, which I hope we will finish this \nweek--that we can turn to America's highways. It is another jobs issue. \nIt is also an infrastructure issue. It is a safety issue. It is an \nissue we will address in this body. It is estimated the highway bill, \nfrom a jobs perspective, will help create as many as 2 million much \nneeded jobs, and it is easy to understand why.\n  We are blessed in many ways because this country is interlaced with 4 \nmillion miles of roads and highways. Our\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\ntransportation infrastructure is estimated to be worth about $1.75 \ntrillion. We are blessed in many ways.\n\n  It is interesting that every $1 billion we invest in transportation \ninfrastructure turns around and generates, for every $1 billion \ninvestment, $2 billion in economic activity. That, of course, \ntranslates into jobs.\n  Our roads, our ports, our railroads are that infrastructure, that \ntransportation infrastructure that is fundamental to our Nation's \neconomic success. If things are so good, we are so blessed, why do we \nhave to have a highway bill? Because if we look at that infrastructure, \nwe see much of it is deteriorating or is becoming painfully crowded. \nProbably people listening to me now over their radios as I am talking \nare sitting in line in their cars. Commutes that used to take 10 \nminutes now take 20 minutes or that used to take 30 minutes now take an \nhour. Some people are probably sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic as I \nspeak, not during just rush hour but throughout the day.\n  From a safety standpoint--I have to put it on the table because it is \nanother reason we have to address this highway bill early--we have more \naccidents.\n  There is less time to spend with families as you spend more time in \nthe car. There will be about 23.6 billion hours spent by Americans in \ndelays, it is estimated. Americans waste 5.7 billion gallons of fuel \njust sitting in traffic in these delays. We can't ask our fellow \ncitizens to join the great American workforce and then simply sit idly \nby and allow our roads to decay as that daily commute stretches from a \nfew minutes to 30 minutes to 60 minutes--indeed, to hours.\n  It is a jobs issue. It is a quality of life issue. It is a safety \nissue.\n  Last year we addressed similar types of issues. We addressed the \nissue of spam with legislation, the Do Not Call phone registry. We just \nhit the issue of spam head on. This year we need to upgrade our \ntransportation system. We are losing billions of dollars in lost \nproductivity and billions of hours stuck in traffic.\n  It is that image of being stuck in traffic that kind of moves me to a \ntopic that is unfinished business, that we worked hard on but we were \nunsuccessful with in the last session. It is an issue that affects \nevery single American, every one of my colleagues, every one of my \ncolleagues' families, everybody listening to me, their families--and \nthat is energy. Our Nation simply does not have a comprehensive energy \npolicy that addresses the unfortunate dependence on foreign sources of \noil and energy today, a dependence which is increasing. It used to be \n30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent. Now it is up to 60 percent \ndependence on oil from overseas--an energy plan.\n  A lot of this reminds me to at least comment on what happened last \nsummer. Fifty million people suffered the biggest blackout in American \nhistory. It came at an instant from New York City to Cleveland to \nDetroit to Toronto; tens of thousands of citizens were trapped at that \ninstant, trapped in elevators and subways, trapped in trains, and they \nwere stranded on dark city streets. We saw just with a sort of snap of \nthe fingers in that instant the potentially fatal consequences of \noperating on a grid, upon which we are all so dependent, that is \noutmoded, that is outdated, that can crash at any time.\n  The Senate must respond. Our Congress must respond. It is our \nresponsibility to respond, to act--not just talk, not just try, but to \nrespond and pass legislation that addresses in a comprehensive way \nenergy supply and conservation and renewable resources and the uses of \nmore efficient types of energy.\n\n  We have to address what people are beginning to feel in the last \nseveral weeks, especially with the cold wave and the cold streak that \nhas hit New England in historic proportions, and that is the cost of \nenergy and the cost of oil and natural gas. U.S. chemical companies are \nclosing plants. They are laying off workers. They are looking to expand \nproduction abroad. All because of what? The cost of high energy prices. \nWe will import approximately $9 billion more in chemicals than we \nexported this year. American consumers are getting hit with higher and \nhigher energy prices.\n  Small businesses are struggling just to contain these rising energy \ncosts. It is our responsibility, this body, the Senate, to act. We \nacted in the last Congress. We came two votes short. Now it is \nincumbent upon us to go back and address that challenge before us.\n  I should add, not only will the energy plan lower prices, it, too, \nwill have a real impact on jobs and on the economy--on thousands of \njobs. It is estimated that the energy package will create about a half \na million jobs. The Alaskan pipeline alone will create at least 400,000 \njobs.\n  Hundreds of millions of dollars will be invested in research and \ndevelopment and new technology. All of this will create jobs. \nEngineering will create jobs in math, chemistry, physics, and science. \nReforming the litigation system, upgrading our highways, and passing a \ncomprehensive energy plan will lead to more jobs and higher economic \ngrowth.\n  We also must think beyond our borders in relation to what happens \nwithin this country, what happens within other countries, and address \nthe energy issue of trade--specifically trade with Central America and \nAustralia. Free trade is essential to the creation of jobs and to \ngrowing the economy.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend 2 days in Mexico City \nwhere I met with representatives from the senate there. I had the \nopportunity to look back over the last 10 years of NAFTA. Indeed, under \nthose 10 years of much freer trade with Mexico, the value of two-way \ntrade between the United States and Mexico tripled. It went up three \ntimes--from $81 billion to over $230 billion. While I was there, I was \ntalking to my legislative counterparts in the senate. And I was talking \nto President Fox. It was apparent to me that free trade does much for \ngrowth and economic opportunity.\n  But it also does much more than that. They described to me how \nelections there have become much freer and much more open at the state \nlevel and at the national level. We also need to make sure those trade \nagreements that we are part of are fair and equitable--that they \nstrengthen the rules of international trade, and we will work hard in \nthis body to achieve that right mix of benefits and obligations.\n  In addition to these types of structural reforms, we will continue to \npursue strong fiscal policy and deficit reduction.\n  Again, the President mentioned last night the importance of this \nfiscal responsibility. In about 2 weeks, the President of the United \nStates will deliver a budget to this body. We will work with that \nbudget to accomplish that fiscal discipline. The President last night \nlaid out a plan to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.\n  Now that the economy is beginning to hum once again, thanks to the \ntax relief package and the jobs and growth package of the President \nfrom 2001 and 2003, we must turn our attention to reducing the deficit. \nThe deficit depends in part on revenues and in part on how much we \nspend. To grow those revenues, we have to focus like a laser, which the \nPresident has done and which we in this body have done growing the \neconomy. Now is the time to focus on that spending.\n  We are also committed to promoting fairness in the Tax Code. Last \nsummer we passed a tax bill to provide additional tax relief for \nfamilies with children. We created a uniform definition of a child. \nInstead of five confusing and conflicting categories in terms of \ndefining a child, the Tax Code was simplified to make it easier for \nfolks to fill out the forms and get the tax relief to which they are \nentitled.\n  Tax simplification: We will not solve all of it this year, but I \npledge this body--working with the appropriate committees--to work \nalong the line for tax simplification. We will continue to pursue \nreforms that make the Tax Code clearer, more understandable, and less \nburdensome for America's tax filers. We will address the issue of \nInternet tax, for example. We will work hard to pass manufacturing tax \nincentives.\n  Each of these will reduce the burden that the Government imposes on \nAmerican workers and on American businesses. They, too, are critical to \nadding jobs to the economy. Reducing taxes on manufacturing profits \nespecially will increase the competitiveness of American businesses by \ncreating a fairer and a more sound system of taxing income. We will \nwork hard this year to lower\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\nmanufacturing taxes and streamline the Tax Code; all of that as we \nfocus on taxes because taxes ultimately is not about dollars but about \npeople--people who go to work every day, who start businesses, who hire \nnew workers, who contribute to their communities, who raise their \nfamilies, and who expand the economy.\n  Tax relief and tax reform grow the range of opportunities for people \nto make the very best choices for themselves and for their families, \nwhether that is to spend their hard-earned dollars on a dishwasher or \nwhether it might be to take the family on a vacation.\n  For some families, however, the choices are stark. They are not \nthinking about even a new dishwasher. They are not thinking about a \nvacation. They struggle just to pay the bills. Often health insurance \nfor their loved ones is a necessity they do without.\n  The President last night mentioned the importance of addressing the \ncost of health care today. Forty-four million people are uninsured in \nthis country. It varies between 40 million and 44 million. Whatever the \nfigure is, it is too high. The primary cause is the cost of health \ninsurance. It is one of the most daunting policy challenges facing \nour Nation.\n\n  As a physician, it is clear to me that if somebody does not have \nhealth insurance they simply don't get good care or high-quality care. \nThey do not tend to get things that are important in preventing \ndiseases such as preventive services. The uninsured are four times less \nlikely to receive needed medical and health treatment. The uninsured \nare five times less likely to obtain prescription drugs. The uninsured \nare four times more likely to enter the health care system through the \nemergency room.\n  The lack of affordable health care coverage is also one of the key \nfactors accounting for the health care disparities among minorities--\naddressing specifically access to quality care.\n  As we heard last night, the President offered specific proposals. He \ndidn't just say we need to address the problem by saying we are going \nto take care of everybody no matter what it costs and sort of stick \none's head in the sand about the issue or overpromise. The President \noffered very specific proposals which we in this body should consider.\n  Refundable tax credits for low- and middle-income Americans are \nimportant. It means that people who are on the margin and can't afford \nhealth care insurance all of a sudden have a pool of resources to be \nable to buy that insurance.\n  He proposed to expand the number of community health centers and to \nincrease access to this new entity of health savings accounts where \nyou, in essence, own your health savings account. You are able to put \nin money tax free and take it out tax free. You control that health \ncare dollar.\n  He introduced the concept last night of making the premiums \ndeductible, to encourage and to make it more affordable to have these \nhealth savings accounts.\n  We have to control costs through, as I mentioned earlier, addressing \nhead on the frivolous and unnecessary medical lawsuits.\n  The President mentioned promoting association health plans--again, a \nspecific proposal. It will be debated on the floor of the Senate.\n  But the point is the President says we need to reduce the cost of the \nhealth insurance policies. He feels very strongly that one of the \nanswers would be lowering the cost by allowing association health plans \nto enter the market and to compete.\n  In this body, I have asked Senator Judd Gregg to lead a Senate \nRepublican task force to explore ways in which this body can respond to \nthe uninsured--this daunting challenge which is before us.\n  America is a strong nation. America is a compassionate nation. We are \ncommitted to protecting the most vulnerable before us. The President \nlast night mentioned immigration policy. The reception to his \nimmigration policy statements from a few weeks ago has been very mixed. \nWe know that. A lot of people are getting phone calls from \nconstituents. But the point is the President says this is a problem, \nand the reality is we have 8 million people or 9 million people in this \ncountry who are in the shadows. We don't know who they are or where \nthey are or what they are doing. Our immigration policy is outdated. It \nmust be addressed.\n  Indeed, in this body we must address immigration policy. I have asked \nmy chairmen of the appropriate committees to come together and see what \nthe appropriate response is in discussing, pulling together and \naddressing what the immigration policy might be and to report back.\n  It was feared that the President's plan was either amnesty or \nwelfare. But the President was very direct last night. This year we \nwill work to find ways to improve the system.\n  In 2004, we will also work to build on the success of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act and the education bill. We are committed to improving \nHead Start and making sure that every child in America learns.\n  We will also address the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nin this session, and to get education out of the courtroom and into the \nclassroom focusing on the individual--to focus on individuals \nthemselves who have disabilities and to make sure they have that \nopportunity to learn. We will examine how we can expand access to \nhigher education. The President last night mentioned the support for \ncommunity colleges. If you are a minority or your family is poor, you \nare less likely to attend college. We must examine how to close this \ngap so that college is within reach for all children, regardless of \nrace, regardless of income. We will work hard in this body this year to \nmake sure, from Head Start all the way up through college, every child \nin America has that opportunity to learn and to achieve.\n\n  Our commitment to opportunity also brings me to mention welfare \nrecipients as they work to gain independence and self-reliance. Since \nthe enactment of the historic 1996 welfare law, 5.4 million fewer \npeople live in poverty than when the law was passed. Caseloads have \ndeclined by more than half. Families once trapped in the clutches of \ngovernment dependency are now on those first rungs of the economic \nladder.\n  It is by no means an easy climb, but these hard-working Americans are \nsucceeding for themselves, they are succeeding for their families. \nToday, 2.8 million fewer children live in poverty. Among African-\nAmerican children, poverty has dropped to its lowest level ever.\n  Welfare reform is working. It is working because it is based on the \nbelief that everyone can succeed if given the chance. This year, in \nthis body, we will work to extend the promise of welfare reform which \nis at its heart the promise of the American dream.\n  As we move America forward on the domestic front, we must also \ncontinue to meet international challenges to the safety and security of \nthe American people. There are many but none more important than the \nwar on terror. The fight against terror will be a long and difficult \nstruggle, unlike any struggle this Nation has known before. Let there \nbe no mistake about it; we are at war, but we will prevail. Already we \nhave made tremendous progress. After years of indifference to the \nthreat of terrorism, the U.S. Government has, under the leadership of \nPresident Bush, made enormous strides in taking the fight to the \nterrorists. In just 2 years, America has toppled two terrorist-\nsponsoring regimes. In just 2 years, America has liberated millions of \npeople. In just 2 years, America has brought avowed adversaries to the \ntable of peace. Our bold, tough, unwavering leadership has yielded \nspectacular results. As the President said last night in the State of \nthe Union Message, ``No one can doubt the word of America.''\n  Previously recalcitrant rulers are beginning to cooperate in the war \non terror. After seeing our troops roll into Baghdad, the Libyan \ndictator, Muammar Qadhafi, called the Italian Prime Minister and said: \nI will do whatever the Americans want because I saw what happened in \nIraq and I am afraid. Libya will now dismantle its nuclear weapons \nprograms and join the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  With the military defeat of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and \nSaddam's regime in Iraq, American diplomacy has been further \nstrengthened toward ending the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and \nIran. North Korea and\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nIran now feel the combined pressure of the international community to \nabandon their nuclear ambitions. I am confident in time they will.\n  Finally, change wrought by war has given old adversaries an \nopportunity to lay aside their grievances and begin the work of peace. \nIndia and Pakistan have agreed to peace talks. Syria has established \ndiplomatic relations with Turkey. In each case, the opportunity to \npursue a new course of peace between these historic antagonists is a \ndirect result of the United States determination to oppose \ninternational terrorists and the regimes that sponsor them.\n\n  This is not to say the war against terrorism has been won. We are far \nfrom that. Yasser Arafat continues to cling to the tools of terror, \nfrustrating the latest efforts for peace in the Middle East. In \nColombia, a courageous new government fights a stubborn terrorist \nmovement. But with clear-eyed determination we can find solutions to \nthese conflicts as well.\n  Victory in the war against terrorism is inevitable because of the \nleadership of our President, because of the perseverance of our people \nand, most of all, because of the courage and sacrifice of our men and \nwomen in uniform. Every day they serve the Nation, our service men and \nwomen give this Nation their very best. They are not the first, but \nthey are the latest generation to take up and bear arms, to travel from \nhome and loved ones and risk all so we may live in safety, so we may \nlive in peace. They deserve our deep gratitude.\n  I take one final moment to pay a special thanks to the 101st Airborne \nwhich is based in my home State of Tennessee and also in the adjoining \nState of Kentucky. Under the leadership of MG David Petraeus, a friend, \nthe 101st is doing extraordinary work. You may remember it was the \n101st that found and dispatched Uday and Qusay Hussein in Mosul. Since \nthen, the 101st has moved more quickly than any other American unit in \ntraining guards and policemen for the new Iraqi civil defense guard.\n  They have also shown that the Iraqi people have tremendous generosity \nin their relationships with the United States. They have demonstrated \nthe generosity through their action, through the action of the 101st \nAirborne, the generosity, the heart displayed by our service men and \nwomen in helping Iraq rebuild its infrastructure, rebuild its civic \ninstitutions and, even more fundamentally, the pride and hope of the \npeople in Iraq, that pride and hope in the future. Together with the \nsupport of the Congress and the American people, the 101st is helping \nplant the seed of democracy in the heart of the Middle East.\n  There is yet much to be done, but it must be said that none of these \ndevelopments was even imaginable 3 years ago. Because of the \nextraordinary leadership of President Bush and the courage of our men \nand women in uniform, America is safer. Millions of people around the \nworld are for the first time free.\n  Strengthening our homeland security, prosecuting this war on terror, \naddressing domestic issues such as education and health care and tort \nreform are just a few of the issues we will address this year. The \nPresident's judicial nominees will get the up-or-down vote they \ndeserve. We will not allow a small minority of Senators to thwart our \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent.\n  Look for action to protect unborn victims of violence, child custody \nprotection, gun liability, bankruptcy, and many other legislative \nefforts.\n  We have laid out an ambitious agenda, one worthy of a great nation, \none that will require strong, bipartisan work. We will be aggressive. \nWe will fulfill our duty to serve the American people and make our \nNation strong.\n  Some cynics say in a narrowly divided Congress, especially during an \nelection year, that we are doomed to gridlock, that we can accomplish \nlittle. I strongly disagree. I believe everyone in this Chamber will do \nwhat is right and what is best for the American people and that is to \nmove America forward.\n  There is much to be done and there is no time to waste. I thank my \nfellow Senators for their dedication. I look forward to another \nextraordinary year in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S66-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2673, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany H.R. 2673, making \n     appropriations for agriculture, rural development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30th, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 6 \np.m. will be equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of \nthe appropriations committee or their designees for debate only.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to consume as much \ntime as I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague, Senator Frist, \nwho is the majority leader. I have great respect for him. His call for \nbipartisanship is certainly welcome. I say to him and to others that \nthose of us who serve in the Senate come here wanting to do good things \nfor our country. We have a passion for good public policy that will \nadvance America's interests.\n  But I must say, in the past year or so the evidence of bipartisanship \nis hard to find with respect to the way the White House and the \nmajority in this Senate have dealt with the minority. We would welcome \ntrue bipartisanship.\n  I must also point out, while I think there are areas where we have \nmade progress in this country, there are some very significant issues \nwith which we must deal.\n  We have the largest budget deficit in history, and, no, it is not \nbecause of a war, it is not because of a recession. We had testimony at \na hearing yesterday that said the largest part of this deficit is as a \nresult of recurring tax cuts, very large tax cuts, the bulk of which \nwent to the largest income earners in this country. If you earn $1 \nmillion a year, good for you; you are very fortunate. You, also, under \nthis administration's tax plan, get nearly $100,000 in a tax cut each \nyear as well.\n  We have a very large and growing Federal budget deficit, the largest \nin history. The President proposes increased defense spending, \nincreased homeland security spending, and then decreased revenue. I \nwent to a really small school, but mathematics is still the same. One \nand one equals two. That fiscal policy equals very large budget \ndeficits.\n  We have a responsibility--all of us, Republicans and Democrats--to \nour children to put this fiscal policy back on track. This President \ninherited a large and growing budget surplus. We now have the largest \nbudget deficit in history, and we must fix it.\n  We have the largest trade deficit in history, and we have to fix \nthat. This administration is negotiating new trade agreements that, \nincidentally, will once again ship more American jobs overseas. It \nmakes no sense to me for us to do that. We do have a global economy, \nbut we ought not set American workers and American businesses up for \ncompetition against those around the world who will work 12-year-olds \n12 hours a day for 12 cents an hour and then ship their products to the \nstore shelves in America. That is not fair competition for American \nworkers and American business. That is only about larger profits for \nmultinationals. We need a better trade policy and to reduce those trade \ndeficits as well.\n  We have many problems, significant problems, we have to address. I \nwelcome bipartisanship. I hope Republicans and Democrats, who seek the \nsame goal, who have the same interests and urges to improve this \ncountry, can work together.\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n  But I want to talk a little about this Omnibus appropriations bill \nand describe why some of us are concerned about the lack of \nbipartisanship at the end of the last session and about the \npartisanship, especially that was exhibited. I want to talk about \nthings that were put in this Omnibus appropriations bill, or things \nthat were taken out, and how that was done, and why that was done, and \nwhy we think it is bad public policy.\n  First, let me talk about country-of-origin labeling. That is just a \nslogan. Not many people, perhaps, know what that is about. Let me \ndescribe it.\n  Upton Sinclair in 1906 wrote a book called ``The Jungle.'' He was \ndescribing what happened in America's meatpacking plants. They had a \nrat problem, and so what they did to control the rats was they would \ntake loaves of bread and lace them with poison and lay them around \nthese meat plants so the rats would eat the poison. The rats would die \nand they would put the bread and the rats down the same hole, and out \nthe back of those packing plants came sausage sent to the \nAmerican consumer.\n\n  Well, Upton Sinclair wrote about that, exposed it in a book called \n``The Jungle.'' That led to tough new laws, inspections, saying you \ncannot do that. This is about the health and safety of the American \npeople and the health and safety of America's food supply.\n  Country-of-origin labeling is about labeling food in this country. \nThe necktie I am wearing has a label on it. I looked at it this \nmorning. All neckties have labels. Why? Because they are required to \nhave labels. I know where this necktie was made. In fact, I know where \nthe shoes I am wearing were made.\n  But not everything is labeled. And especially in the advent of a case \nof mad cow disease, discovered in the State of Washington, with a cow \nthat came into this country from Canada, or the case of the people who \ndied from hepatitis in this country, and the hundreds who remain ill by \nhepatitis as a result of spring onions that came into this country from \nMexico, the American consumers ought to have the right to have their \nfood labeled.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to show a piece of meat on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This happens to be a steak. I would ask if there is \nanyone who could tell me where this particular steak came from? The \nanswer is no. It is not labeled. Did it come from Canada? You do not \nknow. Did it come from Mexico? You will not know. Guatemala? No. This \nmeat is not labeled.\n  Let me read something about a packing plant in Mexico for the \ninterest of the consumers in this country. In May of 1999, one \ninspector paid a surprise visit to a meatpacking plant in Mexico. This \nis what he said he found: ``Shanks and briskets were contaminated with \nfeces . . . diseased-condemned carcass was observed ready for boning \nand distribution in commerce.'' But then the Mexican officials went to \nwork to restore that plant's ability to sell meat into America. The \nMexican plant regained its export license. It switched owners. It \nchanged its name. It sells meat into America. And USDA has never \nreturned. It has never again been inspected.\n  Do you want to know whether this meat came from that plant? I do. The \nAmerican consumer ought to know.\n  This Omnibus appropriations bill contains something that is \npernicious on this issue. We passed a law that is the law of the land \nthat requires food labeling, meat labeling, and the Department of \nAgriculture will not implement it. This appropriations bill, with no \ndebate and no discussion in the Congress, put a provision in this \nappropriations bill that says we shall delay, by 2 years, the \nimplementation of this act. Why? Because they want to kill it. Why? \nBecause the big packing plants got to them, and they don't like this.\n  The USDA says it is hard to implement. Nonsense. We can drive a \nvehicle on the surface of Mars and we cannot put labels on meat? Total \nnonsense. This is about big interests versus others. It is about \nconsumers and farmers and ranchers being together in whose interest it \nis that we label meat and food.\n  On the other side are the big grocery manufacturers, the big packing \nhouses that have fought this tooth and nail, and this administration \nand the majority in this Congress who listen to only one voice; and \nthat is the biggest interests--the bigger interests. They are the \nwinners. They are always the winners in this fight.\n  So the country-of-origin labeling provision in this bill is wrong. It \nwas never debated. It was never agreed to. It ought to come out. Those \nwho went into a room and wrote these provisions and stuck them into \nthis appropriations bill ought to go back into the same room and fix \nit. We do not know which room it is. We do not know who they are \nbecause this was a partisan exercise. They did not invite Democrats. It \nwas a partisan exercise. What they did is they served big business \ninterests by sticking this sort of nonsense in the bill. That is \ncountry-of-origin labeling.\n  Let me describe something else. How about overtime? This is not about \nmeat. I will put the meat away. I thank the Presiding Officer for \nallowing me to show a piece of steak on the floor of the Senate. There \nis not one Member of the Senate who would know where that meat came \nfrom because it is not labeled. It might have come from a plant in \nMexico. It might have come from Guatemala. You do not know. I do not \nknow. We do not know, but we ought to know. That is what the majority \nwants to prevent us and all consumers from knowing; and that is why \nthey are wrong.\n  Let me talk about overtime. Let me talk about workers in this \ncountry. Do you know, for 65 years we have had a kind of pact in this \ncountry, a rule and a law that says if you want to work somebody \novertime, you have a responsibility to pay them overtime pay? It is \ncalled the 40-hour workweek. We say, if you want to tell your employees \nyou are going to work overtime, 10 hours of overtime every week, yours \nis a 50-hour week, you have a responsibility to pay them overtime pay.\n  The Department of Labor is now preparing to decide that they are \ngoing to change the overtime rules. Why? To make it easier for business \nto work people overtime without having to pay them. People whose \njudgments I respect say that up to 8 million Americans would be \nrequired to work overtime with no pay under this provision.\n  So we in the Senate and in the House, on a bipartisan basis, put a \nprovision in this appropriations bill that says you cannot do that, \nDepartment of Labor; you cannot do that to the American worker. Guess \nwhat. In that same closed room, they took that provision out. It was \nbipartisan, voted on in both the House and Senate, but big business \ndidn't like it, so it is gone. It is just gone.\n  The American workers deserve better than that. Do we really want to \nsay to 8 million workers out there that we don't care about their \nfamilies, about their income needs? We just care that after 65 years we \nwant to change the overtime requirements so if their employer wants to \nwork them overtime, they can. They don't have to hire more people. Why \nwould they have to do that? They could just work people 50 hours a week \nbecause it doesn't cost any more. They can work them 50 hours a week \nwith no overtime pay, or they can get rid of their job and hire \nsomebody else.\n  For 65 years, we have had this overtime rule. These folks want to \nchange it and hurt up to 8 million American workers.\n  That is in this Omnibus bill--the exclusion of the provision that \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House and Senate put in. It was wrong \nto do that. They ought to put that exclusion in so we can block these \nrules and stand on the side of the American worker.\n  Let me talk about one more: Broadcast ownership. I will tell you why \nI am talking about these. It may be that those who do this have ear \nplugs; maybe they hear nothing. I don't know. I have told often of my \nhometown of 400 people, a tiny town in the southwest ranching country \nof North Dakota. I used to go down to see a blacksmith, John Krebs. I \nwas fascinated to watch him work. He wore these big gloves and he had \nthis forge. He would pump that thing and get a fire going, and then I \nwould watch him put a piece of steel in this fire. The steel would heat \nup until it was almost white hot, and they would take it out with a big \ntool and go over to an anvil\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nand start to pound on it and bend it. You can bend it when you put heat \non steel.\n  That is a lot like politics. When you apply heat, that is when things \nbend in politics. That is what this is about, trying to apply heat to \nthose who went into a room and said we are going to get rid of meat \nlabeling, or we are going to let the Labor Department tell 8 million \npeople they have to work without overtime pay for more than 40 hours a \nweek, or broadcast ownership, which is interesting for me.\n  Broadcast ownership. Who owns America's radio and television \nstations? That is a big issue. We voted on that issue in the Senate and \nin the House of Representatives. The judgment and decision we made was \ntaken out of this conference after the conference made the decision and \nclosed the title by unanimous consent. I was a conferee; that is how I \nknow. The conference report on this Omnibus bill dealt with what both \nthe House and Senate had decided, and that is that we will restrict to \n35 percent national ownership, the ownership of television stations. \nAnd that was standing up to the big interests, taking on the big \nbroadcast interests. We did it, Republicans and Democrats together. We \npassed legislation in both the House and the Senate, with Republican \nand Democratic support.\n  When we finished, we went to conference. Sitting in the conference, \nwhen we came to that title, I asked the chairman of the conference: Let \nme understand what you now intend to put in this conference report \nbecause they were about to close the title. I said: On the broadcast \nownership issue, will this conference report include the 35-percent \nrestriction that passed the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis? The \nanswer was that, yes, it includes the position of the House and Senate, \nthe 35 percent. I said that I will then have no objection to closing \nthis title. Bang, the gavel came down, the title was closed, and the \nconference resolved that issue. It was done.\n  Mr. President, that is not what is in this bill. That is not what \ncame from the conference. I was driving down the road in my car about a \nweek later and I heard on the radio that the Senate was negotiating \nwith the President on a different number. That is what is in this bill. \nApparently, conferences don't matter. The gavel doesn't matter. The \nchairman closing a title doesn't matter. None of it mattered. None of \nit was on the level. What is in this conference report expands the \nownership capability of broadcast ownership in television and radio--\ntelevision with respect to this issue--in a way it abridges the \ndecision made first by the House, then by the Senate, then by the \nconference.\n\n  I would like just one person to explain to me that process, or the \nrules that allow that process to bring that to the floor of the Senate. \nWhat is this about? It is about whether you are going to stand up in \nthis country for broad-based economic ownership, or whether you believe \nin the area of broadcast properties--those who determine what we see \nand what we hear and read, which increasingly are just a few people in \nthis country--whether you believe they ought to be bigger and bigger \nand bigger. One company now owns over 1,200 radio stations in this \ncountry. I could bring out charts about all the broadcast properties in \ntelevision and radio. You would see there is this orgy of mergers and \nacquisitions and a dramatic and damaging concentration.\n  That is what this fight was about in the Senate and House. In fact, \nthe Senate passed a resolution of disapproval that I, along with \nSenator Lott and others, on a bipartisan basis, passed in the Senate--a \nresolution that disapproved the entire Federal communications rule \ndealing with expanding the ownership capabilities of the big groups for \nradio and television and allowing cross ownership of newspapers and \nbroadcast media. We passed that resolution of disapproval in the Senate \nthat would disapprove the entire rule. That is now pending in the House \nof Representatives at the desk. It is only about 10 signatures short of \npassing there. They have, I think, 208 signatures.\n  You know what. Somewhere in a closed room, with just a few folks \ndeciding, they abridged the decision by the House, the decision by the \nSenate, and explicit decision by the conference committee of which I \nwas a member, with respect to broadcast ownership in television. I \nthink that is a horrible policy choice, aside from the fact that, in my \njudgment, it casts aside all the rules as to how we do business.\n  It is fundamentally wrong for this Congress to weigh in and say, by \nthe way, the sky is the limit; own everything you want. Let's have one \ncompany owning 3,000 radio stations. Let's have two companies owning \nall the TV stations. You know that the FCC rule says that in one big \nAmerican city it will be just fine if you own three television \nstations, eight radio stations, the cable company, and the major \nnewspaper. That is fine.\n  It is not fine with me. It is not the way things ought to be in this \ncountry. Yet it doesn't matter how we vote in the Congress. What \nmatters is what a few people stick in an omnibus report that comes to \nus, which contains provisions that were not debated and not supported \nby either the House or the Senate. Why? I will tell you why. On \nvirtually all of these issues, the White House says if you mess around \nwith what we don't like, we will veto this.\n  We have compliant folks who bow and say if you say ``veto,'' let us \ntake it out. By all means, let us satisfy the White House, forgetting, \nI guess, that there are separate branches in the Government. We are not \nthe White House.\n  The President has not vetoed a thing since he has been President. If \nhe wants to, that is fine. Does he want to make his first veto the \ncountry-of-origin labeling, or the issue of overtime? Does he want to \nmake his first veto broadcast ownership limits? Maybe he wants to \nexplain that to the American people, when the question is whose side \nare you on? The answer from the White House must always be that they \nare on the side of the big interests. Maybe he should explain that. But \nwe will never, apparently, confront those issues of the veto threats \nbecause in every circumstance in this Omnibus, things were put in, or \nthings were left out that thwart the will of the U.S. Congress.\n  What happened here is arrogant, just plain arrogant. So if you wonder \nwhy we are upset, I have explained three of them: overtime, country-of-\norigin labeling for food, and broadcast ownership. There are six or \neight. I could go through more, but I will not. This is wrong, what \nhappened to this conference report, flat wrong.\n  The majority leader is a good man. I am proud to serve with him. When \nhe says to us let's have some bipartisanship, I say to him absolutely. \nBut what they did on a partisan basis is arrogant.\n  There are provisions in this conference report that shouldn't be \nhere, and provisions that should be here that were taken out. It was \narrogant. They know it. This is not something we are going to allow to \nhappen again. This place cannot and will not function this way.\n  I want this to be a bipartisan institution as well. While we might \ndisagree from time to time, and we have people of good character having \na raucous debate, that is just fine. This country will get, in my \njudgment, the benefit of what all of us have to offer if we have a good \ndebate. I think Republicans have something significant to offer our \ncountry, as do Democrats.\n  There are times when we have aggressive debate about issues, and we \npick the best of a competition of ideas. There are other times when we \nwork together where we are near unanimous agreement. But this is not \nthe way to work. This mistreats the minority. We are a significant \nminority at this point, just a vote short of a 50/50 Senate.\n  What happened here will not be allowed to happen again. I say that to \nthe White House and to the majority. We insist on some semblance of \nbipartisanship.\n  Let me make one final point. Not only on this but on other issues, \nthe majority decided not to have conferences. They would have what is \ncalled ``a virtual conference,'' in which they would conference with \nthemselves and exclude Democrats. That will not happen again in this \nCongress either. We will not appoint conferees unless there is a \ncommitment from the chairman of the committee that the conference will \nmeet with both members of the conference, Republican and Democratic \ncaucuses.\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\n  Even more than that, we will not allow again something like this to \nhappen: seven appropriations bills put in one omnibus and then in the \nmiddle, a little folder is stuck in that abridges the rights of the \nmajority and minority with respect to specific votes in the Congress. \nIt is not the right way to do business.\n  I accept the majority leader's call for bipartisanship. As far as I \nam concerned, sign me up on things on which we can work together. I \nwant to do that. People of good will should do that for the good of \nthis country. But we cannot call for bipartisanship unless we renounce \nthe tactics that created this conference report with respect to \novertime, country-of-origin labeling, broadcast ownership, and other \nissues. Those people have a voice in this Chamber as well--people who \nwork hard, people who are consumers. They have a right to be heard in \nthis Congress, and they were not with respect to those provisions in \nthis Omnibus bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a concurrent resolution which I shall send \nto the desk correcting the enrollment of the omnibus conference report \nrestoring the media ownership language to that which the conferees had \noriginally agreed to; that the concurrent resolution be agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. BOND. On behalf of the Republican leadership, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Missouri and my \ncolleague from Rhode Island are waiting. I thank them for their \nindulgence. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I finish \nmy remarks, the Senator from Rhode Island be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have come to speak about the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. I say to my good friend from North Dakota, \nsometimes it is frustrating. We spent 8 years with an administration of \nhis party, and there were many times we had to change appropriations \nbills. We had a very frequent presence from the Office of Management \nand Budget, and in order to get bills signed, we had to accede to \nPresidential requests.\n  In this bill, obviously, there are some very important provisions. \nWhen we are talking about country-of-origin labeling, the concern that \ncomes to many of us in livestock-producing States, cattle producers and \nhog producers, if you are a small independent operator and you don't \nhave a totally integrated operation, you have a very difficult time \ngetting a total life history of every animal you might want to feed out \nand sell.\n  The ability of a large integrated operation which goes from cow calf \nto feeding, finishing and slaughtering, they are in a great position to \nlive with the country-of-origin labeling. There are some real problems, \nwhich is why we asked for a delay in the implementation of the country-\nof-origin labeling. There had been a new proposal for an animal \nidentification system which would make that prospect possible. In the \nabsence of that, many of the individual small cattle ranchers and hog \nproducers in my State think it would be impossible for them to sell \ntheir animals.\n  There are some conflicting needs. Those had to be resolved and, like \nany measure, an Omnibus appropriations bill has provisions in it that \nsome people don't like. Certainly, in almost every appropriations bill \non which I work, there are provisions I don't like. But we have to get \nit passed by both Houses. We have to get it signed by the President.\n  I am here today to urge that, No. 1, we move quickly to adopt the \nOmnibus appropriations bill and that we get on and work on a bipartisan \nbasis without delays, without having to invoke cloture to pass \nappropriations bills for the coming year.\n  With respect to the Omnibus appropriations bill, I wish to call the \nattention of my colleagues to some very important provisions. There are \nproblems that are happening every day because we were not able to pass \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill in December. We worked on a bipartisan \nbasis. The distinguished ranking member of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, \nSenator Mikulski of Maryland, and I put together what is a very \ndifficult bill, but we think it is a very important bill. Probably the \nmost significant part of it is for medical care.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill provides $28.3 billion in funds, \nincluding third-party insurance collections. This amount is $3.1 \nbillion over the fiscal year 2003 enacted level and represents a 12.3 \npercent increase over the previous year's enacted level, the one that \nwill have to stay in effect if we continue to work under a continuing \nresolution.\n  At this point, our problem is we either pass this bill or go back to \na continuing resolution. The figure of $3.1 billion less for the \ncurrent year means great hardship, great delay for our VA health care, \namong other things.\n  Make no mistake, these funds are urgently and desperately needed by \nveterans, especially for those who return from Iraq and the global war \non terrorism.\n\n  If my colleagues visit, as I have, VA facilities, the Washington VA, \nand the VA facilities in my home State, anyplace they go they will find \nthere is a tremendous delay in the ability to care for and take on \nveterans who qualify under the greatly expanded eligibility scope the \nCongress has mandated on VA. There is a great delay in taking care of \nmany of these people.\n  According to a VA analysis, there are 15,813 service members who \nserved in Operation Iraqi Freedom who have been separated from military \nduty as of September 22 of last year. Among these service members, \nalmost 2,000, or 12.5 percent, have sought VA health care during 2003.\n  Every day we hear unfortunate and sad news of American soldiers \nkilled in Iraq. As illustrated by the VA analysis and scores of news \nreports, there are thousands of service members who were fortunate to \nlive but were wounded in combat. As reported last October 1 by USA \nToday:\n\n       At least seven times as many men and women have been \n     wounded in battle as those killed in battle.\n\n  As these wounded service members are discharged from the military and \nconfront new and challenging hardships in piecing together a new life, \nmost of them will depend upon the VA to meet their needs. I personally \nmet some of these service members when I visited Walter Reed Hospital \nlast month. I visited the VA facilities. I visited service members, \nsuch as Phillip Ramsey from Kansas City, MO, who was badly wounded in \nIraq and will ultimately require extensive, long-term care from the VA \nsystem as well.\n  Further, we know that the demand for VA medical care is not going to \nlessen. We have already seen the VA medical care system being \noverwhelmed by the staggering increase in demand for its medical \nservices.\n  Since 1996, VA has seen a 54-percent increase, or 2 million patients \nmore, in total users of the medical care system. Further, the VA \nprojects that its enrollments will grow by another 2 million patients \nfrom a current level of 7 million to 9 million patients in 2009. \nGetting the funds that we have approved in the Senate, approved in the \nconference committee, approved on the floor, and signed by the \nPresident is absolutely essential.\n  In addition, construction projects for new medical facilities and \nimprovements to existing facilities will not go forward without this \nOmnibus bill passing. Under a year-long continuing resolution, the VA \nwould not be able to begin funding construction for new facilities in \nLas Vegas and Orlando. Further, funding for the development of 48 high-\npriority, new, community-based outpatient clinics, and a number of new \nnursing homes will be curtailed.\n  In the years I have worked with the VA in my current position, \nproviding community-based outpatient clinics is the most effective, \nhumane, and efficient way of delivering service to VA-qualified \nveterans who would otherwise have to travel perhaps as much as hundreds \nof miles to get primary and routine care.\n  In another area, for 2003, pharmacy costs rose over 11 percent, and \nthe VA is continuing to see increasing demands for prescriptions each \nmonth.\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\nThe continued rising demand for prescriptions is stripping funds from \nother priority areas as VA continues to operate under last year's \nfunding level. Furthermore, the VA provides a high priority to the \nhighest quality of life long-term care for each of its elderly \nveterans. The VA planned to expand its program by over 20 percent this \nyear, but the VA will not be able to expand its long-term care services \nunder a continuing resolution funding authority. This, in my view, is \nnot the way we should treat the men and women in uniform who have \nserved America.\n  The VA has made significant strides in improving claims benefits \nprocessing, but the VA's efforts would again be curtailed under a \ncontinuing resolution. The VA is currently on track to reach their goal \nof no longer than 100 days to process these claims, down from 233 days, \nwhich it was previously. They are trying to get there by the end of \n2004. However, with a continuing resolution level at the 2003 level, \nthe current year, the Veterans Benefits Administration would have to \ncut 500 full-time employees. Such a reduction would be catastrophic to \nthe timeliness of claims processing and the expeditious delivery of \nbenefits such as pensions to the needy, education benefits, and home \nloans.\n  At a continuing resolution for 2003 funding level, the VA cemetery \nservices would be critically impacted and would result in delays in \nawarding shrine commitment contracts, awarding grants for State \nveterans cemeteries, and a reduced level of staffing that would \nnegatively impact cemetery maintenance.\n  America's veterans rely on the VA to provide the services they need \nand have earned. Now is not the time to reduce funding levels, and that \nis one reason I urge my colleagues to approve this Omnibus bill.\n  In HUD, Housing and Urban Development, under a continuing resolution, \nthe Section 8 Voucher Program for the needy who get housing through a \nvoucher provided by the Federal Government would be $2.1 billion short. \nThat would result in tens of thousands of low-income families without \nrental subsidy assistance and potentially displace them. Certainly, \nthat is not something we want to see done. That is another reason we \nhave to pass the Omnibus bill.\n\n  For the Federal Housing Administration single family and multifamily \ninsurance fund programs, the continuing resolution's limitations for \nthe mutual mortgage insurance and general insurance/special risk \ninsurance programs will be hit well before the end of the fiscal year. \nThat would result in a suspension of new mortgage activities for a wide \nvariety of home ownership and multifamily housing programs.\n  Moving on to NASA, our space program, under a year-long continuing \nresolution space science activities would be reduced by approximately \n$425 million from the amount included in the 2004 Omnibus \nappropriations conference report on the VA/HUD and independent \nagencies. Space science would be forced to accommodate the reduction by \ncutting missions that are currently in the pre-development phase, both \ntechnology and advanced concepts, which would likely result in delays \nto missions on origins, solar space exploration, and Sun-Earth \nconnections.\n  NASA is also relying on the 2004 omnibus level for the space shuttle \nprogram in order to accommodate return to flight requirements. If \nforced to operate under a full-year CR, the ability of the space \nshuttle to accommodate these return to flight requirements would be \nreduced by nearly $60 million.\n  Finally, the Corporation for National Community Service would be \nforced to limit grant awards to AmeriCorps programs throughout the \ncountry since the CR does not provide adequate funding to reach the \nPresident's goal of 75,000 volunteers. Under a year-long CR, the \ncorporation would only be able to support between 45,000 and 47,000 \nmembers, about 40 percent less than provided under the Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  We went through a period of problems that have occurred in the \nCorporation for National and Community Service. Senator Mikulski and I \nworked to help them straighten out the problems. On a bipartisan basis, \nthey have had strong support for getting back to the great work of the \nmany volunteer programs, including AmeriCorps. Without this funding, \nthere would be a drastic setback and we would find that the level of \nactivity would be significantly reduced.\n  These are just some of the reasons, from the perspective of the VA/\nHUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee bill, which is included in \nthe Omnibus bill, why I hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nagree we need to get on with this bill and go to work on the current \nyear's business. We have far too little time to deal with all of the \nthings we must deal with, and I hope we could get on with the job.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I express my deep concern about several \nprovisions contained in this omnibus legislation. Many of these \nprovisions were in direct contradiction to the bipartisan actions of \nthis Senate and the House of Representatives. It is alarming to me that \nin an Omnibus appropriations bill that the will previously expressed by \nboth the House and the Senate would be contravened so arbitrarily and \nso dramatically. I am concerned about the process, as well as the \nspecific issue that I come to speak about today.\n  First, tucked into this massive spending bill are several out and out \ngifts to the gun lobby. Some were included in a controversial House \namendment and another was slipped into the bill later by the Republican \nleadership without a vote by the House and Senate conferees. That is \nhighly unusual and, in terms of procedure, very dangerous to the \nfunctioning of this body and, indeed, to the constitutional obligations \nwe must perform.\n\n  These provisions, with respect to guns, reduce law enforcement's \nabilities to carry out their responsibility to enforce our Nation's gun \nlaws, and they do not provide any benefit to law-abiding gun owners. \nThe other people who benefit from these provisions are criminals and \nprohibited purchasers, those who should not have firearms, according to \nthe laws of this country. Again, I hear time after time that all we \nshould do with respect to gun safety in this country is just enforce \nthe laws. This is the mantra of the NRA and of the gun advocates. But \nhow can you enforce the laws if law enforcement authorities are \nrequired to destroy information they obtain through the gun sales \nprocedures under the Brady Act?\n  From the beginning, this attack on law enforcement's authority has \nbeen highly suspicious. According to a report in the Washington Post on \nJuly 21, 2003, Representative Todd Tiahrt, in the words of the \nWashington Post ``surprised many of his fellow Republicans'' when he \noffered an amendment in the House Appropriations Committee. In fact, \nRepresentative Frank Wolf, who chairs the Commerce, Justice, State \nSubcommittee on Appropriations, objected to the amendment, saying he \nhad not had time to review it prior to its presentation. But \nRepresentative Tiahrt refused to withdraw the amendment and he won \npassage on a 31-to-30 vote, over the opposition of Chairman Wolf and \nAppropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. Tiahrt assured his colleagues that the NRA had \nreviewed the language. He said, ``I wanted to make sure I was \nfulfilling the needs of my friends who are firearms dealers'' and that \nthe NRA officials ``were helpful in making sure I had my bases \ncovered.''\n  This insertion of language over the objections of the subcommittee \nchairman and the full Appropriations Committee chairman, at the behest \nof the NRA, to take care of your friends who are firearms dealers is \nnot what we should embrace in this Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  In the conference between the House and the Senate, appropriators \nmodified several of the provisions on a bipartisan basis of the \noriginal amendment offered by Representative Tiahrt. But the Republican \nleadership later inserted a most objectionable item over, \npresumptively, the objections of the committee chairman and the \nsubcommittee chairman. The provision would require the FBI to destroy \napproved gun sale records within 24 hours.\n  The 24-hours-records-destruction provision would put more guns in the \nhands of criminals by preventing the FBI from discovering and \ncorrecting erroneous gun sales under the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System.\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n  Currently, approved gun sale records are retained for 90 days to \nallow the FBI to perform audits of the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, to ensure that if criminals or terrorists or \nother prohibited purchasers have acquired such a weapon incorrectly, \nand contrary to law, that these mistakes can be corrected, that the \nguns can be retrieved. This is not an imaginary problem. The General \nAccounting Office found that the during the first 6 months of the 90-\nday retention policy, the FBI used retained records to initiate 235 \nfirearm retrieval actions, of which 228, or 97 percent, could not have \nbeen initiated under the next-day destruction policy required by this \nOmnibus appropriations bill.\n\n  Let me repeat that. In a 6-month period, the auditing of these \nrecords enabled retrieval of 235 firearms that were in the hands of \nprohibited persons--criminals, people who were spouse abusers, the \nwhole category of perpetrators who are prohibited from having firearms \nbecause of their records--235. If this rule were in effect then, they \nwould have recovered 7, leaving 228 with dangerous individuals whose \nconduct has already underscored their unworthiness to carry a firearm. \nThey would have had these weapons. I can't see any other result of this \npolicy than to put more weapons in the hands of identified criminals or \nidentified violent individuals.\n  No one in this country is walking around saying let's give violent \ncriminals more guns. Again, the mantra is: Just enforce the laws. Make \nsure those criminals don't have access to weapons. This provision cuts \nat the heart of all the rhetoric and all the hyperbole about ``just \nenforce the laws'' and ``guns don't kill, criminals kill,'' and exposes \na grotesque miscarriage of justice. That is why organizations such as \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police and the FBI Agents \nAssociation oppose this provision.\n  But that is not all that is included in this Omnibus appropriations \nbill. The bill would also prohibit the ATF, the Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms Bureau, from finalizing a proposed August 2000 rule that would \nrequire gun dealers to conduct an annual physical inventory of the \nweapons in their possession. The purpose of the proposed rule is to \nallow dealers to go ahead and identify missing and stolen firearms and \nreport them to the ATF in a timely fashion.\n  You would think every responsible dealer in this country would \nconduct periodic inventories and, as soon as a weapon was discovered \nmissing or stolen, their first instincts would be to contact \nauthorities. But we know that is not the case because this community of \nWashington, DC suffered through a string of sniper killings months ago \nthat traumatized not only Washington but the entire Nation, and this \nstring of sniper killings can be traced back to a weapon at Bulls Eye \nShooter Supply, the gun seller where John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd \nMalvo obtained the assault rifle used in these attacks. After the \nsnipers were apprehended, the gun was recovered and was traced back to \nBulls Eye. What did they say? They had no record of selling the gun. \nThey didn't even know the gun was missing until the shooting spree was \nover. The snipers' gun was just one of more than 238 firearms missing \nfrom Bulls Eye's inventory during the previous 3 years--a dealer who is \nmissing 238 weapons in a 3-year period, one of which turns out to be \nthe murder weapon in one of the most heinous assaults in the United \nStates in many years. The ATF proposal requiring dealers such as Bulls \nEye to conduct annual physical inventories is still pending. We should \nbe urging them not to suspend this rule but to enact this rule. What \ncould be more commonsensical, more obvious, after the sniper killings \nin Washington, than allowing the ATF to promulgate a rule so there is \nat least a physical inventory and requirement to report missing \nweapons?\n  We have learned nothing from the deaths of these people. We have \nlearned nothing from the death of Conrad Johnson, a bus driver sitting \nin his bus reading his paper at 6:30 in the morning, supporting his \nfamily--his wife and his children--who was killed by these snipers.\n\n  This, to me, is preposterous. Yet here we are, trying to take an \nomnibus bill, holding billions of dollars in appropriations for all the \nprograms my colleague from Missouri talked about that we all support--\nholding them hostage to provisions like this, to provisions that fly in \nthe face of our experience and that undercut all the rhetoric when we \ntalked about learning from the mistakes of the past, from ensuring that \ncriminals don't have weapons, from enforcing the laws. We are \nundercutting the ability of law enforcement to do their job.\n  Finally, this bill prohibits release of any information regarding \nfirearms production or sale that is required to be kept by gun dealers \nor manufacturers. In addition, no information or records regarding \nmultiple handgun sales--where two or more handguns are sold to the same \nbuyer within 5 days--or crime-gun-tracing information that is reported \nto the ATF could be reported to the public. No, let's throw a cloak of \nsilence over all of these laws, eviscerate the regulation, and prevent \nany disclosure of information that should be public.\n  ATF has in the past made this information available under the Freedom \nof Information Act, but this information has been used to highlight \nsome of the discrepancies and difficulties and deficiencies in our gun \nlaws. As a result, the gun lobby doesn't want it out: No information, \nno knowledge, no problem. That is not right. There are problems here, \nproblems we should address responsibly, and we are undercutting a \nresponsible approach to ensuring that the present laws on the books are \nenforced. So the next time someone stands up and says just enforce the \nlaws, remember you can't enforce the laws if you don't know how they \nare being enforced--and that is the purpose of this provision--and you \ncertainly can't require law enforcement authorities to enforce laws \nwhen they are prohibited from having the information to do that.\n  This is an important right for the public to know, particularly with \nrespect to firearms tracing from crime scenes. As a result of publicly \navailable information, there have been identified several firearms \ndealers who were the source of a preponderance of weapons at crime \nscenes. That is valuable information, not only to law enforcement \nauthorities but to the general public, and that information should be \npublic.\n  We are facing numerous problems about gun violence. We have the \nthreat of terrorism. Last night the President spoke repeatedly about \nterrorists. This is a situation made to be manipulated by terrorists \nwho want firearms. If the record of their purchases is destroyed in 24 \nhours, if there is no requirement for an inventory of weapons, think of \nhow we are setting out a situation that can be exploited, not just by \ncriminals but by people with even more malign designs on this country. \nWe are doing it and we are doing it in the middle of the night, \nfiguratively speaking. None of these issues was fully debated, \nparticularly the destruction of records within 24 hours. Procedurally \nwe should reject it. Substantively we should reject it.\n  There is another issue we should be concerned about that many of my \ncolleagues mentioned, and that is the overtime rule for American \nworkers.\n  Last year, the administration announced its proposal to significantly \nweaken overtime protection. The proposal would take away from many \nhard-working Americans their ability to earn enough to support their \nfamilies. The timing of this proposal is even more egregious. It comes \nduring a period when more and more Americans are struggling to make \nends meet and while the country is bleeding jobs overseas.\n  It was announced this week that IBM was going to hire 15,000 people \nthis year. The only problem is that they are only going to hire about \n1,500 in the United States.\n  Yet for those people who are struggling to find jobs, to keep jobs, \nand to better their lives, we are telling the employers they do not \nhave to pay overtime. It doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't make \nsense to this Senate because on September 10, the Senate passed a \nmeasure to prevent millions of American workers from being stripped of \ntheir overtime. We acted in a bipartisan fashion. In doing so, we \nreaffirmed our support for protecting these hard-working Americans.\n  Unfortunately, safeguards to overtime pay were stripped out at the \nPresident's request, again leaving Americans vulnerable.\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\n  At a time when the President is talking about job growth and \nproviding additional benefits to families, why does he want to weaken \nthe laws designed to create jobs and to protect hard-working Americans? \nWe know what is happening today. Employers are not hiring full-time \nworkers. They are extending the hours of their existing workforce \nbecause of the pressures they face. When you lower the number of people \nwho qualify for overtime pay, that is an incentive to continue that \npractice of simply extending the hours of current workers and not \nhiring new workers. This will go against our hopes by all, I believe, \nthat this year our economy can start hiring people again--not simply \nadding a few hours to the workday of existing workers. But certainly \nthose few hours of additional work deserve to be compensated by \novertime. This law cuts it. About 11 million workers receive overtime \npay. Many understaffed fields such as nursing are required by law in \nmany communities to pay mandatory overtime. Yet under this rule, that \nmandatory overtime would not in all cases be compensated.\n  Other workers rely on this extra income simply to make ends meet. The \npeople who are in danger of losing their benefits are health care \nworkers and technicians, paralegals, restaurant workers, draftsmen, \ntherapists, retail managers, news reporters, police officers, \nfirefighters, and even military reservists.\n  What I find most objectionable is that this proposal basically says \nthat reservists who are coming back who have had certain kinds of \ntraining in the Armed Forces are no longer considered eligible for \novertime pay. This is preposterous. These individuals could literally \nhave left their employment a few months ago to respond to the call of \nthe Nation in a time of danger and receive some training while they are \nin the military, or have that training before on the weekends as a \nreservist, and now find themselves penalized for the training they \nreceived in the military in terms of getting overtime pay. That is \npreposterous. That is what this rule would do. It could affect \nthousands of military reservists. That is not only unfortunate in \nindividual cases, but that is a stunning snub to Americans who are \nrisking their lives in serving their country collectively.\n  I again am amazed that such a proposal would even be submitted, and I \nam more amazed that we would, today, be prepared to vote on it in this \nOmnibus appropriations bill.\n  American workers work more hours than any others in the world--1,900 \nhours per year. Yet, still, they need more to get by and to make ends \nmeet.\n  I am amazed that the administration would continue on this track of \nundercutting overtime in the United States, and I am extremely \ndisappointed. Rather than trying to undercut the wages of Americans, we \nshould be looking for ways to increase the wages of Americans.\n  I think these two provisions are problematic. Many more of my \ncolleagues have spoken about that and have called into serious question \nboth the procedures that brought us here and certainly the substance of \nthese proposals.\n  At this time, in conclusion, I would like to propound a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of a concurrent resolution which I shall send to the desk \ncorrecting the enrollment of the omnibus conference report; the \nresolution strikes the language which requires the FBI to destroy gun \npurchase background check information after 24 hours; that the current \nresolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a time of challenge, and it is \ntime for the Senate to step up to meet those challenges.\n  As the President carefully outlined last night, because of the \nfilibuster in the Omnibus appropriations bill we find the Senate almost \n5 months into the fiscal year still wrestling with the remaining \nfunding bills from the year in which we are currently involved. We \nstarted a new calendar year trying to finish the business of last year. \nThe Omnibus legislation is finished, and it is ready to pass except for \nthe filibuster. With its passage, the Senate will finally complete last \nyear's business.\n  To be sure, much of the Nation's business was accomplished by the \nSenate last year. We had hoped to be able to finish the appropriations \nbusiness last December. In fact, last year the President called for an \neconomic growth package to create jobs. The Senate passed it, and that \nplan is clearly working.\n  Last year, the President called for a Medicare drug plan so that our \nseniors would never have to choose ever again between groceries and \nneeded prescription drugs. The Senate passed it and that help is on the \nway for our seniors.\n  Last year, the President called for full funding for homeland \nsecurity. The Senate passed it, and America is safer.\n  Last year, the President called for funding of the liberation and \nreconstruction of Iraq. The Senate passed it and freedom is rising.\n  In normal times, that would be indeed a phenomenal record. But these \nare not normal times. These are times of unprecedented challenges.\n  The Senate's historic pattern of studious delay is out of touch with \nthese demanding times in which we find ourselves.\n  This filibuster needs to come to an end. To that end, each Senator \nmust ask themselves the following questions about the funding of the \nGovernment: Should funding for most Federal departments and agencies be \nat the levels we agreed to in the last budget resolution, which we \nnegotiated with the President, or should it be funded at a lower level \nand perhaps not at all? Should we fund the FBI at $320 million less \nthan we planned, even though most of that goes to their \ncounterterrorism activities? Should we fund embassy security at the \nState Department with the extra $15 million we agreed it needs for \nsafety? Should we improve food security by providing the Food Safety \nInspection Service with the additional $20 million we agreed to? Should \nwe keep faith with those who have borne the brunt of battle in the war \non terrorism by providing veterans medical care with the extra $3.1 \nbillion we agreed to?\n\n  These questions obviously answer themselves. Instead, we wrestle with \nthese questions still as we try to fund these programs. As we try to \nfund the Government for this year at the levels agreed upon in last \nyear's budget resolution, we cannot begin to set the budget priorities \nfor next year. The Senate cannot meet the demands of tomorrow if we \nare, today, revisiting the agreements of yesterday.\n  The demands of tomorrow are not going to go away. As the President \nstated last night: We may believe the danger of terrorism is behind us. \nThat hope is understandable, comforting--and false.\n  The President is right. We have done much to improve America's \nsecurity: our economic security, our health security, our homeland \nsecurity, and our national security. But it is false hope, indeed, to \nbelieve we have done all that can be done or should be done. Economic \nsecurity is improving as the economy grows and the unemployment rate \ndeclines. Health security has improved with enactment of a prescription \ndrug benefit in Medicare for seniors and enactment of health security \naccounts for workers.\n  While homeland security has also improved, more must and can be done, \nbut not if we are wrestling with the FBI budget of last year.\n  The national security needs in the coming years require our full \nattention, but that is not possible if we are still fighting to fully \nfund the State Department embassy security for last year.\n  Thomas Jefferson advised us that eternal vigilance is the price of \nfreedom. Ever since he stated those words, America has tried to assess \nhow they apply to us at a particular time and as we confront a \nparticular challenge. The President has assessed the unprecedented \nchallenges of our times and provided unprecedented leadership.\n  Our Nation has responded to the challenges as well. From issues of \nsecurity to issues of prosperity, our country is moving forward behind \nthe President's leadership.\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\n  The Senate should respond as well. But when we delay this bill for no \nreason other than for delay itself, we are not meeting the challenges \nof our time. This is a bill that should have been passed months ago.\n  There is a price for delay. We see it in the reduced funding of the \nFBI, embassy security, food security, and, of course, veterans health \nbenefits.\n  We cannot yet see the price we will pay tomorrow for our delay today, \nbut it is surely there. We delay setting the priorities for next year \nand building upon the security we have achieved in the last 3 years. We \ndelay making our Nation safer and we delay making our economy stronger.\n  In these times of challenge, the time for delay is over and the time \nto act is now. It is my hope and the hope of many Senators on both \nsides of the aisle that tomorrow we will be able to wrap up the \nbusiness of last year, finally, and get this important Omnibus \nappropriations bill down to the President for his signature so we can \nbegin the work of the year in which we currently find ourselves.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is here. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer who was entitled \nto go next. Before she got down here, we intervened and asked her if it \nwould be possible I go ahead of her. So I will be next. We are trying \nnot to break the commitment of one side and then the other side, but I \nwill not be here if I cannot speak now. I am on my way to New Mexico to \nmeet the President, ultimately in Roswell, NM.\n  Mr. President, I said yesterday to a large group of Senators that it \nis about time now to speak about the energy situation in America since \nwe have a bill before the Senate that missed, in terms of filibuster, \nby two votes. That means that in normal times that bill would have \npassed handsomely.\n  What is happening around here, if you do not get your way, instead of \nvoting on a bill, you threaten to filibuster. The American people have \nprobably seen more 60-vote issues in the Senate in the last 5 years \nthan in modern history. Almost every issue is turned into a 60-vote \nissue by a threat to filibuster. That was done on the Energy bill.\n  My friends, I can state what is happening but most of it is right in \nfront of your face. We have the worst case scenario in much of the \nenergy-consuming areas of the country, from the Rockies to New England, \nwith the coldest 10- to 20-day period since the winters of 1977 and \n1978. It was 14 degrees at my house this morning a block and a half \nfrom the Hart Building. Accuweather is predicting within 2 weeks we \ncould have the coldest weather we have seen in 25 years.\n  Some people love the cold. Some people love the snow. But the point \nis America should not be brought to its knees economically and \notherwise because we have a cold winter. We are looking at a point in \ntime not too far down the line when the major sources of energy for \nAmericans will be so expensive that the American people will wonder \nwhat happened.\n  I am stating what is happening: Three or four Senators will not let \nus pass an Energy bill. That is what is happening.\n  Yesterday, natural gas was over $6.50. To put that in perspective, \nwhen I first came to the Senate people--people can look at me and guess \nhow long that was; some would say I look as if I have been here 100 \nyears; some might say 15 years. I have been here 31 years. Ten years \nafter I came here, we were talking about deregulating natural gas and \nthe price of natural gas was 38 cents. Compare that to $6.50.\n  We can look around the world and see what is happening. The great big \nmonster economy called China has decided they do not have enough energy \nfor their growth. They cannot find a way to quench their thirst for \noil. Nobody knew that. It just came upon us. China, the fastest growing \neconomy in the world, has put the word out: Buy oil. And even more than \nthat: Buy the oilfields. Go invest money with oil companies and start \nowning the oil in the world. The underlying theme is China's thirst for \nnatural gas, as well as to fuel its industrial revolution.\n  Yesterday, China reported economic growth of 9.9 percent. When there \nare over a billion people--1.3 billion or 1.4 billion--and they finally \ndecide to take on some aspects of capitalism, they are producing \noverwhelming amounts of goods and services for themselves and for the \nworld. Whether their leaders call themselves Communists or not, they \nlove dollars and they love to produce things and sell to the world. \nThey are a huge problem. But China is not alone. The population and \neconomic growth is creating a voracious new demand for energy and the \nworld is following in our footsteps.\n  The bottom line is we are allowing ourselves to become increasingly \ndependent upon imported energy. We used to say ``imported oil.'' Now I \ncan say ``imported energy'' because we are beginning to import, or will \nhave to soon, natural gas, liquefied natural gas. We will have to buy \nthat from overseas. And we ourselves will become dependent upon foreign \nnatural gas just as we have grown dependent on oil but it will happen \nquicker and be more devastating.\n  Yesterday, unknown to most, a terrible event occurred with reference \nto the production of LNG, natural gas's substitute. A plant blew up in \nAlgeria. Who would have been worried about it? Why would a Senator from \nNew Mexico even have read about it 10 years ago? Well, we did not care \nabout it because we did not use it. But a plant blew up. Forty-three \npeople died, and all the production of LNG went out the window. Now, \nthat is not our production. I should not be here crying about their \nlosing it. But what I am telling you is, they are not producing LNG to \ngive it away. They are producing it to sell and to sell to us.\n  The bottom line is, we are allowing ourselves to become dependent \nupon imported energy. The EIA predicts that 36 percent of all our \nenergy will come from overseas by the year 2025; up from 26 percent in \n2002. Just think of that.\n  I believe some of my colleagues who do not like the current Energy \nbill and who want to duck and hope the energy prices will come down are \ngoing to just wait and see. They will not be coming down; they are \ngoing to go up. And when the question is asked, what did we do about \nit, it is going to be easy for some of us. We are going to say there \nwas a chance to pass a bill, and because of two Senators it did not \npass. Two Senators decided they would not vote for cloture, so the \nEnergy bill, which would have done a lot of things which I will quickly \noutline in a moment, was not passed.\n  First, let me tell you about a couple things that we hear about often \nthat the bill does not have in it. The bill does not have a change in \nthe CAFE standards on automobiles. Because of that, some of my friends \non the other side of the aisle, including the distinguished junior \nSenator from New Mexico, say this bill should have that in it and we \nhave shirked our duty.\n  Let me say to all of you, what do you do when one House of the \nCongress does not want something? And what do you do when you cannot \npass it in the Senate, you cannot pass CAFE standards in the Senate, \nand if you passed it in the Senate, the House will not take it? Let's \ntalk it up. It might be something we ought to be doing, but you cannot \ndo it. Does it mean we should quit, and it does not mean that is enough \nto kill a bill?\n  Secondly, MTBE liability. You all know what that is. It is in the \nbill because the House insisted upon it. Is it the end of the world? I \ndo not think so. Is it enough to kill an energy bill? I doubt it.\n  A renewable portfolio standard means one group wants to not only give \na wonderful tax credit to windmills and solar energy, but they want to \nmandate a percentage each State must produce. That is what these words \nmean: renewable portfolio standard. It is a mandate of a percent. Isn't \nthat interesting? Every State does not have wind, but they are mandated \nto produce a percent of their energy from wind. Can you imagine what is \ngoing to happen administratively? They are going to have to buy credits \nor they are going to have to do something, because this law would do \nthat.\n  Frankly, the Senate did not want it, and the House did not want it, \nbut a few people said: We will not vote for the bill unless that is \nincluded. How do you put it in when over half the people in both bodies \nwill not vote for it? Certainly, the House told us, in 30 seconds: Do \nnot talk about a percentage, a mandate. We will never put it before the\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nHouse. We do not want it. That is the end of it.\n  Now, we all know ANWR is still hanging around, we all know the giant \nissue of offshore drilling is still hanging around, and they are not in \nthis bill.\n  Like it or leave it, the bill represents the current consensus \nposition of the Congress. If we were looking at 51 votes being \nnecessary, which is what you usually need, this bill would be over \nwith, the points of order would be done with, and we would be on our \nway to doing what it does.\n  I believe the deal before us is the only one that does enough, that \ncan currently be reached. I do not believe it is possible to go back to \nthe table and negotiate a different agreement. Why? Because whatever we \nbring to the floor will be debated ad nauseam.\n  The last time we tried to pass a bill to go to the House with, you \nall remember, there were 370-plus amendments pending up there at the \ndesk when we struck a deal with the Democrats to take last year's bill. \nRemember that? That meant they were not very interested in helping us \nget a bill then. That is something I direct at a number of Democrats \nwho might not have thought they were doing that, but that is what they \ndid. Luckily, the minority leader said: Why don't you take last year's \nbill, and I told our leader, Bill Frist: Take it. I think they could \nnot imagine we would take it. We took it and went to conference. And \nthen, of course, we could negotiate around all the bills.\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know if we are going to be able to get 60 votes for \nthis agreement--I do not know if we are going to be able to, but, \nfrankly, there is part of me that is quite all right with that. As \nprices and imports rise, Members are going to begin to reconsider their \nposition. They are going to begin to reconsider their opposition to \ndomestic production. I believe at some point, if we do not take \nintervening steps, we will be forced to open ANWR.\n  I say to the occupant of the chair, which you have been advocating \nsince the day you arrived, and for the many days you were in your State \nlegislature, unless we get control of this situation, I think we will \nfind ourselves confronted with that decision, sooner rather than later.\n  As much as we possibly can, without a new political consensus about \nenergy, this bill addresses the following problems. This is a minimal \nlist.\n  One, it makes regulation of the electricity grid predictable so new \ninvestment can flow into the transmission system. It is a huge part of \nour problem.\n  Two, it encourages massive new construction of windmills--60 \ngigawatts is expected, at a minimum, of new wind power, about 10 times \nthe current amount. Why? Because this bill makes the production tax \ncredit permanent. And listen up. It expired as of January 1. It is not \nthere for those who are building windmills. They know it is gone. It is \nin this bill. It is there for biomass and a lot of other things.\n  Now it makes a new generation of clean coal possible through tax \ncredits and research and development. As gas prices climb, we are going \nto burn more coal. I would like that to be as clean as possible, and \nthis bill makes that possible.\n  It results in more domestic oil and gas production.\n  It will result in the construction of perhaps four nuclear \npowerplants. Some other things have to happen, but it opens the door.\n  Frankly, I believe that for this world crisis I have been talking \nabout, of everybody wanting more energy, there are only a few ways to \ndampen the impact of that on the world. One of them is going to be new, \nmodern, different nuclear powerplants. No doubt about it, that is going \nto be one of them. America led the way. We ought to continue leading \nthe way.\n  This bill will result in encouraging the use of hybrid cars because \nthere is a big tax credit for them. In fact, those companies that are \nexploring them believe they could never sell them without the credit \nprovided in this bill.\n  It massively expands our use of domestically produced ethanol, \nmeaning our farmers will be more in command of their future and their \ndestiny than ever before.\n  Needless to say, bills do strange things. This bill is more for the \nfarmers than anything else we have ever done. Everybody knows it. I \nasked yesterday in the presence of 30 Senators, those who have big \nfarms and much corn production, would you tell me what the most \nimportant issue in your State is? Is it ethanol? Every farm State \nSenator in that room said it is the No. 1 issue in their States.\n\n  How many times have we taken the floor of this Senate since Senator \nReid and I have been here, when Senators have come and said: We have to \ndo this for all the farmers? It just happens that the farmers are in \nthis bill. It is going to produce a substantial amount of gasoline \nbecause ethanol is an additive that will expand the use of gasoline \nimmensely. So throw it away because you don't like some provision or \nyou believe what many have been saying about this bill--that it has too \nmuch pork in it.\n  Well, I can tell you that if we have time available at another time, \nwe will talk about the pork. I will tell you about one piece, and it \nhas been written many times because one Senator used it on the floor \ntwice. It has to do with a new plant that might be built in my State, \nwhich will be the construction of a new plant for highly enriched \nuranium. We only have one such company in America. Shameful. We used to \nhave all that market. This company that exists now doesn't want a new \none built. They have sent to Senators and newspapers around the country \nan unsigned document where they maliciously and erroneously talk about \nthat plant. Some people have refused to use it, thank you, because they \ndidn't sign it. Nobody signed it. But somebody used it on the floor of \nthe Senate and said that New Mexico stood to gain $500 million to $700 \nmillion, and what a shame that such pork is in the bill.\n  That isn't even in the bill. Read it. It says anybody who wants to \nbuild a new plant of that type, two things will happen--it says \nanywhere, not just New Mexico. The license will be approved in 2 years \nand, second, if they want to make an agreement for the Federal \nGovernment to dispose of their waste, they can make one, and they will \nhave to pay the Federal Government full price. What this company--which \nwants no competitor to be built--did was price out what you might have \nto pay the Government, and then said we are giving it to a State--a \ntotal unequivocal fabrication.\n  Many of the other so-called lard matters in this bill have been \nmatters that have been around here for years for States that produce \nmuch of our oil and gas. They finally got a chance to have some equity \ndone to them. When you finally get there and you have the best package \nyou could ever put together, I don't know why we have Senators who find \nexcuses. I think it is because they don't believe there is anything \nthat can be laid to rest on their shoulders in terms of what they have \ndone for this great country and what they have failed to do.\n  I actually believe that of all the things domestically that the \nPresident of the United States mentioned, and all the things we will be \ndebating, there is nothing more important than what we do about our \nenergy availability for future generations. It is No. 1 in my book. You \nhave not heard much from me because, after working for months on it, I \nwas shocked that I could not get 60 to vote to get around a filibuster. \nI believe sooner or later those who have done this to this bill will \npay the piper politically. I say to our President: I believe you ought \nto be pushing this bill a lot harder.\n  Some worry about its cost. Let me tell you, the cost of this bill is \ninfinitesimal compared to the cost to future generations of not \nproducing natural gas from Alaska, leaving it up there instead of \nbringing it down here, and all the things like that which are in this \nbill. It is absolutely crazy. Costs, say some, are too much. If \neverything has to be paid for, and it goes the way it says, it is $1.6 \nbillion a year. Do you know what that means? Americans spend $400 \nbillion a year on energy. If that is going up 10 percent, when the rest \nof the domestic product is only growing at 2 percent, that would be an \n8-percent differential. Just do the arithmetic. Eight percent times 400 \nis $32 billion a year in cost growth being put on the backs of hard-\nworking Americans.\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n  It is time we talk real sense about this. I will not let it go. But \nyou all know there is only so much you can do and only so much of \nyourself that you can give to an issue. You have one thing growing up \nafter another that people invent and argue about, and that same person \njust fails to want to argue about the validity of the entire bill. It \nis truly something that we would look at America and say we love \ndemocracy and we love to vote, but this is one that it sure would be \ngood if some of these things could be done by the President of the \nUnited States. Not so. Can't be. We have to go do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Byrd has time that has been \nreserved. He has indicated to me that he is going to speak for 2 hours. \nHe will be here at 12:30 to begin his important discussion about the \nbill now before the Senate.\n  I understand the intensity and sincerity of the feelings of the \nSenator from New Mexico. As Senators know, he and I have worked \ntogether for many years on the Appropriations Committee, the Energy and \nWater Subcommittee, which is a very important part of our Government. \nHe has been chairman, I have been chairman, and we have worked together \nand developed a tremendous amount of affection for each other. I repeat \nthat I know how strongly he feels about this legislation. There may be \nsome who feel differently about this bill, and whether their feelings \nare as intense as his is not important. But there are people who feel \nvery strongly about this and they have problems with this bill. I hope \nbefore this year's end we can work toward having an Energy bill for \nthis country.\n  There are things in the bill that are extremely important to the \nState of Nevada. I have personally told Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley how I think they have done remarkably good work, generally \nspeaking, with the tax provisions of the Energy bill. So I hope that at \nsome time we have the ability to work something out on this \nlegislation. I know I will make myself available to the Senator from \nNew Mexico to see if there is a way we can narrow the gap. As the \nSenator from New Mexico knows, there may be two, three, or four \nSenators who are crucial to coming up with finality to this bill. If we \ncan work something out to satisfy those individuals and not lose some \non the other side, maybe we can do something.\n\n  I want to say this, though, to my friend from New Mexico, not in \nrelation to the Energy bill but to the underlying bill. The Senator \nwent to some length talking about things that both bodies did not agree \non and people are upset that it is not in this Energy bill. Well, I can \nunderstand why the Senator from New Mexico, being the legislator that \nhe is, cannot understand why if the House and the Senate by their \nbodies assembled have not approved legislation, how in the world you \nthink the conference committee can stick it in when both bodies have \nnot agreed to it. With the omnibus bill, you have the opposite \nsituation. In the omnibus bill now before the Senate, you have the \nSenate and the House duly assembled who have voted overwhelmingly to \nsupport provisions, and the President and his minions go to the \nconference committee and say you are going to take these things out or \nyou are not going to get a bill.\n  Are they things that don't matter? No. They are very important. For \nexample, overtime. The President wants people who make more than \n$22,000 a year to not be eligible for overtime pay. The House and the \nSenate said we don't agree with the President, and we passed \nlegislation by virtue of amendments in this body and in the House which \nsaid you cannot do that, Mr. President. The President said: I don't \ncare what you have done in these two legislative bodies. I want it out.\n  Now, if that wasn't bad enough, he goes to an issue that is so \nimportant--and I repeat on the Senate floor today that Monday night we \nhad a little family gathering, which we call ``family home evenings.'' \nWe had our children and we went to this Caribbean restaurant with my \nthree grandchildren who live in Washington, and my daughter and son-in-\nlaw, Landra and I. My little 13-year-old granddaughter has had \nmononucleosis. She has been sick and has missed a lot of school. She \ncame to dinner. She is feeling better. She attended school yesterday. \nShe was real hungry Monday night. One of the things with mono is you \ndon't have an appetite. She was hungry. She ordered something she \nreally liked, steak and fries. It had a fancy name for it, but that is \nwhat it was. She ordered steak and fries.\n\n  While we were in conversation, I heard her say to her brother who is \n8 years old: Aiden, would you like some mad cow? Here are my \ngrandchildren. They know this is bad. We know there is no way to \nprevent the beef that goes into this restaurant from coming from \nArgentina, Mexico, or Bolivia. I don't know where else they raise beef. \nCanada. We know they raise beef there. Even my grandchildren are \nconcerned about mad cow disease.\n  In the bill that we wanted to come before this body, there was a \nprovision in it that said you have to have a country-of-origin labeling \non the meat that is sold to consumers. The President said: I don't care \nwhat the House and Senate have done; they passed these overwhelmingly, \nbut I don't care because I want to take care of my corporate friends, \nand my corporate friends say country-of-origin labeling is not good; I \ndon't care about mad cow or hoof-and-mouth disease; if you want a bill, \nyou take this out. The Republican leadership in the House and Senate \nsaid: OK, Mr. President. And they took it out.\n  So now this bill, which will probably pass tomorrow, does not have \nthat provision in it. Country-of-origin labeling is not in the bill.\n  I don't think that is a real good deal. It is too bad. But he did the \nsame thing with how much ownership these big broadcasters can have.\n  I didn't come here to talk about this, but with what Senator Domenici \nsaid about if you don't put something in a bill, how do you expect it \nto be stuck in conference, I say if you put stuff in a bill that is \npassed by two duly assembled bodies, how in Heaven's name can the \nPresident in conference demand it be taken out? He has done it, \nespecially on issues that deal with the average American: overtime and \nlabeling of beef. It is another example of this President being the \nPresident for corporate America and not the people who work for those \ncorporations.\n  Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the administration wants \nto increase Medicare payments to insurance companies and HMOs by a \nrecord 10.6 percent. This handout, which is five times as large as the \ntypical increase, was mandated by the new Medicare law that passed this \nbody by one vote.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates those extra payments to \nprivate plans will total more than $500 million this year and over the \nnext decade $14 billion; $14 billion extra, added on that the taxpayers \nare going to shell out to insurance companies and these health care \nproviders.\n  We could do a lot of things with $14 billion. Instead of this \nhandout, maybe there are ways we could use the $14 billion to help \nNevada. People in Nevada need health insurance. There are in America \ntoday 44 million Americans who have no health insurance, and Nevada is \nat the top of the list. We could cut health care costs paid by \npatients, improve the care they receive, and expand coverage. \nFor example, the direct benefit created by the new Medicare bill is \nconfusing and certainly inadequate. Instead of wasting $14 billion on \nthis handout, we should use that money to give seniors the drug \ncoverage they need and not give it as a sop to the insurance industry.\n\n  Under the new Medicare law, a senior must spend $810 out of pocket \nper year before he or she will receive a penny from Medicare. And a \nsenior who spends $5,000 a year on drugs will be stuck with almost 80 \npercent of the bill. Essentially, this law will penalize our sickest \nseniors, the very ones who need help the most.\n  The new law has a huge gap in coverage. Listen to this. Once a senior \nspends $2,250 on prescription drugs, he or she will have to pay the \nfull price for drugs until they get up to $5,100. Obviously, these \npeople who are using $2,100 worth of drugs are sick. That doesn't \nmatter. There is a hole, a big hole until they hit $5,100. They pay it \nall. But they have to continue to pay premiums the whole time.\n  Instead of a handout to the insurance industry, we could use the $14 \nbillion to\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\nprotect senior citizens who will actually be worse off under the new \nMedicare bill. In Nevada, 15,000 seniors stand to lose the coverage \nthey currently receive from former employers, and our poorest seniors \nin Nevada, those who receive both Medicaid and Medicare, will be forced \nto pay a copay under the new law, something they don't have to do at \npresent. This will create a new expense which will be a significant \nburden for those with chronic conditions and disease who are struggling \nto make ends meet on fixed incomes.\n  We can use the money to provide a drug benefit now instead of waiting \n2 years while our seniors struggle with the rising cost of drugs. It \ntook less than a year to start the entire Medicare Program, and that \nwas before we had computers. Surely, we can add a drug benefit in less \nthan 2 years.\n  Finally, we need to expand health care coverage. As I said, there are \n44 million people in our country who don't have health care coverage at \nall. In Nevada, a sparsely populated State, 600,000 people under age 65 \nwere without health insurance last year. Most of these people, \nincluding children, are working families. They go to work every day, \nbut they can't afford the peace of mind that comes with health \ninsurance, so how can we afford an HMO handout of $14 billion?\n  My youngest son who is a lawyer and worked here in Washington got a \nnew job in Las Vegas. He is educated. He has two little girls and, in a \nmatter of days, is going to have a third little girl. He could afford \nthe gap coverage until he got his new job. Most people couldn't do \nthat. For just I think 2 weeks he had to pay $1,200 to have coverage \nfor his family. Most people can't do that. Most people have these big \ngaps, and they are stuck when an automobile accident or something \nhappens to them in the way of illness and they have no insurance.\n  I want to make it clear that I am not opposed to private health care \nplans in Medicare. I have received letters from senior citizens in \nNevada who told me they are enrolled in Medicare HMOs, and they have \ntold me they are happy with the care they receive.\n  I am not opposed to competition. Make no mistake; competition is a \ngood thing. It is a strong incentive for efficiency and productivity. I \nthink this administration has a different definition of competition \nthan I have.\n  They are all in favor of competition when it comes to a worker in a \nnational park who might be making $30,000 a year. They think people \nlike that should compete with private contractors to keep their jobs. \nBut when it comes to big corporations, such as HMOs, the administration \ndoesn't like competition. Why else would a company such as Halliburton \nget a billion-dollar contract without even submitting a bid? That is \nnot competition.\n  Why does the new Medicare bill contain a provision that expressly \nforbids the Government to use its bargaining power to negotiate prices \nwith drug companies? Is that how the free market is supposed to work? \nNo. Now we have a handout for insurance companies.\n  We were told it would be good to let private companies compete with \ntraditional Medicare because they would be more efficient which would \nallow them to provide better care and less costs.\n  While I am talking about privatizing, don't forget last night the \nPresident again in his State of the Union Address talked about \nprivatizing Social Security. I have to hand it to him, he has a lot of \nnerve because it is rare I find anyone who wants to privatize Social \nSecurity. He had some buzz words, but that is what it all meant.\n  These private companies that compete with traditional Medicare now \nhave their hand out for a 10.6-percent increase because they say it is \nthe only way they can continue to serve Medicare patients. That does \nnot sound very efficient to me. It does not sound like competition. It \ndoes not sound like a great deal for seniors who are struggling to buy \nmedicine or for taxpayers. It certainly does not sound like real \ncompetition.\n  This HMO handout to the insurance industry and the managed care \nentities is an example of the way the administration has one set of \nrules for the big-money interests, the corporate interests, and another \nset of rules for people who work for these corporations.\n  Competition is OK for ordinary folks, but the fat cats get sweet \ndeals like the HMO handouts.\n  This is a case of misplaced priorities, just like the misplaced \npriority of spending $14 billion on a corporate handout instead of \nusing it to improve health care for ordinary Americans. This is just \none more reason we need to work to fix the problems in Medicare so \nseniors will have the coverage they deserve. I hope the administration \nwill take another look at its priorities and reconsider this ill-\nadvised HMO handout. According to the State of the Union last night, he \nhas his veto pen ready in case we try to do it.\n  Before I yield the floor and before Senator Byrd speaks, we have been \ngone for a few months and it is good that I remind myself on occasion \nhow I have been educated in the years I have been in Congress, now more \nthan two decades, by the senior Senator from the State of West \nVirginia. Better than any movie, any ball game, any recreational \nactivity that I can think of, I have had more fun learning from the \nSenator from West Virginia. I still look back with almost reverence to \nhis lectures on the line-item veto, on why it should not be done and \nwhy we would be like the Roman Empire. It would be the beginning of the \nend of legislative power. It would be the beginning of the end of this \ngreat Government that we so much admire.\n  I remind the Senator from West Virginia, those lectures--and I call \nthem lectures because they were done by someone who knows as much as \nany professor about the Roman Empire--they were done so well that at \nthe University of Nevada Las Vegas, the head of the political science \ndepartment taught a course based simply on the lectures of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. So whether he is talking about Iraq, as he has done \nso well, about homeland security, about the energy policy in this \ncountry, about the State of West Virginia and what needs to be done \nwith transportation and what needs to be done in this country, all of \nthese many subjects have been lots of fun for this Senator from Nevada. \nI have been educated, and I am a better Senator and a better person and \nthe State of Nevada has done better by me as a result of learning so \nmuch from the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the very distinguished Democratic whip for his \ngracious comments. He has been an inspiration to me. I once served as \nthe majority whip in the Senate. I counted myself a good whip, but \nremember those lines: You are a better man than I am, Gunga Din.\n  Well, this whip from Nevada is the best whip that I can recall in my \nlong service in this Senate, and I am a former whip.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada mentioned ball games. No ball \ngame ever changed the course of history. With all due respect to those \nwho like football, basketball, and baseball--and I like them, too. I \nused to enjoy playing baseball in the sandlot back in the days when \nBabe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were in that great murderous lineup, the New \nYork Yankees. I can remember September 1927 when the sultan of swat, \nBabe Ruth, broke the record with 60 home runs that year.\n  The Senator's mention of the line-item veto is of interest. I was \nright in what I had to say about the line-item veto. I know certain \nSenators whom I personally asked to vote against that line-item veto, \nand they did not. They did not heed my admonishments, but the Supreme \nCourt of the United States called that law invalid. Thank God for the \nSupreme Court of the United States in that instance.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I want to talk about the 2004 omnibus \nconference report on those bills. The Senate opened the second session \nto the 108th Congress not many hours ago. While the year on the \ncalendar has changed from the last time we met in this Chamber, the \nSenate finds itself handcuffed by the same authoritarian dictates from \nthe same Bush administration that last year led to some of the most \nfierce partisan passions that this Senate has seen in decades. Gone is \nthe traditional spirit of cooperation. Yes, the man in the White House \nwho said that he was going to change the\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\ntone in Washington, he changed that tone all right. It is the worst \nthat I have seen in my more than 51 years in Congress. Gone is that \ntraditional spirit of cooperation. Gone is the belief that the needs of \nthe Nation are above the needs of any political party. In their place \nis an agenda driven by pure rank, raw partisanship. This is a tragic \nturn for this historic Chamber, a tragic turn for these United States \nof America.\n  Hope for a bipartisan Medicare prescription drug benefit was bright \nat the start of this Congress, but by the time the conference report \nreturned to the Senate for final passage, all that was left was a \nprescription for protecting the pharmaceutical industry and a drug \nbenefit that is a sham for American seniors.\n  Progress on an energy strategy for the country began in a cooperative \neffort but quickly the Democrats were locked out while industry \nlobbyists were welcomed in to write the conference report with the \nexecutive branch.\n  The fiscal year 2004 appropriations bills have suffered a similar \nfate. Between June 26 and September 4 of last year, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee reported all 13 appropriations bills, bills \nthat were the result of bipartisan cooperation between the chairman and \nthe ranking member of each subcommittee and those subcommittee members. \nThe bills were tight and lean because of unrealistic budget limits, but \nSenators worked in tandem to craft balanced legislation. Despite the \nefforts of the chairman of the committee, the senior Senator from State \nof Alaska, progress on the bills waned, and as a result we faced the \ngrim Frankenstein aberration of an Omnibus appropriations conference \nreport.\n  I warned the Senate that such an Omnibus appropriations bill could \ngrow limbs like trees, limbs like an octopus, limbs that never were \ncontemplated by the Senate. I warned Members on both sides of the aisle \nthat they could not control the outcome when the seed of an omnibus \nbill was planted in a closed conference. I warned that a Senator's \nright to debate controversial legislation would be lost. Finally, I \nwarned that such an omnibus bill would invite the White House to the \ntable.\n  Never was the White House invited to the table when I was chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee--never. It is all right for them to \nbe in an outside room but not at the table, no. I warned that such an \nomnibus bill would invite the White House to the table and that the \nCongress would once again forfeit its constitutional right to write \nlegislation. Negotiations on that legislation started well enough. The \nHouse and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees worked on their \nrespective pieces of this mammoth bill. The conferees held an open \nsession under the able leadership of Senate Chairman Ted Stevens and \nHouse Chairman Bill Young, and several of the chapters of this behemoth \nbill were settled. But this tale does not have a happy ending. No, this \nchariot, drawn by tall horses, quickly turned into a pumpkin. Have you \nheard that before? It quickly turned into a pumpkin, pulled by rats \nbefore the clock struck midnight.\n\n  The White House decided--the White House--the White House decided \nthat bipartisan negotiations were unacceptable. The White House pulled \nthe plug on the conference and took it behind closed doors. The \nRepublican congressional leadership bowed, bowed down to White House \npressure. Suddenly, Democratic Members of Congress had no voice in the \nlegislation. Senator Graham, the Democrats had no voice, suddenly, in \nthe legislation they had only days before helped to move to the verge \nof passage.\n  In the back rooms of the Capitol, the White House sat down with the \nRepublican leadership and with fat-cat lobbyists representing big \ncorporations and produced an unamendable 1,182-page, $328 billion \nconference report. They produced a conference report that turned the \nlegislative process on its head.\n  You think Speaker Joe Martin, Republican Speaker of the House--Joe \nMartin of Massachusetts--would have stood for that when he was Speaker \nof the House? Do you think John Taber of New York, Chairman of the \nSenate-House Appropriations Committee, would have stood for that in his \nday? No.\n  Four of the bills contained in this omnibus did not have a recorded \nvote in the Senate. That is all right. A voice vote or a vote by \ndivision are just as legal and legitimate as is a rollcall vote. But \none of the bills, the Commerce-Justice-State bill, was never even \ndebated, never even debated in the Senate, let alone adopted by a vote \nof the Senate.\n  Shame. Shame on us for letting that happen.\n  So there you have it. The Commerce-Justice-State bill was never even \ndebated in the Senate, let alone adopted. Scores of provisions were \nincluded in the so-called Miscellaneous Appropriations Act portion of \nthe conference report that were never debated, never debated in this \nSenate. What has happened to the legislative process here under the \nleadership of the Republican administration, the Bush administration? \nUnder pressure from the White House, provisions that were approved by \nboth the House and Senate have been dropped. Get that. Under pressure \nfrom the White House, provisions that have been included, that were \nprovisions included in both the House and Senate, have been dropped.\n  A point of order could be made under rule XXVIII that would kill this \nconference report. Under pressure from the White House, controversial \nprovisions that were written as 1-year limitations when they were \nbefore the House or Senate have been mutated into permanent changes in \nauthorization law. This conference report includes an across-the-board \ncut never debated here in this Senate, an arbitrary cut that would \napply to legislation already signed into law. It would cut homeland \nsecurity. It would cut counterterrorism efforts. It would cut education \nand health care. This across-the-board cut would reach back into laws \nthat agencies have been operating under for 4 months.\n\n  In the view of the White House, the United States can afford $1.7 \ntrillion in tax cuts. When it comes to the Medicare bill, we can afford \n$12 billion for subsidies for private insurance companies. When it \ncomes to the Energy bill, we can afford over $25 billion of tax cuts \nand $5 billion of mandatory spending for big energy corporations. But \nwhen it comes to initiatives funded in these appropriations bills, \ninitiatives that help ordinary Americans every day, the President \ninsists on cuts.\n  He didn't say anything like that in his big speech last night. No, he \ndidn't say anything about that, a cut of 0.59 percent would reduce \nfunding for No Child Left Behind programs by more than $73 million, \nresulting in 24,000 fewer children being served by title I. The across-\nthe-board cut would reduce veterans medical care funding by $159 \nmillion, resulting in 26,500 fewer veterans receiving medical care.\n  The President lauds the military, as he should. He applauds the \nsoldier, the sailor, the airman, the marine. But when it comes to \nveterans, 26,500 fewer veterans will receive medical care, or 198,000 \nveterans not getting the prescription drugs they need. Was anything \nsaid about that in the speech last evening? Not a word.\n  The across-the-board cut will chop funding for homeland security \ninitiatives. How many more baggage screeners will be laid off, \nresulting in longer lines and less security at the airports? How many \nfewer flights will have air marshals on board? Nothing said about that \nin the State of the Union speech. No, no, no. How many more containers \nwill come into this country uninspected? How many more illegal aliens \nwill be able to remain in this country or how many more will be able to \nsneak into this country? Not a word said. How many potential terrorists \nwill never be investigated because of cuts in the FBI? The Bush tax \ncuts will cost $293 billion in the calendar year 2004. More than $1 out \nof every $4 being spent on those tax cuts is going to the top 1 percent \nof taxpayers in this country. They didn't put me in office. No, those \non that side of the track didn't put me in office. The Bush tax cuts--\nlet me say it again--the Bush tax cuts will cost $293 billion in the \ncalendar year 2004.\n  More than one out of every four dollars being spent on those tax cuts \nis going to the top 1 percent of taxpayers in this country. Are you in \nthat category? Are you, Senators, in that category? I don't know. But I \nknow a lot of people who sent me here who are not in that category.\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n  Taxpayers with incomes that average about $1 million per year will \nreceive an average tax cut of $85,000 in the year 2010, while those \ntaxpayers earning less than $73,000 will receive at best 1 percent of \nwhat a millionaire will receive and at worst a paltry $98 in the year \n2010.\n  How will we pay for this? Oh, that will be somebody else's problem. \nThis President will be back on his ranch in Crawford, TX, living it up \nand having it good. What about your children and my children? They are \ngoing to be left to pay for this.\n  How will we pay for it? With cuts in education, cuts in veterans' \nprograms, and cuts in homeland security.\n  In the dark of night, behind closed doors, the White House filled \nthis conference report with favors for big corporations. Everywhere you \nlook, you find the interests of corporate America coming first and the \nneeds of working Americans coming in last.\n  The Senate approved a provision to block for 1 year the \nadministration's plan to take away the rights of as many as 8 million \nemployees to earn time and a half for extra hours worked. This \nadministration produced a rule so biased toward industry that it even \nincluded advice to corporations on how to avoid additional wages.\n  Yet the Senate provision--what happened to it? What happened to that \nSenate provision? It is gone, obliterated under the darkness of night, \ntaken out.\n  At the request of the food marketing industry, rules to allow \nAmericans to know where their food, such as beef and vegetables, is \ngrown are delayed for 2 years, breaking the balance crafted as part of \nthe 2002 farm bill.\n  During the consideration of the 2002 farm bill, the Senate included a \nprovision--the Senate; that is, us--included a provision to ensure that \nAmerican consumers were provided with information about where their \nfood originates--where it comes from. This so-called country-of-origin \nrequirement became law and was immediately attacked by industry forces. \nWhen the smoke of the agriculture conference cleared, we found that \nindustry forces had worked overtime to slip out of their statutory \nrequirements. The country-of-origin issue was not even allowed to be \ndiscussed at the conference. The decision whether to keep or whether to \nkill the country-of-origin requirement was made behind closed doors \nafter the conference was adjourned subject to the call of the Chair. I \nwas in that conference. It was adjourned subject to the call of the \nChair. They didn't have any use for me anymore. I was locked out. \nSenator Byrd can go home now. He will not be in on the decision. We \ndon't need you there. You can go home now subject to the call of the \nChair. Of course, the call never come.\n  Roy Acuff used to sing, ``I called and I called but nobody answered. \nI called and I called but nobody answered.''\n  Democrats of either the House or the Senate were not in the room.\n  I wonder how many of our listeners remember the first question that \nwas ever asked in the history of man. What was the first question that \nwas ever asked? It was asked in the cool of the day when God walked \nthrough that garden of paradise, the Garden of Eden, which we think was \nlocated somewhere between the two great rivers in old Mesopotamia, the \nTigris and the Euphrates Rivers. God walked in that garden looking for \nAdam and Eve. But he couldn't find Adam. So he asked the question: \nAdam, Adam, where art thou? That is the first question ever recorded. \nAdam, where art thou? Well, Adam and Eve were hiding behind bushes and \nfigleaves. Adam, where art thou?\n\n  Well, Democrats in either the House or the Senate were not in that \nroom. So when their constituents ask, where were you, where were you, \nSenator Graham? Where were you, Senator Byrd, you who has been in \nCongress 51 years, where were you then? Where were you on that day?\n  The Democrats were locked out. We were locked out. We weren't \nincluded.\n  I will tell you one thing. That was never done when I was chairman.\n  Now we find that the delay in implementing the country-of-origin law \nis not just for 1 year, as the House provided and the Senate opposed, \nbut 2 years. And that is not all. The House provision only placed a \nlimitation on the labeling requirement for meat products. Now the \nagreement coming out of conference expands the limitation to all the \nother commodities covered by the law such as fruits and vegetables. \nAmerican consumers may have thought they were going to know where their \nfood came from, but the majority has made sure that those facts will \nremain a hidden secret in the deep freeze.\n  Also, the 1-year limitation on the FCC media ownership rule was \nturned into a permanent cap at 39 percent. The practical effect of \nchanges demanded by the White House is to protect Rupert Murdoch's FOX \ntelevision network and CBS-Viacom from having to comply with the lower \n35 percent ownership caps, the congressional version of the bill that \nwas put in place.\n  The White House is boosting special corporate interests. Why not? \nLook at the millions that are poured into political coffers by those \nspecial corporate interests. The White House is boosting special \ncorporate interests at the expense of the people's interest for \nbalanced news and information. Protections for Federal workers that \nwere agreed to on a bipartisan basis in the public conference that \nwould ensure fair competition with the private sector disappeared in \nthe backroom.\n  The White House sent its troops to the Hill last week to press the \nRepublican leadership to reject entreaties from Members on both sides \nof the aisle to make any changes to this Frankenstein of a bill.\n  This ``my way or the highway'' roughshod politics over the principled \napproach to Congress is incredible, especially from a White House that \nhas done so much to undermine the credibility of this Nation and its \nGovernment.\n  One year ago, the President used the State of the Union Address \nbefore this Congress, this Nation, and the world to make his best case \nfor taking the Nation to war in Iraq under the doctrine of preemptive \nstrikes, under the doctrine of preemption.\n\n  In the State of the Union Address and in other speeches, he and \nothers in the administration told Congress and the Nation that Saddam \nHussein had weapons of mass destruction that were an imminent threat to \nthis Nation. We were told that Saddam Hussein was trying to develop \nnuclear weapons. We were told that American troops would be received as \nliberators. We were told that Saddam Hussein was aiding terrorists, \nsuch as the al-Qaida. What an incredible tale. What an incredible \nsquandering of the credibility of our Government in the eyes of the \nworld.\n  For this President, there seems to be no limit to his appetite for \nrhetoric, no recognition that there is a difference between his \nrhetoric and reality.\n  Yes, he promised Americans to leave no child behind, but this omnibus \nbill would cut funding by $6 billion below the level authorized for \ntitle I in the No Child Left Behind Act which this President signed \nwith such promise in January of 2002. This omnibus bill would leave \nbehind 2.1 million children who are eligible for title I educational \nservices.\n  The President promised to secure our homeland and yet this bill would \ncut funding for port security and border security. On November 14, \n2002, the Senate passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nwithout a dissenting vote. The vote was 95 to 0. The bill was signed \ninto law by President Bush on November 25, 2002, during a celebratory \nWhite House ceremony. On that day, the President said: We will \nstrengthen security at our Nation's 361 seaports, adding port security \nagents, requiring ships to provide more information about the cargo, \ncrew, and passengers that they carry.\n  Despite these requirements, the President has requested no funding \nfor port security grants and this omnibus bill would cut the funding \nthat Congress added last fall. Sixteen million cargo containers arrive \nin the United States by ship, truck, and rail each year. One hundred \nforty million passengers travel annually by ship each year. Thousands \nof employees work at our ports each day. Millions of citizens live in \nand around our port community. A terrorist attack through our ports \nwould produce billions of dollars of losses to our economy.\n  Was a thin dime requested by this President? No. No, the President \ndid not request a dime.\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\n  On November 19, 2001, the President signed into law the Aviation and \nTransportation Security Act. The act created the Transportation \nSecurity Administration and mandated that all cargo on passenger \naircraft be screened. The administration has never requested sufficient \nfunding to meet the goals of the law. In order to bridge a $900 million \nfunding shortfall that it created for fiscal year 2003, the \nadministration proposed delaying advanced firearms training for Federal \nair marshals at the same time that intelligence reports indicated an \nenhanced threat to aviation and the potential for hijacking planes \ntransiting the United States.\n  Regarding air cargo security, the administration has met the \nrequirement of screening air cargo by expanding a program referred to \nas the Known Shipper Program. This program does not actually physically \nscreen cargo going into the bellies of jumbo passenger aircraft but \nrelies on paperwork to protect our citizens. Congress added $35 million \nabove the President's request to enhance the deployment of detection \nequipment, research other methods to screen cargo and otherwise expand \nair cargo security. This omnibus bill would reduce that funding.\n\n  The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, \nPublic Law 101-173, was signed into law by President Bush on May 14, \n2002. The act authorized funding for enhanced hiring of immigration \ninspectors and agents as well as for improvements to immigration \nfacilities. The President did not request the authorized funds to hire \nadditional immigration personnel, nor did he request funds to make the \nauthorized improvements to immigration facilities or to hire the \nrequired number of Border Patrol agents. The omnibus bill would reduce \nfunding for Border Patrol efforts.\n  Just last month, 4 days before Christmas, Homeland Security Secretary \nTom Ridge announced that the Nation's terror alert level was being \nraised to orange. He said the strategic indicator, including al-Qaida's \ncontinued desire to carry out attacks against our homeland, was perhaps \ngreater than at any time since September 11. He went on to say that \ninformation indicates that extremists abroad are anticipating near-term \nattacks that they believe will rival or exceed the scope and impact of \nthose we experienced in New York.\n  The President promised a safer nation when he created the new \nHomeland Security Department. But his Secretary says we are in greater \ndanger than at any time since September 11, 2001. At the same time, the \nadministration urged Congress to cut funding for Homeland Security.\n  In May of this year the President signed into law a bill authorizing \n$15 billion over 5 years for international programs to combat HIV/AIDS. \nOn July 12, while in Nigeria, the President said: The House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate must fully fund this initiative, for the \ngood of the people on this continent of Africa.\n  To ``fully fund this initiative'' requires $3 billion. The \nauthorization bill, which the President explicitly referenced in his \nspeech, authorized $3 billion in fiscal year 2004. Yet the President \nonly requested that the Congress provide $2 billion for the program. \nThis omnibus bill, after the across-the-board cut, would provide less \nthan $2.4 billion for the Global AIDS Program, over $600 million below \nthe level promised.\n  Democratic Senators, including myself, on three separate occasions \noffered amendments that would have ensured that HIV/AIDS funding \nreached the $3 billion level. All three of these amendments were \ndefeated by the Republican leadership working with the Bush \nadministration.\n  Rhetoric and reality are two different things. Now we understand that \nthe President will be promising to put a man on Mars. Somewhere along \nthe way the tail has begun to wag the dog.\n  The legislative process is being steered from the Oval Office. The \nlegislative branch is being used not as the Framers envisioned, to \nserve as a check on the executive branch, but instead as a tool to \ncheck off accomplishments on the President's political agenda.\n  Whose fault is that? Shame on us for letting ourselves be used. Shame \non us for letting ourselves be used. Shame on us for putting political \nparty against the best interests of the Nation. Shame on us for putting \npolitical party above the Constitution of the United States. This is \nnot the way the Senate should operate.\n  I fault no individual Senator for bringing us to this point, but I do \nfault the system that places meaningless message votes and staged \nphoto-op debates before the business of the Nation. I fault politicians \nfor their weakness, for their failure to uphold their oaths to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic.\n  Shame on us. In my 50 years in this Congress, I have never, never \nbefore seen such a Milquetoast Congress, a Congress that would cede \npower.\n  This Constitution says Congress shall have power to declare war. Yet \nthis Senate stood speechless--speechless--when we voted in 2002 to \nshift this power to determine when, where, and what military forces \nshould invade a sovereign Nation. The Senate had little to say.\n  That was not the Senate that was here when I came here. No, not the \nSenate that was here when I came here. Everett Dirksen stood at that \nplace. Lyndon Johnson stood at that desk. There was Norris Cotton, \nGeorge Aiken, Jacob Javits. Those were men. There was Senator Russell \nof Georgia, who stood at this place, right here at this desk, Richard \nRussell. Lister Hill stood there. John Pastore of Rhode Island stood \nhere. No, not those men. They are gone.\n  But the Constitution is not gone. The Constitution is still with us. \nAnd many times have I stood at that desk where the Presiding Officer \nsits today, put my hand on the Bible, as it were, and swore to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States--not to support this \nPresident or that President, this party or that party. I did not have \nany oath of that kind. I did not take any oath of that kind. I never \nwill take an oath of that kind.\n  How many of us can say we have stood by that Constitution? How many \nof us would have to say: Oh, I have bent--I have bent, when my party, \nwhen my President--the President is the President for all of us. He is \nnot just my President.\n  But I say that we have become far too deferential to all Presidents, \ntoo deferential to all Presidents. Presidents are just hired hands like \nthe rest of us. They are here only for a while. Then they go. I have \nseen 11 administrations go, and I hope I get to see another one. But we \nact, when we come here, as though we swear to support this President or \nthat President, a President from the Republican party or a President \nfrom the Democratic party. Why? They are mere hired hands who are here \nfor a little while, like the rest of us.\n  No President sends the Presiding Officer here. No President can send \nthat Presiding Officer home. Why so deferential to Presidents?\n  Under the Constitution, we have three separate but equal branches of \nGovernment. How many of us know that? How many of us know that the \nexecutive branch is but the equal of the legislative branch--not above \nit, not below it, but equal? Why do we treat Presidents as though they \nwere kings, clothed in royal purple?\n\n  The real losers in this scenario are the American people. They are \nnot well served by a Congress that fritters away opportunity after \nopportunity to probe, to analyze, to exercise its independent judgment \non the urgent issues of the day in favor of rushing to do the bidding \nof the executive branch. Shame on us. Fie on us.\n  The people of West Virginia and this Constitution that I hold in my \nhand have made me a U.S. Senator. No President made me a U.S. Senator. \nI came to Congress when Harry Truman was President. He did not make me \na Member of Congress. Of course, I was indebted to him for coming to \nWest Virginia and speaking on my behalf and on behalf of my colleague, \nJennings Randolph, at that time. But I did not expect that to make him \nmy boss. I admired Harry Truman. I did not like him for some of the \nlanguage that he used in public, but I still admired him, and admire \nhim to this day as a President who had courage. But he was just a \nPresident.\n  So I have served with 11 Presidents--not under any of them. No, no \nPresident sends me here. And by what right do the people of West \nVirginia send me\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\nhere if I am going to bow and scrape to a President? They expect me to \nspeak up, and that is what I have tried to do, in the presence of \nPresidents, yes, but they put their pants on just like I put mine on; \nthe same old way, no different.\n  Under our Constitution, our Founding Fathers had the wisdom to \nestablish three separate, equal, coordinate branches of Government. \nThat is under this Constitution. This Constitution--perhaps one does \nnot think about it often, but when one stops to think about it, this \nConstitution has something to do with every minute, every hour, every \nday of every life in this country in one place or another, and in some \ninstances more than one place.\n  This Constitution impacts your life, your life, and your life. Every \nday that you are here on this planet, this Constitution has a bearing \non it. And then some would treat this as a piece of paper and put \npolitical party above the Constitution of the United States. When I do \nthat, send me home and say: Good riddance.\n  This is the Constitution of the United States. Many times I have \nsworn by oath before God and man, with my hand on the Bible, the King \nJames version of the Holy Bible, to support and defend this \nConstitution. Yet we treat it as a piece of paper. We use it only when \nit is of a particular benefit to us. But every day, in some way or in \nsome ways, this Constitution bears upon your life. It may be in the \ndelivery of your mail. It may be in the hard surfacing of the roads \nupon which you drive. It may have something to do with the flights that \nyou are about to depart upon. Yes, it is this Constitution.\n  In this country, we don't say: God save the King. God save the King. \nGod save the President of the United States. No. We say: God save the \nConstitution of the United States. This Constitution saved Congress \nfrom its error when it passed the Line-Item Veto Act. This Constitution \ndid that.\n  Under the Constitution, Congress writes the laws. The President \nexecutes the laws. Under the Constitution, the power of the purse rests \nhere, right here--not downtown, not down at the other end of the \navenue, but here.\n  Most of the people who were in the Thirteen Colonies, in the 13 \nStates, when the Constitution became a constitution, were British \nsubjects. It took hundreds of years and blood spilled at the tip of the \nsword for Englishmen in 1688 to write that meetings of Parliament that \nshould be held often, that there would be freedom of speech in the \nParliament and in the House of Commons. Those were the men who placed \nthe powers of the purse in the hands of the elected representatives of \nthe people of England in Parliament. That is where the power of the \npurse rests, here in the legislative branch. We ought never to let the \nexecutive branch forget it. Yet we cower. We act like poodles when it \ncomes to standing up against the Chief Executive of the United States.\n  Who is he? With all due respect, whether he is Republican or \nDemocrat, this is the Congress of the United States. This is the \npeople's branch, this body and the other. Under the Constitution, the \nCongress determines how to write our laws, how to protect Members' \nrights to debate the important issues of the day. This omnibus bill \nleaves those pillars of our constitutional system in shambles. It is \nour duty as the people's representatives to protect those pillars of \nour constitutional system of government.\n  In 1999 and in the year 2000, when President Clinton, a Democratic \nPresident, a President of my own party, supported efforts by the \nRepublican Congress to produce Omnibus appropriations bills, I came to \nthis floor to decry our loss of our right and our duty to write \nlegislation. I came to this floor to stand up for Congress's power of \nthe purse. It made no matter to me--not any, no matter--that this was a \nDemocratic President calling for omnibus spending legislation. I stood \nup for the rights of this Senate as I do today.\n  In 1993, there was a great effort to include President Clinton's \ncomprehensive health care reform plan in a reconciliation bill. \nProponents of the President's proposal hoped that such an approach \nwould shelter the proposal from extended debate in the Senate. My own \nmajority leader, George Mitchell, came to me. I said, no. My own \ncolleague from West Virginia in the Senate pleaded with me. I said, no. \nPresident Clinton, a Democratic President, called on the telephone, \ncalled on me to support this effort. I said, no. I said, no. Without \nregard to party, I felt compelled to protect Members' rights to a full \ndebate.\n\n  I said: This is a comprehensive health bill. The people need to know \nwhat is in it. We Members of the Senate need to know what is in it. \nThat is why we have the Senate, to debate and to amend. No.\n  And so I turned my face like flint to the request of my own friend \nand the President of my own party. No.\n  Did he think less of me? I doubt it. He thanked me. He understood \nwhat I was saying. I will say it again. How many on that side would say \nthat to a President of their party? But with President Bush, he insists \nthat members of his party march with him step by step. I can remember a \ngreat Republican Senator who refused to march step by step. That was \nSenator Mark Hatfield. He was scorned by many on that side of the aisle \nbecause he stood alone against a political party, his party. He was no \ncoward for doing that. He was a man.\n  President Bush insists that members of his party march with him step \nby step. Today, on the other side of the aisle, voices for a strong and \nequal Congress fall silent.\n  Last week Senator Frist wrote to Senators and urged them to vote for \nthe omnibus conference report because if the omnibus fails, then the \nonly alternative, he said, is a full-year continuing resolution that \nwould force the agencies for the seven outstanding appropriations bills \nto operate at last year's level. He argued that such a continuing \nresolution would produce deep cuts for food safety, veterans medical \ncare, highway funding, and the Global AIDS Programs.\n  However, the Senator presents the Senate with a false choice. If the \nomnibus is not approved, the Senate has other options to move forward. \nIf the only alternative is a full-year continuing resolution, then that \nis the choice of the Republican leadership. It would be another example \nof putting political posturing before the needs of the American people.\n  There is a clear alternative, and that is to sit down and work out a \ncompromise that can overwhelmingly pass the Senate. If our \ndistinguished and illustrious majority leader, Mr. Frist, had the will \nto do so, such negotiations could be completed, who knows, maybe even \nin 1 day. However, in its current form, I cannot vote for this bill. I \ncannot vote for this conference report that so ravages our \nconstitutional process and puts corporate interests ahead of the \npeople's interests. I cannot vote for a bill that undermines our \ncredibility, undermines the credibility of the United States Senate \nwith the American people. I urge Members to vote no when the Senate \nvotes on the adoption of the conference report.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a tough act to follow of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. Is there any specified allocation of time for \ndebate this afternoon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No special allocation of time, except that \nSenator McCain is to be recognized at 2 o'clock for an hour.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \neloquent words, which I followed on the floor and through the \ntelevision before I arrived on the floor. It is always a pleasure to \nhear him speak to the issues that we are challenged with as a nation.\n  Last night, I joined many Senators and Congressmen to walk across the \nRotunda to attend the 21st State of the Union Address, which has been \nmy honor to witness as a Congressman and as a Senator, to be on the \nescort committee to bring in the President for this historic moment and \nto hear the President's words as he addressed America, as he does each \nyear. It is a rare chance for him to speak unencumbered to the Nation \ndirectly and to really express the feelings in his heart.\n  Part of what the President said I thought was particularly timely and \npoignant. It drew bipartisan response\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\nand applause--particularly the part where he saluted the men and women \nin uniform. We have many debates on foreign policy here. Senator Byrd \nand I view it the same way, that perhaps our country is on the wrong \ntrack when it comes to this policy of preemption and going it alone in \nthe world. Having said that, we both understand, as every Member of the \nCongress does, there are men and women in uniform who are literally \nrisking their lives at this moment for this country. While politicians \nand elected officials debate the policy, we should never forget the \ncourage, sacrifice, and dedication of those men and women in uniform, \nhow much it means to their families that they know we stand behind them \nand we will not deny them the resources they need to perform their \nmission safely and to come home safely and as quickly as possible.\n  I point out one aspect that has come to my attention over the 2-month \nbreak when the Senate was in recess. I joined a couple Senators and I \nwent out on my own to visit Walter Reed Hospital last November and meet \nwith these wounded soldiers. It is a wonderful thing to see these brave \nyoung men and women. Also, it is sad to see some of the injuries they \nhave sustained. Most of them wear ceramic vests that protect them in \ncombat, but they don't protect their limbs. Many of those there are \namputees who have lost a hand, an arm, legs, or, in the case of one \nsoldier, both hands, or suffered a head injury.\n  Having spoken to them and asked them the circumstances of their \ninjury, I usually said: Is there anything I can do for you? It was \ninteresting to me how many had the same response. It wasn't personal. \nThey didn't ask me for a favor. They said: Don't do me a favor, but do \na favor for the men and women I served with. We need to have more \nprotection in combat, particularly with Humvees, which are today's \njeeps that are so prevalent in the war in Iraq. Humvees were built to \nbe light and fast for a desert war, and now they perform a different \nfunction. They move troops through Baghdad and Fallujah, which are \ndangerous areas. Sadly, many of these Humvees have canvas sides. If one \nof these terrorists fires a rocket-propelled grenade at it, it whistles \nright through the vehicle causing great injuries and damage in the \nprocess. The same thing is true with the homemade bombs. So the wounded \nsoldiers at Walter Reed said time and again that they need more armor-\nplating on the Humvee vehicles.\n  I thought this was something a Senator ought to look into. So I came \nback to my office and contacted the Department of the Army and said: \nHow many Humvees in Iraq today don't have armor-plating? They said that \n8,500 do not. So I said: Is it a priority to make armor-plated doors \nfor these? They said it is the highest priority. They said: Senator, \nthere is good news. Half of them will be built in your State at the \nRock Island Arsenal, which has served America since the Civil War. I \nknew the men and women there were anxious to get involved and to prove \nthemselves and to serve our Nation again, as they have time and time \nagain in times of conflict.\n\n  During the break, I went to the Rock Island Arsenal and saw the first \ntwo armored doors for Humvees come off the assembly line. The employees \nwere working around the clock and could not have been prouder. I said \nto the officer in charge at the Rock Island Arsenal: This is great. You \nare supposed to build about 8,000 or 9,000 of these armor-plated doors. \nHow long will it take you to get these 9,000 armor-plated doors into \nIraq on the Humvees? He said: Senator, if we work night and day, we can \nget this done in 2 years. Two years.\n  I thought to myself, what am I missing here? In World War II, we \nwould build a bomber in 72 hours. We would build a ship in 30 days. Why \nis it going to take 2 years to build the armor-plated doors for the \nHumvees? He said: I am sorry to tell you that there is only one plant \nleft in America that makes the steel that can protect these soldiers \nwith armor plating in the Humvees--one plant left in America. I thought \nabout that last night when the President said to us that jobs are \ngrowing in America--manufacturing and industrial jobs are growing in \nAmerica. I have to say to the President, as I look at Illinois, that is \nnot the case. We are losing jobs. We are losing manufacturing jobs. We \nhave lost 20 percent of our manufacturing jobs in the last 5 years and \ncontinue to do so.\n  Many jobs are going to China. China is a country where jobs are \ngrowing but, sadly, at the expense of American workers. China has an \nunfair trade policy related to the currency valuation of their local \ncurrency.\n  Now, the Secretary of the Treasury, who was there last night, \nprotested this in China, but they have done nothing about it. So they \nhave a 15- to 40-percent price advantage over American manufacturers. \nWhat it means is that manufacturers, large and small, are losing \nbusiness to China. So when the time comes, when we need a steel mill to \nproduce the armor for the Humvees so our sons and daughters come back \nwith limbs intact and safe, we find ourselves at the mercy of these \nforeign producers.\n  Today, for every dollar of goods exported from the United States to \nChina, we import $6 worth of goods from China, and one company in \nAmerica--one company alone--imports 10 percent of all of the Chinese \nexports to the United States. One company sells 10 percent of all of \nthe goods and products sent by China to the United States. That company \nis Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, yes. It is in your neighborhood and in your \nhometown.\n  A few years ago, they proudly said ``made in America'' at Wal-Mart. \nBut it doesn't say that anymore. Last week, if you watched the cable \nchannels, you saw Lou Dobbs talking about exporting America. Frankly, \nthat is a sad reality today.\n  So when the President talks about all the new jobs coming into \nAmerica, I don't see it. For my money, a jobless recovery is no \nrecovery at all. What good is it to talk about productivity? What good \nis it to talk about economic growth if we have lost 3 million jobs \nunder the Bush administration? That is a fact of life.\n  I told you the story of the Humvees. I will tell you one other.\n  In my apartment in Chicago, at 4 o'clock on Saturday, I received a \nphone call. It is interesting that I received a similar call 3 weeks \nbefore. The voice on the other end of the phone said: Mr. Durbin, this \nis Nancy, and I am happy to inform you that your Discover Card is on \nthe way to your apartment.\n  I said: Nancy, I didn't order a Discover Card.\n  She said: Yes, but you have qualified for one and we are going to \nsend you a credit card.\n  I said: Nancy, may I ask you a question? Where are you calling from?\n  She said: Delaware.\n  I said: What city in Delaware?\n  She said: Just a minute.\n  I heard papers shuffling. I said: New Delhi?\n  She said: No, Bangalore.\n  As you know, that is a city in India. I tell you those stories \nbecause I think they demonstrate the anxiety and concern of Americans \nfrom one coast to the other.\n  The President may believe that we are deep into a recovery. The \nPresident may see new jobs coming, but America looks at the current \nevolution of our economy with concern. We are giving up our basic \nindustries. We are giving up manufacturing to the Chinese, and now we \nare giving up service jobs to India and other countries.\n  IBM announced 4,000 jobs will be lost in the United States for \ncomputer programs that will be sent overseas to India. If you buy a \nDell Computer and you need instructions on setting up your computer and \nyou call the 800 number, you will generally speak to someone in India.\n  The question that raises is this: What will be the job for the next \ngeneration of Americans? What occupation or profession would you \nrecommend to a young person for a future in America?\n  There are some that are obvious, but when you look at how we have \nbuilt this country with a strong middle class, raising good strong \nfamilies with strong values, you have to wonder, with the challenges we \nare going to face in the years ahead, whether this administration and \nthis Congress are looking at the state of the American economy \nhonestly.\n  What was President Bush's proposal last night to deal with the future \nof America's economy? He made it clear. He believes that if you make \nthe tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America permanent law, then, \nin fact, we\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nwill have a strong economy. In other words, if you will give more money \nto the wealthiest people in America, somehow the economy lifts and \neveryone will succeed.\n  History is not on his side. In fact, this anemic recovery in which we \nare presently involved is proof positive that his tax cuts did little \nor nothing to stimulate this economy and creating a deficit of historic \nproportions. This President took a surplus in the Treasury and turned \nit into the biggest deficit in the history of the United States. He \ntook over from an administration that had created over 20 million new \njobs, and this President, unless something dramatic happens in the next \nfew months, will go down in history as having lost more jobs under his \nadministration than any President since the Great Depression--3 million \njobs lost in America. And his answer to get America back on its feet \nand working again: Give the wealthiest people in America a tax break.\n  The President, when he talks about the tax cuts, zeros in on the $300 \nfor individuals, $600 for families, the marriage penalty, but he \nignores the biggest tax breaks, which are not included in that group \nbut go to the wealthiest people in this country. Those are the ones who \nhave brought us into this deficit situation.\n  To make matters worse, the conference report to accompany the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, which we have before us, includes a provision \nwhich says when it comes to those currently working in America, people \nwho are struggling to keep their jobs and to keep their families \ntogether, this bill contains a provision which will eliminate overtime \npay for 8 million Americans.\n  Mr. President, 8 million Americans today working overtime hours--away \nfrom their families, to make ends meet, to put some money away for \ncollege education, to deal with medical bills they can't handle \notherwise--because of language insisted by the Republican leadership in \nthe White House and in the Congress will lose their overtime pay.\n  That is the record of the Bush administration when it comes to jobs: \n3 million jobs lost; 8 million working Americans denied overtime pay.\n  What does it mean? It means these men and women who are working these \njobs will be told by their employers: You will show up and you will \nwork instead of 40 hours this week, you will work 50 hours this week, \nand the extra 10 hours you work, you will be paid the same hourly wage, \nand if you don't like it, leave.\n  Perhaps that is the President's vision of America. From my point of \nview, that is not a vision that most families would appreciate. If we \ntruly value work and we truly value families, wouldn't we take a \ndifferent approach?\n  Didn't we hear the President last night talk about the family values \nof America and protecting those traditional values? While he spoke, we \nwere considering a bill that says for 8 million Americans, the \nlikelihood that your family will succeed is diminished, and it is \nreduced because we believe employers, at least those who support this \nbill, believe that employers should make more money at the expense of \ntheir employees.\n\n  We have had overtime pay since 1938. The Fair Labor Standards Act \nrequired employers to pay time and a half, and usually Presidents, \nDemocrats and Republicans, would extend overtime protection and \novertime benefits to more and more employees. This President will go \ndown in history as the first to take overtime pay away from working \nAmericans--8 million Americans.\n  The administration's proposal would strip 8 million workers of their \novertime rights, including 375,000 workers in my State of Illinois. For \nworkers who receive overtime pay, that overtime compensation usually \naccounts for 25 percent of their paycheck. The administration's \nproposal would slash the paychecks of 8 million hard-working Americans \nby 25 percent.\n  I haven't spoken about increasing the minimum wage in this country, \nwhich this administration has steadfastly opposed and Republicans in \nCongress have adamantly opposed. So at $5.15 an hour, more and more \nlow-income workers find themselves falling behind and have to take a \nsecond job.\n  I went to a high school in Du Page County over the break. Du Page \nCounty is a great diverse, strong, and generally prosperous county in \nmy State, just west of Chicago. When I sat down with the educators, we \nlooked at No Child Left Behind test scores, and I said: Why is it that \nonly 92 percent of the students took the test for No Child Left Behind \nat this high school?\n  The principal said to me: Senator, a lot of our kids are from poor \nfamilies, single parent families, and they have brothers and sisters. \nIf a little brother or a little sister gets sick and can't go to day \ncare that day, mom is going to have to stay home from work and give up \nher paycheck or that older brother is going to have to stay home and \nwatch the sick baby. That is what happens. He said that is reality.\n  Think about that kind of life where the sickness of the baby keeps an \nolder brother out of school; where the mother, making $5.15 an hour, \ndoesn't work an 8-hour day, but perhaps a 12- and 14-hour day or, if \nshe is lucky, she has a job that used to pay overtime for those extra \nhours and now, because of the Bush administration's proposal, she is \nabout to lose her overtime. She is struggling to keep her little family \ntogether under extraordinary circumstances, and we make it worse.\n  We do not increase the minimum wage. We do not protect her right to \nearn overtime pay, which has been on the books for over 65 years in \nAmerica. Is that an administration with family values, sensitive to \nfamilies and what they face?\n  What kind of employees will be hit hard by the President's \ndetermination to cut overtime pay? Let me give you a few categories: \nPolice officers, firefighters, and safety coordinators. The \nInternational Union of Police Associations estimated this proposal will \ntake overtime pay from 50 percent of those law enforcement officers \ncurrently guaranteed overtime. A minimum of 200,000 law enforcement \nofficers will lose their overtime pay because of this appropriations \nproposal that came to us from the Bush administration.\n  I can go through the list: Prison guards from my State will no longer \nreceive overtime pay; first responders, nurses, medical assistants, \nsocial workers, computer technicians, engineering technicians--the list \ngoes on and on.\n  I think the list tells a story. It is one thing to talk about the \ngoodness of America and the confidence we have in our future, and quite \nanother for us to pass legislation, such as included in this \nappropriations bill, which destroys the confidence of working families \nin this Congress and this administration, unwilling to stand up and \nfight for them defending their rights to keep their families together.\n  Let me speak for a moment about education because at the heart of the \nissue of tomorrow's generation and their jobs is the question of \neducation and training. The President made a very modest proposal last \nnight to help community colleges. I thought it was good. When we assess \nthe value for each community college, it is going to be symbolic, as \nmost things are from this administration when it comes to helping \nAmerica. It won't be the billions of dollars we are sending to Iraq. It \nwill be $230 million, $240 million which is going to be allocated to \ncommunity colleges. Mr. President, $230 million is hardly going to \nchange education in America when we consider we are a nation of roughly \n300 million people.\n  When we take a look at No Child Left Behind, we may note that this \nbill we are about to pass provides the smallest increase in education \nfunding in 8 years, and it shortchanges No Child Left Behind, the \nPresident's premier policy on education, by $6 billion under the \nauthorized funding level.\n  So we have said to schools, test your kids, and the President \nrepeated it last night, continue to test, we want to know how you are \ndoing. That is valuable. That is the diagnosis. But when it comes to \nthe treatment, when it comes to tutoring, mentoring, after-school \nprograms and summer school programs, this administration refuses to put \nthe money on the table. They will identify the problem but they will \nnot invest in solving the problem. In fact, what they have created is \nan unfunded mandate on schools at the absolute worst time possible. \nWhere States are struggling to make ends meet, where local property \npayers are pushed to the limit on their property taxes, the President \nhas imposed a mandate on\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\nthe schools and refuses by $6 billion in this bill to provide the \nfunding the schools need to succeed.\n  So what will happen? Tests will be taken and tests will be reported, \nboth within the Department of Education and publicly. Schools which \npeople respected will now be branded as failing schools. Schools which \nfrankly are doing a good job will find that if one group of students, \nfor example, the kids in the special education class, who have special \nphysical and mental challenges, cannot meet the test scores we have \nmandated in No Child Left Behind, the school will be graded as a \nfailing school.\n  Imagine, you and your husband, your family, have made a sacrifice to \nbuy a home in a very expensive subdivision which you know to be safe \nand near a good school, so that there is going to be a great education \nfor your kids. You are starting to make the mortgage payments, it is \nnot an easy thing to do, and you pick up the paper and you say, did you \nrealize the high school our kids are about to go to has been graded a \nfailing school?\n  That is going to happen. It is going to happen across Illinois. It is \ngoing to happen across America. When it comes to the resources and \nmoney to help those schools and to help those students, this \nadministration refuses to put the money on the table. I think that is \nunfortunate and tragic, and it hardly suggests that this President is \nlooking forward to the next generation.\n  The same President who a week ago looked up to the heavens and said \nthe vision for America is manned space flight to Mars is a President \nwho is not looking around America at the neighborhoods and towns that \nneed a helping hand, that need more jobs, that need better schools, and \nneed affordable health insurance. Had that same President, instead of \ncasting his eyes to the heavens and outer space, looked to our Nation \nand said, in the next 10 years we are going to bring America's schools \nup to the highest world quality standards, and if it takes the trillion \ndollars that is necessary, we will spend it, that President would have \nbeen applauded across America. Instead, he projects someone in a manned \nspace flight to Mars that will cost us $1 trillion.\n  I am not against the space program. Many good things have come from \nthe space program, and they continue to come from the space program, \nbut to think that we are going to look beyond Mother Earth, look beyond \nour own home into the heavens to spend a trillion dollars just strikes \nme as a complete misstatement of priorities for America.\n  In the few minutes I have remaining, I will mention two or three \nother things I find troublesome in this bill. One of the major \ndisappointments was the deletion of funding in the Commerce-Justice-\nState-Judiciary appropriations for the Voice of America and Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty broadcasting for Eastern Europe. The Senate bill \nincluded this funding, as did the Senate version of the authorization \nbill: $9 million for broadcasts to Estonia, the Czech Republic, \nHungary, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, Latvia, Romania, and Moldova. \nUnfortunately, this bill will cut off those broadcasts, and that is not \nthe right thing to do. These are new democracies. They are still \nsubject to instability. There is still gang and Soviet influence. I \nrefer to the old Soviet gangs that still are alive and well and reborn \nin the form of syndicate operations. These democracies need the help of \nRadio Free Europe. I think putting that voice, as well as Radio \nLiberty, in a broadcast is an important thing to strengthen those \ndemocracies. Unfortunately, it was cut.\n  Then, of course, there is the provision in this bill regarding one of \nthe controversial rules of the Federal Communications Commission. Do my \ncolleagues think it is a better country if one company owns more and \nmore television and radio stations? I do not. I think the diversity of \nmessage, the opportunities for Americans to hear different points of \nview, is really kind of key to our democracy. Yet, despite our votes on \nthe floor of the Senate, at the last minute Chairman Stevens and the \nWhite House put a provision in this appropriations bill which allows a \ngreater concentration of ownership of television stations.\n\n  The obvious question is: What is that doing in an appropriations \nbill? The obvious answer is: The special interests won and they won \nbig. Viacom was a big winner. Rupert Murdoch and Fox Broadcasting were \nall big winners by this provision being slipped in the bill. It is no \nsurprise that some of these conglomerates have a conservative bent to \nthem and agree with the President's party. Well, they were handsomely \nrewarded in this appropriations bill.\n  The last point I will make is that of all of the things in this bill \nwhich will make life tougher, more difficult and challenging in \nAmerica, there is one that is very basic. When one turns on the \ntelevision news tonight, what is likely to be the lead story? Well, in \nChicago, sadly, it is likely to be a violent crime, maybe a murder. We \nare showing some improvement there. We are reducing violent crime, but \nit is still a national scourge. Unfortunately, it is the result of the \nfact that guns often end up in the hands of the wrong people.\n  Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, firearm dealers are \nprohibited from transferring firearms to anybody until there has been a \nsearch in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and it \nis determined that selling this gun to this person would not violate \nthe law. The kind of people who would be prohibited from buying guns \nare obvious: convicted felons, somebody convicted of a crime of \ndomestic violence or under a domestic violence restraining order, or a \nfugitive. We do not want to sell guns to people who have demonstrated \nthat they misuse them. That is a smart thing to do. So we submit the \nname of the person to the NICS system for a computer check to see if \nthis person would be prohibited from having a firearm. If so, then we \ndo not sell them the gun.\n  In addition, under the current regulations, the Department of Justice \nretains records of approved firearm sales for up to 90 days. If during \nthe course of those 90 days, it obtains information that a gun has been \nsold to someone improperly, we are going to go get the gun.\n  So I asked the General Accounting Office what would happen if the \nDepartment of Justice was required to destroy these computer records of \ngun purchases within 24 hours. In other words, the Department of \nJustice is given only 24 hours to obtain additional information on a \nperson's background, and they were not given the full 90 days that they \nhave under the current law. What if it is limited to 24 hours? The \nGeneral Accounting Office did a study for me. They came back and said \nthe FBI would lose its ability to initiate firearm retrieval actions \nwhen new information reveals individuals who were approved to purchase \nfirearms should not have been. Specifically, the GAO said during the \nfirst 6 months of the 90-day retention policy, the FBI used retained \nrecords to initiate 235 firearm retrieval actions, of which 228 could \nnot have been initiated if there were a next-day destruction \nrequirement.\n  Let me boil this down. If I want to buy a gun and I pass through the \ncomputer check, they have 90 days to obtain additional information \nregarding whether I should have been able to buy the gun. If they are \ntold they have only 24 hours to gather this information, it means that \n228 guns in a 6-month period would be given to convicted felons, people \nguilty of domestic violence, and fugitives, exactly the wrong people in \nAmerica to have guns.\n  Now, who in the world would want to limit the ability of the \nGovernment to check on someone's background to make sure that criminals \ndid not buy guns? One special interest group--the National Rifle \nAssociation. And they won, in this bill. They have a provision in this \nbill which will prohibit the FBI from obtaining information on a \npurchaser's background more than 24 hours after a sale is approved. \nWhat it means in this case is 228 felons and other prohibited persons \nin a 6-month period would end up with guns on the street.\n  Does that make you feel safer, America? It doesn't make me feel safer \nat all. It is the kind of mindless pressure by a special interest group \nthat is being paid off for its political support with this provision in \nthe appropriations bill, and that makes no sense at all. It is not \ngoing to make the streets of my State any safer. It isn't going to make \nit safer for the policemen who\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\nget up every morning, who put that badge on over their heart and risk \ntheir lives for us every single day. It isn't going to make it safer \nfor our children who are walking home from the bus or from the CTA \ntrain. It is not going to make it safer for America.\n  But there are smiles on the faces of the special interest group, the \nNational Rifle Association. They won in this appropriations bill. They \nwere able to limit the opportunity for Government to do its work, to \nkeep guns out of the hands of criminals. That is another unfortunate \noutcome of this legislation.\n  So we will face this Omnibus appropriations bill after having \ndefeated a motion to close down debate yesterday. I hope in the process \na lot of Americans will pay close attention. This is one of the latest \ntimes I can remember major appropriations bills being enacted since I \nserved in Congress. The fact is, the longer the bill languishes, the \nmore likely it is subject to mischief. That is what happened here. Time \nand time again we saw the overtime pay issue, the issue of media \nownership concentration, the issue of the background checks on guns, as \nwell as the issue of country-of-origin labeling--all of these became \nvictim to this debate that went on and on, on the appropriations bills, \nand ultimately the special interests won, Americans lost, and American \nfamilies lost as well. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Senator McCain is scheduled to be here at 2 o'clock, and he \nhas indicated he will be here, so I suggest the absence of a quorum \npending the arrival of Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been advised by the majority \ncloakroom that Senator McCain will not be here for a few minutes. We \ndon't want him to lose any of his hour. He told me how important it is \nto him to have that hour. So I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nIowa be recognized. When Senator McCain does appear on the floor, \nSenator Harkin would yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain be allotted his \nfull hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for asking \nfor this consent. Certainly I will yield to the Senator from Arizona \nwhen he arrives. I know he had time reserved.\n  I listened with great interest to the President's State of the Union \nspeech, hoping to hear what kind of plans he had to help America's \nworking families in the struggling economy. Unfortunately, I didn't \nhear anything to help the millions of people who are out of work and \nhave given up looking for work because there are so few jobs. I think \nthis administration needs to wake up and come up with a real jobs plan \nto help America's families.\n  We need to extend emergency unemployment insurance for the hundreds \nof thousands of people who paid into unemployment when they were \nworking but months after losing their job still can't find work.\n  We need to raise the minimum wage, which has not been increased in \nover 6 years.\n  And the administration needs to immediately withdraw its proposal \nthat would deny millions of workers their overtime pay. The President's \nproposal will deny overtime pay to 8 million workers. Five months ago \nthe Senate voted 54 to 45 on my amendment to block the administration's \neffort to take away overtime pay to 8 million Americans. The House soon \nfollowed, 223 to 201. The Senate spoke again yesterday in its vote \nagainst cloture. This should not even be an issue on the Omnibus \nappropriations bill that is before us today. The Congress of the United \nStates spoke up, clear as a bell, and said: No, the administration must \nnot strip overtime rights from 8 million American workers.\n  But, as we all know, the administration refused to accept the will of \nCongress. The administration ordered its foot soldiers in the House to \nstrip this provision from the omnibus. Senator Specter and I fought to \nkeep it in, but the administration refused any cooperation or \ncompromise. In the end, just like that, without any vote in the \nconference, the administration nullified the clear will of both Houses \nof Congress and the American people by sticking to his position to deny \novertime pay rights to 8 million Americans.\n  This is a clear abuse of power by the administration and part of a \npattern we have seen from this President, time and time again. The \nadministration seems to believe in government by one branch, the \nexecutive branch. When there are no checks and balances, the result is \nbad public policy, and that is exactly what we see here today.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona has arrived. I will \nyield the floor and resume my talk on the overtime provisions later on \nsometime today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Arizona is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Iowa and welcome him back from \na very interesting time.\n  Mr. President, here we go again, another Omnibus appropriations bill, \nand this one takes the cake. Obviously, the New Years Eve parties \ndidn't end for Congress on January 1. We are on a spending bender and \nthis bill is ample proof of it. I think we have a new phrase in the \nlexicon of description of the way the Congress does business: Another \ndrunken sailor spending spree embarked on by the Congress of the United \nStates to the detriment of our children and our children's children.\n  I haven't been around here as long as many others, but I have never \nseen, nor do I believe history will record, such a rapid transition \nfrom a period of surpluses as far as the eye could see, to now \ncommitment on the part of the administration to cut the deficit in half \nat some time in the future. Multitrillion-dollar surpluses to \nmultitrillion-dollar deficits, and you would think we were still in a \nperiod of surpluses. If you look at this legislation, it is a living, \nbreathing argument that this system is broken, the way we do business. \nSpending is out of control and we are mortgaging the future of our \nchildren and our grandchildren, and there is no way that Medicare and \nSocial Security can be viable when we are amassing these kinds of \noutrageous processes. I say shame on this body, shame on the \nappropriators, and shame on us because, on Thursday, we will, after a \nvote of dissatisfaction, now pass this outrageous spending bill.\n  Americans have heard much about the growing problem of identity \ntheft. We have before us the most costly case of identity theft \nimaginable. It appears that the big spenders in this body have all but \nstolen the credit card numbers of every hard-working taxpayer in \nAmerica and have gone on a limitless spending spree for parochial \nporkbarrel projects, leaving Americans to pay and pay.\n  As I will point out later in my statement on such programs as NASA, \nsome of these cuts are dangerous.\n  Cuts in the International Space Station in the name of porkbarrel \nspending is endangering the very lives of our astronauts. Policy \nchanges that have to do with fundamental changes in media ownership, in \nfishing, and in other areas that have been inserted in this bill are \nabsolutely outrageously in violation of Senate rules, I might add.\n  Please join me as we walk through this shopping mall. On the right, \nwe have $1.8 million for exotic pet disease research in California. On \nyour left, you will find $50 million for an indoor rain forest in \nIowa--$50 million for an indoor rain forest in Iowa? Give me a break. \nOn your left, in front of us, you see $250,000 to build an amphitheater \npark in Illinois.\n  It is time we put an end to this theft. I am sorry we have to call it \ntheft but that is how I see the situation.\n  The sum of these political indulgences is enormous and growing and \namounts to the theft of our future and the theft of our economic \nrecovery.\n  Nearly 1 year ago I stood here and spoke about the 2003 Omnibus \nappropriations bill. At that time, I said our current economic \nsituation and our vital national security concerns illustrate that we \nneed now more than ever\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\nto prioritize our Federal spending. Obviously, it had no effect.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we are nearly 4 months into fiscal \nyear 2004 and still without 7 of the 13 annual appropriations bills. \nThis has become an unacceptable practice. Less than a year after \npassing one monstrosity, we are poised to do it again as if it should \nnow be our standard operating procedure. But far worse than the breadth \nand timing, we have before us a bill loaded with special interest \nporkbarrel projects and legislative riders that have no business in \nthis or any other spending bill.\n  It is no accident that we are dealing with this bill in an election \nyear. In fact, I strongly suggest we change the name of this bill to \n``The Incumbent Protection Act of 2004.'' Forget about the Patriots \nversus the Panthers in the Super Bowl next weekend. We are right in the \nmiddle of the Super Bowl of pork. C-SPAN viewers have seats at the 50-\nyard line. It is Congress versus the American taxpayer, and sadly we \nalready know the outcome of this game. The taxpayer will be the loser.\n  We have before us today a bill that incorporates 7 of the 13 annual \nspending measures totalling a whopping $820 billion chocked full of \nporkbarrel spending and major policy changes.\n  The Kansas City Star recently reported, ``Enough pork is layered into \nthe spending bill that even the Missouri Pork Producers Association is \nin line for $1 million.''\n  There is over $11 billion unrequested, unauthorized, run-of-the-mill \npork projects inserted in the 1,182 pages of this conference report.\n  Let us talk about some of the interesting provisions: $200,000 for \nthe West Oahu campus of the University of Hawaii to produce the \n``Primal Quest'' film documentary.\n  I am sure my colleagues will again be surprised at the number of \nprojects that go to the States of the senior members of the \nAppropriations Committee, Alaska, West Virginia, Mississippi, and \nHawaii: $225,000 to the Wheels Museum in New Mexico--a wheels museum in \nNew Mexico; $7.3 million for Hawaiian sea turtles; $6 million for sea \nlions in Alaska; $450,000 for the Johnny Appleseed Heritage Center in \nOhio; $100,000 to the State Historical Society of Iowa in Des Moines \nfor the development of the World Food Prize; $200,000 to the Rock and \nRoll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, OH, for the Rockin' the \nSchools education program.\n\n  As a fan of rock and roll, I can certainly see why that Rockin' the \nSchools education program would be worthy of $200,000; $1 million for \nthe continued threat of the Mormon cricket infestation in the great \nState of Utah.\n  Here are interesting ones: $450,000 for an Alaska statehood \ncelebration and $225,000 for an Hawaii statehood celebration. If I were \nthe Senator from Hawaii, I would certainly be angered that I have been \nshorted $225,000 to celebrate my statehood. Hawaii became a State in \nthe same year. You would think they would want to equalize that. I am \nsure they will fix it in a later appropriations bill knowing the way, \nin the case of Alaska and Hawaii, that one hand washes the other; \n$175,000 to a city in Missouri for the painting of a mural on a flood \nwall. That must be one heck of a mural; $90,000 for fruit fly research \nin Montpellier, France.\n  Given the closeness of our relationship with the French, I can \ncertainly understand why we would want to send $90,000 over there to \nhelp get rid of that fruit fly in Montpellier.\n  But back to home, $225,000 to Traverse City, MI, for the restoration \nof an opera house. Opera lovers rejoice; $250,000 for the Alaska \nAviation Heritage Museum. Alaska is known for a lot of things, but \nbeing the hotbed or the birthplace of aviation is not one that I knew \nof, although over the years I have grown to be more and more aware of \nthe critical needs of Alaska for Federal funds for every conceivable \npurpose; $200,000 to the town of Guadalupe, AR, for the construction \nand renovation of a shopping center. I will have to go out there and \nsee it. It is not too far from my home; $325,000 to the city of \nSalinas, CA, for the construction of a swimming pool.\n  Some of my colleagues may have read about this kind of interesting \nthing. It appears that a Member of the other body had some pangs of \nconscience because he dropped a frog into the swimming pool, or \nsomething like that. But whatever, the city of Salinas will have a new \nswimming pool.\n  And $100,000 to the city of Macon, GA, for the renovation of the \nCoca-Cola building. I can certainly see why the Coca-Cola people \ncouldn't arrange for that. They are an impoverished corporation, as we \nall know; $100,000 to the city of Atlanta for the renovation of \nPaschal's restaurant and motel. I am sure there is great historical \nsignificance associated with Paschal's restaurant and motel down there \nin the impoverished part of Atlanta; $900,000 to an economic \ndevelopment association in Idaho to continue the implementation of the \nLewis and Clark Bicentennial commemoration plan; $175,000 to the city \nof Detroit for the design and construction of a zoo. The city of \nDetroit certainly wouldn't want to have to pick up any of that tab; \n$238,000 to the National Wild Turkey Federation. I wasn't sure whether \nthis was the animal or the beverage. But either way, $238,000 to the \nWild Turkey Federation will, I am sure, be wisely spent, and perhaps \nthat would reduce the cost per bottle; $200,000 for the city of North \nPole, AK, for recreational improvements.\n  I know it has been a bad Christmas season for some, but you would \nthink the elves and others might not need $200,000 for North Pole, AK. \nBut one never knows, does one? The condition of the elves and Mrs. \nClaus are generally updated only around Christmastime. But it has come \na little late this year. I will have to ask my staff to find out the \ntotal population of North Pole, AK, although counting nonpersons, I am \nsure, would enlarge the census there. There is $100,000 for restoration \nof the Jefferson County Courthouse clock tower in Washington State. \nThat was under the category of economic development. I imagine everyone \nknowing what time it is would probably encourage efficiency there.\n\n  There is $220,000 to the Blueberry Hill Farm in Maine. They are \ngetting their thrill on Blueberry Hill. I almost did not use that one, \nit is so schmaltzy.\n  While many of these projects may sound comical, they illustrate a \nbadly broken system in need of serious and comprehensive reform. The \nHUD portion of this bill contains an account that is perhaps the best \nevidence that this process is completely broken and out of control. The \nappropriators included $278 million in this bill for so-called \n``economic development initiatives.'' Every single dime of that $278 \nmillion was served up as pork. There were 40 pages of report language. \nThe appropriators dished out 902 earmarks for everything from theater \nrenovations in Jenkintown, PA, to quarry updates in Nome, Alaska.\n  Excuse me, North Pole, Alaska. The population in 2000 was 1,570, so \n$200,000 is a tidy Christmas present.\n  Back to the 902 earmarks, from everything from theater preservation \nto quarry updates in Nome, Alaska. Again, somehow Alaska comes back and \nback and back and back throughout. I wonder how the people in Alaska \nfeel about being put on welfare.\n  Sadly, the EDI account in the HUD appropriations bill has become \nnothing more than a slush fund for the appropriators, completely \neliminating any competitive or merit-based determination by the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development. The only word that comes to \nmind to describe this practice is ``shameful.''\n  At the same time, I will comment about some language in the statement \nof managers language accompanying this conference report that offers a \nmore appropriate approach. Many of the accounts throughout the \nDepartment of Justice portion of this bill contain language that allows \nFederal officials, Governors, and other State and local representatives \nsome discretion in awarding the appropriated funds. While the statement \nof managers names specific entities in connection with the Department \nof Justice grant, it also states that funding should be awarded if they \nare warranted after a proper review. Unfortunately, that kind of \nlanguage is missing throughout the rest of this legislation. I hope the \nagency officials charged with reviewing these proposals will employ a \nmodicum of fiscal restraint in some projects mentioned, such as $2 \nmillion for the First Tee Program, which teaches\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nyoung people how to play golf. I know the Presiding Officer is an avid \ngolf fan and has been to many parts of the world in order to enjoy the \ngame of golf, but I don't think even he would think it is justified in \nthis period of multitrillion dollar deficits to spend $2 million for \nthe First Tee Program.\n\n  As inappropriate as the earmarks are, I am perhaps more dismayed at \nthe inclusion of some major policy changes in the bill. Every member of \nthis Chamber knows it is a violation of Senate rule XVI to legislate on \nan appropriations bill, the most often violated rule I know of in the \nSenate. Moreover, every Member knows it is a violation of rule XXVIII \nto add new provisions in conference that have not been included in \neither House or Senate bill sent to conference. Sadly, every Member \nknows this omnibus violates those rules. The inclusion of special \ninterest legislative riders on a must-pass spending measure is not only \na corruption of the proper process, it is irresponsible and an affront \nto good government.\n  I turn first of all to Section 629, the Commerce-State-Justice \ndivision of the omnibus. The provision would undo the Federal \nCommunications Commissions June 2 decision to incrementally raise the \nnational television broadcast station ownership from 35 percent to 45 \npercent. Instead, the provision would set the ownership cap at 39 \npercent. I strongly object to the inclusion of this provision for both \nprocedural and substantive reasons. Procedurally, this is a blatant \nattempt by the appropriators to usurp the jurisdiction of the \nauthorizers. I have not supported the use of the appropriations process \nto legislate policy and I will not do so today. Substantively, this \nprovision is objectionable because while purporting to address public \nconcerns about excessive media consolidation, it really only addresses \nthe concerns of special interests. It is no coincidence, my friends, \nthat the 39 percent is the exact ownership percentage of Viacom and \nCBS. Why did they pick 39 percent? So that these two major \nconglomerates would be grandfathered in, purportedly, in order to \nreduce the media ownership, which was voted 55-40 in the Senate. The \nfact is now they are endorsing Viacom and CBS's 39 percent ownership, \ngrandfathering them in because they should have been at 35 percent. \nRemarkable.\n  I am not sure where the line should be drawn. We have spent hours and \nhours and hours in the Commerce Committee in hearings on this issue. I \nhave never seen such an uprising of American public opinion on an issue \nthat surprised me as much as this issue of media concentration. \nHundreds of thousands of people contacted the FCC on this issue. A vote \nwas forced in the Senate which rolled back--the first time in my \nmemory--a decision of the Federal Communications Commission. I had very \nmixed emotions about it. But when I saw a clear channel radio go from \n140 stations to 1,240 stations and there is a toxic spill in Minot, ND, \nand there is not a single person in any of those stations to warn the \nlocal people, I am worried about media concentration.\n  So what did the appropriators do? They pandered to a special \ninterest, Viacom and CBS, and grandfathered them in. That is what this \nis all about. Do you think they addressed the major concern that most \nhave, which is cross ownership? When Gannett owns the Arizona Republic \nand Channel 12, it is OK. What happens when Gannett owns Channel 12 and \nChannel 10 and Channel 5? That is what concerns people.\n  So the appropriators, in a blatant bow to Viacom and CBS, insert a 39 \npercent rule. I again give credit where it is due, the power of the \nNational Association of Broadcasters, which is not included in the \nprovision, as the ultimate proof of their influence. Why is it that \nother concerns that have been raised and were voted on in the Senate \nwere not included in the appropriations bill? It is because the \nNational Association of Broadcasters did not want it in.\n\n  As I mentioned, this is not the first attempt by Congress to undo the \nFCC's new media ownership rules. Last September, the Senate voted 55-40 \nin support of Senator Dorgan's congressional disapproval resolution \nwhich sought to declare all of the FCC's new media ownership rules \n``null and void.'' The omnibus spending bill is not the appropriate \nlegislative vehicle to undo the commission's broadcast ownership cap.\n  If the Congress wishes to take action on the issue of media \nownership, it ought to do so in the committee of jurisdiction. The \nissue of media ownership is far broader than the limited scope of this \nprovision. As William Safire wrote in an op-ed piece in the New York \nTimes, itself a large owner of several media outlets: The effect of the \nmedia's march to amalgamation on America's freedom of voice [is a] far-\nreaching political decision [that] should be made by Congress and the \nWhite House, after extensive hearings and fair coverage by too-shy \nbroadcasters, no-local-news cable networks, and conflicted newspapers.\n  I can spend a lot of time later on this year on this whole issue of \nwhat is happening with localism, with the station owner in Baltimore \nwhere the person goes on the set with an overcoat on and says, It is \nreally cold here in Minnesota today. These are serious issues.\n  What did the appropriators do? They decided to do something for the \nNational Association of Broadcasters. We had multiple hearings in \nexamining media ownership and several committee members introduced S. \n1046, the Preservation of Localism Program Diversity and Competition in \nTelevision Broadcast Service Act of 2002, and that is what we should be \ndebating.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, has said many times, we \nnow have many voices and one ventriloquist.\n  Now, if we could have a little straight talk here today, while the \nNAB is unhappy with only part of the FCC's new rules, there is no valid \npublic policy reason why both of the FCC rules should not be considered \ntogether. In fact, if only one rule could be addressed, as I said \nbefore, the broadcast/newspaper cross-ownership rule is the one that \nshould be addressed.\n  In an October hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, the \nentire panel of academics and analysts agreed that the FCC's new \nnewspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule would have a significantly \ngreater impact on media ownership concentration than the new 45-percent \nnational television broadcast ownership cap.\n  One of the panelists, Dr. Mark Cooper, provided the example of \nTallahassee, FL, where the top TV station has a 70-percent market share \nand the daily newspaper has 60 percent penetration. If they merge, they \nwould employ almost two-thirds of all local journalists in that \ncommunity.\n  A September article in Business Week recognized this and stated:\n\n       The 45% cap has become a rallying symbol, but the \n     regulations that would truly reorder America's media \n     landscape and affect local communities have flown under the \n     radar. These would allow companies to snap up not only two or \n     three local TV stations in a market but also a newspaper and \n     up to eight radio stations. If the courts and Congress are \n     worried about the dangers of media consolidation, they'll \n     have to resist calling it a day after dispensing with the \n     network cap and go after the rules with real bite.\n\n  In opposition to the National Association of Broadcasters selective \nadvocacy, all four television networks have quit their membership in \nNAB. In a resignation letter submitted last year, ABC/Disney wrote:\n\n       Almost two years ago, the other major broadcast networks \n     resigned from the NAB. The issue was the patently \n     hypocritical NAB position favoring deregulation of newspaper \n     cross-ownership and duopoly while simultaneously advocating \n     continued regulation of the national station cap. The NAB and \n     the public policy process in Washington should not be abused \n     to advance the business interests of one broadcaster over \n     another.\n\n  The ABC/Disney suggestion is exactly what is going on here. This \nprovision is not about public policy; it is about advancing the \ninterests of the National Association of Broadcasters.\n  To summarize, stand-alone legislation like S. 1046, that was reported \nout of the authorizing committee, is the correct vehicle to address \nthese difficult and complex issues involving media ownership. Attaching \na rider to selectively address concerns of special nonpublic interests \nis not the way to make good policy.\n  Let me state from the outset I take a back street to no one in my \nsupport of second amendment rights. I have supported nearly every law \nthat protects the rights of law-abiding gun owners since first coming \nto Washington. But there is a special interest rider included in this \nOmnibus appropriations bill that is absolutely appalling. The House \nsponsor of this provision has argued that it benefits gun\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nowners, but the only gun owners it seems to help are those who have \nbroken the law.\n  This rider has three major provisions, all of them unnecessary for \ngun owners, and none of them helpful for law enforcement.\n\n  First, it requires that background check approval records be \ndestroyed within 24 hours instead of the current policy of 90 days. \nProponents argue that keeping these records for 90 days constitutes a \nnational firearms registry. I want to be very clear, I oppose Federal \nregistration of firearms.\n  I also want to be equally clear that our current policy of keeping \nthese records for 90 days does not constitute in any way, shape, or \nform a national registry. It is a phony issue.\n  The 90-days retention allows the NICS system to correct mistakes that \noccur when they accidentally approve someone who should have been \ndenied a gun in the first place. This happens about 500 times a year, \naccording to the General Accounting Office. Nearly all these false \napprovals are because of missing domestic violence records. So as far \nas I can tell, this provision benefits no one except those who should \nhave been denied a firearm but were not.\n  The second provision prevents ATF from conducting an inventory audit \nof licensed gun stores. This means that ATF auditors will have no way \nof knowing if a gun store is missing firearms, a sure sign that they \nare selling guns illegally without the proper background checks.\n  In Tacoma, WA, ATF auditors recovered 233 firearms missing from \nBull's Eye Shooters Supply store. One of those weapons was used by the \naccused DC area snipers. Why are we putting special language in a must-\npass Federal spending bill to protect a store such as Bull's Eye? \nConsider the potential consequences.\n  A third provision prohibits the public release of crime gun trace \ninformation. This information is not top secret data that jeopardizes \nour national security or hinders law enforcement. We cannot have a \ngovernment that operates in secret and refuses to release information \nthat shows where criminals have obtained a gun.\n  This provision has no support from the law enforcement community, and \nwas even opposed by Chairman Young and Subcommittee Chairman Wolf. Yet \nhere it is today included in this terrible bill. This language is an \nembarrassment to law-abiding gun owners and a slap in the face to law \nenforcement.\n  Now, it is going to get a little esoteric here for a second, but it \nis very important. Because what we have done in this bill has basically \nchanged the entire fishing industry and the way they do business, \nagain, to protect certain entities in the State of Alaska.\n  One of the policy riders is language that authorizes the Bering Sea \nand Aleutian Islands crab fisheries rationalization plan, which would \ndivide 90 percent of that crab market among just a small group of \nprocessors. Under the provision, fishermen could only sell this crab to \nthose few processors and, in turn, only those processors would sell to \nconsumers.\n  We are creating a cartel, a Government-mandated cartel. And who is \ngoing to pay for that, at the end, in the form of higher prices? Those \nwho eat this crab all over America, including my State.\n  This legislative language has not been considered by the authorizing \ncommittee nor requested by the administration. This provision raises \nserious antitrust concerns. Again, it would require--not simply allow \nbut require--the crab fishermen to sell 90 percent of their crab \nharvest to predetermined processing companies. This precedent-setting \naction would vitiate antitrust laws, limit competition in the seafood \nsector, and ultimately hurt fishermen and consumers. Fishermen around \nthe Nation have expressed strong opposition to this provision, as have \nat least a dozen newspaper editorial boards.\n\n  Before I go any further, I wish to clarify the difference between \n``fishing quotas'' and ``processing quotas.'' Fishing quotas are \nallocation tools that allow fishermen to catch a certain portion of the \noverall allowable harvest. Fishermen can determine when and under what \nconditions to fish with such quotas, and fishing quotas have been \nwidely recognized to benefit fishermen, the environment, and consumers.\n  In contrast, processing quotas would allocate buying rights for the \ncrab catch among a handful of processing companies so that each would \nbe guaranteed to receive a certain percent of the overall harvest. \nRegardless of how efficient these processors are or what kind of price \nthey are offering, they would have a guaranteed market share. I thought \nthat kind of thing went away with the Berlin Wall. Under this plan, it \nwould be illegal for fishermen to take their crab to other processors.\n  This language would have far-reaching consequences. Yet it was \nincluded in this must-pass bill without ever having been considered or \ndebated by the committee of jurisdiction, the Commerce Committee.\n  Fishermen throughout the Nation object to the crab plan's individual \nprocessing quotas, IPQs, because the precedent-setting nature of this \naction could lead to IPQs in the processing sector of other fisheries. \nIndeed, crab boat owners and crew from all over the country--even from \nArizona--have voiced their opposition to this proposal.\n  ``Crab cartels,'' the Anchorage Daily News--even the Anchorage Daily \nNews. ``Stevens pushes plan that gives processors too much market \npower.''\n  The Los Angeles Times: ``Toss This Stinker in the Sea.''\n  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer:\n\n       The quota plan would guarantee shares not just to boat \n     owners, as has been done successfully with other species, but \n     also to fish processors on the land. That has nothing to do \n     with safety. As the U.S. Department of Justice recognizes, it \n     raises significant anti-trust concerns.\n       Crab Cartels are Bad News for Maine Lobster Industry.\n\n  Seattle Times:\n\n       Crab Industry Bakes a Monopoly Pie.\n\n  Seattle Times:\n\n       Feeling Crabby? No Need for a Monopoly.\n\n  It goes on and on. There is nobody who thinks this is a good idea.\n  In addition to affecting the price setting process, I am aware of at \nleast one crab fisherman who owns a fishing boat and a ``catcher-\nprocessor'' boat. He objects to this policy rider because it would make \nit illegal for him to sell his own catch to himself, so that the catch \nfrom his fishing boat could be processed on his processing boat.\n  According to the National Research Council, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, fishermen's \nconcerns about IPQs are clearly justified. The 1999 NRC publication, \nSharing the Fish, found no ``compelling reason to establish a separate, \ncomplementary processor quota system'' to accompany an Individual \nFishing Quota program. These findings were echoed by the GAO in its \nDecember 2002 report on IFQs, which failed to find the IFQ programs \nresulted in harmful impacts on processors in the halibut and sablefish \nfisheries that would warrant creation of an IPQ program.\n  Furthermore, on August 27, 2003, the Assistant Attorney General of \nthe U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division wrote a letter to the \nGeneral Counsel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA, in which he opposed the IPQ provisions of the crab plan, stating \n``processor quotas are not justified by any such beneficial competitive \npurpose'' and that ``The Department urges NOAA to oppose IPQ.''\n  While the fisherman are up in arms, the processors are already \ncounting their chickens, or in this case, crab harvests, and in turn, \ntheir profits. That is because the percent of the harvest that they \nwill be able to process in the future is based on how much they have \nprocessed in the past under the free market environment. Regardless of \nfuture operational efficiency, supply and demand, or any other real-\nworld factors, these processors will be guaranteed their allocation in \nperpetuity. Consider, for example, one company that recently has \nprocessed roughly 20 percent of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island \ncrab. This provision will assure that company continues to receive 20 \npercent of future harvests--worth on the order of tens of millions of \ndollars annually.\n  For centuries, fishermen have used market forces to negotiate their \ndockside prices, and this has had the effect of maintaining competition \nand benefitting consumers. Processor quotas throw an enormous wrench \ninto the free market machinery.\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\n  In addition to affecting the price-setting process, the crab IPQ plan \nalso would effectively prevent new processors from entering the \nindustry. If anyone wants to enter the processing sector, they would \nneed to buy the processing rights from the few processors who would \nhave processing quota.\n  Considering all these facts, the administration has officially stated \nits opposition to IPQs, as reported in the Sacramento Bee, Kodiak Daily \nMirror, Anchorage Daily News, and Seattle Times. The administration's \nproposed language for amending the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries \nConservation and Management Act clearly specifies that processors could \nown fishing quota, but does not propose a separate quota system \ndivvying up processor quotas.\n  Editorial boards from at least 12 major newspapers--the Washington \nPost, Washington Times, Boston Globe, Oregonian, Anchorage Daily News, \nLos Angeles Times, Honolulu Advertiser, Daily Astorian, Seattle Times, \nSeattle Post-Intelligencer, Portland Press Herald in Maine, and the \nTampa Tribune--have come out against IPQs. Note that these newspapers \ninclude the entire west coast--even Alaska and Hawaii.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 5, 2003]\n\n                      Toss This Stinker in the Sea\n\n       Ted Stevens thinks the Alaskan fishermen and processors he \n     represents shouldn't have to comply with federal rules they \n     don't like. So the powerful Republican, chairman of the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee, attached a rider to the \n     Commerce, Justice and State appropriations bill to give \n     Alaskan industry a pass.\n       Stevens insists that Alaskans have done a better job \n     husbanding their fish-teeming waters than have other states. \n     Regardless of whether he is right about the health of the \n     Alaskan crab, salmon and pollock populations, he's wrong to \n     use the appropriations process to grant favors that rewrite \n     federal resource law behind closed doors.\n       One provision of his rider would freeze all funds to \n     enforce federal laws imposing new limits on crabbing and \n     fishing in sensitive ocean habitat. Another legal barnacle \n     guarantees certain processing companies 90% of the lucrative \n     Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab catch. This \n     unprecedented deal not only would favor some processors and \n     unfairly exclude others, it would hobble fishermen from \n     offering their prized catches to the highest bidders.\n       This rider is troubling by itself. But it becomes deeply \n     disturbing when combined with the growing market for seafood \n     and the more efficient fishing techniques that threaten ocean \n     species. For example, the red king crab season in Alaska's \n     Bristol Bay this year was the shortest ever. Crabbers \n     captured an entire year's quota in a little more than two \n     days by using 700-pound steel pots baited with chopped \n     herring and set and retrieved by hydraulic launchers and \n     large winches. Yet even as this high-tech harvest intensifies \n     each year, Stevens would order federal regulators to lay off, \n     a move certain to put more pressure on the prized critters' \n     survival.\n       Stevens' rider also would set destructive precedent. \n     California, Florida or Maine lawmakers could decide they want \n     to suspend federal rules protecting their fish.\n       Federal fisheries law is and should remain the product of \n     consensus and deliberation, not one senator's backroom \n     maneuvers. that's why Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Olympia \n     J. Snowe (R-Maine) promise to ``strenuously oppose'' Stevens' \n     rider. When the mammoth spending bill that it is hooked to \n     comes before the Senate, other senators too should cast his \n     smelly deal into the deep.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Anchorage Daily News, Sept. 16, 2003]\n\nCrab Cartels--Stevens Pushes Plan That Gives Processors Too Much Market \n                                 Power\n\n        U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens is fast-tracking a controversial \n     plan that dictates where Alaska's Bering Sea crab fishermen \n     are allowed to sell all but a tiny part of their catch. He is \n     pressing the legislative process to ram through a scheme that \n     short-circuits market competition.\n        The concept Sen. Stevens is pushing is known as processor \n     quotas. Using a legislative shortcut called a rider, he \n     tacked his measure onto one of the 13 federal spending bills \n     that have to pass each year, instead of pursuing a stand-\n     alone bill that would have to be judged on its own merits in \n     committee and on the Senate floor. A rider is no way for \n     Congress to make such a complicated, far-reaching and hotly \n     disputed decision.\n        Processor quotas are part of a larger set of fish \n     management changes that address real problems in the Bering \n     Sea. Fishing for crabs today is a free-for-all, a race to see \n     who can catch the most the fastest. As a result, too many \n     boats are chasing too few crabs. They go out in dangerous \n     weather, and crews work dangerously long hours. The boats \n     then rush to deliver their catch, so processing plants have \n     to move huge amounts of product before it spoils.\n        To cure these problems in some other Alaska fisheries, \n     federal managers now use individual fishing quotas. In that \n     system, the government gives each fisherman the right to take \n     a certain percentage of each year's allowable harvest. \n     Fishermen can go out when it's safe and work at a safe pace \n     without having to worry that others will grab all the fish. \n     Fish plants have more time to process the catch and produce \n     higher-quality products.\n        These fishing quotas have improved the safety and economic \n     health of other Alaska fisheries. Processors, though have \n     complained that fishermen with quotas now have too much time \n     to shop around and get higher prices for their catch.\n       Crab processors persuaded the North Pacific Fishery \n     Management Council to try to cure their problem. So when the \n     council decided to give fishermen rights to catch Bering Sea \n     crab, fish plants in the region also got guaranteed rights to \n     process the catch. Fishermen would have to sell 90 percent of \n     their catch to existing processors. This part of the \n     council's plan requires congressional approval, which is \n     where Sen. Stevens and his rider come in.\n       Processor quotas are a straightforward way for fish plants \n     to limit competition and grab back economic power they might \n     lose if fishermen get a guaranteed share of the catch. \n     Imagine if Congress dared to tell farmers they could sell \n     their grain only to a handful of agribusiness companies. \n     There would be an uproar on the plains. The U.S. Department \n     of Justice opposes fish processor quotas because they are \n     anti-competitive, and indeed they are.\n       Processor quotas are a government attempt to do the \n     economically impossible. They are a convoluted system that \n     tries to hold everybody harmless as the government revamps \n     management of the crab fisheries. It's inevitable that those \n     changes will create winners and losers, both among fishermen \n     and processors. The government can't micromanage such complex \n     economic consequences and shouldn't even try. The job is just \n     too complicated, the mechanisms too convoluted, the \n     intervention in markets too deep.\n       Sen. Stevens says he's just doing what the professional \n     managers at the federal fish council want. (They unanimously \n     approved a crab management plan with processor quotas.) The \n     only problem is that the fish council is an industry-\n     dominated process. This complicated, anti-competitive deal \n     was hatched up in an attempt to keep all the players at the \n     table happy. Consumers and free-market advocates don't have a \n     seat on the council.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Nov. 3, 2003]\n\n                  Boat Quotas Make Crab Fishing Safer\n\n       Crab fishing off Alaska can be made safer.\n       The key to reducing fatalities is a quota system.

As fellow Republican Sens. \n     John McCain and Olympia Snowe recognize, that's a poor way to \n     make policy.\n       Attaching riders to spending bills end-runs the lawmaking \n     process.

His rider \n     would reopen a troubled pollock fishery, stop studies of \n     critical North Pacific habitat and prevent new rules against \n     bottom-scraping trawling equipment.\n       The quota plan would guarantee shares not just to boat \n     owners, as has been done successfully with other species, but \n     also to fish processors on the land. That has nothing to do \n     with safety. As the U.S. Department of Justice recognizes, it \n     raises significant antitrust concerns.\n       Unless Stevens rewrites his rider, the Senate should block \n     it.

No Need for a Monopoly\n\n       Seafood processors, led by Seattle-based Trident Seafoods, \n     have been campaigning for years for exclusive rights to buy \n     crab from the Bering Sea fleet. If these rights come into \n     effect, a newcomer who wanted to buy that crab would have to \n     buy the rights to buy crab from companies already in the \n     business.\n       In the proposal now under consideration, anyone wishing to \n     enter the crab-processing business would have to get \n     permission from someone already in it.\n       And that is a monopoly privilege.\n       Processors say they are asking only for what boat owners \n     will get: an individual quota of crab. But these two quotas \n     are not the same.\n       For the fishermen, crab is wild and in the public domain. \n     There has to be a quota, either for the whole fleet or each \n     boat. The idea of a quota for each boat allows crab to be \n     harvested slowly, cost-effectively and safely. There is a \n     public interest in doing it that way.\n       Processors buy crab that is already harvested. There is no \n     public-interest reason to give certain processors what \n     amounts to ration coupons. And nowhere else in U.S. fisheries \n     do such rights exist.\n       Individual harvest quotas exist in halibut, black cod and \n     elsewhere. But they are never buying quotas.\n       Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and head of the Appropriations \n     Committee, is now offering processors quotas to buy.

Leal)\n\n       Depletion of the fish in our coastal oceans is a growing \n     environmental concern, and the state of Alaska is poised to \n     help correct the problem. But Alaska's senior senator, Ted \n     Stevens, Republican, won't let it happen without attaching \n     some expensive strings. Mr. Stevens is backing individual \n     fishing quotas (IFQs) for Alaskan crabbers. That's good \n     policy. But he insists on a provision requiring crabbers to \n     sell 90 percent of their catch to a small group of \n     established processors. That's bad policy. To accomplish \n     this, he has attached a rider to an omnibus appropriations \n     bill, which the House and Senate must vote on by Jan. 31.\n       Alaskan crab fishers participate in one of the most \n     dangerous fisheries in the world. Loss of life is not \n     uncommon. Part of the reason crabbing is so dangerous is that \n     the seasons are incredibly short--only four to six days long \n     in the winter--when winds are high, water is turbulent, and \n     decks are icy.\n       Regulation has not ended the race that occurs when fishers \n     depend for their livelihood on unowned resources like ocean \n     fish and shellfish. IFQs could solve this problem. IFQs would \n     give crab fishers a right to a specific portion of the total \n     allowable catch set for Alaska crabs each year.\n       With IFQs, each crabber would know how much he or she is \n     allowed to catch each season. Assured of such a quota, \n     fishers would not be forced into the destructive ``race to \n     fish.'' Fishing management councils could extend the seasons, \n     fishing would be safer, the quality of the seafood would go \n     up (fishers would have time to protect the quality), and \n     fresh crab would reach the consumer more often.\n       But there's the rub--fresh crab. Mr. Stevens wants to \n     protect the companies that process fish. Under the current \n     regulatory regime, with its short, intense seasons, these \n     processors invested in additional plant capacity such as \n     extra freezer space. If IFQs are implemented and seasons \n     extended, some of this processing and storage capacity will \n     probably not be needed. Also, processors will also have less \n     control over prices, because fishers will be able to choose \n     when they want to fish.\n       Mr. Stevens is trying to create a package for crab \n     fisheries that holds IFQs hostage to benefits for processors. \n     His rider, which would give crabbers IFQs only if they \n     deliver 90 percent of their catch to a handful of processors, \n     has drawn protests from the Bush administration and Senate \n     colleagues. Even the Justice Department has suggested it \n     would not stand up under antitrust law. Fellow Republican \n     Sens. John McCain of Arizona (and Olympia Snowe of Maine have \n     also criticized Mr. Stevens for attaching a precedent-setting \n     policy issue to an appropriations bill.\n       Processors deserve sympathy because they were steered by \n     flawed government policy to invest in redundant capacity. But \n     forcing crabbers to take their catch to a specific processor \n     will hurt their chances of receiving a competitive price. It \n     could also derail the effort, supported by free marketers and \n     environmental activists alike, to implement IFQs elsewhere. \n     Surely better options--like a stranded capital buyout program \n     or simply including processors in the allocation of the \n     individual fishing quotas--exist for compensating processors.\n       Alaska's halibut fishery has already shown the benefits of \n     IFQs. In the early 1990s, halibut fishermen were limited to \n     fishing during just three 24-hour fishing openings a year. \n     Catching halibut was dangerous, profits were low, and most of \n     the catch had to be frozen. When IFQs were adopted in 1995, \n     the season was expanded to 245 days. Fishing became more \n     profitable and safer. Fisheries in New Zealand, Iceland, \n     Australia and Canada also show that IFQs improve fish \n     management, reduce danger and improve product quality. \n     Congress should not let the processors' difficulties stand in \n     the way of a solution to a problem that is hurting marine \n     resources around the world. Don't let Sen. Stevens' rider \n     remain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Additionally, the conference report would authorize a \nsimilar processor quota program for Gulf of Alaska rockfish. Even \nthough IPQ proponents had previously indicated that IPQs are needed for \ncrab only, they are now proposing authorizing such a program for a \ndifferent Alaskan fishery.\n  Further, the conference report also would authorize the North Pacific \nCouncil to open an area currently closed to fishing, but open it only \nto the Aleut Corporation, which would also have the exclusive right to \nprocess the fish. This new fishery could be worth more than $10 \nmillion, yet the proposal has not undergone the proper congressional \nauthorization and oversight process that we demand for other important \npolicy issues.\n  Obviously this proposal makes fundamental changes to our fisheries \npolicies. This rockfish and pollock language was not requested by the \nadministration nor the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and it \nhasn't been reviewed by the authorizing committees. At a minimum, all \nof these new quota provisions merit thorough review and debate prior to \ntheir enactment.\n  The tacking of fisheries riders onto appropriations bills extends all \nthe way to North Atlantic fisheries as well. Last-minute language was \nadded that would prevent the administration from implementing a \ngroundfish management plan required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Not \nsurprisingly, the administration did not request this change, nor has \nthe authorizing committee of jurisdiction held any hearings on this \nproposal.\n  In the northeast, fishery managers must comply with a court-ordered \nimplementation date of May 1, 2004, for putting a groundfish management \nplan into effect, and the administration is now seeking public comment \non and finalizing regulations to do this.\n  Even before we know what the final plan is, the language would \nprohibit the administration from spending any money to implement this \nplan. The legislative rider would authorize funding for only a certain \nset of management rules--which have already been determined by a court \nto be out of compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  So, under the language in the omnibus, it would be illegal for the \nadministration to comply with Federal fisheries law as set out in the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act. If this provision is enacted, there is a real \nrisk that the fishery could be ordered closed by a Federal court.\n\n  Again, this significant policy change was not considered by or \ndebated in the Commerce Committee. I am more than willing to discuss \nways to redesign the fisheries management council process, along with \nthe rest of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, if indeed, it is as flawed as \nsome seem to think it is. This rider, however, is not the appropriate \nway to make policy.\n  Section 626 of the omnibus broadly requires the Secretary of Commerce \nto ``negotiate or reevaluate, with the consent of the President, \ninternational agreements affecting international ocean policy.''\n  Under 22 U.S.C. Section 2655a, however, international ocean policy \nissues are currently handled by the State Department's Bureau of Oceans \nand International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, or OES. Several \nmarine resource conservation laws, including the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act, grant the Secretary of State the authority to\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\nnegotiate international agreements on these matters. Clearly, this \nlanguage conflicts with the Secretary of State's statutory \nresponsibility for carrying out a coherent foreign policy.\n  When appropriators first proposed such a transfer of responsibility \nin the FY04 CJS appropriations bill, Secretary Colin Powell explained, \n``Such a provision would significantly hamper the Department's ability \nto address important foreign policy issues (e.g., oceans policy, marine \npollution, global overfishing) to which the United States can ill \nafford to give short shrift.''\n  Considering the important role that the United States needs to \nmaintain as a leader in the international community on ocean policy \nmatters, I am dismayed that the appropriators would attempt to transfer \nthese powers between government agencies without any public or expert \nreview and debate. This is clearly a matter that needs the full \nattention of the Commerce and Foreign Relations Committees, and this \nhas not happened.\n  A provision in the EPA portion of the VA-HUD section of this bill \nprohibits all States, with the exception of California, from exercising \ntheir existing authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate ``non-\nroad'' engines to improve air quality. This language will effectively \ntie the hands of the State air pollution control agencies by preventing \nthem from addressing the 120 million small engines which are a \nsubstantial and growing source of smog and soot pollution nationwide.\n  This provision was originally put in the VA-HUD bill at the request \nof a single engine manufacturer, Briggs and Stratton. The company \nsuggested that the provision would save jobs. I find this argument very \ndisingenuous due to the fact that, in its September 2003 filing with \nthe SEC, the company stated, ``Briggs and Stratton does not believe \nthat the CARB staff proposal will have a material effect on its \nfinancial condition or results of operations . . .''\n\n  Our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, made an effective \nargument against the language on the Senate floor during consideration \nof the bill, but she was not permitted to offer an amendment to strike \nthe language. Mr. President, what has come out of the conference may be \nacceptable to California and to Briggs and Stratton, but it is \nunacceptable to me and should be unacceptable to almost every Member of \nthis body.\n  If you have not heard from your State air agency yet, you certainly \nwill soon. In the State of Arizona, for example, the potential \nemissions impact of these unregulated engines is equivalent to 1.4 \nmillion additional cars on the roads. This is almost certain to worsen \nthe smog problem in the city of Phoenix, and I am sure it will be the \nsame in many other cities in the Nation. I have no doubts that with \nworsening smog will come many more cases of asthma and a litany of \nother health problems. It is simply outrageous that States will be \nprohibited from exercising their responsibility to protect public \nhealth and the environment because one company was able to secure a \nspecial deal in a must-pass spending bill.\n  I also am very concerned that for the NASA funding portions, that the \nJoint Explanatory Statement to the conference report contains a list of \n144 earmarks that total in excess of $300 million. These earmarks are \nunauthorized and unrequested by the President. Meanwhile, the \ninternational space station has been funded at $200 million below the \nPresident's request. This action comes despite news reports that have \noutlined numerous safety problems aboard the international space \nstation.\n  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), which was assigned \nto determine the causes of last February's tragic accident, described \nthe results of congressional earmarking in its August report. According \nto the CAIB Report:\n\n       Pressure on NASA's budget has come not only from the White \n     House, but also from the Congress. In recent years there has \n     been an increasing tendency for the Congress to add \n     ``earmarks''--congressional additions to the NASA budget \n     request that reflect targeted Members' interests. These \n     earmarks come out of already-appropriated funds, reducing the \n     amounts available for the original tasks.\n\n  I must question whether we have learned anything from the shuttle \naccident and the CAIB findings. During a Senate Commerce Committee \nhearing last year, I questioned Admiral Gehman about the effects of the \n$167 million that was earmarked in fiscal year 2003 appropriations \nbill. He responded by saying that ``$100 million will buy a lot of \nsafety engineers.'' Maybe we should ask what he thinks should be done \nwith over $300 million worth of earmarks.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the \nimportance of fully funding the international space station. Again, the \nomnibus provides $200 million less than the President's request at a \ntime when serious safety concerns have been raised about the space \nstation. This underfunding could be corrected if we simply eliminated \nthese wasteful earmarks and we'd even have money to spare.\n  William F. Readdy, the NASA Associate Administrator at the Office of \nSpace Flight, testified before the Commerce Committee that the space \nstation onboard environmental monitoring system which, ``provides very \nhigh accuracy information on atmospheric composition and presence of \ntrace elements . . . is not operating at full capacity.'' He also \ntestified that the crew health countermeasures, which include an \nonboard treadmill and associated resistive exercise devices, were \n``operating at various degrees of reduced capacity and needed to be \nrepaired, upgraded or replaced.''\n  Articles in the Washington Post paint an even more disturbing \npicture. An October 23, 2003, article describes:\n\n       The problems with monitoring environmental conditions \n     aboard the space station have festered for more than a year, \n     some NASA medical officials said. Space station astronauts \n     have shown such symptoms as headaches, dizziness and ``an \n     inability to think clearly,'' according to a medical officer \n     who asked not to be named. The onboard sensors designed to \n     provide real-time analysis of the air, water and radiation \n     levels have been broken for months, which has made it \n     impossible to determine at any given time whether there is a \n     buildup of trace amounts of dangerous chemical compounds that \n     could sicken astronauts, or worse.\n\n  A November 9, 2003, Washington Post article reports that:\n\n       A recent NASA study found that the risk of fire aboard the \n     station has grown because the crew is stowing large \n     quantities of supplies, equipment and waste in front of or \n     near 14 portals that would be crucial for detecting and \n     extinguishing a fire in any of the station's various \n     compartments. There is also concern that a portion of the \n     station's water stores supplied by the Russians may have high \n     levels of carbon tetrachloride, a toxic contaminant.\n       As far back as March, internal studies warned of a host of \n     dangers for six separate systems, including the thermal \n     controls that cool the station's computers and interiors, \n     that would likely grow out of trying to run the station with \n     limited supplies and a caretaker crew of two instead of the \n     normal complement of three.\n\n  Before the recent launch of Expedition 8, the Chief of NASA's \nHabitability and Environmental Factors Office and NASA's Chief of Space \nMedicine signed a dissent to the ``flight readiness certificate.'' The \ndissent declared that ``the continued degradation in the environmental \nmonitoring system, exercise countermeasures system, and the health \nmaintenance system, coupled with a planned increment duration of \ngreater than 6 months and extremely limited resupply, all combine to \nincrease the risk to the crew to the point where initiation of [the \nmission] is not recommended.''\n  In addition, a December 6, 2003, Washington Post, article states that \none of the gyroscopes that control the space station's motion failed, \nand that another was showing vibrations and spikes in electrical \ncurrent. NASA will be forced to use Russian thrusters onboard the space \nstation to shift the station's position.\n  These are very serious issues that cannot be ignored, yet here we \nare, about to approve more than $300 million for unrequested earmarks \nwhile underfunding more pressing needs. How will these cuts to the \nPresident's budget request affect the safety of the space station? Are \nwe really willing to take any risks? Mr. President, that this practice \ncontinues in the face of legitimate safety concerns is simply \nunacceptable given the tragedies experienced just last year.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy opposed this $200 million \nreduction in the Senate-passed VA-HUD bill, stating that: ``After \ndiligently rebuilding reserves to place the Station on sound financial \nground, this reduction\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\nwould deplete reserves deemed critical by independent cost estimates \nand limit the program's ability to address risks in FY 2004, including \nimpacts from the Columbia accident.''\n  You know, I have to admit I am naive. I thought after the Columbia \ndisaster we would see a reduction in the earmarks. It was an increase.\n  In addition, I have been informed that this reduction would place at \nrisk actions that NASA is taking to address the Independent Management \nand Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task Force recommendations to ensure a \n``credible'' ISS Program.\n  I know there is a lot of excitement about last week's announcement by \nthe President proposing a new agenda for human exploration of the Moon, \nand eventually Mars. However, let us also note that he reaffirmed the \nUnited States commitment to completing the ISS. The Commerce Committee \nwill hold a series of hearings to discuss the proposal, but we will not \nlose sight of our responsibilities of ensuring the safety of the space \nshuttle and international space station.\n  Finally, it is unfortunate that the appropriators, while earmarking \nhundreds of millions of dollars in NASA, underfunded the Advanced \nPolarimeter Sensor of the Global Climate Change Research Initiative by \n$11 million below the President's request--a 47-percent decrease--yet \ncould sure find funds for thousands of earmarks. This reduction would \nsignificantly impact the development of the sensor, which is designed \nto measure methane, tropospheric ozone, aerosols, and black carbon in \nthe atmosphere. The proposed reduction would delay the purchase of \n``long-lead'' item purchases, which could potentially delay the launch \ndate of the satellite from 2007 to 2008.\n  As my colleagues know, the public is greatly concerned about the \nimpacts of climate change on our environment and economy. Although the \nadministration and I have a difference of opinion on the need to take \naction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are in agreement on the \nneed for research in this area. We should not cut this publicly \nsignificant research, so that we can simply fund local pork projects.\n  The bill would appropriate funding for the Advanced Technology \nProgram, ATP, at approximately $152.2 million above the President's \nrequest. The language would ignore the President's attempt to rein in a \ncorporate welfare program in a time of skyrocketing Federal deficits \nand critical national security needs. For example, the most recent ATP \nawards included a grant to Aqua Bounty Farms, Inc., to ``produce \nsterile transgenic fish that can be made fertile as needed for \nreproduction.'' I can assure you that the ATP program was never \nenvisioned to fund the production of sterile transgenic fish.\n\n  I also am concerned about funding for the Scientific and Technical \nResearch and Services account of the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology. This account supports NIST's scientific research, \nincluding Nobel Prize winning research on the Bose-Einstein \ncondensates. This account is funded at approximately $43 million \nbeneath the President's request, while the appropriators have continued \nto earmark activities within this account. I would ask my colleagues to \nask themselves if it is more important to fund a spreadsheet \nengineering initiative at Dartmouth University, or research to help our \nbeleaguered manufacturing sector. Should we fund a wind demonstration \nproject in Texas or research to improve the equipment for our Nation's \nfirst responders? In the long run, it will be considered a great \ntragedy that we have wasted our Nation's scientific potential of \nmeaningless parochial projects.\n  This reduction is even more disturbing given the reality that NIST \nwill have to lay off many of its scientists and engineers due to lack \nof funding. Let me remind my colleagues that these are the scientists \nand engineers that have won two Nobel Prizes for research in the past \nfew years. These layoffs will occur even as we continue to send funding \nto industry through the ATP program for research that is inconsistent \nwith the program requirements of being ``high risk.'' That does not \nsend the right message to our award winning scientist and engineers of \nhow we value their work.\n  There is also language that redirects $40 million to the Port of \nPhiladelphia for construction of a cargo terminal that is designed to \nsupport ``high-speed military sealift and other military purposes.'' \nToday, these type of vessels do not even exist, nor are they being \nchampioned by the military. They are supported, however, by the private \ninvestors and their lobbyists who obviously think it makes sense to \nplace the risk of their venture on the backs of the taxpayers. Let me \nalso mention that the design of these vessels is based on unproven \ntechnology. And, in reviews of the proposed vessel technology by the \nDepartment of Transportation, it was determined that the project did \nnot qualify for government backed financing. It is ridiculous that \ndespite these facts, this legislative rider will risk wasting $40 \nmillion of the taxpayers on a terminal to support a certain type of \nvessel that may never exist. This is a costly example of putting the \ncart before the horse.\n  By the way, we have ample precedent. The Senator from Hawaii, the \nSenator from Alaska, and the Senator from Mississippi put in loan \nguarantees for cruise ships to be built in Pascagoula, MS, which cost \nthe taxpayers $273 million in loan guarantees, which I fought against \nand predicted would fail. Only $273 million. By the way, for those of \nyou who keep up with it, the hulls of these cruise ships in Mississippi \nhave been towed to Europe.\n  Mr. President, it's time to get serious about what we are doing here. \nWe have a deficit of $500 billion--that's half of a trillion dollars--\nthe largest ever. Our fiscal future can only be described as bleak. \nGovernment watchdog organizations and think tanks, both liberal and \nconservative, have expressed enormous concern about the level of \nspending in this bill.\n  A recent report by the Heritage Foundation states:\n\n       Following increases of 13 percent and 12 percent during the \n     previous two years, 2004 would mark the third consecutive \n     year of massive discretionary spending growth.\n\n  It further notes that:\n\n       Altogether, total Federal spending in 2003 topped $20,000 \n     per household [I am glad we don't divide that up by States] \n     for the first time since World War II and is set to grow \n     another $1,000 per household in 2004.\n  According to a joint statement issued by the Committee for Economic \nDevelopment of the Concord Coalition Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities:\n\n       Without a change in current fiscal policies, the Federal \n     Government can expect to run a cumulative deficit of $5 \n     trillion over the next 10 years.\n\n  These numbers are shameful and frightening.\n  Another astonishing part of this report states:\n\n       After the baby boom generation starts to retire in 2008, \n     the combination of demographic pressures and rising health \n     care costs will result in the cost of Medicare and Medicaid \n     and Social Security growing faster than the economy. We \n     project that by the time today's newborn reaches 40 years of \n     age, the cost of these three programs, as a percentage of the \n     economy, will more than double from 8.5 percent of the GDP to \n     over 17 percent.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to read this joint statement.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has issued warnings about the dangers \nthat lie ahead if we continue to spend in this manner. In a report \nissued last month, CBO stated:\n\n       Because of rising health care costs in an aging population, \n     spending on entitlement programs, especially Medicaid, \n     Medicare, and Social Security, will claim a sharply \n     increasing share of the Nation's economic output over the \n     coming decades. Unless taxation reaches levels that are \n     unprecedented in the United States, current spending policies \n     will probably be financially unsustainable over the next 50 \n     years. An ever-growing burden of Federal debt held by the \n     public would have a corrosive effect on the economy.\n\n  That is from the Congressional Budget Office, not from any liberal or \nconservative think tank, as much as I value those.\n  Additionally, CBO projected a 10-year deficit of $4.4 trillion.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported, according to an \nInternational Monetary Fund report:\n\n       If cumulative budget deficits rise by 15 percent of gross \n     domestic product, as the Congressional Budget Office expects, \n     world interest rates would be pushed up by one-half to 1 \n     percentage point over 10 years.\n\n  We are paying a price overseas for our reckless spending. The U.S. \ndollar is tumbling, and it is a result of our fiscal indiscipline and \nour enormous deficit. Foreign countries are losing confidence in the \ndollar. To underscore the\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\npoint, today the dollar stands at a 7-year low, worth 80 cents against \nthe Euro, a 40-percent drop in under 4 years.\n  In his State of the Union Address last night, the President called on \nus to act as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars. My response to the \nPresident: Mr. President of the United States, you also must be a \nsteward of taxpayers' dollars. Veto this bill. Veto this bill, Mr. \nPresident of the United States, and demand this pork be removed--this \n$11 billion in pork be removed--and send a message that it is not \nbusiness as usual anymore in the Senate. We cannot do this to our \nchildren and our grandchildren. We cannot do this to them.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to have to make some choices around \nhere. We are going to have to make some choices between our children's \nand our grandchildren's futures and having some kind of fiscal sanity \nand plan for the future. We cannot continue the practices of the \nSenate. We need to have a point of order that any unauthorized \nappropriation and any policy change is subject to a specific point of \norder, not one that brings down the whole bill, but one that brings \ndown that provision.\n\n  I could bring a point of order against this bill, and it would lose \nby 99 to 1 because it brings the whole bill down. We should have the \nright to object, and object vociferously, to North Pole, AK, getting \n$200,000. We should be able to object to the brown tree snake in Alaska \nin which we have invested I have no idea how many tens of millions of \ndollars. I think Alaska and Hawaii should pay for their own statehood \ncelebrations. We in Arizona do.\n  If I sound like I am angry and upset, it is because the people I \nrepresent are angry and upset. The people I talked with in my State, \nwho I have been privileged to represent for a long period of time, are \ndeeply disturbed. They know what is going on. They know their kids are \nnot going to ever receive Social Security benefits as present retirees \nare today. They know we just laid a multitrillion-dollar debt on them \nin the form of a Medicare prescription drug bill, and they figured it \nout. By the way, the overwhelming majority, the last poll I saw, 58 to \n42, don't like this prescription drug bill which no senior I know can \nunderstand, and I don't blame them because I don't understand it \neither.\n  If I sound as if I am not happy and perhaps given to flights of \nrhetoric, which I am from time to time, it is because my constituents \nare demanding that we change this system. The appropriators have become \nall power in this body. That is not appropriate. We need to change the \nrules, and we need to change the way we do business.\n  Last year, we stood here with an Omnibus appropriations bill. This \nyear we stand here with an Omnibus appropriations bill. I was pleased \nwe did not cut off debate until I heard: We are just doing this for \nlabor, but it will pass. We are just going to do this for labor once.\n  How stupid is labor? If I were a labor leader, I would say: Either \nvote it down or vote it up, but don't throw me some kind of 4-day \ndelay.\n  I understand labor just took some significant setbacks. They are \nabout to take another one.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to fight. I will continue to see if we \ncan't stop funding the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and get our thrills \non Blueberry Hill, the wild turkey, and all of the other turkeys that \nhave become part and parcel of this thousand-page piece of pork.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. We will be hearing about \nthis issue for a long time to come because the American people demand \nwe address it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what is the order right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee control the time until 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in their absence, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to proceed for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like the Senator to amend the \nrequest he has just propounded so that I might have 15 minutes \nimmediately after Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \nhas been waiting a long time. He is in the cloakroom. If we can have \nDemocratic speakers in order, Senator Harkin, Senator Lautenberg, then \nSenator Graham, and Republicans to speak in between, that will \ncertainly be appropriate. We have been going back and forth. Will that \nbe OK?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A unanimous consent request has been \npropounded. Is there objection to the request? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, picking up where I started earlier today, I listened \nto the President's State of the Union Message hoping he would come up \nwith a real jobs plan to help America's families. But quite frankly, \nthere was nothing in the State of the Union Address that talked about \nthat.\n  We need to extend emergency unemployment for the hundreds of \nthousands of people who paid in when they were working, but months \nafter losing their jobs, they still can't find work.\n  We need to raise the minimum wage, which has not been increased in 6 \nyears.\n  And right now, most important of all, the administration needs to \nwithdraw its proposal that would deny millions of American workers \ntheir overtime pay protections.\n  Five months ago, the Senate voted on my amendment 54 to 45 to block \nthe administration's effort to take away overtime pay protection for up \nto 8 million workers. That's right, the Bush proposal that came out of \nthe Department of Labor would deny overtime pay protection to 8 million \nAmerican workers.\n  The House followed soon after us and voted 223 to 201, and the Senate \nspoke again yesterday in its vote against cloture.\n  Now, again, this should not even be an issue in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill before us. Congress spoke up clear as a bell. They \nsaid: No, the administration should not strip overtime pay protection \nfor these 8 million workers.\n  As we all know, the administration refused to accept the will of \nCongress. The administration ordered its foot soldiers in the House to \nstrip the provision from this omnibus bill. Senator Specter and I \nfought to keep it in, but the administration refused any cooperation or \nany compromise. In the end, just like that, the administration \nnullified the clear will of both Houses of Congress and of the American \npeople.\n  This is a clear abuse of power by the administration and it is part \nof a pattern we have seen from this President time and again. The \nadministration seems to believe in government by one branch, the \nexecutive branch. Time and again, we see this administration running \nroughshod over the will of Congress. When there are no checks and \nbalances, the result is bad public policy, and that is exactly what we \nsee today.\n  The administration's new rule is a stealth attack on the 40-hour \nworkweek, pushed by the White House without one single public hearing. \nAs I have said time and again over the last several months, it will \neffectively end overtime pay for dozens of occupations, including \npolice officers, firefighters, clerical workers, air traffic \ncontrollers, social workers, journalists, nurses.\n  In the amendment that I offered and that we voted on and that the \nHouse supported, there was one part of the President's proposal our \namendment did not touch. The President's proposal does increase the \nincome threshold that guarantees overtime pay protection from $8,060 a \nyear to $22,100 a year. In other words, if someone makes under $22,100 \na year, under the President's proposal they are guaranteed overtime pay \nif they work more than 40 hours a week, regardless of their occupation. \nWell, my amendment did not touch that, but now we understand that the \nLabor Department is providing tips within the proposal to employers on \nhow to get around it. It included helpful tips for employers, advice on \nhow to avoid paying overtime to the lowest paid workers who are \nsupposedly helped by the new rule.\n  For example, here is a list of what they have put out to employers--I \nmight say probably to unscrupulous employers because honest employers \nare not going to do this anyway. If employers want to get around the \nrules,\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\nthe administration is telling them how to do it.\n  They are suggesting how employers can avoid paying overtime. First, \nthey lower existing wages so when workers accrue overtime, their net \npay will not grow. In other words, reduce their pay, work them longer \nhours so that the net effect is the same. So the workers will be \nworking more than 40 hours a week but their pay will be exactly the \nsame. Now, that is what has come from the Department of Labor. That is \nwhat they are telling employers to do to get around that provision in \ntheir proposal.\n  Secondly, they are saying change workers' duties so they are exempt \nfrom the overtime rules. Well, okay. So let's say someone makes \nslightly over $22,100 a year. Therefore, they might be eligible for \novertime. Just change their designation. Say they are something else. \nPut them under the category of exempt from overtime, and guess what; \nthey are exempt from overtime.\n\n  If an employee is close to the $22,100, what they are saying is, \nraise their wages to the level required to be exempt. So if someone is \nmaking $22,000 a year, or $21,700, just raise their pay to $22,100, \nwork them over 40 hours a workweek, and do not pay them any more \novertime. That is the way to get around it. This is from the Bush \nadministration. That is what they are telling employers to do. Lastly, \ndo not let them work more than 40 hours a week.\n  Well, this sweeping proposal is in direct contrast to the intent of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that established the 40-hour \nworkweek for America's workers. It is a slap in the face to the \nmillions of American workers who depend on overtime pay to support \ntheir families and make ends meet.\n  We are not talking about spare change. We are talking about taking \naway some 25 percent of the income of American workers. It is essential \nfamily income that helps pay the mortgage, feed the children, pay for \ncollege, save for a rainy day, save for retirement.\n  Now, again, one can say do not let them work more than 40 hours a \nweek, family time is premium time. For an American worker to spend time \nwith their children at baseball games, basketball games, football \ngames, or at school meetings, or just to be home with their families \nlate in the evening or on a weekend is premium time. If an employer is \ngoing to ask an American worker, a man or a woman, to give up their \npremium time with their families, they had better pay them premium \nwages, which is what overtime is.\n  No. The Bush administration is saying, hey, this family-friendly \nadministration--how many times have we heard that, ``family-friendly \nadministration''?--is now saying: Forget about it; if an employee wants \nto work overtime away from their family, we are going to make sure they \ndo not get overtime. Or if they need the overtime to pay for retirement \nand stuff, we are suggesting they do not work an employee over 40 hours \na week.\n  Again, we already know that American workers are working more than \nwhat they have in the past and more than what they have done in other \nnations. If we look at this chart, we can see that American workers \nwork more hours than workers in other industrialized nations. Here is \nthe United States over here. Hours worked per employed person in 2001 \nis slightly over 1,800. Look at where it is in Denmark, France, \nIreland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. \nAmerican workers are already working longer than any other workers in \nany other industrialized country.\n  What the administration is saying is we are going to work employees \nlonger and not pay them any more.\n  It will not create one new job. It will give employers a disincentive \nto hire new workers if they can force their current employees to work \nmore hours with no increase in pay. That is exactly what it is. It is \nanti-worker. It is anti-family. It is bad economic policy.\n  Congress did the right thing in voting to block this new rule. Now \nthat Congress's vote and voice have been nullified, we are hearing from \nthe Department of Labor that the new rule will go in in March. I am \nhere to serve notice that just as I offered this amendment last summer, \nI will offer it again and again on any legislation that comes to the \nfloor of the Senate. We will not give up, nor will others who have \nfought this fight with us. The American people will not allow us to \ndrop this issue. They have been watching this issue closely because it \nhits so close to home.\n\n  Lastly, I was home over the break period and there was this cartoon \nthat appeared in the Des Moines Register which I thought kind of summed \nit all up. Here is a police officer standing over a poor guy who looks \nas if he has been run over by a truck. The police officer is taking it \ndown and he is saying: ``You say the guy who took your overtime pay \nbore a striking resemblance to the one who gave it to you in the first \nplace?''\n  So on the one hand, President Bush is saying we are going to raise \nthe threshold so that employees are covered by overtime pay provisions. \nOn the other hand, they are saying to employers: This is how to get \naround it. Here is how employers can get around this proposed rule so \nthat they can take overtime pay away.\n  The President wants to have it both ways. He wants to tell the \nAmerican workers that he is going to increase their overtime pay. On \nthe other hand, he is whispering to employers: Do not worry, I have \nways you can get around it.\n  There is only one way, and that is the right way, which is to pay \nworkers what they earn and what they deserve and to pay them the \novertime they need and for which they have worked.\n  The administration can take care of this right now. They could take \ncare of it, but they have nullified what they have tried to do in \nCongress. So I urge the administration to do what is fair and just for \nAmerica's workers and withdraw this harmful proposal. It is the right \nthing to do, to withdraw it.\n  I say to this administration if you think this is just an issue with \nlabor unions, you are sadly mistaken. Everywhere I went in Iowa and \nsome other States during the long break period that we had, I heard \nabout this issue. Not just from union workers; white collar workers, \nnurses, firefighters, and others in our society. Maybe they don't \nbelong to a labor union, but they are going to be drastically affected.\n  This cuts very deep. I don't know who gave you the advice, Mr. Bush, \nbut it was bad advice. You ought to get a grip on this, President Bush. \nGet a grip on this and tell your Secretary of Labor to rescind this \nproposal. Work with Congress. We can, as we have many times in the \npast, come up with something. The Fair Labor Standards Act has been \namended many times but always through an open process with open \nhearings, the best information, and Congress worked with the \nadministration. We have never had any contention. Certainly we could \nagree on that level, that $8,060 level, that ought to be raised to \n$22,000. It ought to be raised. But then don't put out information \nsaying OK, here is how you get around it.\n  Let's raise it. Let's make it stick. Let's not exempt all these \nworkers from overtime pay protection.\n  That is the right thing to do. This Congress, this Senate, and this \nSenator will continue to fight to make sure this rule does not go into \neffect and that we protect the legitimate overtime pay protections of \nthe American workers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think this is quite a moment in \nhistory. It will be long remembered. It will be remembered for several \nreasons, not the least of which is the excessively optimistic tone that \nwas issued by the President of the United States in his address on the \nState of the Union last night. Millions of people were watching and, I \nassume, thinking about the effects his thoughts will have on their \nlives.\n  It is presented as the Omnibus appropriations bill, but I think there \nis a better description than that complicated term that few in the \npublic really understand. I would rather call it the ``ominous'' bill, \nand I am going to refer to it that way.\n  It is astonishing to me that we are here, nearly 4 months into the \nnew fiscal year. Our friends on the other side of the aisle who control \nthe White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate, have \nfailed to move through the Senate the result of the\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\nconference with the House. It is an indictment of failure, an \nindictment of failure to govern.\n  The basic problem with this bill is that in an age when we are so \nconscious of saturated fats, this bill is saturated with special \ninterest provisions that bring harm to the well-being of our \nconstituents. In some cases, the bill even threatens the health of the \nAmerican people.\n  For instance, stuck deep in this bill is a provision that blocks the \ncountry-of-origin labeling rules for agricultural products, including \nbeef. In the wake of the mad cow scare, it is more critical than ever \nthat Americans get more information about beef and other products they \neat, not less information.\n  The bill also, regrettably, undermines workers' rights. Even though \nboth the Senate and the House--both houses of the legislature--voted in \nfavor of blocking the administration's new rule to deny overtime pay to \n8 million Americans, this omnibus report allows the rule to go into \neffect.\n  The question is, How did it get there? You have heard me say that \nboth the Senate and the House voted in favor of blocking the \nadministration's rule to deny overtime to people, deny their just \ncompensation from coming to them. How does this report ban that, those \nconsensus votes? The President's overtime rule amounts to a 25-percent \npay cut, on average, for millions of hard-working Americans, including \npolice, firefighters, emergency workers, nurses, and many others. Many \nof these people are veterans. It amounts on average, according to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, to $161 a week in lost wages--$161 a week. \nThat is $8,000 a year that will be taken away by this rule.\n  It doesn't say you work less. The amount of time you work may be the \nsame. But you are going to lose part of the compensation that you \ncurrently earn if you work those hours. It is a very important addition \nto the average week's pay.\n  Congress voted to stop this unjust rule. But the omnibus allows it to \nmove forward. Is that how democracy works? Congress speaks clearly, \nunequivocally, on an issue and the White House comes in and tells the \nconferees: Hey, forget it; we don't care what the people in the Senate \nor the House in a majority vote want. You have to do what we tell you \nto do. And we are going to hold billions of dollars in funding hostage \nuntil you agree with us.\n  That is not democracy; that is extortion.\n  The overtime rule is not the only provision in the conference report \nput there because of this extortion. To clarify, there are lots of \nthings in the appropriations bill. Some of them we would like to see \nput into place. But the administration, in a cute trick, held them out \nfor ransom to pass this omnibus bill.\n  For instance, if you vote your conscience, you are going to lose your \nmoney. Your constituents are going to lose their money. The States and \ncities across this country are going to lose their money. If you dare \nto vote your conscience and do what is right, we are going to take away \nthe funding that is justly yours.\n  There is another gift to corporate special interests in the omnibus, \nthe new media ownership rules. Current media ownership law prevents a \nsingle company from owning local TV stations that reach more than 35 \npercent of the Nation's households. In most totalitarian nations there \nis usually only one or two broadcast stations that are controlled by \nthe government. In this case, they are held by people who have a \nparticular view of how society ought to get its information.\n  So in fairness to the constituents, the citizens across the country, \nwe made clear that ownership of those outfits was to be held to a \nparticular percent. In 2002, the FCC proposed raising the limit to 45 \npercent. Majorities in both the House and the Senate voted to block \nthis FCC rule to weaken media ownership rules--to expand it for the fat \ncats who presently own it to let them foist their opinion all over \nAmerica without rebuttal.\n  Congress spoke clearly. We said no. Leave these caps where they are. \nThere is a reason and there is a value to them.\n  But in the conference on this omnibus, the limit was raised from 35 \npercent to 39 percent--some arbitrary act. By whom? We can't say around \nhere. It is an odd-sounding number. Not coincidentally, that is the \nnumber just big enough to accommodate Mr. Rupert Murdock in his effort \nto allow his conservative views on his media empire to have more \ncontrol over local TV news than is appropriate in communities across \nthis Nation.\n  These problems are only some of the bad provisions contained in the \nomnibus.\n  I haven't even mentioned the worst problem in the bill.\n  This bill contains provisions that would help terrorists. I am heard \ncorrectly. I will repeat it. This bill aids terrorists who seek to harm \nthe American people. A dangerous provision was snuck into this bill in \nthe dead of night, put there by the Republican leadership carrying \nwater for the gun lobby, that will help terrorists and criminals who \npurchase weapons to avoid detection by requiring the destruction of gun \nbackground checks. That is done to see if the person is stable or if \nthey have any criminal connections, yet requiring the destruction of \nthat information, that research, that investigation to be done in 24 \nhours.\n  What is the harm in holding that information and giving our law \nenforcement people a chance to further study it?\n  Some on the other side may say that ``terrorists don't buy guns on \nthe legal market in the United States.'' But they do. In fact, the Bush \nadministration has indirectly assisted them in the acquisition of guns.\n  A recent audit of a small sample of gun background check data by the \nJustice Department reveals that at least 12 suspected terrorists and \nperhaps hundreds purchased firearms in the United States last year. How \ndid the Department of Justice find this out? By looking at gun \nbackground checks data.\n  But this ominous would change the law so that records of gun \npurchases are destroyed within 24 hours of sale. The logic to that \nescapes me and lots of people. I hope the American people pay attention \nto that. The Brady law calls for these records to be held up to 6 \nmonths. The current practice is to hold the records for at least 3 \nmonths so that there can be a second review or a second check.\n  If someone is on a terrorist watch list, they certainly ought to \nreport it immediately to the FBI or the CIA or whoever it is that is \ngoing to follow up on this information if the war on terrorism is as \nserious as it ought to be. If the Republicans' 24-hour destruction rule \nwere put into place, no audit or other investigation of terrorist \nactivity involving weapons purchases would be possible.\n  The administration is already dragging its feet when it comes to \ninvestigating terrorists who purchase firearms. Believe it or not, when \na known terrorist purchases a firearm, the policy of the Justice \nDepartment is to withhold relevant information from law enforcement. \nWhy is that so? Why is Attorney General John Ashcroft so concerned with \nthe gun rights of terrorists? I can't figure that one out.\n  We only found out about terrorists acquiring guns from the audit of \ngun background check data. But now, if this ominous is enacted, records \nwill be destroyed in 24 hours. What the devil is the urgency to destroy \nthose records? Purportedly, it is so we don't have some file or big \nbrother looking over your shoulders.\n  Talk to any of the people who had family members in the World Trade \nCenter neighborhood that I come from and ask them if those records \nought to be destroyed in a hurry. Or ask the people who lost loved ones \nin Pan Am 103. If any of the records--if any of those people associated \nwith Libya and that group goes to purchase a gun, those records ought \nto be left open until they are totally combed. If a person purchases a \ngun and it is discovered that terrorists are planning to launch an \nattack somewhere in the country, the records will have been destroyed. \nWhom are we trying to protect?\n  Under the 24-hour destruction standard, we will not know where the \npurchase was placed or when or what firearms were purchased. The loss \nof this data puts our communities at risk and hinders the ability of \nlaw enforcement to prevent terrorist attacks. Does that\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\nmake America safer? I am sorry that the President last night in his \nspeech didn't object to having that held over our heads legislatively \nnow.\n  In their zeal to please the National Rifle Association and other \nspecial interest gun groups, the majority is willing to undermine \nhomeland security and individual security and put our communities in \ndanger. So I ask the majority: Whose side are you on anyway? You really \nhave to wonder when the Republican leadership decides that the \nprotection of the anonymity of gun-buying terrorists is more important \nthan protecting our country from terrorist attacks.\n  My home State, New Jersey, lost 700 people on 9/11. I would like \nsomeone from the other side of the aisle, or someone from the Justice \nDepartment, to sit down with those families, many of whom I know, who \nlost loved ones, and explain to them why we should destroy these \nrecords so quickly. Explain to these families why we need to protect \nthe terrorists' identity when they try to buy a firearm. It is an \noutrage.\n  The majority claims that they care deeply about homeland security. I \nam sure they do. But in practice, when homeland security collides with \ngun rights, homeland security goes out the window.\n  I was a member of the Appropriations Committee for 18 years. The \ncommittee has always done its work in a bipartisan fashion. It is sad \nto see that bipartisanship evaporate at the snap of Karl Rove's \nfingers.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Let us take \nthe pollutants out of this ominous bill. We have a responsibility to \nfund critical government programs without adding misguided or downright \ndangerous legislative riders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will speak on the issue of the education \nfunding in this omnibus bill which is being held up by our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, which is unfortunate.\n  The issue of education, of course, is one of the priorities of our \nconcerns in Congress. We have made significant strides under President \nBush in addressing a variety of different areas involving education, \nand this omnibus continues that progress. It is interesting to note the \ncommitment which we as a Republican Party and the President, under his \nleadership, have made since coming into office.\n  The commitment to education, specifically, has been dramatic. For \nexample, in the area of No Child Left Behind, which is funding for low-\nincome disadvantaged students, as compared with the prior \nadministration, in the last 3 years we have seen a 32 percent increase \nin funding, going from $18.4 billion up to $24 billion. In the Title I \naccount, we have seen an increase of 41 percent, going from $8.8 \nbillion to $12.3 billion. In the area of special education, we have \nseen a 59 percent increase in funding, going from $6.3 billion up to \n$10.1 billion. In the area of funds going to K through 12, totally, we \nhave seen an increase of 36.5 percent, from $26 billion to $35 billion. \nIn the area of Pell grants, we have seen an increase, going from $8.8 \nbillion to $12 billion, or an increase of 37 percent. That is in the \nlast 3 years of this President.\n  This bill carries forward those initiatives. The fact this bill is \nnot passed and the Democrats insist on holding it up will represent a \nvery significant cut in the amount of money that would have gone into \ntitle I, which is education for underprivileged children, into special \neducation, and into Pell grants.\n  If we go under a continuing resolution, which is the other option to \nnot passing this omnibus bill, it will mean title I will end up being \ncut by over $650 million. Those are dollars that go out to low-income \nkids, to schools that educate low-income kids, which is critical to \nbring these children up to speed so they can compete with their peers \nand have a chance at the American dream.\n  In addition, in the special education area, if this bill is not \npassed, it will represent an approximately $1.2 billion cut in special \neducation. Anyone who goes back to their State and spends any time with \ntheir local communities knows the cost of special education is one of \nthe most difficult issues which the local education community faces \nbecause the Federal Government requires, as rightly it should, that \nchildren with special needs be educated and be educated at a level \ncompetitive with their peers who do not have special needs.\n  Unfortunately, that is very expensive. Originally, the Federal \nGovernment said it would pick up 40 percent of the cost of that \neducation, but it has not been doing that. However, since President \nBush came into office, we have dramatically increased our commitment in \nthe area of special education. As a result, we have been able to reduce \nthe burden on the local property owner because more money has been \ngoing out from the Federal Government to bear its share of special \neducation, thus relieving the local property tax owner from having to \nbear not only the local share of special education but also the Federal \nshare of the special education. If this bill is not passed, that is \n$1.2 billion of additional spending for special education which will \nnot occur, which will mean that burden will be thrown right back on to \nthe local property tax payer. That is certainly not something we should \ndo. We have an obligation to try to get to full funding of the Federal \nshare of special education. The President has made that commitment and \nwe are on that path. This bill is part of that effort.\n  Pell grants is another example. We all know it has become very \ndifficult for people who are going to college today to pay the cost of \ncollege because college tuition has increased so dramatically over the \nlast 10 years, outstripping the rate of growth of inflation by a factor \nof about two and a half times.\n\n  One of the ways we have tried to relieve that burden is to increase \nthe amount of money or to increase the amount of people who participate \nin the Pell grant program, which is a grant program which helps kids \nwho are in college pay for their college tuition. If this omnibus bill \ndoes not pass, the Pell grant program will be penalized with a loss of \ntens of millions of dollars which would be available for college \nstudents in order to help defray their cost of education so when they \nget out of college they can participate aggressively in the workforce \nand earn the rewards of participating in the workforce without having \nthe huge burden of debt placed on them by having to pay for their \ntuition costs and borrow money to do that but, rather, by having a Pell \ngrant, which is not a loan.\n  This is a critical issue for us as a country. As the tuition rates go \nup and up, it has become more and more difficult for many people to \nparticipate in college education. We as a society cannot compete in the \nworld unless we have a highly educated workforce. That highly educated \nworkforce is conditioned on people being able to afford college. This \nbill allows a lot of people to participate in college who will not \notherwise be able to.\n  We can honestly say if this bill is held up, low-income kids who go \nto title I schools will not receive the support they need, kids who are \nspecial-needs children will not be receiving the support they need, and \nthe local taxes of people will go up as their real estate tax burden \nwill go up, and many kids who are attending college will be unable to \ncontinue their college because they will not be able to obtain the Pell \ngrant. There are real lives at risk if this bill is not passed in its \npresent form.\n  There are other things this bill has that address education which are \nequally interesting and equally, in my opinion, significant. The most \nsignificant is the fact this bill includes the District of Columbia's \nefforts to pursue other options for their children in the area of \neducation. The Mayor of the District of Columbia, the head of the \nschool board of the District of Columbia, members of the city council \nof the District of Columbia came to Congress and asked those in a \nposition to deal with education issues, Will you help us do some more \ncreative things to try to\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\naddress a very serious problem in our school districts?\n  The serious problem is this: Washington, DC, spends the second most \nper child of any school district in the country. The only other school \ndistrict in the country that spends more per child is New York City. \nYet Washington, DC, has the worst performance for its children of any \nschool district in the country; in fact, the worst in many categories. \nA lot of parents feel their children are trapped in schools that are \nnot working. The Mayor appreciates this and wants to improve the school \nsystem but wants to give parents other options. They have in this town \na private proposal, a private program for kids whose parents want to \nsend their kids to a private school through a choice program, take them \nout of the public schools and put them in a private school. There are \n7,500 kids waiting to participate in that program.\n  The Mayor and the head of the school board and members of the city \ncouncil came to us and said, We would like to try a demonstration \nprogram in the area of choice where we will basically set up a fund \nwhich allows parents--most of these are single parents, by the way--\nfrom very low-income situations to take their kids, if they are not \nperforming and they are not getting the support they need in the public \nschools, to a private school as long as that private school subscribes \nto the standards we as a city public school system set both in the area \nof accountability and in the area of teaching those children.\n  It is a creative and courageous idea the Mayor has put forward along \nwith the president of the education board and along with members of the \ncity council--courageous, obviously, because it flies in the face of \nthe professional education community, and especially the unions.\n\n  But the mayor is committed to trying to improve the educational level \nof the kids in Washington. He simply is not willing to accept the idea \nof generation after generation of children here in Washington being \nleft behind and not being able to participate in the American dream \nbecause they cannot get the education they need.\n  When you have parents who are waiting, enthusiastically, to try to \ngive their children an option, to try to give their children an \nopportunity, which does not exist today, by moving their child from a \npublic school to a private school, when you have parents who are \nwilling to take that risk with their children, and you have a mayor who \nis willing to do that, then you have a formula for maybe improving the \nlives of these children.\n  The mayor came to us and said: Give us this program. We would also \nlike a program which helps us support more charter schools in the city \nand helps us do more school improvement in the basic public schools.\n  So we put together a package where we took $40 million out of other \naccounts within the Federal Government. I know because a significant \namount of that $40 million came out of my own appropriations bill which \nhas nothing to do with the city of Washington, and we moved that money \ninto the city of Washington account. We divided it into three parts, \nand we structured it so that the mayor and the board of education and \nthe council can set up three programs: One, to assist in the creation \nof charter schools; two, to add to the improvement of schools that \nalready exist in Washington, the public school system; and, three, to \nhave a choice program system. It is a creative and aggressive idea.\n  But if this bill does not go through, that program will fail. The \nmayor and the people who are committed to this, and, most importantly, \nthe children who would benefit from this and their parents--and it is \nheartrending to meet these parents.\n  They have a lottery right now in this city where the private \nprogram--which is funded privately, which is the philanthropic \nprogram--every year draws out of a hat a group of names of kids who \nqualify to take part in the choice program. Literally thousands of \nparents, single moms in most instances, sit in that room and wait for \ntheir child's name to be drawn. When their child's name is not drawn, \nit is tragic, and the sense of loss is palpable. And when their child's \nname is drawn, the excitement that their child will have a shot at the \nAmerican dream because they will get a decent education is electric.\n  So the mayor has set up this program, working with the president of \nthe board of education and with members of his council, and they came \nto us and asked for this money.\n  Unfortunately, Members on the other side of the aisle have tried, in \nall sorts of ways, to defeat this program. It is ironic that they have \nbecause there are not a whole lot of Republicans serving in the \nmunicipal government in the District of Columbia. In fact, I do not \nthink there are any. I don't know. I suspect there are not. I think \nonly 12 percent of the people in the city are registered Republicans. \nThe mayor is Democrat. I know the board of education is democratically \ncontrolled. The council is democratically controlled. The whole \nadministration is democratically controlled.\n  It was, ironically, the leadership of the city, a Democratic \nleadership, that came to a Republican Congress and said: Give us this \nopportunity. We will take it. We will run with it. We will make these \nchildren's lives better and give their parents a chance to give their \nchildren something special.\n  Unfortunately, they were stone-walled, regrettably, by the other side \nof the aisle, but we were able to get around that and we were able to \nput in this bill the language which accomplishes this. If this bill \nfails, then that program fails, and it will mean that $40 million--\nwhich is a huge amount of money--which would flow into the educational \nefforts here in Washington to try to improve those educational \nefforts--not by putting more money after money that has not worked in \nthe past but, rather, by putting more money in programs which have a \npotential of working, and which we know will work in specific \ninstances, such as charter schools and choice--that money will not go \nforward. That money will be a benefit, and there will be real lives \nimpacted in a very positive way.\n\n  So we have seen a lot of crocodile tears from the other side of the \naisle about their concern on education, about their concern about \nchildren. Where the rubber hits the road is whether this bill passes or \nnot. A lot of children's lives here in Washington will be affected. If \nit does not pass, they will once again be put in a system which has \nfailed them and failed their peers. And, regrettably, it has failed \ngenerations before them. If the bill does pass, there will be an \nopportunity, created by a creative and aggressive mayor who is willing \nto take chances.\n  If this bill passes, there will be relief for many taxpayers in \nAmerica who are paying the burden of the Federal Government's share of \nspecial education. There will be relief on their property tax bills.\n  If this bill passes, people who are going to college will be able to \nstay in college, and they will not have to leave college because they \ncan no longer afford to pay for it.\n  If this bill passes, title I children, children from low-income \nhomes, will have a better shot at not being left behind because the No \nChild Left Behind bill will be more aggressively funded.\n  So there are real lives affected by whether or not this bill passes. \nI hope Congress will see fit, and our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will see fit, to stop this filibuster and pass this bill so \nthese students can get on with their education.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, as fate would have it, the \nfirst vote this new session of Congress has before it, as our first \nmeasure, is an omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004.\n  This first-of-the-year appropriations bill is the product of \nnegotiation among the leadership, primarily Republican leadership in \nthis Chamber and their House counterparts, to meld together a series of \nappropriations bills\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nthat had been unable to be passed prior to the time of our adjournment \nin 2003 and have now been presented to us as a single bill.\n  This single bill will provide for discretionary domestic spending of \n$328 billion--$328 billion. In fact, it contains over 7,000 earmarks, \nwhich means specific projects that have been added to this bill, almost \nexclusively projects that were never considered by the Senate.\n  Senator McCain has given a speech, as has Senator Byrd, outlining \nadequate reasons to vote against this omnibus bill based on those facts \nalone. I would probably have voted against the bill based on those \nfacts alone because I consider myself to be a fiscal hawk, and I \nconsider that the kind of spending in this bill is illustrative of the \nundisciplined practices into which this Congress and this President \nhave too often fallen.\n  But that is not the reason I am going to discuss today. It is the \nfact of what is not in this bill. What is not in this bill is a \nprovision which was adopted on a bipartisan basis by the Senate and by \nthe House of Representatives which would protect the overtime rights of \nour Nation's workers.\n  A brief background. In 2003, the Department of Labor developed a \nregulation which would modify the current overtime pay standards. The \npractical effect of this will be to make some 8 million American \nworkers, who are now eligible for overtime, ineligible for overtime.\n  My colleague and good friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who also has \nspoken eloquently on this matter today, offered an amendment to protect \nthe overtime our Nation's workers earn from this new Bush \nadministration policy.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 54 to 45. \nThat same measure was then endorsed by the House of Representatives \nwhen they instructed their conferees, who would be responsible for \nnegotiating any differences between the House and the Senate bills, to \naccept the Harkin amendment by a bipartisan vote of 221 to 203.\n  In spite of that history, this provision, which would have rolled \nback the Department of Labor's denial of overtime to 8 million \nAmericans, was removed from the bill, ostensibly at the insistence of \nthe White House.\n  I have had a practice, now for almost 30 years, of taking different \njobs. My next-to-the-last job was as a coal compactor. That consisted \nof driving a very big piece of equipment, made by Caterpillar in \nPeoria, IL, over a large field of West Virginia coal in order to keep \nit at the necessary compaction so that it would not be subject to self-\nignition and fire. There were three other men who worked with me in \nthat job. It took place at the Gainesville regional utility generating \nplant.\n  At the lunch break, we avoided talking politics. That is sort of my \nrule when I am on these workdays. I talk about hunting or fishing or \nfootball or whatever but not politics. These three men brought it up at \nlunch. They said: We heard somewhere that they are talking about \nmessing with our overtime.\n  I said: Well, how much will this affect you?\n  They said: It will affect us a lot because we typically work maybe \n50, 60 hours a week doing this job, and that overtime is what makes the \ndifference between us sort of getting along and getting along with a \nlittle extra money to do the things our families need.\n  I cite that example to indicate this is not an inside-the-beltway \nissue. This is an issue which the American people understand and about \nwhich they are emotional.\n  Under the Bush administration's overtime plan, millions of salaried \nworkers who make between $22,101 and $65,000 a year--just think how \nmany millions of families fall within that range of $22,101 and $65,000 \na year--could be reclassified under more lenient standards as \nexecutive, administrative, or professional employees and would no \nlonger qualify for overtime.\n  I indicated earlier that the plan would affect approximately 8 \nmillion workers in 257 occupations. This is the estimate of the \nEconomic Policy Institute, that that many workers in that many \noccupations would lose their right to overtime. In my State of Florida, \nthe change is estimated to affect 441,000 workers. Those numbers \ndramatically understate the real impact of this legislation.\n  Let me give two illustrations of its extended impact. We are \nconcerned about a jobless recovery. Yes, the stock market is up. Yes, \nwe are showing a significant increase in our domestic economic output. \nBut in the month of December, do you know how many jobs were created as \na result of all that economic activity? One thousand. I have not made a \nmistake. I didn't misstate 100,000 or 150,000. One thousand new jobs \nwere created in the month of December.\n  While there is no single reason that that is true, I believe one of \nthe reasons is the math I am about to give you. Assume you are an \nemployer. You have four employees. As part of this economic upturn, you \nhave generated enough demand for your product that you really need to \nhire a fifth employee. So you have a choice: Hire a new person or you \ncan ask the other workers to add 10 hours a week to cover the amount of \nadditional demand that has been generated. Assuming these workers \nearned $20 an hour, that would mean that while they are in their \novertime period, they would be earning $30 an hour. So each of the four \npeople would earn 10 hours at an additional $10. So they would earn, as \na result of overtime, $100 a week times the four workers which is $400 \na week.\n\n  The employer could very well look at those numbers and say: Look, it \nis less expensive for me to pay these existing employees an additional \namount to work overtime than it is to undergo the training cost and the \ninsurance cost, particularly the health insurance cost, of bringing a \nnew person on board.\n  I believe this extensive use of overtime is a significant factor in \ncausing a jobless economic recovery. If it is a significant problem \ntoday, when the employer is having to pay an additional $10 an hour in \novertime, think what it is going to be like when the employer doesn't \nhave to pay the additional $10 an hour in overtime, where the amount of \nwork that the four current employees do would be paid at the same rate \nas those four plus a fifth working at 40 hours a week?\n  No. 2 is another example. A plant has 100 employees, all of whom are \ncurrently eligible for overtime. Under these new rules, let's say that \n20 of those 100 are reclassified as being ineligible for overtime. The \nplant has a certain number of hours of overtime which are going to be \nincurred. Today they are distributing that among the 100 overtime-\neligible employees. I can tell you with a high level of confidence that \nif we allow this Department of Labor regulation to go into effect, \nwhatever overtime is generated in that plant is going to be assigned to \nthe 20 employees who no longer are eligible to get overtime pay.\n  At a time of a jobless economic recovery, to propose cutting overtime \nearnings, which will give an even greater incentive not to employ \npeople, is to cause one to question the common sense of the people who \nare proposing this. This plan offers no incentive for economic \nstimulation. It is an incentive to further reduce employment by relying \non now no longer overtime compensated additional hours of work by your \ncurrent workforce.\n  This also offers no economic incentive to our general economy. We \nhave debated this issue for much of the last 3 years: What is the most \nappropriate way to stimulate the economy? Last night the President \ndidn't talk about changes in trade policy. He said we were going to \nstimulate the economy by making tax cuts permanent.\n  As Senator Byrd discussed with vigor and eloquence a few hours ago, \n75 percent of these tax cuts go to 1 percent of the American taxpayers.\n  That is not a program of economic stimulation. Rather, it is a \nprogram to compensate the most affluent people in the country by \ncutting their taxes and letting the crumbs of the other 25 percent of \nthe tax cuts fall down on the rest of us.\n  If we were serious about economic stimulation through the Tax Code, \nwe would have a different tax cut policy. I have advocated, as an \nexample, that we ought to have a program to make the first $10,000 of \nearnings free from the payroll tax. That would put approximately $780 \nin the pocket of every American, the largest share of which\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nwould go to where the largest share of Americans are--into the middle \nclass. I can tell you, from common sense, those people will actually \nspend the $780 because they have kids who need new clothes; they have a \ncar that needs to be replaced; they have a new bedroom they may need to \nadd to the house because they just had another child.\n  We didn't take that approach. We didn't focus our tax cuts on the \nAmericans who are most likely to use the tax cut to stimulate the \neconomy by increasing demand. Having committed that first error, we are \nnow about to compound it by taking away overtime pay from the same \ngroup of Americans who, if they get the overtime, are most likely to \nspend it, create demand, and create new jobs in our economy. It is just \nconfounding that, at a time when we are concerned about the future of \nthis country and we are concerned about economic stimulation, when we \nhave concerns about the fairness by which our people are viewing their \nGovernment's action, we would go an additional mile to cut away the \neligibility for overtime pay for 8 million Americans.\n  This policy is not just bad economics; it is also bad security \nbecause many of the people who will be affected by this are people who \nare our first responders. They are police officers, firefighters, air \nand traffic controllers, nurses, and others involved in emergency \nmedical care. All of these will potentially see their wages diminished \nas a result of this one provision in a bill which does not justify \npassage even on its own merits--a provision which has stripped out a \nproposal that passed by bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and \nthe House, passed at the instance of the White House, wanting to assure \nthat its policy of cutting back on average American workers' overtime \nis implemented. I would vote against cloture on this bill today; I will \nvote against cloture on this bill tomorrow; I will vote against cloture \non this bill at any time we have the opportunity to do so. And should \nwe, in a moment of lack of wisdom, grant cloture and this bill is \npassed, then I will join my colleagues in every effort to see that what \nthe Congress of the United States wants to happen, what the people of \nthe United States desperately want to happen--which is to retain their \novertime pay benefits--will occur. Even though it is not what President \nGeorge W. Bush wants, this will be a battle the American people will \nwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it had been my hope we would have \neliminated the overtime pay provision, because I believe it is not a \ngood idea, with the economy just beginning to recover--obviously \nfragile--to be denying many American working men and women overtime \npay.\n  This issue came before my subcommittee, Labor, Health, Human Services \nand Education. By a vote of 54-46, the Harkin amendment was passed, \nwhich prohibited any funding to implement the new regulation on \novertime pay. There is no doubt it would be useful to revise the \nregulation with the view to limiting and reducing litigation. We had an \nextensive hearing yesterday. The Secretary of Labor testified. We \nanalyzed the current regulations, we analyzed the new regulations, and \nit was apparent the new regulations will not do anything to reduce the \nlitigation. There are still the same ambiguities regarding the various \ncategories of personnel, making it evident from the course of the very \nextensive hearing we had yesterday that the objective of reducing \nlitigation will not be accomplished by the new regulations.\n  In approaching the cloture vote, we are not between a rock and a hard \nplace. We have an impossible situation because, either way we go, we \nare going to have this regulation, unless there can be a negotiated \nchange with the administration. After making that effort repeatedly for \nmonths, I do not think that is a realistic possibility. We are faced \nwith this regulation whether we pass the Omnibus Appropriation bill or \nnot. If we do not pass the Omnibus appropriation bill, then we will \nhave a continuing resolution, and the continuing resolution will leave \nin effect the current funding for the Department of Labor, Health, \nHuman Services and Education, and all of the other departments that are \naffected by the Omnibus bill. With a continuing resolution, there will \nnot be any provision to prohibit the implementation of the regulation.\n  If the alternative is followed, the result will be the same. If you \nhave the Omnibus appropriation bill in its present form, which does not \nhave the prohibition against implementing this overtime regulation, \nthen the regulation goes into effect. So either way you go, you have \nthe regulation. So that we are not between a rock and a hard place; we \nare faced with this regulation on either alternative.\n  If we do not pass this Omnibus appropriation bill, there will be very \nmany important projects that will not be funded. If you take the \nDepartment of Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, and the \nsubcommittee which I chair, there is an addition of $3.7 billion this \nyear, with substantial additional funding for the National Institutes \nof Health, with substantial additional funding for education, and \nsubstantial additional funding for Head Start. We really do not have a \nchoice.\n  Last November, when the omnibus was taken up, the chairman of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee, Chairman Young, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Chairman Regula, chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, and I met and tried diligently to work out \nan accommodation to delay implementation of this regulation until the \nend of the fiscal year. We were not asking for very much. Now it is \nJanuary 21, and the Secretary of Labor says the regulation will be \nready for being promulgated on March 31. I doubt very much that will \nhappen. Yesterday, in the course of the hearing, I asked the Secretary \na detailed set of questions to see how many comments she had. \nReportedly, it was some 80,000. After the regulation is promulgated by \nthe Department of Labor, it has to go through the OMB, and that takes a \nlong time. At March 31, we already will have half of the fiscal year \ngone. It will not be much of a concession by the administration to \nallow this regulation to not be put into effect until the end of this \nfiscal year and to take up the alternative legislation, which I have \nintroduced, that would provide for a commission. But we face a \nsituation where we have been unsuccessful in months of negotiations to \ntry to effect a change on this issue.\n  This is part of the political process. It would have been my hope \nthat the Secretary, who comes to our subcommittee with frequent \nrequests that we have accommodated to the maximum extent possible, in \nthe spirit of reciprocity would have accommodated us for a few short \nmonths. But in view of the fact that this regulation will take effect \nwhether we pass the omnibus or not, the continuing resolution will \nleave the regulation in effect. The Omnibus appropriations bill will \nleave the regulation in effect.\n  It is obviously preferable to have the omnibus pass, where we have \nthe additional funding, $3.7 billion, for the subcommittee for very \nimportant items. That is why I feel constrained, notwithstanding my \nvery strong objections to this regulation on overtime pay.\n  I think it is not appropriate, not really fair to the American \nworking men and women that a few extra months were not commissioned to \ntry to bring some clarity. I agree with the proposition that we ought \nto take every step we can to clarify the regulations to eliminate \nlitigation. But on this state of the record, the least undesirable \nalternative is to have cloture imposed and to try to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the worst provisions in this \nshameful bill is the provision that will take away the right of \novertime pay to millions of loyal and hard-working Americans. That \nprovision also shows the enormous gulf between what the Bush \nadministration says and what it does.\n  Again and again, President Bush talks about providing economic \nsecurity for all Americans, and then he\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\nquietly tries to deny millions of workers their basic right to \novertime.\n  If you have to work overtime, you deserve overtime pay. No employer \nshould deny you that right, and no President and no Congress should \ntake it away from you.\n  In his State of the Union speech last night, the President said his \njobs and growth agenda would include ``relief from needless Federal \nregulation.'' Apparently, he believes protecting employees' overtime \npay is a needless regulation.\n  Millions of employees across America disagree with that. This \nproposal makes clear that the Bush administration is working overtime \nfor the corporations and against the workers of America. We are \nfighting a war in Iraq, and this President and this administration is \nalso waging a war on workers here at home.\n  Thirteen million children are going hungry every day; 8 million \nAmericans are unemployed with no jobs in sight; 7 million workers have \nbeen waiting since 1997 for the raise they deserve in the minimum wage; \n90,000 workers a week are losing their unemployment benefits. They \ncan't find jobs in the Bush economy, and the President took away their \nunemployment benefits, too. And more than 8 million workers will lose \ntheir overtime pay because President Bush says they don't deserve it.\n  Majorities in both the Senate and the House agreed that the Bush \nadministration was wrong to deny overtime protections to workers, and \nby a vote in the Senate and a vote in the House of Representatives, we \nsaid to the President: You are wrong. But here it is. They took it out \nof this bill behind closed doors at the last minute, and now they \nexpect Congress to accept that because the vote is on this larger bill.\n  We could change this bill in a minute and send it on to the \nPresident, and that is what we ought to do. We know for whom we are \nfighting on this issue, and we know why we are fighting--for their \nright to keep the overtime pay they deserve.\n  We are fighting for the nurse who burns the midnight oil day in and \nday out caring for the sick and the elderly. We are fighting for the \nfirefighters, the law enforcement officers, the first responders--the \nheroes of homeland security--the men and women standing watch and \nworking night and day to protect our safety. They are our generation of \nPaul Reveres prepared to act when danger comes. They deserve fair pay \nfor all they do.\n  We are fighting for our veterans and for our men and women serving so \nbravely now in Iraq and across the world who return to civilian life \nonly to find that the training they learned in the military will now be \nused to deny them their right to overtime pay.\n  I want to point out what this proposed regulation under professional \nemployees is all about and what it states. I will include the whole \nprovision but included in the provision--listen to this, Mr. \nPresident--is:\n  The word ``customary'' means that exemption is also available to the \nemployees in such professions--these will be the people who are \nincluded in the rule and, therefore, ineligible for overtime--it says:\n\n       The exemption is also available to employees in such \n     professions who have substantially the same knowledge level \n     as the degreed employees--\n\n  Those are generally the 4-year degree employees to whom they are \nreferring.\n\n     but who attained such knowledge through a combination of work \n     experience, training in the Armed Forces--\n\n  Training in the Armed Forces. This is the first time they have \nincluded that you can be ineligible for overtime pay if you have been \ntrained in the Armed Forces.\n  I say to my colleagues, what are the kinds of training they get in \nthe Armed Forces? The Army, for example, offers new recruits a choice \nof over 200 occupations, each of which includes training and a listing \nof the civilian occupations for which training could help them find a \njob. This proposal would punish the veterans with loss of overtime \nprotection precisely because they have received the exact same training \nthat is used as a recruitment incentive.\n  The military trains service members for hundreds of occupations, \nincluding lab technicians and other health care occupations, \ninformation technology, engineers, drafters, designers, air traffic \ncontrollers, communications specialists, law enforcement, firefighters, \nsecurity personnel, journalists, and the list goes on.\n  If you go into the Armed Forces, you serve in Iraq, you come back, \nyou have received training programs. Under these regulations, you are \nineligible for overtime.\n  That is unconscionable. Why did they put in the service members' \ntraining programs in the Armed Forces for the first time? This is put \nin for the first time in changes to the rules. This is the first time \nin the history of overtime, going back to the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nthat they have included this training.\n  I am absolutely amazed, at a time when we are asking our service men \nand women to do so much and while they are in Iraq and elsewhere, we \nare passing a regulation in this omnibus bill that is going to say when \nthey come back that if they have been trained in any of these areas, \nthey will be considered, under these regulations, a professional and be \nineligible for overtime, after they have been risking their lives for \nthe American people. Does that make sense? Permit us to have an up-or-\ndown vote on that, Mr. Republican Leadership? Permit the Senate to vote \non that and see what the sentiment is? Oh, no. Just tuck it into the \nregulation, behind closed doors; put it in there with everything else \nand let it become law without giving Congress a say.\n\n  I do not know what that will mean in the future if that happens \nbecause we know that the incentives--one of the reasons that many young \npeople go into the Armed Forces is because of the various training and \neducational benefits. Effectively, the Bush plan would do away with the \nstandard requirement and allow equivalent training in the Armed Forces \nto substitute for the 4-year degree and therefore make these veterans \nineligible. These training programs, as I say, have been a primary \nincentive for attracting people into the Armed Forces.\n  Do my colleagues understand that? It says here--I am reading right \nfrom it--training in the Armed Forces, and it goes on: Comma, or other \nintellectual instructions, training in the Armed Forces.\n  So that is what would happen to thousands of those men and women who \nare over in Iraq and Afghanistan, scattered around the world. They come \non back. This proposal goes into effect. Their employer is going to \nlook down and say, oh, Jim, by the way, you were in a training program \nbefore you went over to Iraq and you were trained, and it says in these \nrules here I do not have to pay you overtime because that is right in \nthese rules.\n  So we are fighting for our veterans and fighting for our men and \nwomen serving bravely now in Iraq and across the world, who return to \ncivilian life only to find that the training they earned in the \nmilitary will now be used to deny them their right to overtime pay.\n  Most cynical of all, the Bush administration claims that its plan \nwould actually entitle low-income workers to qualify for overtime. The \nDepartment of Labor has distributed guidelines to employers on the \nsteps that they can take to avoid the need to pay that overtime. Just \ncalculate the pay an employee now gets with overtime included and then \ncut the employee's basic pay enough to reduce the total to what it was \nbefore.\n  Is there anybody who doubts what is going on? This is basically a sop \nto companies and corporations around the country in order to squeeze \nemployees even further. There are more than eight million out of work. \nLast quarter we found employment increased by only 1,000. They expected \nclose to 300,000. It increased by only 1,000. There are so many workers \nwho are eligible for unemployment insurance even though they have paid \nin for it, 90,000 at the end of this week which will be the end of all \nof their unemployment compensation. Did we hear anything about that \nlast evening? I did not.\n  So is that cynical or what? How redhanded do we have to catch this \nadministration before the American people understand what is being done \nto them? Always it is the Bush administration putting corporate profits \nover the well-being of American workers. The Department of Labor's \nmission is to promote the welfare of the job seekers, wage earners, and \nretirees of the\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\nUnited States, and that is what it says on the Department's Web site. \nIt does not say promote the bottom line for businesses.\n  The last thing American workers need in today's troubled economy is a \npay cut like that. Staff Sergeant John Miller, who performs homeland \nsecurity and other public safety duties in the District of Columbia \nNational Guard, is concerned that he and many in his department will \nlose their overtime pay because of the Bush plan. He recently testified \nthat eliminating overtime pay will have a devastating impact on his \ndepartment's ability to perform vital public safety responsibilities. \nWithout his overtime pay, he said his family could no longer afford \ntheir current mortgage or save for college for their two teenage \nchildren.\n  Thousands of veterans will lose their overtime pay as well. Under \ncurrent law, workers can be denied overtime protection if they are in \nthe category of the professional employees. In general, it is only \nworkers with a 4-year degree in a professional field who will be \nclassified as professional. The Bush plan will abolish this standard \nand allow equivalent training in the Armed Forces to be routinely \nsubstituted for a 4-year degree. How is that for a slap in the face to \nour courageous men and women fighting in Iraq?\n\n  Cutbacks in overtime pay are a nightmare that no worker should have \nto bear. Nationwide overtime pay makes up a quarter of a worker's total \npay. The administration's policy will mean an average pay cut of $160 a \nweek for every worker. That is an outrage.\n  Hard-working Americans deserve a pay raise, not a pay cut.\n  It is wrong for the administration to try to force the unfair pay cut \non them. More than 2 million jobs have been lost since President Bush \ntook office. Unemployment is a massive problem, especially in hard \ntimes such as these. Overtime pay is exactly the incentive needed for \njob creation, because it encourages employers to hire more workers, \ninstead of requiring current employees to work longer hours. We need a \njob creation policy, but all the Bush administration proposes is a job \ndestruction policy.\n  The overtime pay requirement and the Fair Labor Standards Act has \nbeen a fundamental right of American workers for more than half a \ncentury. That basic law was enacted in the 1930s to create the 40-hour \nweek. It says workers have to be paid time and a half for extra hours. \nSince 1938, that has been the law.\n  According to the Congressional General Accounting Office, employees \nwithout overtime protection are twice as likely to work overtime as \nthose covered by protection. Americans are working longer hours today \nthan ever before, longer than any industrialized nation. I will show \nthis in the following illustrations.\n  This chart shows that Americans work more hours than workers in any \nother industrialized nation in the world. The United States is right \nover here on this chart. We can also compare Denmark, France, Ireland, \nNetherlands, the UK, Italy, and Germany. This was in 2001. It is still \nrelevant in terms of the current time. We can see workers in the United \nStates work considerably more than any other country in the world. So \nthey are No. 1 in the workplace.\n  The second chart shows that if one does not have overtime protection, \nthis is what happens: Workers without the overtime protections are more \nthan twice as likely to work longer hours, more than 40 hours a week \nwithout protection. Forty-four percent of workers who had no overtime \nprotection worked more than 40 hours a week, compared to 19 percent of \nthose with the overtime protection, well more than double. If it is \nmore than 50 hours a week, those without overtime protection work three \ntimes longer than those who have the protection.\n  Who is affected by this? All one has to do is see under the \nrecommendation of the Bush administration of the 8 million people, what \nare the classifications? It is very interesting. We are talking about \npolice officers. We are talking about nurses. We are talking about \nfirefighters. They are the backbone of the homeland security, the front \nline responders. The dangers we are facing from bioterrorism, who is \nout there first? The firefighters, policemen, and nurses. This proposal \nwill effectively eliminate their overtime. We should not be eliminating \nit.\n  We ask them to take vaccines in a number of instances where we are \nunsure about what the outcomes are going to be. We do not even provide \nthem with adequate compensation if they are going to get ill or sick as \na result of it. We ask them to do all kinds of things.\n\n  Now their reward will be we will find that, under the proposal that \nis in this legislation, their overtime pay will be effectively \neliminated.\n  The same department that is tasked to protect American workers and \nenhance the employer's workplace and enhance the opportunity for work \nin this country put out the proposal about how to avoid paying your \nemployees overtime. That is courtesy of the Bush Department of Labor.\n  There it is. They just spell it out for us. The Department of Labor \nspells out how the employer can circumvent paying any kind of overtime \nif they are doing it even today, and gives every employer who wants to \nthe way in which they can undermine it.\n  Congress cannot stay silent and roll over while more and more \nAmericans lose their jobs, their livelihoods, their homes, their \ndignity, and their hope. We will be fighting other battles in this \nsession, battles to restore jobs, guarantee fair unemployment benefits, \nraise the minimum wage. The place to start is here. Let's at least not \nallow the Bush administration to take the country backwards on this \nfundamental issue, the right to overtime pay when workers are forced to \nwork overtime by their employers. Let's preserve the overtime \nprotections on which so many millions of working families across the \ncountry depend today. Why should their standard of living have to go \ndown so employers can make higher profits by squeezing workers harder?\n  I would like to address one other issue that is related to the \nworkers of this country, and that is the issue of the unemployment \ncompensation. The Federal extension of unemployment benefits expired \nDecember 31 and 90,000 workers a week have been running out of \nbenefits. The economy lost 2.4 million jobs since President Bush took \noffice and at the December rate of job growth it would take 200 years \nto return to prerecession jobs levels. American workers can't wait that \nlong. Nearly 15 million Americans are out of work, including \ndiscouraged and underemployed workers, and the number of long-term \nunemployed remains unacceptably high at 2 million.\n  Historically, job loss during a recession is about 50 percent \ntemporary and 50 percent permanent. Today, nearly 80 percent of the job \nloss is permanent. As a result, many of the unemployed will not return \nto work soon.\n  Today, there is only one job opening for every three out-of-work \nAmericans. The Republican leadership continues to paint a rosy picture \nof the economy while ignoring these workers. House majority leader Tom \nDeLay has said he sees ``no reason'' to extend unemployment benefits \nand the Bush administration has been silent on the issue. Democratic \nSenators have asked for unanimous consent to take up and pass a Federal \nunemployment extension more than a dozen times. Each time the \nRepublicans say no.\n  The program was enacted in March 2002 and extended in January 2003 \nand May 2003. It provided 13 weeks of unemployment benefits in most \nStates, and 26 weeks in high unemployment States. Today, due to the \ncriteria used to define high unemployment, only one state qualifies as \na high unemployment State, Alaska, despite continuing unemployment in \nmany other States.\n  The bill would reinstitute and extend the Federal Unemployment \nInsurance Program for 6 months, and ensure that high unemployment \nStates continue to be covered.\n  I see my friend and colleague on the other side. I have just \nmentioned to the Senate we are now at the point where we are losing \n90,000 workers a week, those who are losing coverage on unemployment. \nWe still have some 15 million Americans out of work, including the \ndiscouraged and underemployed workers. And the number of long-term \nunemployed remains unacceptably high--nearly 2 million.\n  Historically, as I mentioned, the job loss during a recession is \nabout 50 percent temporary and 50 percent permanent. Today it is 80 \npercent permanent.\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\nThese are real people with real needs--families, mortgages to pay, food \nto put on the table. If we are going to have an expanding economy, it \nshould not be done at the expense of one sector of our economy. It \nshould be a tide that raises all the boats. There is no question that \nWall Street is doing well. There is no question that a number of our \ncompanies are having extraordinary profits.\n  But we have these two issues, one denying the 8 million Americans the \novertime, including veterans. And now we have a proposal to permit the \nextension of the unemployment compensation for those who have paid into \nthe program and who are in dire need.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 2006, a bill to extend unemployment benefits for 6 \nmonths, which I introduced yesterday; that the bill be read a third \ntime, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements appear in the Record as though read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I need to find out what \nthe request is. Unfortunately, I tell my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts, the Senate has been in for a day, but I have not read \nhis bill. I understand he introduced it yesterday. He wants to pass it \ntoday. Senator Kennedy is a very effective legislator, but I personally \nhave not had a chance to read the bill.\n  Will the Senator tell me what the essence of his bill is? Is it a \nprogram to double unemployment compensation extension to 26 weeks? Or \nextend the present program to 13 weeks?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator, it is essentially the same plan we \npassed before. The bill will reinstate the insurance program for 6 \nmonths, ensure that higher unemployment States continue to be covered--\n13 weeks; 13 weeks. It is the narrower program.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the clarification.\n  Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, two or three comments. Senator Kennedy is \nmy friend. We debated this issue a couple of times.\n  In the past many months, I guess for the last year and a half, there \nhas been an effort to turn a 13-week program into a 26-week program. I \nhave objected to that very strongly and will continue to object to it \nvery strongly.\n  As I understand Senator Kennedy's explanation, this is an extension \nof the existing Federal unemployment compensation program which is \nscheduled to expire by the end of March of this year. But I would like \nto point out a couple of reasons why I object.\n  I will be happy to work with my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts to maybe learn in greater detail of his proposal, but \njust a couple of editorial comments. No. 1, the unemployment rate is \ncoming down. It is at 5.7 percent. In 1993, at the conclusion of a \nsignificant downturn and recession in the economy, the Democrats were \nin control of the Senate and they had a Temporary Federal Unemployment \nCompensation Extension Program. The unemployment rates at that time \nwere between 6.6 and 7.7 percent. In other words, they discontinued the \nprogram when the unemployment rate was at 6.6. The unemployment rate \ntoday is 5.7.\n  I might mention the title of this program has been Temporary Federal \nUnemployment Compensation. It was temporary. I note today there are 26 \nStates, over half of States have unemployment rates of less than 5 \npercent.\n  To have a national program for every State, which is very expensive, \nI am not sure is timely.\n  That is the reason we should have a chance to review this. Without \nhaving a chance to find out what the cost of it is, from what I have \ngathered and learned over the years, I object.\n  We have already spent, for the information of my colleagues, over the \nlast 36 months I think something like $30 billion. It is not an \ninexpensive program.\n  I might note that in the 1990s Congress spent $28.5 billion. That was \nover 30 months when the unemployment rate was much higher--6.6 to 7.7 \npercent.\n  I might also, for the information of my colleagues, note that many \nStates have not spent the $8 billion of Federal funding that we \ntransferred in March of 2002 for unemployment compensation. We \ntransferred $8 billion. According to the Labor Department, there is \nstill $5 billion remaining unspent by the States.\n  Those are reasons I objected to my friend's unanimous consent \nrequest. I appreciate his bringing this to the forefront of the Senate. \nIt may not be the last we have heard of this. But this is a temporary \nprogram. I think some people would like for it to be a permanent \nprogram. This Senator does not want it to be a permanent program.\n  For those reasons, I objected to the request. I will be happy to work \nwith my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, to see if we can't \ndo something positive to help create an environment which is more \nconducive to more jobs for more Americans this year. I think we can do \nthat in a variety of ways, one of which would be making the Tax Code \nmore fair for the working environment. I will work with all of our \ncolleagues to see if we can't have a more productive job-creating \nenvironment, one part of which would be to pass an energy bill.\n  We passed a good energy bill. I am not saying that what we had last \nyear, which I guess is still on the calendar, was a perfect energy \nbill. But I believe there are thousands and thousands of jobs that \ncould be created if we passed a positive energy bill.\n  I hope our colleagues will look at that and other measures maybe that \nwould help reduce health care costs and other things that would create \na more productive environment for job creation in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to respond briefly, as this chart \nindicates, our economy has lost 2.4 million jobs since the President \ntook office. The job creation has been anemic. The economy created only \n1,000 jobs in December. At the December rate of job growth, it would \ntake 200 years to return to the level of jobs we had when President \nBush first took office.\n  The reality is that the estimate of the administration was that we \nwere going to create 300,000 jobs as a result of the tax cut. It is \ndown to 1,000. The reason we have seen the move from 5.9 to 5.7 percent \nin unemployment is basically that so many people have been \ndisillusioned. They have given up. We put this program in, which I \nsupport, at a time when unemployment was 5.7 percent, the exact same \npercent that it is now. But it is objected to.\n  It is true the plans are costly, but we know that the fund itself \nwhich the workers have paid into has nearly $20 billion. This would \ncost about $7 billion. That represents funds the workers have paid in \nfor just this kind of rainy day. But no, we are being objected to.\n  In the early 1990s, Congress extended the unemployment benefit five \ntimes. That program did not end until the economy had more jobs than \nbefore the recession began.\n  This is a fair enough test, it seems to me. But when you have 90,000 \nAmericans who have worked--these are Americans who have worked hard, \nplayed by the rules, have families, mortgages, and paid into the fund. \nThe fund is in surplus, and we have 90,000 who are losing their \ncoverage. This is a temporary program. It is short term--6 months, \nabout $7 billion, with nearly $20 billion in surplus.\n  Workers are entitled to this kind of protection. They are entitled to \na minimum wage. They work 40 hours a week 52 weeks of the year so they \ndon't have to live in poverty. Most Americans believe that. They \nunderstand, for example, when we have the chance to increase the \nminimum wage that we have been blocked for 7 years. For 7 years, \nRepublicans have blocked it. They block increasing the minimum wage. \nThey block extending unemployment compensation. They initiate rules to \neliminate overtime.\n  This is the record. When we talk about the minimum wage, it is \nobviously a women's issue because most of the people who receive the \nminimum wage are women. It is a children's issue because great numbers \nof those women have children. It is a civil rights issue because many \nof those who work at minimum wage are men and women of color. And it is \na fairness issue.\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\n  We can't get the chance to vote on these matters. There is objection. \nHow long did we hear last fall about, we ought to be able to vote on \nMedicare? Let the people vote up and down. But no, no, we can't with \nregard to the unemployment compensation. We can't get a vote on \nincreasing the minimum wage. They have refused to permit this \ninstitution to have a vote again on the overtime limitations for 8 \nmillion people because there is objection. I think that is wrong.\n  We look forward to another opportunity to come back and address these \nissues in a way where hopefully we will be able to get a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to see my friend from \nMassachusetts again. He is feeling good. He is energetic, as he always \nis. He is a very effective legislator and champions the cause with \ngreat enthusiasm. I appreciate that.\n  I will make a couple of editorial comments.\n  I love the chart. He said if we went at last month's pace of 1,000 \njobs being created, it would take 200 years. That was 1,000 jobs last \nmonth. Over the last 5 months, 280,000 jobs were created, according to \nthe Department of Labor. He forgot to mention that. But for December, I \nthink he is correct as reported by the Department of Labor.\n  It is kind of interesting. He also said we have to have a vote on \nincreasing the minimum wage but those Republicans haven't allowed us to \ndo it. He said they haven't allowed us to do it for the last several \nyears.\n  I remember a period with not necessarily the greatest fondest of \nmemories. But for almost 2 years, the Democrats were in control. \nSenator Daschle was the majority leader, I believe from about June of \n2000 or maybe 2001 until the end of 2002. He was the majority leader of \nthe Senate. Senator Kennedy was the chairman of the committee, and that \ncould have been brought to the floor at any point during that time. The \nmajority leader controlled the floor and the agenda of the Senate. It \ncould have been offered as an amendment by any Member of the Senate, \nand it wasn't. I just make note of that fact.\n  It is interesting that it wasn't raised during that timeframe when \nthis body was controlled by my friends on the Democratic side of the \naisle. I want to just make note of that.\n  I don't doubt that we will have the pleasure of debating that issue. \nI look forward to that debate when that happens. I don't know that we \nwant to make it against the law for anybody to work in the United \nStates for less than $6 an hour. Some people say if they didn't make $6 \nan hour, they would be unemployed. I don't share that philosophy. But I \nguess we will have a chance to debate that. That is fine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, very briefly, we will have an opportunity \nto debate this further. We were denied an up-and-down vote on the \nminimum wage just last year when the Republican leadership pulled the \nState Department bill from the floor rather than let us vote on the \nminimum wage amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       However, the word ``customarily'' means that the exemption \n     is also available to employees in such professions who have \n     substantially the same knowledge level as the degreed \n     employees, but who attained such knowledge through a \n     combination of work experience, training in the armed forces, \n     attending a technical school, attending a community college \n     or other intellectual instruction.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I voted to continue debate on the \nOmnibus because I believe we need to explore alternatives. Let me be \nclear: I want this bill to pass. I am proud of the work we did on the \nVA-HUD subcommittee to help our veterans, protect our environment, \nrebuild our communities, but I believe we need to pause.\n  We need to take a break and problem solve. There should be an \nalternative between passing an Omnibus that contains terrible \nprovisions and a one year continuing resolution that would underfund so \nmany of our priorities.\n  There must be a way to compromise and go back to the original seven \nappropriations bills, negotiated on a bipartisan basis, before \nprovisions were added in the dead of night, outside the usual and \ncustomary conference procedures.\n  The Omnibus includes critical funding for our Nation's veterans. \nWorking on a bipartisan basis, Senator Kit Bond and I increased funding \nfor VA health care by $1.5 billion over the President's request.\n  We said no to the administration's proposal to charge our veterans a \n$250 membership fee for their healthcare. We said no to higher \ndeductibles and co-payments. With record numbers of veterans seeking \nmedical care through VA, with soldiers returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, we have a duty and responsibility to care for them. \nPromises made must be promises kept. The Omnibus funding bill allows us \nto keep our promise.\n  The Omnibus also includes increased funding for AmeriCorps--$444 \nmillion--an increase of $170 million over last year the highest funding \nlevel ever.\n  With this funding, more volunteers will serve our communities \nteaching in our schools, tutoring and mentoring our children, \nrebuilding neighborhoods, restoring parks, all while earning money to \nhelp pay for college, and learning the habits of the heart that make a \ndifference for America.\n  The Omnibus adds $500 million for the Clean Water revolving loan \nfund, and another $6 million to improve water and sewer infrastructure \nthat directly helps clean up the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what this means in my State of Maryland. \nThe Chesapeake Bay is part of our heritage. It also source of jobs from \nthe watermen to the restaurant owner. Yet the President's budget cut \nfunds for this critical infrastructure program. That's why I fought to \nprovide $1.35 billion for water and sewer construction.\n  This funding means a cleaner Chesapeake Bay and new jobs right away--\nhigh paying construction jobs that will put people back to work clean \nour environment and prevent cost shifting to our local communities.\n  We have a chronic shortage of nurses in America. This bill contains a \n$30 million increase for the Nurse Reinvestment Act--legislation I \nwrote that provides scholarships to nursing students in exchange for 2-\nyears of service in areas that need nurses most.\n  The Omnibus increases funding for special education by $1.2 billion. \nThis is an important step toward the Federal Government fulfilling its \nobligations. When IDEA first became law, the federal government \npromised to pay 40 percent of the cost.\n  But Federal funding has never topped 17 percent that means local \ndistricts must make up the difference by skimping on special ed, by \ncutting from other education programs, or by raising taxes. I do not \nwant to force States and local school districts to forage for funds, \ncut back on teacher training, or delay school repairs.\n  We need to make up the difference and help relieve a crushing \nfinancial burden on local school districts.\n  I fought hard to improve this bill to meet the day to day needs of \nMarylanders and the long range needs of our Nation.\n  So why do I want to pause--before we pass it?\n  Because we can do better. I want time to discuss and explore \nalternatives to provisions that were added in the dead of night and \nthat cause real problems.\n\n  I believe the best social program is a job. You should be paid if you \nwork. You should be paid overtime if you work overtime.\n  Yet the Omnibus allows the administration to gut overtime protections \nfor 8 million American workers. The Bush proposal means workers will \nhave to work long hours for less money.\n  It hurts nurses, police officers, fire fighters who are already \nstretched to the limit. This provision hurts working families \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  The Senate voted to block this provision. The House supported our \nefforts.\n  But then, in the dead of night, the administration strong-armed \nconferees to strip our protections out of the bill.\n  The administration should not be able to overturn the will of \nCongress without debate and without a vote.\n  The administration did the same thing to federal employees--twisting \narms and going outside the usual and\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\ncustomary process to push an anti-worker agenda.\n  The White House has a plan to contract out as many federal jobs as \npossible. It is a political agenda, masquerading as management reform. \nThe Administration's plan for privatization costs money, costs morale, \nand costs the integrity of the civil service.\n  They have changed the rules to favor their contractor cronies, and \nnow they have violated the democratic process. They know they do not \nhave support in Congress or from the American public for their \nprivatization agenda.\n  So they are using bully boy tactics and back room politics to bypass \nCongress and overturn a bipartisan compromise.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, what happened. During an appropriations \nconference, the House and Senate agreed to a bipartisan compromise that \nfixed some of the problems with OMB's new unfair contracting out rules \nbut still recognized the importance of competition.\n  The compromise did not fix every problem. And it did not stop \ncontracting out. But I supported it because it was fair, and I thought \nit was a good start.\n  My Republican colleagues supported it. And the White House supported \nit as well.\n  Yet now, the White House has gone back on the deal. They slipped a \nprovision into the Omnibus spending bill that guts the bipartisan \ncompromise and leaves us with meaningless ``improvements''\n  This is disgraceful. The contracting out provisions in the Omnibus \nroll back workers' rights--the right to appeal a contracting out \ndecision, the right to competitively bid on their own jobs. It even \nrolls back the requirement that contractors have to save money.\n  That is not what we agreed to in a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. \nWe had an agreement that these three things were important. But OMB did \nnot like it, because it would have given workers a fair shot.\n  Our country faces a new threat--the threat that mad cow disease will \ncontaminate our food supply.\n  But, instead of taking this seriously, and doing everything possible \nto keep our food supply safe, the administration pushed to delay the \ncountry-of-origin labeling for meat products, overriding the will of \nthe Senate.\n  Labeling of meat and meat products was supposed to go into effect \nthis year, based on provisions in the 2002 Farm Bill. With this \nlabeling, consumers could make an informed decision about what they \npurchased and what to feed their families.\n  Even with the first case of mad cow in the United States, \nadministration will not back down from protecting its special interests \nfriends. They made sure the Omnibus kept language delaying \nimplementation of labeling for 2 years.\n  The Omnibus also rolls back existing gun laws and ties the hands of \nlaw enforcement. The Brady law requires that gun records be held for 90 \ndays, yet this bill allows Government to destroy records after only 24 \nhours.\n  These records are kept for a reason--to help law enforcement track \ndown weapons used in a crime, and to keep law breakers from buying \nguns.\n  The rollback provision also blocks the public from seeing critical \ninformation, even if they were the victim of a gun crime. If these \nrollbacks were in place last year, families of the DC sniper victims \nwould not be allowed to know where the sniper got his gun and the \nquestionable practices of the gun shop. Without this information, they \nwould effectively be denied their day in court.\n  These provisions were not raised in the Senate. They should not be \nforced through in an omnibus.\n  I voted against cloture so the Senate has more time to discuss these \nimportant issues and explore the alternatives.\n  The American people deserve our best effort, not an omnibus rushed \nthrough in a single day.\n  There are serious problems with this bill--problems largely created \nby an administration that runs rough-shod over the democratic process \nand the will of Congress.\n  I am volcanic about how the final version of this bill was written.\n  As a member of the Appropriation Committee, I know first-hand the \nhard work and honest effort at bipartsanship went into the 7 \nappropriations bills.\n  All that went out the window once the administration forced itself \ninto the room.\n  The underlying bill is a good bill that does a lot of good things.\n  We need to find a way to get back to those things and move forward \nfor the good of America.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, more than 70 years ago, \nNebraska Senator George Norris left Congress, returned to Nebraska, and \nled the effort to establish a unicameral legislature. He did this in \nlarge part because of his frustration with conference committees. These \ncommittees are supposed to reconcile differences between House and \nSenate bills, but all too often the bills that come out of these \ncommittees with new, controversial provisions.\n  Based on what I have witnessed, I have a renewed understanding of \nNorris's frustration with the conference committee process.\n  As we all know, it is in the conference committee that the final \ndraft of legislation is often completed. Once the conference report is \nfinished, a member may only vote to accept or reject; no amendments are \nallowed.\n  For this reason, the conference committee is an attractive \nopportunity to include legislative proposals that would not pass muster \nif they were considered openly on the floors of the House and Senate.\n  As Senator Norris wrote:\n\n       Members of conference committees are often compelled to \n     surrender on important items where no surrender would be even \n     demanded if consideration of the legislation were in the open \n     . . . The individual legislator must then vote upon a \n     conference report without any opportunity of expressing by \n     his vote his opposition to anything that the bill in this \n     form contains.\n\n  This is as true today as it was so many decades ago.\n  Too often, a conference report comes back to us with initiatives \nnever discussed in this body, or worse, with provisions that were \nrejected outright months, weeks, or even days before. In a conference \nreport, popular or necessary programs can be tied to unpopular or \nimpractical ones, subverting the process by which we should consider \nlegislation.\n  The legislative process is frustrated further when the legislation in \nquestion is labeled a ``must-pass'' appropriations bill. With programs \nawaiting resources sometimes months after the end of the fiscal year, \nthere is an understandable desire not to drag out the process once the \nomnibus bill is finally completed. When a ``must pass'' appropriations \nbill leaves conference, the normal conference habit of including more \ncontroversial measures increases exponentially--as does the pressure to \npass the bill without delay.\n  This is not how Congress should do business. Measures should be \nconsidered openly and honestly. They should not be tucked in during \nclosed door meetings of committee conferees.\n  This year's Omnibus bill contains several controversial proposals, \nand while this is by no means the first time this has occurred, it is \npast time for it to end.\n  Included among those is a provision that would delay funding of COOL \nfor 2 years. This could effectively end the program before it has \nbegun. This program is believed to be an important element in our \nefforts to re-establish consumer confidence in foreign markets. \nNebraska's beef exports to Asian markets amounted to more than $460 \nmillion in revenue for our State in 2003. Without these and other \nmarkets, Nebraska could lose up to 21,000 jobs according to a Creighton \nUniversity expert, severely hurting our efforts to turn the corner on \nthe recent economic downturn. This may be the most important economic \nissue facing rural Nebraska. We need to act promptly in considering the \nimpact of defunding COOL.\n  For this reason, I will vote to continue debate on the Omnibus bill. \nI do so in the hopes that this package can be re-examined and that the \npolicy initiatives in it will be discussed as legislation, not \nappropriations.\n  This bill contains many promising Nebraska projects, some of which I \nworked with my colleagues and other Nebraskans to include. These \nprojects and other spending initiatives are important to our State and \nto me. But I do not think that their importance\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\nshould allow them to be held hostage by a process that promotes the \nbackroom inclusion of new, controversial, onerous and unpopular \ninitiatives. It is my hope that with full debate on the bill, these \nlast minute policy initiatives will be considered and openly discussed.\n  It is past time for Congress to end the process of using conference \nreports and appropriations bills to enact unpopular or controversial \npolicies. Continuing debate on the controversial provisions of this \nbill is the first step in doing so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that \nwe have reached an agreement on final language for S. 1177, the Prevent \nAll Cigarette Trafficking, PACT Act of 2003, which my friend Senator \nKohl and I introduced on June 3, 2003. The manager's amendment makes \nthe PACT Act even stronger than as introduced.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and I originally introduced \nthe PACT Act because of our concern that contraband cigarette \ntrafficking both damages the economies of several States and \ncontributes heavily to the profits of organized crime syndicates, \nincluding global terrorist organizations. When we reported this bill \nfrom the Judiciary Committee on July 31, 2003, I pledged to work with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address any and all \nconcerns they had with the legislation. The result of this bipartisan \neffort is a piece of legislation that will prevent cigarette and \nsmokeless tobacco smuggling and ensure the collection of tobacco excise \ntaxes without infringing upon the rights of Native Americans or \nconsumers.\n  Internet sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are an impediment \nStates face in their collection of tobacco excise taxes. A recent \nGeneral Accounting Office report indicates Internet tobacco sellers \nrarely comply with requirements under the Jenkins Act of 1949 (15 \nU.S.C. Sec. Sec. 375-378 (2003)). The Jenkins Act, as modified by this \nlegislation, is a Federal statute that requires tobacco retailers to \nregister with the tax authority for each State in which they sell \ncigarette and smokeless tobacco products and to file monthly reports \nproviding shipment information within each state. Failing to comply \nwith the Jenkins Act damages not only individual States, but also \nretailers that are put in unfair commercial disadvantage.\n  By ensuring the collection of state excise taxes from all tobacco \nretailers, the PACT Act will neither inconvenience nor hinder smokers \nand smokeless tobacco users in their ability as consumers to purchase \nthe tobacco products of their choice over the Internet. This \nlegislation merely removes any uncertainty regarding the scope of the \nJenkins Act by explicitly mandating Internet tobacco retailers also \ncomply with existing requirements under the Jenkins Act. This strong \nvehicle with which to collect taxes from Internet tobacco retailers \nwill allow States to finally claim their rightful revenue and level the \nplaying field for all tobacco retailers.\n  The PACT Act as modified by the manager's amendment also clarifies \nthat the bill will not affect existing tribal compacts relating to \ntobacco tax collection on tribal lands and allows Native American \nTribes to maintain enforcement authority over their own excise tax \nlaws.\n  As I mentioned in June, law enforcement authorities have uncovered \nseveral instances in which organized crime syndicates are illegally \nfunding terrorist organizations, such as Lebanon-based Hezbollah, \nthrough the smuggling of cigarettes. These groups purchase cigarettes \nin States with low taxes and then transport them into states with \nhigher taxes where the contraband is sold to small retailers at below \nmarket costs. The September 19, 2003, edition of the Detroit Free Press \nreports that one such scheme involved a 12-member syndicate, which \npurchased cigarettes in North Carolina and resold them in Michigan. \nBecause North Carolina collects a 50-cent-per-carton tax and Michigan \ncollects a $12.50 per carton tax, federal prosecutors estimated that \none member of the scheme, Hassan Moussa Makki, who monthly smuggled \n$36,000 to $72,000 worth of cigarettes into the State during a 2-year-\nperiod, prevented Michigan from collecting $2 million in tax revenue. \nLaw enforcement authorities determined Makki donated a substantial \nportion of these profits to Hezbollah. By providing state attorneys \ngeneral with the necessary enforcement tools and the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives with investigative and inspection \nauthority, the PACT Act will ultimately disrupt this form of terrorist \nfunding and ensure that state, local and tribal governments collect \ntheir rightful excise taxes from both cigarette and smokeless tobacco \nsales.\n\n  With respect to delivery sales of smokeless tobacco, this provision \nis intended to impose strict federal limitations on delivery sales in \norder to supplement, and not preempt, applicable State or local law. \nAccordingly, it is intended that State-specific requirements in \nconnection with the collection and remittance of applicable smokeless \ntobacco excise taxes will remain controlling, notwithstanding that \nadvance payment of excise taxes might otherwise be required by Federal \nlaw in the absence of contrary State law. Moreover, the Federal \nproscription of delivery sales of smokeless tobacco with respect to \nwhich excise taxes have not been paid in advance of the delivery is not \nintended to apply where the laws or administrative practices of the \nState and locality in which the delivery is made provide that the \ndelivery seller may remit applicable smokeless tobacco excise taxes in \nan alternate manner.\n  For example, the law of the delivery State and locality may \nexplicitly or implicitly provide for the payment of smokeless tobacco \nexcise taxes along with the filing of a tax return in the month \nsubsequent to the delivery sale. Under such circumstances, even though \napplicable State or local law may not require the applicable smokeless \ntobacco excise taxes be remitted after the delivery, where the law of \nthe delivery State and locality allows for such taxes to be remitted \nafter the delivery, the intent of this provision is that the delivery \nsale may be made without violating federal law provided that applicable \nState and local law with respect to the collection and/or\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nremittance of applicable smokeless tobacco excise taxes are satisfied.\n  I call upon my colleagues to support Senator Kohl's and my efforts to \nprevent the funding of global terrorist organizations and ensure the \ncollection of all excise taxes from the sale of cigarettes and \nsmokeless tobacco, including Internet sales, so States can utilize \ntheir rightful revenue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S105-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE MAMMOGRAPHY QUALITY STANDARDS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support this important \nlegislation. Women screened for breast cancer deserve mammograms of the \nhighest possible quality. I commend Senator Mikulski and Senator Ensign \nfor this bipartisan proposal to strengthen current standards and do \nmore to reduce the tragic toll of breast cancer.\n  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among \nwomen, exceeded only by lung cancer. It strikes more than 200,000 \nAmericans a year. Over 39,000 will die from breast cancer this year.\n  Early screening is essential. More than 90 percent of breast cancers \nare now detected at an early stage of the disease, when treatment can \nbe most effective. Because of early detection through regular \nmammograms, the death rate from breast cancer fell by 20 percent \nbetween 1990 and 2000, even though the overall incidence increased \nslightly.\n  All women deserve access to mammograms of the highest quality. It's a \ntragedy when tumors are missed and lives lost because a screening was \nconducted poorly or interpreted inadequately. The legislation that \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Ensign have proposed will improve the \nquality of mammograms and help reduce the unacceptable toll of breast \ncancer and I urge my colleagues to approve it. It is fitting that this \nimportant bill is one of the first actions taken by the Senate in this \nnew session.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced \nthe Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In May 2002, two young male assailants targeted a Washington, D.C. \nresident after he left a local gay bar. The victim suffered severe face \nwounds, including a broken nose. Later that night, and in the week that \nfollowed, several more gay men were attacked by an unidentified group \nof young men.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S105-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to cosponsor S. 1999, \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug Price Reduction Act, which strikes \nlanguage known as the ``noninterference clause'' included in the \nrecently passed conference report accompanying the Medicare \nPrescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003.\n  I believe that language preventing the Secretary from leveraging the \nenormous purchasing power of the Federal Government will mean our \nseniors may pay more for their drugs than they could be if that \nlanguage was modified to allow the Secretary negotiating ability. \nAmerica's seniors already pay the highest drug prices in the world, \neven though American taxpayers subsidize the research that produces \nmany of those drugs.\n  So this legislation gives the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services, HHS, authority to negotiate contracts with \nmanufacturers of covered Medicare Part D prescription drugs in order to \nensure that enrollees in Medicare prescription drug plans, PDPs, pay \nthe lowest possible price. The authority given to the HHS Secretary is \nsimilar to that given to other Federal entities that purchase \nprescription drugs in bulk.\n  I voted for the Medicare prescription drug conference report because \nit delivered voluntary prescription drug coverage to this Nation's 41 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries. Too many Americans today face the \nterrible choice of paying for rent or groceries or paying for their \nprescription drugs. In fact, some of my constituents have resorted to \nskipping doses in an attempt to manage prescription drug prices.\n  One of the strongest features of the Medicare bill is the assistance \nit provides for low-income Medicare recipients through the elimination \nor reduction of premiums, deductibles and copays. For those low-income \nMedicare recipients whose prescription drug spending exceeds the \ncatastrophic limit, or $5,100 in total drug spending, Medicare will pay \nall of their drug costs. For seniors who do not qualify for the low-\nincome assistance, they will pay no more than 5 percent of their \nprescription drug costs above the catastrophic limit.\n  The Medicare prescription drug bill includes essential increases in \nfunding for California's health care providers. California's hospitals \nare facing financial crises across the State. In fact, over the past 7 \nyears, more than 62 hospitals have been forced to close.\n  The bill will help hospitals meet the needs of California's \ncommunities by providing $882 million in additional Medicare and \nMedicaid payments over the next 10 years. Physicians will now receive \nan increase of 1.5 percent per year in Medicare payments in 2004 and \n2005, rather than the 4.5 percent payment cut they were expected to \nincur.\n\n  However, one of the most troubling aspects of the bill was language \nintended to promote competition among prescription drug plans in order \nto lower prescription drug prices. Section 1860D-11(i) says:\n\n       The Secretary may not interfere with the negotiations \n     between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and Prescription \n     Drug sponsors.\n\n  I believe that this language actually takes away one of the best \ntools the Medicare program could use to bring down prescription drug \nprices by denying the Government the ability to negotiate price \ndiscounts on behalf of Medicare recipients.\n  The Veterans' Affairs, VA, system negotiates prescription drug \nprices. This negotiating authority has been a terrific success in \nbringing down the cost of drugs purchased by the VA. Why would we \nprevent the Secretary of HHS from doing the same on behalf of our 41 \nmillion Medicare recipients?\n  Some argue that this noninterference language will spur competing \nprescription drug plans to drive down the cost of prescription drugs in \nan effort to secure contracts with the Federal Government. However, \nsince the Secretary may not require a particular formulary or institute \na price structure for covered Part D drugs, seniors may be unprotected \nfrom escalating drug costs in regions without plan competition.\n  Here is the most recent picture of health care spending in the United \nStates: Health care spending in the United States increased 9.3 percent \nto $1.55 trillion in 2002, the largest increase in 11 years. It now \naccounts for 15 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product. \nPrescription drug spending rose 15.3 percent to $162.4 billion in 2002, \naccounting for 16 percent of the overall health care spending increase.\n  Spending on prescription drugs is often cited as a key contributor to \nrising health care costs. Unfortunately, the Medicare bill missed a \nsignificant opportunity to reign in the escalating cost of prescription \ndrugs in the U.S.\n  I believe the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Reduction Act will \nbring real prescription drug cost relief to seniors in California and \nacross the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S105-4", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S105-S106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE UNINSURED\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of the almost 44 \nmillion Americans who have no health insurance. This number has \ncontinued to grow--last year alone, the number of people who lost their \ninsurance grew more than any other year in the past decade. The number \nof uninsured Americans now exceeds the cumulative\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\npopulation of 24 states and the District of Columbia.\n  I know we can reverse this trend because we have done it in the past. \nDuring my first year in the U.S. Senate, I helped create the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Today, all 50 States have \nSCHIP programs covering millions of needy children who do not qualify \nfor Medicaid.\n  Last night in his State of the Union address, President Bush \nhighlighted the need to make insurance more affordable for working \nAmericans. I couldn't agree more. He also asked Congress to give lower-\nincome Americans a refundable tax credit to allow millions to buy basic \nhealth coverage.\n  Last year, the President's ten-year refundable tax credit proposal to \ncover the uninsured would have helped up to 14 million people with \nincreased access to care: 6 million previously uninsured Americans \ncould gain health care insuranced and 8 million could improve their \ncoverage.\n  This would be a great start. But we must act, and we must act now, \nbefore health insurance coverage erodes even further. Last year, \nCongress set aside $50 billion to cover the uninsured--less than in \nprevious years--and once again, Congress failed to act.\n  Helping provide health care for working families and children is not \na partisan issue.\n  Having access to health insurance is the best predictor of access to \nhealth care. Without access to preventive care, millions of people \nsuffer needlessly every year, and often require more expensive, less \neffective emergency care.\n  But suffering is only part of the equation. Eighteeen thousand \nAmericans die every year for lack of access to health care. That \ntranslates to two people dying every hour because they were uninsured.\n  I ask my colleagues to come together to help solve this problem that \nhas affected so many of our friends and neighbors. I ask my colleagues \nto make it a priority to preserve and expand access to health care \ncoverage in the United States, and I ask that we do it before the end \nof this Congress.\n  It is the right thing to do, and the right time to do it. Thank you, \nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S106-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S106-S107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BIOMETRICS--THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT IN ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, it has been brought to my attention that \nthe Department of Agriculture has put for comment their rules and \nregulations on animal identification, in particular beef. It is not \nunusual that by the time Federal agencies in today's environment get \naround to issuing their rules and regulations, or by the time Congress \npasses legislation, our technology has moved so quickly that those \nprovisions become outdated. I am concerned this could be happening with \nthe Department of Agriculture promulgating rules on the radio frequency \nidentification, RFID, tag in United States animal identification. It \nhas an internal code structure that identifies a specific bovine, but \nif something happens to the tag, there is no way of re-establishing the \nanimal's identification. That is, there is no way of re-establishing \nthe animal's identification unless another form of permanent \nidentification is obtained. That is why it is so important to discuss \nthe use of biometrics in animal verification, and more specifically, to \nfully explore the use of retinal scanning for identification purposes.\n  It is my understanding that the rules and regulations may exclude the \nuse of retinal scanning because the rules that the USDA is considering \ndo not address or allow the use of a ``secure permanent identifier,'' \nor at the least, they could be interpreted to discourage its use. I \nhave personally viewed such retinal scanning technology and believe \nthat it can be a practical way to identify individual animals, or lots \nof animals, and that this technology should not be put at a \ndisadvantage because of a policy position by the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  With the December 23 discovery of a cow infected with bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy, BSE, the United States faced a real-life \ntest of our animal identification and tracking system. Identification \nof livestock is very advanced in the United States, but even with our \nsystem, it took days to track that BSE-infected cow to Canada.\n  As part of our efforts to confront, control and eliminate the risk of \nBSE and to address future animal health emergencies, we should consider \nputting into place systems that can easily and rapidly identify an \nanimal and tell us where it has been. It must be able to tell us what \nanimals it has been in contact with and where those contacts are now. \nThe system should do this rapidly, securely and without error.\n  I commend the efforts of the USDA and industry who have been working \ntogether for some time to design a national animal identification plan. \nDuring the intervening period, new technologies have continued to \nemerge. As the USDA looks at implementing a national animal \nidentification plan, it is important that we utilize the best of \ntoday's technologies. For instance, a primary objective of this plan, \nas proposed, is to trace any animal within 48 hours. With the \ntechnology available to us in this country, we can be looking at \nsystems that can locate animals in minutes--not hours--with great \naccuracy.\n  To assure the American public and our export customers that we have \nnot lost track of any animals, the U.S. animal identification plan \nshould allow use of a secure, tamper-resistant image of the animal's \nretinal vascular pattern that is more unique than a human fingerprint. \nRetinal scanning identifies the animal, not the identifier. The \nmajority of the other animal identification systems work on the basis \nof adding an identifier to the animal, such as a visual or electronic \nmarker or tag and then recording that identifier. Identifiers like this \ncan be lost or changed and are not secure. Some estimates put livestock \ntag loss in the range of 5 to 8 percent--an unacceptable scenario when \nconsidering the ramifications that this could mean to the beef \nindustry.\n  I hope that the national animal identification plan does not preclude \nthe use of new technologies introduced since the plan's inception, \nespecially when these technologies exceed the proposed plan's \nperformance objectives. Several U.S. companies are not waiting for the \nUSDA, but are rapidly installing retinal imaging technology in their \nown plans to significantly improve their ability to track livestock. \nThese companies should not be forced to also adopt a poorer performing \ntechnology because the plan mandates a certain, specific technology.\n  It is critical that the plan's systems be audited for performance and \nreliability to verify that they are actually working. We must be able \nto measure and document how many animals are misidentified or lost. \nSince retinal scanning technology uses secure, tamper-resistant, \nretinal patterns, it is currently the only available method against \nwhich to verify the performance of any tag-based system.\n  We should be using the most current technology available--the Global \nPositioning System, GPS. By linking the Global Positioning System to a \nsecure identifier such as a retinal scan, the time, date, and location \nof the animal can be captured when the eye is scanned, proving beyond a \ndoubt that ``this animal was at this place at this time.'' Furthermore, \nthe use of GPS coordinates provides USDA with the means to audit and \nverify the accuracy of any identification numbering system.\n  The United States has the most competitive livestock sector in the \nworld. But we are at risk of falling behind countries in Europe, South \nAmerica, as well as Australia and New Zealand, nations that are all \nexploring more modern technologies for identifying and tracking \nlivestock. Not only can the U.S. take a leadership role in this area, \nwe can take identification and traceability ``off the table'' as a \npossible trade barrier by introducing technologies that leapfrog \nexisting country requirements.\n  I would like to close by reminding my colleagues that it is only when \nyou combine identity with location that you get traceability. And in \norder to build a secure, tamper-resistant system to trace livestock, \nyou must begin with a secure, tamper-resistant identifier. I believe we \nhave the technology to do this in a practical, economically feasible \nway that will allow United States producers to meet the concerns \nexpressed by our trading partners when\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nmanaging diseases like mad cow disease. I believe retinal scanning \ncombined with the GPS system can be the most practical option if the \npolicy of this country is to require an identification system of each \nanimal or even for tracing batches of live animals because it is \ntechnology that can be easily used in the field and is very accurate, \nreliable, and precise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S107-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING MISHAWAKA POLICE OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Madam President, I rise to support legislation that \nSenator Murkowski introduced last November that would bring some \nfairness to States such as North Dakota and Alaska with low \npopulations. I am proud to cosponsor S. 1851, the Small State HOME \nProgram Equity Act.\n  This legislation would increase the minimum funding level provided to \nlow-population States for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's HOME Investment Partnerships Program. The HOME Investment \nPartnership Program distributes funds to State and local governments to \nexpand housing for low-income families. It is one of the most important \ntools that States, local governments, and nonprofits have to respond to \naffordable housing needs. The program helps both renters and homebuyers \nacross the country by rehabilitating substandard housing and funding \nnew construction.\n  The HOME Investment Partnership Program has been enormously \nsuccessful in providing housing for those in need, and I have been a \nstrong supporter of annual appropriations for this important program. \nFor the last several years, I have joined many of my colleagues in \nsending a letter to Senators Bond and Mikulski, the chairman and \nranking member of the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, supporting robust funding for the HOME program.\n  Since 1992, the first year in which funds were appropriated for this \nprogram, HOME funds have been dispersed by a statutory formula, which \nis based in part on a State's population. At the time the program was \ncreated, a minimum funding level of $3 million was established for \nStates which would receive a small amount of HOME funds under the \nallocation formula.\n  Over the last 10 years, inflation has significantly eroded the value \nof this minimum allocation and it is very difficult for States to meet \ntheir housing needs on only the minimum allocation of HOME funds. In \nGrand Forks County in North Dakota, for example, the wait list for HOME \nrehabilitation funding is estimated to be 11 years. I would imagine \nthat the situation is similar in the 10 States that are not currently \nreceiving a level of funding that allows them to run effective programs \nwith their HOME dollars.\n  This is unacceptable. States with low populations deserve to have \nadequate funding to meet the unique housing needs of rural areas where \nconstruction and rehabilitation costs are often very high. The \ncongressionally appointed, bipartisan Millennium Housing Commission \nalso recognized this problem. It recommended increasing the minimum \nState funding level for the HOME program to $5 million in their May 30, \n2002, report to Congress.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski on this important \nlegislation to meet the housing needs of low-income families in rural \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S107-4", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S107-S108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARSHA GOODWIN-BECK\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I am saddened to \nreport that on December 18, 2003, our Nation lost one of its leading \nadvocates for the care of older veterans, Marsha Goodwin-Beck. The \nDirector of Geriatrics for the Veterans Health Administration from 1989 \nuntil her death, she dedicated her career to serving veterans in many \ncapacities.\n  Ms. Goodwin-Beck was instrumental in the growth and development of \nVA's nationally prominent Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical \nCenters, as well as its multidisciplinary geriatric training programs. \nShe also had a key role in coordinating the implementation of the \nVeterans Millennium Health Act of 1999, a bill that made an impact on a \ncountless number of our Nation's veterans. Ms. Goodwin-Beck began her \ncareer at VA in 1983 as an education specialist, later moving into \nvarious positions with the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care. In \n2003, VA recognized her long-time service on behalf of older veterans \nby awarding her the VA Undersecretary for Health Commendation.\n  As a testament to her expertise, Ms. Goodwin-Beck authored several \narticles on geriatric and long-term care issues. She also was active in \nlocal and national nursing organizations, including as a founding \nmember of the National Alliance for Caregiving, and she served on the \nEducation Committee of the Gerontological Society of America. Shortly \nbefore her death, Ms. Goodwin-Beck was elected to the national board of \ndirectors of the American Geriatrics Society.\n  Prior to her Government service, Ms. Goodwin-Beck had a distinguished \ncareer in clinical care as a certified adult nurse practitioner and \nnurse educator. Between 1981 and 1982, she was awarded a Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation fellowship as a primary care nurse practitioner at \nthe University of Maryland. Ms. Goodwin-Beck was also an assistant \nprofessor at Catholic University's School of Nursing and was on faculty \nfor the university's Teaching Nursing Home project. In addition, she \nwas a consultant to the American Health Care Association, coauthored \nthe book ``How to Be a Nursing Aide in a Nursing Home,'' and conducted \nworkshops on quality assurance for staff in nursing homes throughout \nthe country.\n  On behalf of the members and staff of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans Affairs, our hearts and thoughts are with Ms. Goodwin-Beck's \nhusband, Jeffrey\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\nBeck, and her entire family.

Biggs, from Hope, IN, who passed away \non December 2, 2003.\n  Mr. Biggs, known as ``Charlie'' to his numerous friends and \ncolleagues, was an invaluable asset to the State of Indiana, and will \nbe sorely missed in each community he worked so diligently to improve. \nCharlie taught at Hauser High School for many years as a music \ninstructor, and a band and choir director. He also owned and published \na local newspaper, the Hope Star-Journal. In addition, he was a member \nof the Hoosier State Press Association and a past president of the \nIndiana Democratic Editorial Association.\n  Charlie selflessly offered his remaining time to numerous \norganizations. He served on the Hope Volunteer Fire Department as an \nEMT, was a board member of the Heritage of Hope Foundation, was a \nmember of the St. Bartholomew Catholic Church, and even served for over \n30 years as the organist for the Hope United Methodist Church.\n  He is survived by his wife, Carol, four children, and seven \ngranddaughters. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, \nand colleagues during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S108-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S108-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a withdrawal and a treaty which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed in the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S108-4", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2006.

INVESTIGATIONS BY DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY \n                   DURING LABOR DISPUTES.\n\n       (a) In General.--When information is received by the \n     Department of Homeland Security concerning the employment of \n     undocumented or unauthorized aliens, consideration should be \n     given to whether the information is being provided to \n     interfere with the rights of employees to--\n       (1) form, join, or assist labor organizations or to \n     exercise their rights not to do so;\n       (2) be paid minimum wages and overtime;\n       (3) have safe work places;\n       (4) receive compensation for work related injuries;\n       (5) be free from discrimination based on race, gender, age, \n     national origin, religion, or handicap; or\n       (6) retaliate against employees for seeking to vindicate \n     these rights.\n       (b) Determination of Labor Dispute.--Whenever information \n     received from any source creates a suspicion that an \n     immigration enforcement action might involve the Department \n     of Homeland Security in a labor dispute, a reasonable attempt \n     should be made by Department of Homeland Security enforcement \n     officers to determine whether a labor dispute is in progress. \n     The information officer at the regional office of the \n     National Labor Relations Board can supply status information \n     on unfair labor practice charges or union election or \n     decertification petitions that are pending involving most \n     private sector, non-agricultural employers. Wage and hour \n     information can be obtained from the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor or the State labor department.\n       (c) Relevant Questions for Informant.--In order to protect \n     the Department of Homeland Security from unknowingly becoming \n     involved in a labor dispute, persons who provide information \n     to the Department of Homeland Security about the employer or \n     employees involved in the dispute should be asked--\n       (1) their names;\n       (2) whether there is a labor dispute in progress at the \n     worksite;\n       (3) whether the person is or was employed at the worksite \n     in question (or by a union representing workers at the \n     worksite);\n       (4) if applicable, whether the person is or was employed in \n     a supervisory or managerial capacity or is related to anyone \n     who is;\n       (5) how the person came to know that the subjects lacked \n     legal authorization to work, as well as the source and \n     reliability of the information concerning the subject's \n     status;\n       (6) whether the person had or is having a dispute with the \n     employer or the subjects of the information; and\n       (7) if the subjects of the information have raised \n     complaints or grievances about hours, working conditions, \n     discriminatory practices, or union representation or actions, \n     or whether the subjects have filed workers' compensation \n     claims.\n       (d) BICE Review.--There is no prohibition for enforcing the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), even \n     when there may be a labor dispute in progress, however, where \n     it appears that information may have been provided in order \n     to interfere with or to retaliate against employees for \n     exercising their rights, no action should be taken on this \n     information without review and approval by the Bureau of \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n       (e) Enforcement Action.--When enforcement action is taken \n     by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department \n     determines that there is a labor dispute in progress, or that \n     information was provided to the Department of Homeland \n     Security to retaliate against employees for exercising their \n     employment rights, the lead immigration officer in charge of \n     the Department of Homeland Security enforcement team at the \n     worksite must ensure, to the extent possible, that any aliens \n     who are arrested or detained and are necessary for the \n     prosecution of any violations are not removed from the \n     country without notifying the appropriate law enforcement \n     agency that has jurisdiction over the violations.\n       (f) Interviews.--Any arrangements for aliens to be held or \n     interviewed by investigators or attorneys for the Department \n     of Labor, the State labor department, the National Labor \n     Relations Board, or any other agencies or entities that \n     enforce labor or employment laws will be determined on a \n     case-by-case basis.\n\n     SEC. 223.

A bill to amend section 119 of title 17, United States Code, \nto extend satellite home viewer provisions; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my friend \nand colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, the Satellite Home Viewer \nExtension Act of 2004. We are pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenators DeWine and Kohl.\n  S. 2013 provides for a five-year extension of the statutory license \nfor satellite carriers to make secondary transmissions of ``distant'' \nnetwork and superstation television programs, which is set forth in \nsection 119 of the Copyright Act.\n  The current section 119 license permits satellite carriers to provide \nsubscribers that reside in unserved households with network programming \nfrom distant television markets. This section is set to expire at the \nend of 2004. The extension of this statutory license for an additional \nfive years would continue to serve the many interests that the section \n119 license seeks to advance. Most importantly, it assures that \ntelevision viewers incapable of receiving local network stations off \nthe air retain access to network programming via satellite. This is \nparticularly important for viewers who live in rural areas and may be \nunserved by either local stations or cable carriers. Indeed, many of my \nconstituents in Utah depend on satellite systems for their television \nreception. This statutory license also enables the satellite home \ndelivery industry to effectively compete with cable companies, which \nhave long enjoyed a statutory license of their own.\n  The limited extension also recognizes, however, that satellite \ncarriers are still in the process of making local signals available to \ntheir subscribers, an important development for viewers and local \nbroadcasters, as well as for the satellite carriers themselves. The \nSatellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, which I was proud to \nhelp draft, authorized for the first time the retransmission of local \nsignals to satellite subscribers residing in those local markets. The \nroll-out of ``local-into-local'' service by satellite carriers \ncontinues at a substantial rate, giving subscribers more choices than \never and further strengthening the competition between cable and \nsatellite carriers. In light of these continuing changes, an additional \nextension of the Section 119 license is warranted pending further \ndevelopments in this area.\n  I recognize that there are likely to be other issues relating to the \nsection 119 license that warrant consideration in connection with this \nreauthorization. I look forward to working with my colleagues and \nhearing from the interested parties on those matters in the coming \nmonths.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Hatch, \nas well as Senators Kohl and DeWine, in sponsoring the Satellite Home \nViewer Extension Act. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, which \nwe passed in 1999, established a statutory license for satellite \ncarriers to make secondary transmission of ``distant'' network and \nsuperstation television programs. That license will expire this year, \nhowever, so today's bill will extend that license, found in section 119 \nof the Copyright Act, for 5 years in order to ensure that the laudable \ngoals of the initial bill are fully realized.\n  The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act was the result of much work \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it enjoyed strong bipartisan \nsupport in both Houses of Congress. The license created in section 119 \nserves a very worthwhile purpose: it permits households that cannot \nreceive local network programming over-the-air to receive those shows \nby satellite. For the many viewers who are not served by local networks \nor cable companies--which is the case for a great many people in the \nrural areas of my home State of Vermont--this is absolutely critical. \nOf special importance is the fact that the Satellite Home Viewer \nImprovement Act permits the satellite transmission of ``local-into-\nlocal'' programming, so that satellite companies can retransmit local \nbroadcast signals to subscribers who actually live in the local market, \nbut cannot receive the broadcast signal. Providing the news and local \ninterest programming that is so vital to the creation and maintenance \nof a healthy and involved community has been the most gratifying result \nof the passage of that act. Furthermore, this license enhances \ncompetition by placing providers of satellite television programming on \nan equal footing with cable operators, which enjoy the benefits of \ntheir own statutory licenses.\n  Such important progress does take time, however, and the satellite \ncarriers have not yet made these local signals available to all their \nsubscribers. Although the provision of ``local-into-local'' programming \nis proceeding well, and although competition between cable and \nsatellite companies has been strengthened, there is still more to be \ndone before the goal of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act is \nfully realized. If we fail to reauthorize the section 119 license, \nsatellite programming may be unavailable as a real choice for many \nhouseholds, and many rural viewers will have little or no programming \nat all.\n  I look forward to working again with my colleagues on this important \nissue and to a speedy reauthorization of this important license.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 2014. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to establish \nreliability standards; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2015. A bill to prohibit energy market manipulation; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce 2 pieces of \nelectricity legislation--simple, common-sense bills that enjoy the \nbipartisan support of a majority of United States Senators.\n  First, I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues Senators Clinton, \nJeffords and Feingold the Electric Reliability Act of 2004. This \nlegislation would give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \nauthority to devise a system of mandatory and enforceable standards for \nthe reliable operation of our nation's electricity grid.\n  My distinguished friends from Wisconsin and Vermont, Senators \nFeingold and Jeffords, and I are also\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\ntoday introducing a second bill: the Electricity Needs Rules and \nOversight Now (ENRON) Act, which would put in place a blanket ban on \nmanipulative practices in our nation's electricity markets.\n  Enactment of these bills is long overdue. And in both cases, their \nprovisions have passed the United States Senate within the past eight \nmonths. They represent crucial steps forward in the effort to modernize \nour nation's electricity grid and reform the rules by which it is \noperated.\n  Quite simply, these provisions are too important to be held captive \nto the majority's effort to pass H.R. 6-- the energy bill conference \nreport. Resembling a patchwork quilt of special interest hand-outs--\nrather than a policy that would help this nation achieve energy \nindependence--H.R. 6 capsized under its own pork-laden weight on this \nvery floor, a mere two months ago.\n  Rather than holding good energy policy hostage for the bad--as those \nwho seek to resurrect that 1,700-page legislative monstrosity have said \nthey intend--I believe this body can and must make necessary progress \nin upgrading our electricity grid and protecting our nation's \nconsumers. That's what the two bills I'm introducing today are intended \nto do.\n  As surely my colleagues recall, much of the Northeast and Midwest \nlast August suffered a massive power outage, affecting 50 million \nconsumers from New York to Michigan. Clearly, the biggest blackout in \nour nation's history has underscored the need for mandatory and \nenforceable reliability standards--as envisioned in the Electric \nReliability Act of 2004. To date, the system has operated under a set \nof voluntary guidelines, with no concrete penalties for those who break \nthe rules and jeopardize the reliable energy service that is the \nfoundation of our nation's economy.\n  While the August 2003 blackout was certainly a potent reminder, the \ncall for reliability legislation dates back at least another five \nyears. In 1997, both a Task Force established by the Clinton \nAdministration's Department of Energy and a blue ribbon panel formed by \nthe North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) determined that \nreliability rules for our nation's electric system had to be made \nmandatory and enforceable.\n  These conclusions resulted, in part, from an August 1996 blackout in \nthe Western Interconnection, where the short-circuit of two overloaded \ntransmission lines near Portland, Oregon, caused a sweeping outage that \nknocked out power for up to 16 hours in ten states. The blackout \naffected 7.5 million consumers from Idaho to California, resulting in \nthe automatic shut-down of 15 large thermal nuclear generating plants \nin California and the southwest--compromising the West's energy supply \nfor several days, even after power had mostly been restored to end-\nusers.\n  As outlined in Economic Impacts of Infrastructure Failures, a 1997 \nreport submitted to the President's Commission on Critical \nInfrastructure Protection, the blackout was estimated to exact between \n$1 billion and $4 billion in direct and indirect costs to utilities, \nindustry and consumers. The report also detailed the risks the outage \nposed to public health and safety, including an exponential increase in \ntraffic accidents, hospitals forced to rely on emergency back-up power \ngeneration, and the grounding of more than 2,000 airline passengers.\n  While it took time to develop consensus, the Senate recognized the \nhuman and economic stakes associated with the reliable operation of the \nelectricity grid. Stand-alone legislation very similar to what I've \nintroduced today passed this body in June 2000, when this chamber was \nunder Republican control. And even as the majority has twice changed \nhands since then, the United States Senate has twice passed the very \nprovisions included in the Electric Reliability Act of 2004 as part of \ncomprehensive energy legislation--most recently, this past summer.\n  Likewise, the Senate has previously passed the provisions contained \nin the ENRON Act, which Senator Feingold and I are introducing today. \nOffered under the agreement that last July cleared the way for Senate \nLeadership to replace the then-pending Republican energy bill with the \n107th Congress' Daschle-Bingaman legislation, the ENRON Act was adopted \nas an amendment to the Senate's Fiscal Year 2004 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill, on a strong, bipartisan vote of 57-40.\n  The ENRON Act is simple in concept. In the face of overwhelming \nevidence that Enron and other unscrupulous energy companies brazenly \nmanipulated western energy markets during the crisis of 2000-2001, it \nwould amend the Federal Power Act to put in place a blanket ban on such \nactivities.\n  It has been estimated that the western energy crisis cost the \nregion's consumers and businesses $35 billion in domestic economic \nproduct--in other words, a 1.5 percent decline in productivity and a \ntotal loss of 589,000 jobs. After experiencing a devastating blow that \nexacerbated the already-crippling national recession, consumers in my \nstate--who continue to pay the price for the unethical gamesmanship of \nthese companies--know that our economy simply cannot abide another \nEnron.\n  Thus, the ENRON Act is based on language included in the Securities \nExchange Act--in existence since 1934. This bill would make it illegal \nfor any company to ``use or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive \ndevice or contrivance'' to circumvent FERC rules and regulations on \nmarket manipulation. Further, it would specify that electricity rates \nresulting from manipulative practices are simply not lawful. In other \nwords, when companies are known to have gouged consumers--in some \ncases, even admitting as much--those same consumers should not be stuck \nwith the inflated energy bills that result.\n  As Congress and various Federal agencies have over the past few years \nsought to piece together the events that led to the western energy \ncrisis--the most devastating energy market meltdown in our Nation's \nhistory--a number of agencies and officials have weighed in on the \nissue of market manipulation. In addition to simple common sense, their \nstatements underscore the need for the ENRON Act. For example: FERC in \nMarch 2003 issued its Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western \nMarkets. The voluminous FERC report found that: ``Enron's corporate \nculture fostered a disregard for the American energy customer; the \nsuccess of the company's trading strategies, while temporary, \ndemonstrates the need for explicit prohibitions on harmful and \nfraudulent market behavior and for aggressive market monitoring and \nenforcement.'' The General Accounting Office (GAO) in August 2003 \nissued a report entitled Additional Actions Would Help Ensure that \nFERC's Oversight and Enforcement Capability is Comprehensive and \nSystematic. Among GAO's observations: ``The heads of [FERC's] market \nmonitoring units told us they recognize the difficulty of defining just \nand reasonable prices. They also said that they believe FERC has made \nsome progress in doing so. However, they generally believed that FERC \nhad not yet gone far enough.'' GAO further concluded that: ``we \nrecommend that the Chairman of FERC more clearly define [the \nCommissions] role in overseeing the Nation's energy markets by . . . \nexplicitly [describing FERC's] activities relative to carrying out the \nagency's statutory requirements to ensure just and reasonable prices \nand to preventing market manipulation.'' Republican FERC Commissioner \nJoe Kelliher wrote the following in a November 5 letter to me, just \nprior to his confirmation: ``Markets subject to manipulation cannot \noperate properly and there is an urgent need to proscribe manipulation \nof electricity markets. You have correctly noted there is no express \nprohibition of market manipulation in the Federal Power Act and have \nproposed legislation to establish an express prohibition. This is a \ncritical point. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission only has the \ntools that Congress chooses to give it, and Congress has never given \nthe Commission express authority to prohibit market manipulation. I \nbelieve the time has come for Congress to take that step.'' In the same \nletter, Kelliher goes on to note that, ``This is not to say that the \nCommission cannot take steps to prevent market manipulation under its \nexisting legal authority . . . Since there would likely be legal \nchallenges to any such effort to proscribe manipulative practices, it \nwould be helpful for Congress to give the Commissioner clear\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\nauthority to prohibit market manipulation . . . I support the goals of \nyour amendment'' [to the Agriculture Appropriations bill, which \ncontains the same provisions as the ENRON Act] ``and believe it would \ngo far towards effectively prohibiting manipulation of electricity \nmarkets.''\n  Recent events have clearly demonstrated the need for both the \nElectric Reliability Act of 2004, as well as the ENRON Act. On the \nother hand, the case is far less compelling for many of the provisions \nfound in the H.R. 6 conference report. It's not just unpersuasive to \nargue that a 21st Century energy policy must include: liability \nprotections for manufacturers of the groundwater pollutant MTBE; the \nweakening of landmark environmental laws such as the Clean Air, Clean \nWater and Safe Drinking Water Acts; and billions of dollars worth of \nsubsidies, most infamously, taxpayer-backed bonds for construction of \nan energy efficient mall including a Hooters restaurant, it's absurd.\n  When the Senate last July agreed to send a comprehensive energy bill \nto conference with the House, few anticipated that we would get back a \ngrab-bag of corporate give-aways so bloated that editorial pages from \nevery corner of this Nation, from Yakima to Pensacola; Texarkana to \nHonolulu, would call on this body to put H.R. 6 out of its misery. Nor \ndid many of us believe that common-sense legislation such as the ENRON \nAct--with broad, bipartisan support in the Senate--would be so quickly \njettisoned by the conference report's authors.\n  Make no mistake: many of us in this chamber emphatically believe that \nwe need an energy policy that will liberate this country from its \ndangerous dependence on foreign sources of oil and position our \nbusinesses to compete in the emerging global market for clean energy \ntechnologies. But to paraphrase my distinguished colleague from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, who has been a great leader on these issues, \nthis Nation needs an energy bill, but certainly not this energy bill.\n  So today, we are introducing the Electric Reliability Act of 2004 and \nthe ENRON Act, because it's time for this body to put the public \ninterest ahead of the special interests poised to profit so handsomely \nfrom the passage of the energy bill conference report. We should take \nup and pass these individual pieces of legislation, which would mark a \nsubstantial achievement in the effort to upgrade the reliability of our \nNation's grid and insulate our economy from the disastrous impacts of \nlatter-day Enrons.\n  In last night's State of the Union speech, President Bush observed \nthat ``consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to \nmake our economy run.'' I could not agree more. He also urged Congress \nto ``pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote \nconservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of \nenergy.'' Nowhere in his address did President Bush mention tax breaks \nfor Hooters; I did not hear him invoke rollback of environmental laws \non behalf of polluters; nor did he cite the need to put in place \nprotections for corporate looters such as Enron--all those provisions \nthat have become the hallmark of the energy bill conference report.\n  So I ask my colleagues to recognize that we can make measurable \nprogress this year on the objectives the President has outlined. But \nthat will happen not by holding good energy policy hostage for bad \nenergy policy, as the authors of H.R. 6 would have it. Rather, it will \nhappen when we agree to set aside the H.R. 6 conference report and pass \ncommon-sense, consensus-based energy policy. And both the Electric \nReliability and ENRON Acts fit this description.\n  I ask my colleagues to support these bills.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Cantwell, \nJeffords and Feingold in introducing legislation that would create \nmandatory, enforceable reliability standards for our electricity \nsystem.\n  Last week was the five month anniversary of the worst blackout in the \nhistory of New York, and, indeed, the history of America. Congress has \nyet to pass electricity reliability legislation that would help ensure \nthe blackout never happens again. There is strong support for this \nlegislation, which has passed the Senate twice before as part of the \nenergy bill. But with the energy bill stalled, we simply cannot afford \nto wait any longer to move on reliability standards.\n  The blackout had a tremendous impact on New Yorkers and on the \neconomy. Some experts put the costs to New York at more than $1 billion \ndollars and the costs nationwide at more than $6 billion.\n  In November, the Electric System Working Group of the United States-\nCanadian task force on the blackout released its draft report on the \ncauses of the blackout. Among the report's findings was that the North \nAmerican Electric Reliability Council's (NERC) voluntary reliability \nstandards were violated at least six times during the series of events \nthat led to the cascading blackout. This finding reinforced the need \nfor swift enactment of mandatory, enforceable electricity reliability \nstandards. We clearly need a system that provides real accountability \nfor failure.\n  New Yorkers, and all Americans, are relying on Congress to help \nprevent another blackout. Congress needs to move swiftly on legislation \nin this area so that rules can be put in place before this summer. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining the Senator \nfrom Washington, Ms. Cantwell, and the Senator from New York, Mrs. \nClinton, as an original cosponsor of legislation to ensure the reliable \ndelivery of electric power in the United States. This bill is similar \nto Title I of the S. 1754, the Electric Reliability Security Act of \n2003, that I introduced last October in response to the Northeast \nblackout.\n  Last night, in his State of the Union, the President urged Congress \nto pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote \nconservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of \nenergy. This bill, the Electric Reliability Act of 2004, addresses the \nPresident's request, and the Senate should pass it expeditiously. Our \ncountry needs the new, clear national rules of the road contained in \nthis bill to ensure the reliable delivery of electric power.\n  As the people in the Northeast will not soon forget, in August 2003 \nnearly 50 million people were affected by a massive power outage. But \nthis is not an isolated incident. On January 16, 2004, Gov. James \nDouglas urged Vermonters to save power to help avert rolling blackouts \nbecause of electricity problems in southern New England. Though there \nwas likely enough power to meet my State's demand, but we are part of a \nregional grid system. This system, as we learned last year, needs to \noperate in a coordinated fashion or the region faces blackouts.\n  The Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, whose State was so \nsignificantly affected during the Northeast blackouts, knows well the \nhardship long electricity outages cause. I am pleased that she and the \nSenator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, have joined in this effort. The \nSenator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, has been alerted to the need for \nreliability legislation well before last year, as her State suffered \nduring the massive multi-state Western blackout of 1996.\n  Be it 1996, 2003 or last week, these events emphasize the \nvulnerability of the U.S. electricity grid to human error, mechanical \nfailure, and weather-related outages. Congress needs to do all that is \nnecessary to protect the grid from devastating interruptions in the \nfuture. Those who know this issue well, say that reliability \nlegislation is essential. On the first day of this year, Michehl Gent, \nPresident and Chief Executive of the North American Electric \nReliability Council, said in the New York Times that all of the actions \ntaken by industry and oversight organizations to respond to the \nNortheast blackout do ``not reduce the need for Federal legislation \nthat would provide authority to impose and enforce mandatory \nreliability standards.'' He continues, ``whether legislation is adopted \non a stand-alone basis or as part of a comprehensive energy bill, \npassage is essential. If reliability legislation had been enacted when \nfirst proposed, I believe that the blackout would not have occurred.''\n  Given that Congress has not passed grid reliability legislation, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission decided during its December 17, \n2003 open\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\nmeeting to have its staff develop an order over the next few weeks \nrequiring utilities and other jurisdictional entities to report \nviolations of voluntary reliability standards set by the North American \nElectric Reliability Council. The Commission also asked for comment on \nits legal authority under existing statutes to mandate compliance with \nthose standards.\n  Why is Congress making FERC waste time trying to determine whether \nthey have the legal authority to act to protect consumers and ensure \nelectric reliability? We should simply make that statutory authority \nclear. Reliability legislation has passed the Senate twice, and this \nbill asks the Senate to act on those same provisions again. Congress \nshould establish mandatory reliability standards and close other \nregulatory gaps left by state deregulation of the electricity sector. \nWe should pass this bill now, and I pledge my support to the Senators \nfrom Washington and New York, Senators Cantwell and Clinton in doing \nso. Given the high costs of power outages to our country, we cannot \nafford to do otherwise. I invite my colleagues to join us in our \nefforts to advance energy security and reliability in the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/21/senate-section/article/S121-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 285--RECOGNIZING 2004 AS THE ``50TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n                             ROCK 'N' ROLL\n\n  Mr. FRIST submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I wanted to say, while my counterpart is \non the floor, that we in the minority have appreciated the way Senators \nMcConnell and Frist have handled legislation that has been on the \nfloor. We don't agree as to what comes to the floor a lot of times, but \nthe majority, with rare exception, has given us the opportunity, when a \nmatter is brought up, to talk about it, offer amendments, and then give \nus reasonable time to determine if in fact cloture needs to be invoked \non a bill. We appreciate that.\n  In the rush of things this year, we are going to go out of session on \nJuly 26 until the fall. We are going to be in a position of wanting to \ndo things more quickly than we would ordinarily. I hope the majority \nwill stick with what happened last year. I think it worked out well. I \nthink our people felt that we were treated fairly, with some \nexceptions. There is going to be a tendency to push things more quickly \nthis year and it will make things go even more slowly. In short, we \nhave a lot of work to do. By following the Senate rules, I think we \nwill get more done than not following the rules.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me say to the assistant \nDemocratic leader that I thank him for his kind observations. I think \nhe is absolutely correct. We have a very limited number of days this \nyear upon which to accomplish anything. It is going to require a high \nlevel of bipartisan cooperation to advance measures that are essential \nto the country, which we all, for the most part, agree on--not to \nmention items that may be more contentious.

I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of \nthe Department of State with respect to this Additional Protocol.\n  My Administration has already forwarded to the Senate a similar \nAdditional Protocol for Romania and expects to forward to the Senate \nshortly Additional Protocols for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. Each of these Additional \nProtocols is the result of an understanding the United States reached \nwith the European Commission and six countries that will join the \nEuropean Union (EU) on May 1, 2004 (the Czech Republic, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the Slovak Republic), as well as with \nBulgaria and Romania, which are expected to join the EU in 2007.\n  The understanding is designed to preserve U.S. bilateral investment \ntreaties (BITs) with each of these countries after their accession to \nthe EU by establishing a framework acceptable to the European \nCommission for avoiding or remedying present and possible future \nincompatibilities between their BIT obligations and their future \nobligations of EU membership. It expresses the U.S. intent to amend the \nU.S. BITS, including the BIT with Bulgaria, in order to eliminate \nincompatibilities between certain BIT obligations and EU law. It also \nestablishes a framework for addressing any future incompatibilities \nthat may arise as European Union authority in the area of investment \nexpands in the future, and endorses the principle of protecting \nexisting U.S. investments from any future EU measures that may restrict \nforeign investment in the EU.\n  The United States has long championed the benefits of an open \ninvestment climate, both at home and abroad. It is the policy of the \nUnited States to welcome market-driven foreign investment and to permit \ncapital to flow freely to seek its highest return. This Additional \nProtocol preserves the U.S. BIT with Bulgaria, with which the United \nStates has an expanding relationship, and the protections it affords \nU.S. investors even after Bulgaria joins the EU. Without it, the \nEuropean Commission would likely require Bulgaria to terminate its U.S. \nBIT upon accession because of existing and possible future \nincompatibilities between our current BIT and EU law.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this Additional Protocol as soon \nas possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification at an \nearly date.\n                                                      George W.
