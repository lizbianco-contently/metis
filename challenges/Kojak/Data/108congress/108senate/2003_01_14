Today's prayer will be offered by the \nguest Chaplain, Dr. Richard Roth of Falls Church, VA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                                 PRAYER\n\n  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:\n  Standing in Your presence on this winter morning, Gracious God, we \naffirm with our forefathers that You have not only created us, but You \nsustain us each day. So with the psalmist of old, we proclaim, ``This \nis the day that the Lord has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.''\n  Our Senators will face again today matters of such import that \ndifferences and conflict will be natural. In this arena, where vision \nand reality collide freely, may clear heads prevail. We are grateful \nfor the freedom to challenge ideas and debate issues and for that \nfreedom, we will rejoice and be glad.\n  This moment in history weighs heavy in this chamber and around \nCapitol Hill, so we ask for wisdom beyond experience and a fresh touch \nof Your grace. In a world on edge, as diplomats talk and warriors make \nready in the pursuit of needed security, we pray that a peaceful \nresolution will come. With hope in our hearts, Lord, we submit \nourselves to You. You are now and forever our Prince of Peace. For Your \npresence among us we will rejoice and be glad.\n  In Your Holy Name, we pray. Amen.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. This morning I would like to ask the \ndistinguished assistant minority leader to lead us in the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S249-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Harry Reid led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S249-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today there will be a period of morning \nbusiness until 12:30 p.m., with the time equally divided and Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Last night, I closed saying that I remain hopeful an agreement can be \nreached as soon as possible with respect to the committee resolution \nwhich, very simply, allows us to proceed with Senate business and with \nappointment of our committees and the chairmen.\n  Again, as I mentioned last night, I want to put my colleagues on \nnotice that if we are unable to reach accord in a short period of time, \nit will be my intent to begin consideration of the resolution. Again, \nit is very simple. It just names the chairmen and the Republican \nmembers of the committees. In addition, the appropriations process for \nfiscal year 2003 absolutely must be completed.\n  Members should be aware that the Senate will finish these matters or \nit will be necessary to return after the holiday on Monday and be in \nsession through next week. I mentioned that last night in closing. But \nagain I want to make sure my colleagues understand that we have two \nmatters that are of critical importance to the fundamental organization \nof this body, No. 1; and, No. 2, on the appropriations bills that are \nthe unfinished business from last year, we have an obligation to the \nAmerican people to complete.\n  As the negotiations progress over the course of the morning--and, \nagain, discussions continued well into the evening last night and began \nearly this morning--as those negotiations progress, I will advise the \nSenate about the day's schedule.\n  Rollcall votes are, therefore, possible each day this week, including \nFriday, and it may be necessary to begin to have late evenings until we \ncomplete the appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\n  I think we could make real progress over the next several minutes and \nthe next hour. But if not and if, in my judgment, we are just at a \npoint where our business comes to a halt, it is important that we come \nforward on the floor of the Senate with the resolution on those \ncommittees.\n  I think we will have a productive day today. I am optimistic that we \nwill. We have negotiated in good faith over the last week and a half. \nNow is the time to get on with the Nation's business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was listening intently. But when does the \nleader think he would bring this resolution up, if we can't work \nsomething out?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, my intention is to review it with everybody \nwho has been involved in the negotiations over the next several minutes \nor hour. But it is time for us to move ahead. So, very shortly. I \nhesitate to do so, to be very straightforward, because the overall \nnegotiations have gone very well, and I did not in any way want to \ninterrupt those negotiations. But at this point I am receiving phone \ncalls from our colleagues, including the 11 freshmen, who, even if we \nmet right now with committees, are simply not on those committees and \nare asking: What do we do? We came here. We were elected with the \nmajority, and we are not on committees. We are not allowed.\n\n  It is incumbent upon me to get to it sometime very shortly. It may be \nthis afternoon. It may be this morning. But sometime today we need to \nbring to a head the very simple Republican resolution to appoint \nchairmen, which we ratified on this side, and to appoint committees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my only suggestion to the leader would be \nthat I think it would be in the best interests of all if we at least \nwaited until the party caucuses so our leader and the majority leader \ncould explain to their folks what the end might be. But we will await \nthe decision of the leader. I will report to Senator Daschle \nmomentarily.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, I am trying to have discussions in \ngood faith. If in the next hour or hour and a half it is clear to me \nthat no progress is being made--because by the time we have the policy \nluncheons, that will be 2 o'clock, and by the time we get back out \nhere, it will be 3 or 4, and in essence we have lost a day. I do not \nwant to make any commitment. I understand. That is why day after day I \nhave not gone public, and I appreciate the Democratic leadership doing \nthe same. But now all our colleagues are recognizing that our \nresponsibility is to the United States of America and to this body, and \nwe simply cannot leave next week with these things pending.\n  If I wait until tomorrow or the next day before we bring this to a \nhead, it will be clear that we are going to be here every single day. \nRight now, I think we have a chance. If we can do the committee \nresolution today--this morning--I think we can very quickly go to the \nappropriations process, the committee will be organized, and we can \nconsider that legislation. Because so much work has already been done, \nwe could, in fact, complete this and be able to have the recess that we \ninitially planned. But if it is not done this morning or early this \nafternoon, I don't see how we will be able to do it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, certainly we understand the difficulty in \norganizing. When the majority changed a year and half or 2 years ago, \nit took us 6 weeks to work this out. I certainly hope it doesn't take \nthat long this time.\n  I also say both Senator Daschle and I yesterday indicated we agree \nwith you that if we cannot complete our business this week, we should \nstay in next week. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee and \nSenator Byrd need to finish these bills, and they cannot do that if we \nare not in session.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request \nwhile the majority leader is on the floor?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I put us into a quorum call. I ask unanimous consent that \nduring this morning business time that we have, the quorum calls be \nequally divided between both sides and not be charged against the party \nwho asks for it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are now in morning business?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are now in morning business.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will speak for a period of time in \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S250-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S250-S252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ORGANIZATION AND THE SENATE'S BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I was pleased to see the minority whip and \nour majority leader on the floor a few moments ago, as I was viewing \nthe floor from my office, hoping that an organizational resolution had \nbeen completed, that negotiations that had been underway now for nearly \n2 weeks as to the organization of the Senate might bring us to a state \nwhere the Senate could begin to work.\n  Obviously, the American people have spoken very loudly in the last \nseveral months about the need to get our work done as it relates to \nboth the economy, the risk of war, and certainly the ongoing business \nof Government. And they spoke out loudly on November 5 as to who ought \nto be running the Senate. I think they would expect that transition, in \na peaceful democratic system, would go smoothly and that we could be in \nthe business of running the Senate. That simply has not happened to \ndate.\n  I served, at the privilege of the majority leader, as chairman of the \nCommittee on Committees. My task was to call all the Senators and get \nthem fitted into the new committee structure and to recommend that kind \nof shaping for the ongoing business of the 108th. That work was \ncompleted well over a week ago. The majority leader urged me to get it \ndone as soon as possible after the first of the year. Why? Because of \nthe history of the Senate, that most organizational resolutions that \nget our Senate working occur usually in the first week of January, so \nwe can be immediately at the people's business, so we can be \nimmediately examining budgets and spending resolutions, and begin the \nwork of shaping a budget for our Government to operate.\n  That simply has not happened. Why has it not happened?\n  I think the best evaluation of it appeared in the Wall Street Journal \neditorial yesterday, called ``Daschle's Election Lesson.'' Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 13, 2003\n\n                       Daschle's Election Lesson\n\n       So much for the theory that Democrats lost the Senate in \n     November because they had obstructed President Bush's agenda. \n     Judging by Tom Daschle's behavior so far this year, the new \n     Senate minority leader has concluded that the lesson of their \n     drubbing is that Democrats weren't obstructionist enough.\n       Only a week into the new Congress, the Daschle Democrats \n     are already in full-throated opposition, assailing every \n     White House idea and starting up the 2004 election campaign. \n     Mr. Daschle's response to the President's tax cut hasn't been \n     merely that it's wrong or helps ``the rich,'' but that it's \n     ``obscene.'' (Tom, what are you going to say when you really \n     don't like something?)\n       Democrats are also already vowing to defeat Mr. Bush's \n     judicial nominees, even if it takes filibusters that let a \n     mere 41 Democrats define Senate ``advice and consent.'' \n     Yesterday Mr. Daschle said the renomination of Charles \n     Pickering Sr. ``lays bare the Administration's real position \n     on civil rights'' and ``exposes the Southern strategy \n     clearly.'' Ah, racial harmony.\n       This same goodwill embrace is also being extended to new \n     GOP Majority Leader Bill Frist. Despite a bipartisan deal \n     last week to pass unemployment benefits by unanimous consent, \n     Democrats sandbagged Mr. Frist on the floor by demanding more \n     cash than the deal had called for. Hillary Clinton was seen \n     giving orders on this ambush on the Senate floor. While the \n     original deal ultimately passed, the vote was an omen of the \n     Democratic strategy.\n       Which seems to be to use every opportunity to bollix up the \n     Senate works. That\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\n     includes even delaying the handover of their majority status. \n     Every new Congress requires ``organizing resolutions,'' but \n     Democrats have threatened to filibuster the Senate version \n     unless they get virtually the same committee and staff \n     funding as the majority.\n       Some of this haggling is understandable, but the demand for \n     50/50 funding is absurd. The historical split has typically \n     been two thirds/one-third regardless of the Senate breakdown. \n     Last Congress's division of 55/45 was the exception, because \n     it began with the parties split 50/50, and Democrats only got \n     to 51 midterm after Jim Jeffords defected to get a committee \n     chair. Republicans have now won an election, and Democrats \n     know the majority needs more funding because it has the duty \n     of actually running the Senate.\n       Conveniently, any organizing delay allows Democrats to \n     continue as committee chairmen, slowing the Republican start. \n     Joe Lieberman, who is supposed to be the former chairman of \n     Governmental Affairs, sent out a notice saying that he'd \n     preside over this week's confirmation hearing for Tom Ridge, \n     nominated to run the new Homeland Security Department.\n       This would mean a nice photo-op for the soon-to-be \n     Presidential candidate, but it's an insult to Maine \n     Republican Susan Collins, who should be running the \n     committee. The White House pulled Mr. Ridge at the last \n     minute to deny Mr. Lieberman his chance to knock the \n     Administration around, but this only delays Mr. Ridge's \n     ability to get on with the job.\n       No doubt the Senate will organize, but the shenanigans \n     portend a nasty two years. Democrats are understandably sore \n     about losing their majority, but rather than undertake some \n     introspection they're jumping right back to the barricades. \n     They apparently figure they can obstruct Mr. Bush's agenda \n     and voters will blame Republicans who are supposed to be in \n     control.\n       Maybe, but we seem to recall that's similar to the argument \n     they made last year. Max Cleland and Jean Carnahan can \n     testify from private life to how well it worked.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. What the editorial in the Wall Street Journal said was \napparently the former majority leader had not learned a lesson, that in \nthe obstructionist character by which he operated the Senate for the \nlast 18 to 20 months--that lost him the majority in the Senate, that \ndenied us a budget and 11 appropriations bills, that denied us Medicare \nand prescription drugs, that denied the American people a great many \nthings that not only was the President promising but the Senate and the \nHouse were working under--he should have learned a lesson; that he \nshould be here helping facilitate the process of helping this Senate to \nmove forward.\n  That has not happened. Why? I guess they don't realize they lost the \nmajority; that somehow they are now in the minority, and it is the \nresponsibility of them, in this Democratic process, to work with us to \nmake our Government function appropriately. It has always happened that \nway in the past, but it isn't happening that way today.\n  Over the last week, the negotiations, which I have not been a part of \nbut certainly which have been reported to me, largely say: We want \neverything we had last year. But they were in the majority last year. \nAre they entitled to everything they had last year? No. There is a \nclear historic precedent that said the majority always got two-thirds \nof the funding to operate the committees and to cause this system of \nthe Senate to function, and the minority got one-third.\n  It changed during the 107th because of the 50-50 relationship. And \ncertainly, when I was asked, I would say that in a relationship like we \nhave today, 51-49, with 1 independent, we could be more flexible than \njust 66 or one-third, two-thirds. But to suggest that they have \neverything they had last year, in helping set the agenda of the Senate, \nif that is what their position is, then the tactics they used in the \nlast Senate, that gave them the minority in the new Senate, are being \nemployed once again.\n  I know why they are doing it and why they think they can get away \nwith it in this business, because it is inside ball, it is inside \npolitics. The American public does not register with them. When we \nstart talking about committee funding and staffing, that is of little \ninterest to an American who is out of work, to a senior who is paying \n$400 or $500 a month for his or her prescription drugs. They want those \nproblems solved and they want them solved now. And while, in many \ninstances, we cannot move that quickly, it certainly is our \nresponsibility to move.\n  The Presiding Officer at this moment is the new chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He and his staff have been working for weeks \nto move the 11 appropriations bills that fund Government through this \nsystem, and it has not happened. Why? Because he has not been given the \nauthority, even though he is in the majority, to do it. Why? Because \nthe former majority leader, now the minority leader, has simply blocked \nit.\n  The editorial I put in the Record from the Wall Street Journal, I \nthought, said it well in the closing paragraph:\n\n       No doubt the Senate will organize--\n\nand we will. And we may see that debate over a final resolution begin \ntoday--\n\n     but the shenanigans--\n\nsome that I have just referred to--\n\n     portend a nasty two years. Democrats are understandably sore \n     about losing their majority, but rather than undertake some \n     introspection they're jumping right back to the barricades. \n     They apparently figure they can obstruct Mr. Bush's agenda \n     and voters will blame Republicans who are supposed to be in \n     control.\n       Maybe, but we seem to recall that's similar to the argument \n     they made last year.\n\n  And then they go on to talk about certain Senators who lost their \nelection. Maybe that message was not as obstructed from the American \npeople as some of us might have believed it was.\n  The Senate is not working today. And the reason the Senate isn't \nworking is because the minority leader, the Democrat leader, is doing \neverything he can to block it from working. It is simple. It is \nstraightforward. And I believe my comments are very honest.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator is making an excellent point, and it \ngoes beyond just the question of the operation of the Senate. It really \ngoes to the constitutional form of government we have.\n  We have a constitutional democracy in this country. One of the key \nelements of constitutional democracy is that after there is an election \nin which one party is succeeded by another party in power, that \ntransfer of power occurs smoothly and seamlessly. That has been the \ntradition in this country for over 200 years. Yet now we see the other \nside of the aisle insisting on maintaining their chairmanships after \nthey have lost the majority. That flies in the face of the concept of a \nconstitutional form of government, does it not?\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think the Senator from New Hampshire is straight on. \nWhat we are talking about is that peaceful transition of power, when \nyou are no longer in the majority and it is the responsibility of the \nnew majority to form a Congress, and that is what you do every 2 years \nwith a new Congress.\n  This is the 108th Congress that we are now forming. I think the point \nof the Senator is made, which is that the Democratic Party is now in \nthe minority and are still holding chairmanships and therefore refusing \nto allow committees to function on the whole, and to allow the \nmajority--now Republicans--to shape the committees, bring staff on \nboard, and establish the agendas. And what is most critical at this \nmoment is to finish the work that was left undone in the last Congress.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and I know, and certainly the Senator \nfrom Alaska who is in the chair at this moment knows, one of the single \nmost important tasks we do every year is pass 13 appropriations bills \nto fund the Government. That is the budget of the U.S. Government. It \nis not just dollars and cents. It is policy--where you spend it, how \nyou spend it, how much you spend, what it gets, programs that are \ndiscontinued, programs that are expanded. A budget is absolutely \ncritical, and the funding of that budget is, in essence, the operations \nof the Government.\n  Yet last year the Congress was not able to perform, not able to pass \nthose 13 appropriations bills. Why? Because of this Senate denying the \nCongress the time and the opportunity to move forward to get that done. \nWe had hoped we could come back in and, during the month of January, \nmove expeditiously to complete those 11 appropriations bills left \nundone, get those policy messages and spending messages out to the \nagencies that are clearly affected so that Government would run as we \nare expected to ask it to run. Of course, that is really what is being \ndenied at\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nthis moment by our inability to organize, the inability of the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee--now presiding--to move forward. Yes, \nwe have been working.\n  Right now, we should not be debating an organizational resolution on \nthe floor or hoping we can debate it; we ought to have the omnibus \nappropriations bill on the floor with those 11 bills in it. That is \nwhat the debate of the day and the work of this week ought to be.\n  I hope the minority leader and the Democrats who serve in the Senate \nrecognize that the game they play may be inside politics, but more and \nmore of us are going to be talking outside the inside trying to reflect \nto the American people that, as the Wall Street Journal said, the \nshenanigans being played are to man the barricades and use \nobstructionist tactics to stop the Senate from moving and--I think the \nSenator from New Hampshire said it so clearly--in essence deny us the \ndemocratic process.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield further.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is a significant point. We have had a number of \nextraordinarily enlightening discussions on this floor involving the \nhistory of the Senate and the history of the Senate in the context, for \nexample, of the Roman Senate. If you look at the history of this Senate \nand at the history of legislative bodies similar to the Senate, when \nthere has been a sliding away from the traditional transfer of power as \na result of an election; when there has been a sliding away from that, \nthat is when crisis has occurred. I know the Senator who was often \ngiving us extraordinary statements and information on the issue of the \nRoman Senate, and he would probably have to concede that the Roman \nSenate--if I may refer to that body as the precursor of ours--really \nfell into disrepair and became a nonfunctional body when Caesar refused \nto abide by the Roman Senate and stepped on the authority of the Roman \nSenate and took away its authority and didn't acknowledge its elective \nrole.\n\n  The only time in our history when we have not had a transfer of power \nthat has occurred as a result of an election, when the right of an \nelection has been superseded, was in the Civil War, and there were \nextenuating circumstances for why that occurred. It occurred in the \nMaryland Legislature, to be specific. So this decision by the other \nside of the body to retain their chairmanships in the face of an \nelection which has removed them from them, because the majority has \nshifted, sets a precedent which has immense impact, potentially, on the \nway this body functions as a reflection of a democratic government.\n  So before the Democratic side of the aisle continues down this \ncourse, I think they need to think about what they are doing. Are they \ndamaging the integrity of our process, of the elective process, by \ncontinuing to insist that they remain in power when they have lost \npower through the election? That is what this is about. They want to \nretain power even though they lost power through the elective process. \nI think the Senator has touched the issue rather effectively. I suppose \nit can be understated, but I don't think it is.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me conclude because I see another colleague on the \nfloor who wishes to speak. I am going to serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee this year, along with several colleagues, for a lot of \nreasons, but primarily to move judges into our Federal court system \nthat now lacks 150 seats. That third branch of Government isn't \nfunctioning largely because of the denial to move the President's \nnominees through in this past 18 to 20 months. We have seen that going \non. Yet we are now being told that 41 Senators will filibuster, and \nthat that simply won't happen if they don't get what they want.\n  The role of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in this instance \nfits well into that advise and consent role that we play with the \nexecutive. My colleague from New Hampshire was talking about \nconstitutional authority and constitutional responsibility and the \ntransition, if you will, in a democratic process. Our job is to advise \nand consent. Our job is to review the President's nominees, and I hope \nwe can bring every one of them to the floor for an open-ended debate--\nnot to filibuster; that would be precedent-setting, but to have a \ndebate and have an up-or-down vote. That is what the American people \nexpect of us and they should demand it, and I hope the hue and cry from \nthe hinterland becomes very loud in the next few months if the \nprocesses are denied simply by an obstructionist tactic of refusing to \ngive up power when the electorate has spoken.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, I had the great honor of being elected \nby the people of Alabama to a second term this year. I traveled hard \nall over the State. I travel to every county every year in my State. I \nwas out this past year talking with the American people and listening \nto what they had to say. I have a sense of what they are concerned \nabout, what they want to see done, what they thought their vote meant.\n  They were, I believe, tired of politics as usual, political logjams, \nobstructionism. They wanted us to move forward, work together, and put \nthe interest of the United States and the people first. They think we \nfocus too much on parties and political interests. Certainly, sometimes \nwhat may appear to individuals as a petty political party dispute \nreally has significant policy impact for the country and the world, but \nthe truth is that many times that is not so. Many times, the American \npeople are correct that politics interferes and overcomes our \nresponsibility to serve the people of the United States. Sometimes the \ndebates we have here are indeed ``insider baseball,'' as some would \nsay. It reveals personal pique, pride, and sometimes plain \nobstructionism.\n  After the election, when the majority changed in the Senate, just \nordinary people would grab my arm as I went about and they would say to \nme--and I have told others this, and they have said it in almost these \nsame words--Jeff, maybe you can get something done now.\n  I think the message of this election was the American people wanted \nus to get the work done. I believe that strongly.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for a number of years. I know the \nPresiding Officer has been a lawyer for a number of years. I remember \nthe story--it has different versions--about a jury that had been out a \ncouple of days. The judge was getting a little worried about them. He \nasked them how they were doing, and they reported: Fine, Your Honor, we \njust elected a foreman.\n  How much time do we have to piddle around with organizing \nresolutions? The situation with which we are struggling today is \ncritical. We must pass an organizing resolution for this Senate. It is \nimportant because nothing much is going to happen in this body until we \ndo. New Senators cannot even be assigned to committees until this \norganizing resolution is adopted. We can do better.\n  The Senate has been in session over a week. We still have not adopted \nthe organizing resolution. The new majority leader, Senator Bill Frist \nfrom Tennessee, has a reputation of working across the aisle, of being \nable to bring together people with different views, and he is a good \nand nice person. He desires a bipartisan resolution that is fair to \neveryone, but I think it would be a mistake for Members of this body to \nbelieve that because he desires to be fair and he desires to reach \nacross the aisle, he is just vulnerable to being pushed around; that \nthey can insist no changes occur in their vision of how this body ought \nto be organized, and they will just sit back and refuse to let the \nbusiness of the Senate go forward until that happens. I believe that is \nwrong.\n  The majority leader is going to be open, but he will not capitulate \nand change the historic procedures that have guided the Senate over the \nyears. Frankly, there is a reason on the financial end of this \norganizing resolution for the majority party to have additional \nresources. That reason is the majority has to chair the committees, and \nthe chairman has to move the agenda of the committee. Not only\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\ndoes the chairman have to chair the committee, but each committee has \nsubcommittees. Armed Services, of which I am a member, and Judiciary, \nof which I am a member, have four, five, six subcommittees, and each \none of those subcommittees the last 2 years has been chaired by \nDemocratic chairmen, as well as the chairman of the committee being \nDemocratic. Now those subcommittees will be chaired by Republicans who \nhave the burden of moving the legislation forward and moving an agenda \nforward.\n\n  It is historic that the chairmen and the majority on the committees \nhave had a higher degree of financial support than the minority.\n  There is a lot of work for us to do. This last Congress, which I \nsuggest raised obstructionism to a high art form, was a failure by any \nobjective analysis. It is little wonder its failure led to a change in \nthe majority in this body.\n  For example, for the first time in nearly 30 years, we did not pass a \nbudget. This was a signal failure that symbolized the ``my way or no \nway'' attitude of the past Congress leadership.\n  We failed to pass a prescription drug plan. Why? Because the \nDemocratic leadership insisted on a bill that would spend twice what we \nhad budgeted the year before. We had budgeted $300 billion for a \nprescription drug plan. But, oh, no, it had to be twice that. Some \nsuggested that had to do with politics. Some suggested there was a \nconcern on behalf of the leadership--and I hope this is not true--that \nif a bill passed, the President would get credit and the Republicans \nwould get credit, and they did not want them to get credit. I hope that \nis not true.\n  I do know I was prepared to vote for a bill that even exceeded that \n$300 billion which would have created a prescription drug plan that had \ntripartisan support, but it never went forward to be passed.\n  Then there was the homeland security issue, really an amazing issue. \nThe President of the United States, in response to an attack on the \nhomeland of the United States and after careful evaluation, concluded \nwe needed to reorganize our Government to get those departments and \nagencies that function to protect our homeland security together in one \nagency so they could work together in an effective way to be more \nefficient and more productive in protecting our homeland.\n  It was a big deal. He proposed that resolution, and what happened? \nSome of our Government union friends--and I used to be a Government \nemployee; I know and respect many of those members--wanted to use the \nhomeland security bill as leverage to maneuver into the law provisions \nproviding benefits to their workers that were not even in current law. \nWhen, in fact, we were trying to create an agency that was more like a \nmilitary agency--with a higher degree of responsiveness required than \nthe normal agencies--no, they wanted to make sure there were even \ngreater protections than existed at the time for workers.\n  The President said: What I need is flexibility, please, Senate. His \nbill passed the House. He said to the Senate: Please give me some \nflexibility; I have to move people; I have to be able to protect and \ndefend the homeland of America. Don't tie this up by politics of \nspecial interest. He urged us not to do so. We debated and debated, and \nit was obstructed week after week, and then we took his case to the \nAmerican people on election day, and the American people spoke. They \nsaid: We are tired of obstructionism. We want a bill. We want homeland \nsecurity, and we want it now. A few weeks ago in December when we were \nin a lame-duck session, the homeland security bill passed quickly, and \nthe leadership on the other side of the aisle capitulated to the \nchanges the President wanted. It was a complete victory for the \nPresident because the American people spoke on that issue.\n\n  Another one of the more amazing failures of this past Congress was \nour utter inability to pass the appropriations bills. This Government \ncannot function; no Government agency can spend a dime that has not \nbeen appropriated by the Congress. So each year we have a burden to do \nour jobs before the beginning of the fiscal year in October and pass \nappropriations bills. We work on that every year. Sometimes we do pass \nthem on time, and sometimes we are a few weeks late and have to do a \ncontinuing resolution, but we normally get the appropriations bills \ndone. Not this year. By October 1, we had not done our job. By the time \nwe recessed and by the time the Senate reconvened in a lame-duck \nsession in December, we still had not passed 11 of the 13 \nappropriations bills necessary to organize this Government. And they \nstill have not been passed.\n  We need to be moving on those bills now. In fact, what we really need \nto be doing right now is preparing for the 2004 fiscal year that will \nbegin in October. That is what we should be doing. But what are we \ndoing? We are still working on those appropriations bills that did not \npass last year. It is a historic failure because of the obstructive \ntactics that occurred in this Chamber. We should have done better. \nThere is no excuse for that failure. But I really overstate the matter. \nWe are not formally working on that now in any significant way because \nwe do not even have committees. We do not have committees because the \nother side thinks just like they did with homeland security; that going \nforward and moving the agenda is so important they can demand and \nextract from Senator Frist concessions they would not otherwise get \nunder these circumstances. I do not believe that is healthy.\n\n  I hope Senator Frist will reach across the aisle and do what he can \nto accommodate legitimate concerns, but I do not think he should be \npushed beyond what he thinks is right. I do not think he should be \nshoved around where he concedes things that are not part of the \nhistoric traditions of this Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I do not know if they have mules in \nSouth Carolina. I suspect they still do. I conclude by these remarks: \nIt is said that one way to get the attention of a mule is a 2 by 4 \nacross the head.\n  We had an election this past year, and I believe a critical part of \nthat election dealt with the question of obstructionism in the Senate. \nThe 2 by 4 has been delivered. I was proud to be sworn in, as I know \nthe present occupant of the Chair was proud to be sworn in as the \nsuccessor to Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. There were 35 \nSenators sworn in. Twenty-two of them were Republicans. That is a \npretty good 2 by 4 against those who believe obstructionism is the \nproper tactic.\n  Some on the other side think their lack of success in this election \nwas not due to obstructionism. They think their lack of success was \nthey were too cooperative, and they are being encouraged to fight even \nharder this time. If that is so, we are in for a long, difficult year, \nand that is why I am troubled by this extraordinary delay. It has gone \non day after day, everybody thinking day after day it will be settled. \nIt has not been settled yet.\n  So are we going to now start a year of partisanship and \nobstructionism on every issue? I hope not. I believe we need to settle \nthis matter now, and I want to be clear and say I think Senator Frist \nis doing everything possible to be fair and to work out this \ndifficulty, and that once that is done we will move forward and we will \nhave a successful Senate term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have listened to the remarks of my \ncolleague from the State of Alabama very closely and carefully, and I \nhave a very simple suggestion of three words for the organizing \nresolution, and the three words are: Do unto others.\n  What the Democrats are proposing as an organizing resolution, in a \n51-49 Senate, is exactly what the Democrats proposed to the Republicans \nwhen we had 51 votes and the Republicans had 49. We said, this is such \na close division of control in the Senate we are going to offer \nresources which historically had never been offered to a minority but \nwe felt that it was only fair, and here is what we said: We will give \n55 percent of the resources to run the\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\nSenate to the majority party, in that case Democrats who had 51 votes, \nand 45 percent of the resources to the Republicans. And the Republicans \nsaid: thank you. That is fair. That is just. We accept it.\n  Along comes an election and two Senate seats change, and guess what. \nNow the Republicans are in control with 51 votes, and this fair and \njust approach of running the Senate is now being rejected.\n  I am hearing from the Senator from Alabama that we do not understand \nthe mandate of the American people says we are not going back to this \nfair allocation of resources--no, no, no. Two-thirds of the resources \ngo to the Republicans and a third to the Democrats. Democrats get fewer \noffices, fewer staff, fewer people working for them, and the fact the \nDemocrats gave the Republicans 45 percent of the resources when they \nhad 49 votes, forget it, those days are over.\n  We are trying to, as the Senator from Alabama said, run over Senator \nFrist. No, we are offering to Senator Frist, the new majority leader, \nexactly as a proposal what we offered to the Republicans when they were \nin the same situation.\n  Our organizing resolution is simple: Do unto others. We are asking \nthe Republicans to be as fair to us as we were to them, and they have \nrejected it.\n  My colleague has come to the floor today and said we are being \nunreasonable. I do not think so. When it came to allocating the \nresources of a closely divided Senate, we gave to the Republican \nminority of 49 Senators an extraordinary allocation of resources, a \nfair allocation of resources, and they do not want to see that happen \nagain.\n  In talking about this last election, it was truly an historic \nelection. The fact that the President's party would increase the number \nof seats in the House and the Senate is history making, and the \nRepublicans deserve credit for that. Their party was successful in its \ncampaign strategy, but to suggest that two Senate seats represent a \nrevolution in thinking to the point where we can cast aside all of the \nfair allocations which we decided would be part of the future of the \nSenate is unreasonable to me. Why can't we play by the same rules?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am glad to acknowledge the Senator and allow him to \nspeak on Republican time, but I want to maintain the 10 minutes I was \nallocated as part of morning business. I do not think that is unfair.\n  What we are suggesting is exactly what we gave to the Republicans and \nnow they cannot stand it. They cannot stand the thought we would end up \nwith 45 percent of the resources.\n  On the outside, people say, why are we haggling over 45 percent or 50 \npercent? Well, it comes down to people and staff who are working on \ncommittees, who are trying to process and evaluate bills so we can have \na lively and informed debate, and the Republicans want to deny us those \nresources, the same resources we offered to them. I do not think that \nis fair.\n\n  As for this organizing resolution, make it simple, three words: Do \nunto others. Have the Republicans do unto us what we did unto them in \nexactly the same circumstances. They say they cannot live with that. It \nreally tells the whole story.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the failure of the last Congress, \nwhich the Senator from Alabama has addressed. It was breathtaking to \nhear his analysis of what happened over the 15 or 16 months when the \nDemocrats were in control, how terrible it was, how things could not \nget done. He talked about the homeland security bill, and I remember \nwhen the Senator from Texas, Phil Gramm, came to this floor and tied up \nthe Senate for 6 weeks and would not pass the homeland security bill \nbecause he would not allow an amendment to be called for a vote. For 6 \nweeks he held up the Senate, which can be done. This is the greatest \nplace in the world to get nothing done, and we do a lot of it. The \nrules are designed so that nothing is done. Senator Gramm knew the \nrules and the Republicans knew the rules. Time and again they \nestablished the roadblocks and stopped the bills we wanted to pass.\n  Homeland security was a classic example. It got so bad that my former \ncolleague, Max Cleland of Georgia, a triple amputee Vietnam veteran, a \nman I was proud to count as a colleague and friend, was attacked during \nthe course of his Senate campaign for not being patriotic. He is a \ntriple amputee Vietnam veteran, and they said in the campaign he was \nnot patriotic because he would not go along with the Republican \nposition on homeland security. To me, that represented the depths of \ncampaigning in America, the absolute worst, and that is what we faced \nin the last election.\n  It is a tough business. This is not a bean bag. One has to expect \ngive and take in this business. It is part of it. But that really \nrepresented the bottom as far as I was concerned, and that is what we \nare up against.\n  On prescription drugs, we came up with a proposal which said make it \nvoluntary, make it universal, make it under Medicare so seniors have a \nchance to pay for their drugs. Who opposed it? The drug companies. Know \nwhy? Because if the Federal Government, under Medicare, offered this \nprogram we would bargain with the drug companies to bring down their \nprices.\n  They did not want to do that. That would cut into their profits. They \nsupported the Republican version of their bills which basically gave \nthe seniors little or nothing, and then turned around, and if people \ndid not believe who they were supporting, look at the money they spent \nin the election--tens of millions of dollars in support of Republican \nCongressional candidates who supported their point of view, that \nbasically said consumers in America will keep paying the highest prices \nso the profit margins to these drug companies can be as high as they \nhave always been. That was the whole story in that debate.\n  Frankly, when I hear the Senator from Alabama blame the Democratic \nSenate on the failure of the appropriations process, I might remind him \nthe appropriations bills originate in the House and they could not get \nstarted. We passed two bills. There were 11 appropriations bills that \ndid not pass, and still have not passed. They could not pass them out \nof the House because they could not reconcile the Republican caucus in \nthe House. They put that blame on Senator Daschle and the Democrats. We \ncould have done a better job. I wish we had. Frankly, some of those \ncriticisms are weak and wrong.\n\n  Now a word about the President's stimulus package. Is it not \ninteresting that the former Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, \nsaid yesterday that had he continued on as Treasury Secretary, he would \nhave not supported President Bush's stimulus plan: I would not have \ndone it, Paul O'Neill said. I can understand why. When you look at this \nplan, you see there are three fundamental problems. It is not a \nstimulus plan. To get the economy moving, do something now. Give people \nspending power.\n  There are a lot of working families in Illinois and across the \nNation. With a few more dollars, they would spend on goods and \nservices, creating demand, creating jobs, creating opportunity. No way. \nThis Bush approach is going to defer most of the money that will be \nspent for an extremely long period of time. Look at what the \nPresident's stimulus package does in the first year: 12 percent of the \nmoney he is proposing to be spent in the first year, $110 billion; over \na 10-year period of time, $933 billion. This is not an economic \nstimulus. If it were, you would focus on the first year, as the \nDemocrats have, put the money in the first year, get the economy moving \nagain.\n  I live in a State now No. 3 in the Nation for unemployment. I cannot \nimagine that this has happened, but it has. In Illinois, there is 6.7 \npercent unemployment. We have lost over 20,000 manufacturing jobs in \nthe last 12 months. The President says all the stimulus should come in \nyears to come. What about the people losing their jobs today? Don't we \nwant to put them back to work? Not under the President's plan.\n  The second problem is the nature of the tax breaks. They are \nfundamentally unfair. I believe this, fundamentally, when it comes to \ntax law: The majority of the tax benefits should go to a majority of \nAmericans.\n  I have heard Republican Senators--one from Pennsylvania--say: Don't \nyou understand? A third of the workers in America do not pay taxes.\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\n  Hey, wake up. These people are paying payroll taxes every week.\n  Oh, he just meant income taxes. What difference does it make if they \nare taking it out of your paycheck? That is what is happening to the \nworkers who are being ignored by the President's proposal, ignored by \nthe Republican majority in this Chamber.\n  Look at these benefits: Typical middle-income taxpayers, adjusted \ngross incomes up to $38,000--that is at the lower end of middle income, \nI am sure--$265 a year under President Bush's proposal for tax breaks. \nNow look at those with incomes over $1 million a year: Under President \nBush's proposal, those making over $1 million a year will get almost \n$89,000 in tax breaks. Think about that. When a citizen has $80,000 in \nincome a month coming in, how big a difference in your life is $89,000?\n  Somebody said the other day in one of the articles, the President is \nstanding up for minorities in America. Sure, the minority being \nmillionaires.\n  Why in the world are we not standing up for the working people across \nthis country? In my State and across the Nation, they are struggling to \nmake ends meet. They are trying to pay the bills. These are folks who \nhave seen their retirement income shrinking. If they are members of \nlabor unions, they have seen their pension benefits threatened. \nStruggling working families in America are people who need tax breaks \nas well.\n\n  Take the cost of health insurance. What do you think about that? Have \nyou paid any attention to what is happening, whether you are small \nbusiness, large business, or labor union? It is breaking the bank. In \nmy State, construction workers with good jobs, with good paychecks, \ncome to me and say: Another year has gone by, we have $1.50 more an \nhour under our contract, and I don't see a penny of it in take-home \npay; it is being gobbled up by health insurance.\n  At General Electric, the employees called a strike because of the \ncost of health insurance.\n  And the President is saying, let's not worry about those folks, let's \nworry about the millionaires and give them $89,000 in additional tax \nbreaks. Why in the world are we not giving tax benefits to help working \nfamilies and small businesses cope with the real expenses of life?\n  My colleague, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, has a proposal, \nwhich I cosponsor, which allows the deductibility of college education \nexpenses. That just makes sense to me. A new couple with a new baby, \nand you go see them and say: Looks like his dad. Looks like his mom. Is \nhe sleeping at night? Are you starting to save money for college for \nthis little baby? The first thing that comes to mind: You know how \nexpensive it is. Why in the world, if we are talking about tax breaks \nto help people, to spark the economy, aren't we talking about things \nlike that--breaks for small businesses to offer health insurance, \nbreaks for families so they can pay for their kids' college education \nexpenses, reductions in the payroll tax that would help every single \nAmerican across the board. No way.\n  When this President takes a look at it, he cannot even see those \npeople. The only people he sees are those making $1 million a year; \n$89,000 in tax breaks for them. That is not fair.\n  Let me tell you about something that troubles me greatly. Not only \nare the President's tax breaks unfair in terms of whom they help--not a \nstimulus, because they do not take place in the first year--the thing \nthat troubles me greatly is we are returning to that era of deficits in \nAmerica that we had under Presidents Reagan and Bush and the first few \nyears of President Clinton: Red ink as far as the eye can see.\n  When you ask the Bush Cabinet, Aren't you worried about the deficits \nyou are going to create with this tax program the President is \nproposing, they say that deficit is ``manageable.'' Manageable--$350 \nbillion in deficit?\n  Let me tell you what we are doing. We are betraying two generations \nwith the President's economic stimulus package. The first generation we \nare betraying is the baby boomers who within a few years are going to \nshow up for Social Security and Medicare. For their entire lives, as \nlong as they have worked, they have dutifully paid every single hour of \nevery day of work into the Social Security trust fund with the \nunderstanding that when they were eligible for Social Security, it \nwould be there and Medicare would be there. But the President's \nproposal is taking money--in this case, $933 billion over 10 years--out \nof the Social Security trust fund, just at the baby boomers are looking \nfor their benefits. At a time when the largest number of retirees come \nin, President Bush is taking more money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund to make it more difficult to meet our obligation. Will we \nmeet it? We will, but at the expense of everything else in our \nGovernment--at the expense of education, at the expense of prescription \ndrugs, at the expense of helping families pay for their basic education \nneeds and basic needs of their family. These are the topics central to \nthis debate.\n\n  The second generation we are betraying is our children. President \nBush's proposal betrays the generation of our children. Why do I say \nthat? They have to pay off this debt. All this money that we are \nborrowing at this point in time in our history has to be paid back, or \nat least interest on it to service it over the years. The Republicans, \nfiscal conservatives, watchdogs of the Treasury, are digging us into \nthis deep deficit of red ink so we can give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in America. How can that make sense?\n  Let me add another perspective. This is a time when usually a country \ncinches its belt, takes a view toward reality, and is prepared to \nsacrifice. We are in the midst of a war on terrorism.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 7 minutes afterwards.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Reserving the right to object, is there an order \nestablished right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Is the Senator from Alabama asking consent--is part of \nthe unanimous consent request--I see the Senator from Vermont is here. \nI ask the Senator from Vermont if he wants to add his time to the \nunanimous consent request, and I request 15 minutes after the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If you want to proceed, that is fine with me.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I refer to the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from Alabama wishes to \nspeak. Is that right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Following the Senator from Illinois. And then following \nthat, the Senator from Vermont wishes to speak for how long?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And then the Senator from Minnesota wishes to speak for how \nlong?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Chair, do the Democrats, with our allotment of \ntime, have that much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent, then, that the Senator from \nAlabama be recognized following the statement of the Senator from \nIllinois; then the Senator from Vermont be recognized for 5 minutes; \nthen the Senator from Minnesota for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying the following: \nOn the organizing resolution, the Republicans should offer to the \nDemocrats exactly what we offered to them under the same allocation of \nseats in the Senate, 51-49, Democrats over Republicans. We offered to \nthe Republicans 45 percent of the funding for the Senate and they took \nit and said, thank you; that's only fair. That is all we are asking for \nnow. It is not unreasonable.\n  Second, the President's economic stimulus package is not a stimulus \nbecause most of the benefits do not occur in the first year. It is not \nfair because most of the money is going to people in the highest income \ncategories. And it is reckless in terms of the deficits it is creating \nfor this generation of baby boomers who are going to need Social \nSecurity and for our children who will have to ultimately pay for this \ndebt.\n  The final point I make is this. At a time of national sacrifice, \nfacing a war on terrorism and the potential of at\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nleast one other war in some other part of the world, we are allocating \ntax cuts and deeper deficits instead of saying to the American people: \nStand with us; take care; let us go through this time of crisis \ntogether and then as the economy is restored we will stand together and \nprosper together. Instead, we are saying: Tax cuts for everybody--as \nlong as you are wealthy in America.\n  That is not the best approach to get America moving again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I strongly disagree with the \ncharacterization of the President's stimulus package as stated by the \nSenator from Illinois. He is a great advocate and eloquent spokesman \nfor his values and views, but I don't agree with that analysis.\n  The problem we are dealing with today is that it does little good to \nbe talking about stimulus packages, war, or other matters when we can't \nget the Senate organized. He challenged some of the statements I made \nand I want to talk about that a little bit.\n  First, it is indisputable that the last Congress was marked by \nobstructionism and failure. We produced no budget for the first time in \nthe history of the Budget Act, almost 30 years. No budget was passed. \nWe were not under a budget. It is a historic failure of monumental \nproportions.\n  Mr. President, 11 of the 13 appropriations bills that should have \nbeen passed by October 1 of last year remain unpassed. This Government \ncannot operate, cannot spend money not authorized by Congress. So we \nare at this moment unable to even take serious steps toward passing \nthese appropriations bills from last year when the Senator's leadership \nwas in control because we can't get the Senate organized.\n  Homeland security was held up interminably, over nothing more than \nlabor issues, driven by the other side. After the election, the \nPresident got exactly what he wanted. The other side capitulated on \nthat because they were not sound objections. They never were. And the \nAmerican people didn't appreciate it, and they knew it, and the bill \npassed.\n  There were a lot of bills that failed last year that should have \npassed had we met each other halfway. Let me tell you how that year \nstarted. This is important.\n  Two years ago the Senate was 50-50. That changed when the \ndistinguished Senator Jeffords made a decision to change last year. But \nwhen it began, it was 50-50. The Republicans had an effective majority \nbecause the President of the Senate was Vice President of the United \nStates, Dick Cheney, and he would have broken the tie on these matters. \nIn an effort to work in a bipartisan way, Trent Lott agreed to \nsomething never before agreed to. He agreed to basically a divided \nSenate financing and an organization that was historically favorable to \nthe Democrats, because we were at a 50-50 deal, and he wanted to work \nin a bipartisan way the last 2 years, in the last Congress. That was a \nbig step, to not fight but to reach an accord. Some criticized him for \nthat but he did that.\n  In the course of that agreement, somebody said: Well, what happens if \nthe majority changes in this year? We don't know that is going to \nhappen, but over every 2-year period often things change that you do \nnot expect. So the agreement was reached that if the majority changed \nand the Democrats achieved a majority and got 51 Senators, then the \nfunding would remain the same for the Republicans so we would not have \ndisruption in the middle of that Congress. That was the agreement \nreached. When Senator Jeffords made his change--and he remained as an \nIndependent but he organized with the Democrats and they had 50 \nDemocrats and 1 Independent to organize and elect Senator Daschle the \nmajority leader--then the funding continued as we had agreed months \nbefore when the original resolution was agreed to.\n  That is what happened. That is how it is that it came out that the \nfunding ended last year the way it did. It was not as if the Democrats \nmade a great concession. In fact, Trent Lott made the concession. As \npart of that agreement that they worked out, they worked out how it \nwould continue throughout that Congress, and that is what happened.\n\n  Now we are here in a situation in which every committee is chaired by \nRepublicans, every subcommittee is chaired by Republicans, and we are \nback into the normal historical deal where you have a majority in the \nSenate--whether it is 51, 52, 53, or 54--and the majority needs \nfunding. The majority needs other capabilities to operate the Senate so \nwe can pass our appropriations bills; so we can pass a budget; so we \ncan move legislation that needs to be moved.\n  So it is just not right to say this plan that Senator Frist is \nworking on to return to the historic way that we have organized this \nSenate throughout our lifetimes, and perhaps even more, is somehow \nunfair and not legitimate. It is the way we organized and the way we \nought to organize this time.\n  So I hope we do not start this Congress with this kind of spat. I \nknow Senator Frist has, for days now, been working to reach an accord \nwith which people can be familiar. I think there are some who think if \nthey keep shoving it, the crisis in our agenda is so important that \nSenator Frist will just give in. I think he will be cooperative and \nreach out, but there is a limit as to how far he can and should go. I \nknow he is not going to capitulate and give in to an unhistorical way \nto divide the leadership in this Senate and to accept a resolution of \norganization that is not consistent with our traditions and the needs, \nfrankly, of this body.\n  I hope this will be worked out. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, briefly, I remind those who don't \nremember that my decision to change parties came about on the basis of \neducation and education funding, not what we have been discussing \nrecently. At that time, the budget had left the Senate with $500 \nmillion to be made available for education--maybe $450 million. But \nwhen it came back out of conference it was zero, absolutely zero.\n  It was at that point, in order to impress upon this Nation the \nimportance of education and to show my disagreement with my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, I decided I would change over such that \nthe Democrats would have control of the budget process and that we \nwould not suffer the horrendous cuts which were proposed in education.\n  I would say right now we are still on that issue. The most critical \nproblem we have in this Nation right now is education. I will discuss \nthat now and try to put some light on the difficulties we are having.\n  Usually in times of war the question of national priorities is summed \nup with a simple phrase: Guns or butter. But today, I fear that the \nchoices aren't that simple. Perhaps it is time that we retool that \nphrase and ask ourselves, will it be guns or butter, tax breaks or \ntextbooks?\n\n  As the threat of war dominates our front page headlines and as we \ntalk about stimulating our economy with billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks, I was astonished when I turned to an inside page of the New \nYork Times last weekend and read the headline, ``Schools Ending Year \nEarly Among Efforts to Cut Costs.''\n  If I may quote from that story:\n\n       Fourth-grade students in Portland, OR will not read about \n     their State's history in their social studies classes, nor \n     will they study the metric system in math class, nor will \n     they study electricity in their science class.\n\n  That is because some schools in Portland will be forced to slash more \nthan a month from their school calendars this year because the money \nhas run dry.\n  And Oregon is not alone in this crisis.\n  In California, Oklahoma--all over the country--schools are having to \ncut millions of dollars and they expect even deeper cuts in the year to \ncome.\n  Schools are cutting janitors, cafeteria workers and substitute \nteachers in an effort to keep their classrooms in tact. One teacher \ndescribed it as ``death by a thousand cuts.''\n  In my home state of Vermont, there is talk of whether a 4-day school \nweek would be an option.\n  This all comes on the heels of last week's celebration of the 1-year \nanniversary of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\n  Somthing is dreadfully wrong with this picture, and if we don't \naddress this now, the consequences will be with us for generations to \ncome.\n  What kind of a nation have we become that we put so little value on a \nschool day? Every school day is sacred. It is an opportunity to expand \na child's horizons, an opportunity to help a child build new \nrelationships, an opportunity for a child to learn.\n  Our Nation's public schools cannot overcome the obstacles they face \non the cheap. We might pride ourselves as being a superpower, yet we \nlag dangerously behind our counterparts in our commitment to fund \neducation.\n  Of the major industrial nations, the United States ranks among the \nlowest in funding education at the Federal level, providing only seven \npercent of the costs. This figure pales by comparison when you look at \nour overseas competition.\n  Other nations hold their teachers in the highest regard, and \ncompensate them accordingly. We do not.\n  I laud the efforts of the administration to boost Title 1 funding for \nthe poorest schools, but the one billion dollar increase this year is \nstill far short of the mark.\n  And I once again remind everyone in the Chamber of our failed promise \nto fund 40 percent of our schools' special education costs. We made \nthat promise more than a quarter of a century ago. It is shameful that \nwe have fallen so short.\n  In other nations, students spend far more time in classrooms than \nthey do in the United States.\n  In China, the average school year is 250 days. In Europe, students \nspend an average of 190 days a year in the classroom.\n  In the United States, we are down to 180 days, and that number is \nlikely to fall as school budgets are slashed, as we see happening today \nin Oregon.\n  We cannot, and we should not, stand idly by while our schools \nstruggle without enough money to do their jobs. This is a national \ndisgrace.\n  I understand that there are many priorities facing our Nation, \nperhaps too many for what our recessionary budget can afford.\n  But when we consider guns and butter, we must not allow textbooks to \nslip to the bottom of the list. The security of our great Nation is at \nrisk, and the threat is right here at home.\n  We must act responsibly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was listening with some amazement to the \ndiscussion last night and earlier today about the reorganization, who \nis to blame, and who has the interests of the American people at heart. \nI have been kind of astonished at the reworking of the present reality \nand the past history by my Republican colleagues.\n  I am reminded that when I arrived at the Senate 2 years ago, I waited \nfor 5 weeks to receive my committee assignments. We had, as others have \nsaid, a 50-50 split then, and the Republicans, because of the Vice \nPresident, had the majority. But it was unprecedented. So there was \nsome reason for this delay. But then when Senator Jeffords moved over \nto caucus with our party in June of that year, I lost my committee \nassignments for the next 6 weeks while once again this agreement was \nnegotiated.\n  Contrary to what I have heard from others across the aisle, it is my \nunderstanding that an agreement was reached for when the Senate was 50-\n50, and we had a provision that the agreement would end if and when the \nmajority in the Senate moved to one side--not that it would remain the \nsame for that entire session of Congress.\n  I had no committee assignments for 6 weeks while this split of 51 to \n49 was being renegotiated, despite years of precedence and how we were \ntold the Senate should be organized and how funds were distributed when \nthe Senate was in clear majority by one side or another.\n  Those who are today shedding crocodile tears for their colleagues who \nare denied committee assignments certainly were not at all visible 2 \nyears ago when I was waiting for those 6 weeks for my committee \nassignments to be reinstated.\n  I don't propose that our side should act as irresponsibly as others \ndid 2 years ago. In fact, I am told that many of the chairs and ranking \nmembers of the various committees, as they will be reestablished under \nRepublican leadership, have already reached their agreement about how \nthey are going to allocate funds--either 50-50 or 60-40--along the \nlines of what they agreed to 2 years ago. It seems to me that those who \nare able to behave responsibly have already come to their own \nagreements regarding their committees and what we are left with are \nthose who are holding out with insistence that they are going to have \ntheir two-thirds share.\n  I am reminded of my mother, when I was a child growing up with my \nbrother and sisters, who said when we were squabbling over who was \ngoing to get this or that: Well, until you can work it out among \nyourselves, none of you will have it. It was amazing how, back then, it \nwas possible for my brother and sisters at very young ages to work \nthese things out, knowing that until we got it resolved, none of us \ncould have what we wanted. So I think that would be a good admonition \nfor my colleagues who are complaining today about the lack of \norganization.\n  I am reminded also that when we arrived here a week ago, our new \ncolleagues were sworn in and the next day the Republican caucus wanted \nto adjourn to have a conference. In fact, we on the Democrat side \nwanted to stay in session. Senator Clinton had an amendment to \nreinstate unemployment benefits for those who lost them in December. We \nasked for 30 minutes equally divided to debate that amendment and to \nhave a vote. We were told we couldn't have that; there was not time. \nThe Senate was adjourning to the next day so the Republican caucus \ncould go out and have their conference.\n  We came back on Thursday. The Republican leader--the majority leader, \nnow acknowledged by everybody and recognized as representing the \nmajority caucus, the Republican caucus--told us on Thursday afternoon \nthat there would be no votes on Friday, no votes until Monday at 5 \no'clock. We had a long 4-day weekend and came back. I came back \nyesterday. I understood that we were going to have a hearing this \nmorning--right at this hour, in fact--to confirm the nomination in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee of Governor Ridge as the new Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I met last week with Governor Ridge. I told him he had my support. I \nmet with the Secretary of the Navy last week, Mr. England, who will be \nthe Deputy Secretary. I said I hoped we would have a hearing this week \non his nomination, as well, so we could pass that--I expect virtually \nunanimously, or if not unanimously, on a bipartisan basis.\n  Yesterday afternoon, I was told that the committee meeting for today \nhad been canceled--not by the Democrats, who were fully prepared to \nconvene today, but by our Republican colleagues from each State who in \nturn would be asking questions of Governor Ridge. I cannot believe that \nany of us are going to have any objections to this outstanding American \nand public servant taking over this helm as rapidly as possible. He \ncertainly has my full support.\n\n  But the committee hearing was canceled, I suspect more for the fact \nthat the present chairman has expressed over the weekend some ambitions \nof seeking the Presidency than anything else because, as I say, last \nweek, when Governor Ridge and Secretary England came to my office to \nmeet with me, they understood we were having a hearing this week--the \nGovernor did--and certainly understood that the arrangement was as it \nwas.\n  Of even greater concern to me is the fact that we had a briefing on \nnational security scheduled for this afternoon, a top secret briefing \nfor Members of the Senate, with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the \nVice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Deputy Secretary of \nState, about the international situation in Iraq and North Korea.\n  We have been back a week. We have not had that briefing. I am a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee. I have not had that briefing. \nAt 2 o'clock this afternoon we were supposed to receive the \ninformation, of which we are certainly entitled as Members of this body \nin which the American people\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\nelected us to represent their interests, and that briefing was \ncanceled. Whether by the administration or the majority leader, I do \nnot know, but it was not canceled by the Democratic caucus, I can \nassure you.\n  So when we talk about preventing this body from doing the business of \nthe American people, representing the interests of the American people, \nI think those of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should \nlook in the mirror.\n  Frankly, for someone such as myself, and my position in seniority, \nthis argument over funding for committees--two-thirds/one-third--gets \nto be a little bit surreal: Who should have a car, who should have a \ndriver. I do not even have a car in Washington. I certainly do not have \na driver. I get to work just fine every day.\n  If the American people knew what one-third of this budget or \ncommittee actually was, I think they would be astonished that anybody \ncould not operate effectively on one-third of what we are talking \nabout. In fact, I would propose, if we are really concerned about the \ntaxpayers, as we profess, we should establish a precedent of one-third \nof the committee budgets for the Republicans and one-third of the \ncommittee budgets for the Democrats, and give one-third back to the \nAmerican taxpayers. Give it to some needy food shelves around the \ncountry. Let's establish that for the President to follow.\n  Precedents get established and reestablished all the time. That would \nbe a good one, to have the same funding for the Democrats and \nRepublicans, regardless of who has the majority, and giving one-third \nback to the American people. And then let's proceed.\n  I might also point out that the majority leader has also announced, \neven if we do have an organizational resolution this week, we are going \nto be in recess next week. In other words, we were in session last week \nfor a couple days, and will be in session this week for a few days, and \nthen we are going to go off for a week. Lots of us have ideas of what \nwe are going to do back in our States around the country, but the fact \nis, as others have said, we have the people's business before us.\n  I was delighted to see the Republican leader say that based on his \npriorities we would be dealing with prescription drug coverage for \nseniors in the very near future. I understood that was his first order \nof business, in fact. I thought that was just exactly the right \npriority for the American people.\n\n  So I suggest to the majority leader that, given these delays, let's \nget this organizing resolution resolved and then let's stay in \nWashington next week. Let's do the business of the people. Let's not \nleave Washington. Let's not go away for a weekend. Let's not go away \nfor a week. Let's stay here in session until we get passed prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors. If he kept all of us to the task, denying us \nour recess until we completed the business of American senior citizens, \nI guarantee you we would have something done sooner rather than much \nlater.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have the opportunity to \nfinish my remarks with an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, might I \ninquire as to how many additional minutes we are talking about?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I have 5 more minutes approximately, I say to my \ncolleague, and I would ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, the President announced a tax proposal \nlast week. I call it ``Leave No Millionaire Behind.'' He expressed his \nconcern about the double taxation of corporate profits in America. I \nwish he would devote equal concern about the nontaxation of corporate \nprofits in this country. It is estimated that now less than half of \ncorporate profits are taxed at all. Through various tax and accounting \ngimmicks, some of the very profitable companies in this country not \nonly have no tax liability whatsoever, they receive multimillion-dollar \nrefunds from the American taxpayer.\n  Take CSX, for example, a company headed by the President's nominee \nfor Secretary of Treasury, Mr. John Snow. For the last 4 years, CSX \nreported U.S. profits of $934 billion. It paid, in American taxes, \nzero. It received rebates, in fact, from the American Treasury of $164 \nbillion.\n  Let me repeat that. CSX earned $934 billion in profits on its \nAmerican operations, paid zero taxes to the American Treasury, and \nreceived a $164 billion refund from the American taxpayer.\n  I would say that is ``compassionate conservatism,'' but it is \ncertainly not double taxation. It is no taxation. And it is a big \nwinner, increasingly so, on Wall Street. It is a reason that corporate \nincome tax in this country has been a declining share of the Federal \ntax revenues over the last decades.\n  In 1960, corporate taxes amounted to 23 percent of Federal revenues. \nIn 1970, that dropped to 18 percent; in 1980, 14 percent; last year, \n10.5 percent. In other words, the corporate income tax share of Federal \nGovernment revenue is one-half of what it was 40 years ago.\n  There used to be an ethic in this country that business, being an \nintegral part of the communities in which they operated, drew their \nlifeblood from the people of this country and from its democratic and \ncapitalist structures, and that they had an obligation to give \nsomething back. But no longer.\n  The modern version of John Kennedy's inaugural refrain, ``Ask not \nwhat your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your \ncountry,'' has become, in corporate America, ``Ask what your country \ncan do for you and what you can avoid doing for your country.''\n\n  One of the most obvious and disgraceful tax avoidance schemes is the \ngrowing practice of some American companies of setting up sham \ncorporate headquarters offshore in places such as Bermuda or the Cayman \nIslands. These tax-free havens permit the total avoidance of taxes for \nforeign operations and, in some cases, from domestic operations as \nwell.\n  It is bad enough that profitable U.S. corporations can essentially \nrenounce their U.S. corporate citizenship, but some of them continue to \nsecure very large and lucrative contracts with our Federal Government, \nsome even in the areas of national defense and homeland security. \nEvidently, they see nothing wrong with profiting off the U.S. \nGovernment and then avoiding paying taxes, even on those profits to \nsupport our very own Government.\n  One partner in Ernst & Young said recently: ``A lot of companies feel \nthat the improvement in earnings is powerful enough so that maybe the \npatriotism issue should take a back seat.''\n  That is why last summer my colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, amended \nthe 2002 Defense appropriations bill to bar such corporate tax dodgers \nfrom being awarded Government defense contracts. Then he successfully \namended the homeland security bill to bar those companies from getting \ncontracts with the new Department of Homeland Security. Both amendments \npassed on the Senate floor by voice votes, seemingly unanimously.\n  However, after the November election, after Paul's tragic death, the \nfinal version of the homeland security bill gutted the Wellstone \namendment. Whereas Paul's amendment permitted only the President to \ngrant a waiver upon certification to the Congress that would be \nnecessary for national security, the corporate callboys snuck in \nlanguage that allowed the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant \nwaivers for national security or for economic benefits.\n  Who could argue that tax-free Government contracts are not to \nsomeone's economic benefit? It seems if that corporate someone is big \nenough and rich enough to know who to call in Washington, and to pay \n$1,000 an hour for what is euphemistically here called ``Government \nrelations,'' there is no doubt that the waiver would be granted. In \nother words, Paul Wellstone's legacy is going to be obliterated by \nwaves of waivers, which is why we need more Paul Wellstones in \nWashington.\n  So, last week, to honor Paul's memory, to try to reclaim part of his \nlegacy, I introduced the Senator Paul Wellstone Corporate Patriotism \nAct\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\nthat reinstates the Wellstone amendment to the Homeland Security Act. \nIt says that corporations that have renounced their American \ncitizenship and moved offshore to avoid paying taxes to the U.S. \nGovernment will not get business contracts with the U.S. Government, at \nleast not with homeland security projects.\n  It is the least we can do for Paul Wellstone. It is the least we \nshould do for ourselves because most U.S. companies, like most American \ncitizens, are law abiding, patriotic, and responsible. Nobody likes \npaying taxes. Americans have been anti taxes since the colonial days, \nsince the Boston Tea Party, since the rallying cry of, ``Taxation \nwithout representation is tyranny.''\n  Taxes are necessary for this country's survival, however. We have \nincreased military spending by 23 percent in the last 2 years on a \nbipartisan basis, which the President requested. We have evidence that \nnew efforts in homeland security will cost an additional $37 billion. \nOperation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, the military buildup in the \nneighborhood of Iraq--all of these depend upon Americans paying taxes \nand everyone paying their fair share of taxes. When someone avoids \npaying their fair share, everyone else pays a higher unfair share. We \nneed to reestablish an ethic in this country that tax avoidance is \nunpatriotic, un-American; tax avoidance is selfish, greedy, and an \ninsult to this Nation.\n  Tax exemption, especially for the wealthy, whether they be dividends \nor estates--those tax exemptions not based on the inability to pay for \nsocial benefits such as charitable negotiation are betrayals of our \ndemocracy. They betray the American promise of better lives for \neveryone by all of us working together, by joining together, by \npledging together, as our forefathers did, our lives, our fortunes, and \nour sacred honor.\n  This country won't work if we don't work together. This country won't \nthrive if the richest citizens avoid paying taxes and profitable \ncompanies put profits before patriotism. More is never enough. It is \ntime for the American elite to say they have enough--more than enough. \nI urge you, don't break America with your selfishness or your greed. \nPay your fair share for America. Do so willingly, proudly, and \npatriotically. I say to the corporate expatriots of America, come home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are having a debate on the organizing resolution. \nWe have heard a great deal. The Senator from Minnesota just spoke \nsomewhat disparagingly of what he calls ``crocodile tears'' on this \nside of the aisle and said we were trying to rewrite history.\n  I would like to set the record straight with a little bit of \nhistory--some that I know because I was directly and personally \ninvolved.\n  We all recall that the 107th Congress was unique. It was 50-50 for \nthe first time in history. The two leaders, facing that unusual \ncircumstance, created an unusual solution to it. However, the question \nof who would chair the committees was never in doubt. Right from the \nvery beginning, it was clearly understood that since the Republicans \nhad the vote of the Vice President for organization purposes, \nRepublicans would chair all of the committees.\n  The fight over money has been exaggerated by those who have debated \nhere. There was a protracted conversation and negotiation between \nSenator Lott and Senator Daschle over the issue of money, but there was \nnever any doubt that the Republicans, with the Vice President's vote, \nwould organize the committees, and work began immediately for the \norganization of the committees, with the Republicans recognized as the \nchairs.\n  Now, when Senator Jeffords left the Republican Conference--crossed \nthe aisle and decided he would caucus with the Democrats--I was \nchairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee. I had a hearing scheduled to proceed with the work of the \nAppropriations Committee. Senator Jeffords made his announcement at a \n10 o'clock news conference in the morning, as I recall--I may not have \nthe exact time correct. As I left the Senate Chamber following Senator \nJeffords' announcement, I said to my staff: Put the hearing on hold \nbecause Senator Durbin is now the chairman of that subcommittee.\n  I ran into Senator Durbin waiting for the subway in the basement of \nthe Capitol, and I said to him: Dick, since you are now the chairman of \nthat subcommittee, you decide whether or not we hold the hearing. He \nlooked a little nonplussed but said to me: Bob, don't you want to hold \nthe hearing since you have set it up? I said: No, Dick, you hold the \nhearing because you are now the chairman. He said: Oh, thank you very \nmuch for that courtesy.\n  There were no resolutions that had to be passed, as far as I was \nconcerned, because it was very clear that the power in the Senate had \nshifted and I--and I know of no other Republican--was not going to act \nas a dog in the manger and hang on to the technicality that no \nresolution had been passed in order to hold on to power for a few extra \nminutes, or a few extra days, in the face of the fact that the decision \nhad been made as to who would control the Senate.\n  Now we come to the present circumstance: An organizing resolution \ndetermining who will be chairmen of the committees has been introduced \nby the majority leader, and it is being contested by the minority \nleader and the members of the Democratic Party. We understand now that \nthis is a deliberate strategy that was laid down by the Democrats prior \nto the time this Congress was organized. Prior to the time when new \nSenators were sworn in, prior to the time when we gathered to meet, the \nDemocrats had met and made the decision that they would hang on to the \ncommittee power for as long as they possibly could. We have written \nevidence of this in the form of an e-mail sent by Ben McMakin, who is \nthe legislative director to Senator Patty Murray, the previous chairman \nof the Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\n  Senator Murray's legislative director, in an e-mail dated January 2, \nprior to the time when we met, prior to the time anybody was sworn in, \nprior to the time when anybody was addressing these questions formally, \nmade these points. He begins this by saying to his staff:\n\n       Here is an update from Daschle staff on where we find \n     ourselves at the beginning of the 108th Congress. Democrats \n     continue to serve as chairs of all committees and \n     subcommittees until the Senate reorganizes.\n\n  Technically, that is true. Historically, that has never been true. No \nparty, when there has been a change in control from one party to the \nother as a result of the actions of the American people--those things \ncalled elections, which we usually pay attention to around here--but no \nparty has ever tried to hang on to its control of committees when there \nwas a transition of power from one party to the other. Technically, it \nis true, Democrats continue to serve as chairs of all committees and \nsubcommittees until the Senate reorganizes, but that reorganization \nresolution always passes virtually immediately, and there is never an \nattempt on the part of the outgoing party to hang on to the power that \nthe people have given to the incoming party.\n  However, Mr. McMakin makes this point:\n\n       Senate Democrats have leverage when the organizing \n     resolution hits the floor, as it is debatable and will \n     ultimately require 60 votes to pass.\n\n  Understand, this is not Mr. McMakin's idea. This is Mr. McMakin's \nreport to his staff of the position of the Daschle staff. He simply was \ntaking notes of what the minority leader staff was telling him and the \nother legislative directors. I will read that sentence again:\n\n       Senate Democrats have leverage when the organizing \n     resolution hits the floor, as it is debatable and will \n     ultimately require 60 votes to pass.\n\n  If ever there was a clear statement that prior to the time the \nCongress even met, Senator Daschle and his\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\nstaff were planning to filibuster the organizing resolution, there it \nis.\n  Again, the attitude that was on the Republican side when Senator \nJeffords walked across the aisle, I handed the gavel to Senator Durbin \nthat afternoon. I handed it to him without any resolution. I handed it \nto him without any action, without any thought that there would be a \nfilibuster or clinging to power because I recognized the power had \nchanged in the Senate, and that meant if we were going to have orderly \nactivity on the people's business, the power had to change in \ncommittees.\n  Here is the reality of where we are today. The Democrats are saying: \nWe cannot allow the organizing resolution to pass until the funding \nissues are resolved. The funding issues are not up for resolution until \nthe end of February because of the disarray with which we ended the \nlast Congress, with funding resolutions and appropriations bills not \npassed. The funding of committees was passed in the last Congress that \ncarries over to the end of February. We have no dispute on funding at \nthe moment. We will have at the end of February.\n  We can organize the Senate and allow the committees to go forward \nthis afternoon without disrupting the present funding circumstance. We \ndo not need to tie the two together. The majority leader has offered \nthe resolution just to allow the Republicans to take the gavels, \nnothing else. The negotiations over funding can still continue. The \narguments over percentages can still go forward. And the Democratic \nleader is saying: No, we are going to hang on to the gavels; we are \ngoing to hang on to our technical power that is a residue of the last \nCongress; we are going to continue to say the election did not make any \ndifference week after week for as long as we can.\n  We come to another very interesting statement by Mr. McMakin in this \ne-mail on January 2. He says:\n\n       January 20th recess. Daschle staff says highly unlikely \n     that we will recess that week due to standoff over organizing \n     resolution and delay in addressing outstanding appropriations \n     measures.\n\n  Before the Congress even met, Senator Daschle knew there would be a \nfilibuster on the organizing resolution and knew that would carry over \n3 weeks, 4 weeks, on in to cancelling the January 20 recess which had \nbeen previously scheduled with, I understand, the approval of the \nDemocratic schedulers. No, no, Daschle's staff is alerting other \nSenators' staffs that the recess will not take place because we will \nstill be haggling over the organizing resolution.\n  I do not know how you can be more specific about a determined plan \nlaid out in the beginning to slow down the work of the Senate, to \nobstruct the people's business, to make sure the effect of the election \nis delayed as long as possible than you have in this e-mail from Mr. \nMcMakin.\n  There is one item on here I find of interest. While most of the e-\nmail does deal with the fact that the Democrats intend to filibuster \nthe organizing resolution and slow down, delay as long as possible the \nRepublicans' ability to take over the Senate and manage it, under the \nheading ``Other Legislative Issues,'' Mr. McMakin has this very \ninteresting sentence:\n\n     UI fight to resume again on first day.\n\n  Those of us who were here on the first day understand ``UI'' stands \nfor unemployment insurance. That the first item out of the box when the \nnew majority leader offered a bill, which he thought had been agreed \nupon by both sides and, therefore, was a simple matter of asking \nunanimous consent, in fact, the Democrats were lying in wait to begin \nthe fight over again; that the unanimous-consent request would be \nobjected to, as it was--objected to by one of the Senators who had \nentered into the agreement forming it in the first place. Ultimately, \nthat got taken care of, but the strong message laid in advance by the \nDaschle staff, as they talked to other legislative directors, was: We \nare going to begin fighting the Republicans at every step on every item \nthe first day--the first day.\n\n  As we think back over the election, with all of the punditry that \ngoes into analyzing it, we find that different pundits come to \ndifferent conclusions. Some have said the Democrats lost because they \ndid not have a clear message. Others have said the Democrats lost \nbecause they obstructed everything the President tried to do and the \nvoters punished them for that obstruction. And then others said the \nDemocrats lost because they did not obstruct enough; they were not \ntough enough; they did not show themselves with enough backbone.\n  From this memo and from the actions since this memo, it becomes clear \nto me the Democratic leadership in the Senate has decided the third set \nof pundits is correct: That they lost the election because they did not \nobstruct the President enough, and so this time, they are not only \ngoing to try to trip him up on unanimous-consent agreements that \nRepublicans think have been cleared in advance, they are not only going \nto lay traps for the majority leader when he thinks the path is clear, \nthey are even going to go to the point of trying to hang on to the \ngavels as long as they can to prevent the Republicans from organizing \nthe committees and moving forward with the committee work as long as \nthey can so that perhaps at the end of the Congress, they can say: You \nsee the disarray the Republicans were in, you see how difficult it was \nfor us to have Republicans in charge; they could not get anything done.\n  Filibustering the organizing resolution, demanding 60 votes before \nthe Republican chairmen can even pick up the gavels, and then \ncomplaining, as the Senator from Minnesota did, that the Republicans \nare shedding crocodile tears because things are not being done the way \nthe Democrats want--Mr. President, this is unprecedented, and I hope it \nis unique. I hope in every successive session in the history of this \nRepublic, when the Senate gathers, the party which won the control of \nthe Senate through the election is allowed to take control of the \ngavels in the committee as soon as the Senate gathers.\n  That is what I thought democracy was all about. That is how I behaved \nwhen Senator Jeffords changed the power in the Senate and, as far as I \nknow, that is how every other Republican chairman behaved. We handed \nover the gavels without protest.\n  We handed over the gavels with an attempt to make sure the work of \nthe Senate went forward smoothly. We did not haggle and complain. We \njust said, the Democrats are now in charge. Good luck. We will do the \nbest we can to help.\n  When Senator Jeffords crossed the aisle, funding issues took weeks to \nresolve. That is a different question. Funding issues can go until \nFebruary and they will not affect anybody. To tie the two of them \ntogether and to slow down, indeed prevent, the majority party from \nexercising majority control over funding issues that can and should be \nresolved at some point in the future is, in my view, irresponsible and \nultimately, in the eyes of the American people, unforgivable.\n  I am sure there will be those in the media who will say the Democrats \nare just asking that the Republicans be fair. They got 49 votes, they \nshould have 49 percent of the money.\n  Let me take a few moments and explain that one. If we do not deal in \npercentages but we deal in dollars, what is it the Republicans are \noffering the Democrats in funding? Forget the percentages; talk about \nthe dollars. We are offering, as I understand it, the same dollars they \nhad in the last Congress. What we are asking for is a few more dollars \non the Republican side. That brings the Republican percentage of the \ntotal dollars up to 60, which is down from the target Senator Daschle \nset prior to the election when he was asked what the funding levels \nwould be. He said the funding levels would be two-thirds to one-third, \n67 percent for the Democrats, 33 percent for the Republicans, if the \nDemocrats took clear control in the election. That was his plan if he \nhad control as majority leader.\n  Now when he is not majority leader, he is saying they have to have 49 \npercent of the total funding. Using their power in the filibuster, they \nwill give the Republicans a little bit of an administrative kicker but \nwill not allow the Republicans to get enough additional administrative \nmoney so the total pot is divided 60/40. They have to have the \nRepublicans under 60. That is the demand, as I understand it.\n  If we had a fixed amount of dollars we were debating and we were \nsaying\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\nwe give the Democrats X percent of that fixed amount, maybe their \nargument for fairness might have some validity. But the fixed amount is \nthe same amount they had been getting under the 107th Congress when \nthey were in the majority, and we are saying we are going to add on the \nRepublican side enough administrative dollars so the total percentages \ngo up to 60, and the Democrats are objecting to that.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. So this is where we are. This is not a fight over money. \nThis is not a fight over fairness in funding. This is a deliberate, \npredetermined, precongressional attempt to prevent the Republicans from \nbeing successful. This is deliberate obstruction, planned and \nannounced, at least among their own troops, prepared for and carefully \nscripted. For the Democratic leader, through his staff, to be able to \npredict in advance of the Congress meeting that a recess scheduled 3 \nweeks later would not occur is a clear demonstration he is prepared to \nobstruct every step of the way, even if it means denying the party that \nwas chosen by the people as the majority party its proper majority \nstatus.\n  So let us not get carried away in percentages. Let us not get carried \naway in false arguments about fairness. What is on the table is an \norganizing resolution that deals nothing with money. What is on the \ntable for discussion is a funding resolution that gives the Democrats \nevery bit as much money as they had in the 107th Congress.\n\n  Simple fairness to the American people who made their choice in \nNovember demands we get on with this; that the Republicans be given the \ngavels; that the Congress be organized, the Senate be organized; and \nthat we move ahead to the people's business instead of to partisan \nmonkey business.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S261-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S261-S264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING OBSTRUCTIONISM\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, ordinarily I do not come to the Senate \nfloor and involve myself in a lot of the issues that are going on at \nthe leadership level, but I have to say I really am disappointed the \nleaders of the Democratic Party are continuing to obstruct the \nRepublicans' effort to organize and to move forward with this Nation's \nagenda.\n  In the last session, we could not even pass a budget. We have \nappropriations bills that are waiting to be acted on as we move into \nthis new year. My hope is we could put aside our partisan differences \nand move quickly forward with these pressing issues, deal with the \npeople's business. After we finish the unfinished business of the last \nCongress, and after the State of the Union address, then we could go \nahead and begin to move forward with the business of this new year.\n  Historically in the Senate, the majority party has moved ahead very \nquickly on the organizing resolution. It has been a standard process \nwhere two-thirds of the funding goes to the majority party and a third \nto the minority party.\n  I was interested in the reference by my colleague from Utah who \nmentioned there was an e-mail floating around, which he quoted, that \nthis was actually a planned effort by the Democratic party to obstruct \nthe agenda. I have been informed there have been previous e-mails that \nif the Democrat party had been in control in the Senate, they were \nplanning to push the two-thirds/one-third breakout on funding because \nthat has been the tradition of the Senate year after year; that is what \nhas happened, the majority party has had the two-thirds and the \nminority party has been one-third.\n  Now we find the majority party has tried to use last year's abnormal \ntype of session--there was nothing normal about last year's session we \ncan use as a standard for moving forward from this point on, but the \nfact is historically this has been a rather standard process. I hope we \ncan put aside this type of partisan bickering that does not have \nanything to do with the people's business and move forward with what \nhistorically we have done in the Senate.\n\n  Last year, Congress started with Republican control, then went back \nto the Democrat Party because a Republican changed parties--went from a \nRepublican to an Independent. And then after this election, \ntechnically, we could have been back in the majority again--after the \nvote in Missouri. It was decided we would hold that aside and just move \nforward with this year's agenda.\n  As we enter the second week of a new year, the second week of the \n108th Congress, the business of the Senate is once again seeing \nobstructionist politics blocking the Nation's business and our work \nfrom moving forward, getting something accomplished. I don't see any \nlegitimate reason for this delay.\n  The Senate, over its many years, has abided by the clear precedent I \nreferred to earlier, with an organizing resolution quickly agreed upon, \nand then we move forward with our routine business each year. Now we \nhave the Democrats wanting to change the world since they did not get \ntheir way in November.\n  I had one of the more contested races in the Nation, in Colorado. It \nis clear to me the people of Colorado are disappointed that we did not \npass a budget last year; that we did not get our work done in the last \nCongress.\n  I don't think anyone wins with obstructionist politics. The big \nlosers are the citizens of this country. We are not able to address \ntheir problems and move forward with real solutions. The people of the \nUnited States made clear whom they chose to lead the Senate. It was the \nsame argument all over the country as in my race. Yet the minority \nparty refuses to step aside and let the duly elected party move \nforward. We have a clear majority in this Congress to deal with the \nbusiness of the people and the business of the country. They refuse to \nrelinquish the power the people of the United States said they no \nlonger wished them to hold.\n  We face challenging times in our Nation. Grave threats against our \nnational security continue to damage economic confidence. Spending \nbills that should have been approved last year are still pending. That \nis right, 11 spending bills that provide funding for parks and research \nfailed, under the leadership of the Democrats, to proceed. And they are \nnot passing now because of the Democrats' persistence in obstructionist \npolitics. Last year, for the first time in decades, we did not even \npass a budget. Yet the Democrats still want to control.\n  I stand by our newly elected Majority Leader Frist and the people of \nthe United States. Let our work proceed. Let the will of the people \nstand victorious and let the continuing resolution move forward \naccording to the clear precedent that we have in the Senate.\n  Newspapers across the Nation continue to report that the \nobstructionist politics of the Democrats have delayed the confirmation \nhearing of Tom Ridge, the President's choice to run the new Department \nof Homeland Security. My question is, Do my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle truly believe the people of the United States would \nrather see obstruction than move forward with the Department of \nHomeland Security, with the effort to try to restore economic growth in \nthis country, to finish the unfinished business we had left over from \nthe last Congress because of obstruction politics?\n\n  The New York Times reported that until Senators adopt a so-called \norganizing resolution, committee chairmanships will rest with the \nDemocrats despite the November elections that gave Republicans a 1-vote \nmajority. The impasse creates delays in the Senate business, not only \nof Mr. Ridge's confirmation but also the confirmation of John Snow as \nTreasury Secretary, as well as consideration of the appropriations \nbills left over from last year.\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\nIn addition, the 11 freshman Senators cannot receive their committee \nassignments until the dispute is settled. Obstructionist politics of \nthe 107th Congress continue: No committee assignments, no chairmen; \nnewly elected Members of the Senate remain without the right to \nparticipate in discussions because of heavy obstructionism.\n  In my view, we must end the stalemate and get back to work. I come to \nthe floor to reemphasize how important it is that we move forward and \nget the Senate's business accomplished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we allowed 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \na situation that is evolving with reference to who is going to run the \nSenate and who are going to be chairmen of committees and how are we \ngoing to pay our staffs. I don't think the American people understand \nthis debate, so we ought to explain it quite a few times.\n  The election occurred. There has been a lot of talk in the country \nabout what happened. The conclusion was: Republicans won the Senate.\n  Now I will go back in time to the day that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont formally decided to leave this side of the aisle and \nbecome independent and was ready to vote with that side of the aisle, \ngiving them a 1-vote majority. Before that day was up, the gavels were \nhanded to the Democrats to run the committees. So as I had been \nchairman of the Budget Committee, I was no more. And Kent Conrad, who \nhad not been chairman, was chairman. So if any meetings were called or \nhearings held, the agenda was prepared by him, not me.\n  Now we win an election, we come into session, we convene the Senate, \nand guess what: Democrats maintain they are still entitled to run the \ncommittees. I believe this borders on nonsense, but to the Democrats it \nmust mean something. Perhaps they think they win elections by delaying \nwhat we do, by not letting us do work. Last time, they did that, we got \nnothing done, and they lost. Maybe we should do nothing and stay in \nthis stalemate. Maybe we will win and they will lose again. But we \ndon't think that way. We think we ought to get on with the business \nthat is not yet done from last year.\n  Remember, we were not running things last year. I am not casting \naspersions, but they ran the Senate and we got nothing done. As a \nmatter of fact, we had 11 appropriations bills that we will be debating \nperhaps for weeks that were last year's appropriations bills. They are \nnot finished. The year started out when that gavel was switched from \nDomenici to Conrad and he became chairman. The Democrats never produced \na budget resolution last year either.\n  Again, some people do not want Senators from this side of the aisle \nto lay blame on anyone, but a budget resolution was not passed and it \nis supposed to be. The answer that was given was: We do not have the \nvotes; or: It is too hard. I passed a lot of them. We did not have the \nvotes, and they were too hard, and yet I got them done because that was \nmy job.\n  I am not saying every Senator who is chairman of the Budget Committee \nshould produce a budget. I am saying it should have been done last \nyear. And then we probably would have completed our appropriations \nbills. We probably would have gotten the appropriations bills done. Now \nwe do not have them, 11 of them, and the other side of the aisle is \nwaiting for something to happen other than the election, which we won, \nto give us the gavel so we can start to work at the Senate. Frankly, I \nknow people are probably saying: You can't be telling us the truth. \nThis can't be the case.\n\n  It is the case. It is the case. I am chairman of the Energy Committee \nnow. I have been told if I want to call a meeting, I am not chairman. \nBut I am chairman. Certainly the Democrat is not chairman. They say \nthey are, I guess, because we have not passed a resolution saying how \nwe are going to pay the committees. Frankly, that is another issue, how \nmuch do we allot to the Democrats and how much to the Republicans to \nrun these committees. Frankly, I didn't think, having a brand new \nmajority leader, the first thing that would be given to him to solve is \nthis issue. I thought we would see him down here helping us get the \nappropriations bills finished and get on with what we think we were \nasked to do by the American people in the last election.\n  I think they were unhappy, at least enough to swing the election, \nbecause the other side of the aisle delayed incessantly the passage of \nthe homeland security bill--incessantly. In fact, I should have asked \nhow many days that bill was delayed on the floor and in committee \nbecause certain Senators on that side of the aisle did not like it the \nway it was. That is their prerogative. They wanted to delay it. That is \ntheir prerogative. They succeeded in delaying it. But we succeeded, \nwith the help of a Democrat Senator who suggested to his own people: Is \nthere a higher calling than the security of our country, even if it is \na special interest bill? Ask the Senator from that side of the aisle. \nThat spread like wildfire. That is why a couple of Senators on that \nside of the aisle lost: Delay, delay, special interests on the homeland \nbill. We barely got it finished. But we didn't get appropriations \nfinished.\n  Do you know what that means? If the American people understood what \nthat means, more telegrams and whatever they send to us would be here \non the laps of the Senators than you could ever imagine. It means \nliterally we have not funded education, roads, all of the bills on HUD, \non defense, on nuclear bombs, nuclear programs--defense we have done; \nall the others we have not. We have not passed the annual \nappropriations bills. They are operating at last year's funding levels. \nWhat they got was for 1 year. We said we didn't get our work done so \njust operate the same way you did last year. That is why some money is \nnot being spent on education, because it has not been appropriated. \nThey have not been allocated the new moneys. Up and down the \nappropriations bills, that is the mess we are in. And we sit here and \nargue about how many dollars are we going to give to the staff on the \nDemocrat side of the Energy Committee and how much to the staff of the \nRepublicans on the Energy Committee? I cite that because I happen to \nchair that committee.\n  All I know, fellow Senators, is that in all of modern history, \nwhichever party was ahead--by one vote or 10 votes or 12 votes or two \nvotes--that is, however many more Senators elected on their side, they \ngot two-thirds of the money for staff. And the side that had a \nminority--whether it was a three-vote minority, a six-vote minority, a \n10-vote minority, which we were in sometimes--we were in an 18-vote \nminority sometimes--the minority got one-third, the majority got two-\nthirds.\n  This year we are one vote ahead. It seems to me the rule has been \nthat the party that is in the majority gets two-thirds, the other one-\nthird. I don't think the rule said: but only if you are ahead by five \nvotes, if you have five more Senators. What if it were two? Would that \nbe enough to apply the rule? It has been six, it has been eight. But \nnow it is one, but one doesn't work? It's not a majority?\n\n  Because when we were even--remember, we were even at one time. We \nthought we should be running the Senate because the Vice President gave \nus an extra vote. It didn't work out that way. We had to concede. And \nwe split the money 50-50, or at least we said we will not force a \nreduction.\n  To me, the dollars involved in that are important, but clearly not as \nimportant as doing the public's business. They are not as important as \nrecognizing they lost and we won, and we ought to be in control. We \nought to be chairmen. Clearly, our leader is the majority leader. He is \nnot the ``maybe majority leader''. If you call a meeting to have a \nserious hearing tomorrow or the next day, whoever the Republican on \nthat committee who has been designated by the Republicans as chairman, \nis chairman.\n  Why we sit here and let the appropriations for all of our Government \nlanguish while we argue this issue is beyond this Senator. I truly \nbelieve the Democrats are not going to win by this\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\ntactic. I urge them to get this resolved. The American people do not \nwant them delaying this. They want us getting on with work together. \nThey don't want us bickering. But how can you not have an argument when \nthe facts are what I have just said? Apparently, unless they get the \nsame amount of money as we had agreed upon when we were not in the \nmajority, they believe they are not going to let us run the business of \nthe Senate.\n  I think it can be worked out. It should be two-thirds/one-third, just \nas it was through all of history, but at least we ought to work it out \nsome way--60-40? Some way, so we can get on with our work. One hundred \nSenators, many new ones, are here ready to get on with their work. How \nsurprised they must be, the new ones, ready to go to work and here we \nare, arguing about who is entitled to the gavel. I don't know if all \nthose new Senators thought that was what their work was about, but here \nwe are.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator departs, we have had \nthe privilege of sitting next to each other for some period of time \nright there in the Senate. I, of course, admire him as one of the elder \nstatesmen and pillars of this institution. I think, if people were \nasked what are the hallmarks because of which we have such strong \nadmiration for the Senator from New Mexico, it would be because of his \nability to reach across the aisle and work as he has always done these \nmany years in the Senate.\n  So I listened carefully to what my colleague had to say. It was not \neasy for you to say some of the remarks you did. You feel strongly \nabout it, as do I. Here we are with a new Republican leader and we just \nwant the work of the institution to go on, on behalf of the people of \nthis Nation who entrusted to us the awesome power that resides in this \nSenate--the institution regarded as perhaps the most powerful \nlegislative body, not only just here in the United States in comparison \nto the legislatures of our States, but, indeed, the world.\n  I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Chair advise the Senate with regard to the \nparliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business was to be \nequally divided. The minority party has 41 minutes left. The majority \nparty's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see. I do not at this time know--I'm not entirely sure \nhow we say majority or minority here in this situation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That's right.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not see where there is someone from the other side \nof the aisle seeking recognition, so the Senator from Virginia would \nask for 7 minutes to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is the \ntime allocation? The Democrats were allotted equal time with the \nRepublicans. What is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 40 minutes remaining. The \ntime for the majority party has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We were asking for a few minutes because the Senator \nwas not here. He was going to use some time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then, Mr. President, I will put again before the Chair \nthe request on behalf of the Senator from Virginia to proceed as in \nmorning business for, say, 6 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to agree to that. Forty minutes takes us until \n12:30, when the time is up.\n  What I ask is that the time be extended past 12:30 for the Democrats \nby the 5 or 6 minutes, if that is what the Senator wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am sorry, I simply did not hear.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection to that. I only ask the time from 12:30 \nto whatever time the Senator takes, 7 minutes or whatever it is, be \ngiven to the Democrats so that would be until approximately 12:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada.\n  I thought I would bring to this series of comments some experience I \nhave been privileged to have in this institution. I mark a quarter of a \ncentury of service beginning this week in which I have been privileged \nto serve the people of Virginia and the people of the United States in \nthis venerable institution. I just draw on some of my own experience, \nparticularly as it relates to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Currently, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, my very good \nfriend, Mr. Levin, remains as chairman of the committee. We are \nactively carrying forward the work of the committee irrespective of \nsome of the difficulties we are facing on the floor as it relates to \nother matters. But that is the way Chairman Levin and I have operated \nthrough our years since we came together. Both of us mark a quarter of \na century of service beginning this week in the Senate.\n  I am very respectful of the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nFrist, Senator Daschle, and the respective whips in their efforts to \ntry to negotiate a resolution to this unique situation--unique in some \nrespects but in other respects I feel that elections are held in \nAmerica and the results are announced to the people of our Nation. I \nknow of no contest going on with regard to any of the 100 Senate seats, \nand most particularly those of the class who were just elected, or \nreelected in my case to a fifth term in the Senate. I don't know of any \ncontest anywhere in the States in this Nation but such contest as this \nwhich most unfortunately remains here in this Chamber.\n  But this is the way that I have conducted myself and as others have \nconducted themselves in these 25 years that I have been here as it \nrelates to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  I suppose if I were to say what some of the great lessons are that I \nhave had as a Senator it would have been my service with men--and in \nsome instances several women but most particularly the men--on the \nArmed Services Committee. I say women because when I was Secretary of \nthe Navy I appeared before Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, an absolutely \nbrilliant Senator and stalwart member of the Armed Services Committee. \nBut Senator Stennis was chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, who followed in the tradition of Richard Russell. I really \nstood in awe to testify before Russell when I was Secretary of the Navy \nat the time I knew him in that period of time. When I joined the \ncommittee, Senator Stennis really took me under his wing and just sort \nof treated me almost like an adopted younger brother. It was a \nmarvelous experience. He gave me a variety of special assignments when \nI first came to the Senate to serve him and the other members of the \ncommittee.\n  Another Senator on the committee at that time was Scoop Jackson of \nthe State of Washington. For those few of us here in the Chamber who \nhad the opportunity to serve with him, he touched our lives very \ndeeply.\n  These men not only carefully operated under the rules of the Senate, \nbut there was so much tradition and unwritten sort of rules of the \nSenate that they conveyed to us.\n  Following Stennis, Senators Gore and John Tower; and then my longtime \nvalued friend, Senator Nunn--I served as ranking on the committee under \nSenator Nunn as I do now under Carl Levin.\n  But I thought I would go back and just describe how we handled the \ntransition when Senator Jeffords made his decision, which decision was \nan incalculable blow to the Republicans who served with him in this \ninstitution because there had never really been a precedent at any time \nwhen the change of power in the Senate shifted other than by elections. \nIt was unprecedented.\n\n  But on May 24, the declaration of independence statement was made by \nSenator Jeffords. And from May 26 to June 3, the Senate was in recess. \nOn June 5, 2001, Senator John Warner, acting as chairman, presided over \nan Armed Services Committee nominating hearing. At the close of the \nbusiness on June 5, the Democrats became the majority party in the \nSenate when Senator Jeffords switched formally his\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nparty affiliation from Republican to Independent. On June 6, Senator \nCarl Levin was designated chairman of the Committee of Armed Services. \nOn June 7, Senator Levin, as chairman, presided over the Armed Services \nCommittee nominating hearing and other business of the committee.\n  There it is. I had waited some 20 years through this procession of \nseniority. Then we have an election process in our conference. I became \nchairman and served in that 2-year period--some 18 months, whatever it \nworked out to be--after 20-some-odd years of training and preparation \nto take on that awesome responsibility. In less than 24 hours, I stood \nup as I was trained as a military man and handed the gavel to Senator \nLevin, and the business of the committee went on.\n  That is sort of the transition, and that is the sort of spirit we \nhave in that great committee on which I serve. We try to keep to a very \nminimum questions of partisanship because we have the responsibility \nfor the men and women of the Armed Forces and, indeed, the security \npolicies in terms of oversight of this Nation. We take that \nresponsibility very seriously. As such, I am proud to say that I think \nSenator Levin and I have continued the traditions of those men who we \ndeem great, great chairmen of this committee.\n  I hope this casts some light on the negotiations that are being \nundertaken on our behalf by the leadership because I certainly value \nit. We took our blow when Senator Jeffords made his switch. But I think \nto the man and to the woman on this side of the aisle we did it, and we \ndid it swiftly and in recognizing that the leadership in this Nation \nshould never be in doubt.\n  If I could just reminisce on one story that I remember so well. I was \nworking on the staff of the Vice President of the United States, \nRichard Nixon. I was traveling with him in 1960--as we call it, an \n``advance man.'' I had the last assignment of taking him to California \nthat night when the nationwide election was held. The following morning \nI made the arrangements to convey the Vice President back to \nWashington. The election was still not fully decided in the minds of a \nnumber of people, primarily because of the celebrated block of votes in \nChicago allegedly under the control of the then-mayor, the father of \nthe current mayor, Richard Daley. But, in any event, we proceeded to \nthe airport. I put the Vice President's plane on the end of the runway \nbecause we wanted to try to remove ourselves as much as possible from \nthe clamor of the press watching the final results of that election \nunfold.\n  There was a mechanic who had come out to make certain the plane was \noperative before we departed. We loaded all the staff. I then escorted \nthe Vice President and Mrs. Nixon out, and one or two of his senior \nassociates. The mechanic had a small radio that was blaring about these \n10,000 votes. I watched the Vice President at that time instruct one of \nhis aides to call in and say that he would not contest those votes \nbecause at no time did he feel there should ever be a doubt in the \nminds of the American people or in the minds of the world of the \nability of the elections of this country to decide the change of power.\n  Right there at the end of that airstrip when that decision was made, \nit was conveyed back to President Eisenhower, and that was it. That \nnight, we came back to Washington and he formally conceded that \nelection. I think that is an interesting precedent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the minority has until 12:40; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S264-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S264-S266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CRY UNCLE\n\n  Mr. REID. First of all, I am not going to spend a lot of time talking \nabout the organizing resolution. I think we should follow the Durbin \nplan of government, which he enunciated here today--the golden rule: Do \nunto others. We are willing to take what we were given last time by the \nRepublicans. And the Senate has changed; last year at this time, there \nwere 51 Democrats; now there are 49. Today, there are 51 Republicans \nand 49 Democrats. We can take the same thing that we were given. That \nis what this debate is all about.\n  There were four boys in our family, and my wife and I had four \nchildren. We have kind of followed a tradition that I am sure is in a \nlot of families with boys. When you wrestle and do other things, one of \nthe rules I had with my brothers and my children is, if there is a \nlittle too much wrestling, or maybe you are putting on a little too \nmuch pressure, let him cry uncle on it; then you stop.\n  I think the time has come with this, as reported in a number of \naccounts yesterday, bizarre, foolish, crazy tax plan the President has \ngiven us. I think it is time that he cry uncle because it simply won't \nwork. Even people from his own party--U.S. Senators--are saying enough. \nI think what they are saying in so many words is: Please cry uncle, Mr. \nPresident.\n  You can look at what some journalists have had to say. David Broder \nsaid, among other things:\n\n       The dividend tax would likely deepen the growing budget \n     deficits. The first round of Bush tax cuts will cost more \n     than $1.3 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years.\n\n  Kevin Phillips said, among other things:\n\n       The congressional leadership and the White House are so \n     wedded to an economic policy keyed to helping those at the \n     top that they lined up behind what is really a program to \n     make stock dividends into a 10-year, $300 billion individual \n     income tax shelter. This isn't just trickle down economics. \n     The benefits to the rest of the economy, even to the stock \n     market, are so conjectural that trickle down looks to become \n     misting down.\n\n  That is by Kevin Phillips, a Republican.\n  All we need to do is look in the Washington Post, which has run a \nstory by a man by the name of Allan Sloan, a Newsweek Wall Street \nreporter. He writes for Newsweek. The Washington Post ran this story. \nAmong other things, he says there are too many leaps of faith in the \nBush tax cut plan. He says that the debate is focused largely on the \nquestion of fairness and affordability.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full column of Allan Sloan be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Too Many Leaps of Faith in Bush Tax-Cut Plan\n\n                            (By Allan Sloan)\n\n       Do you remember those happy bygone boom days when the stock \n     market was going to save us from a variety of ills? Rising \n     stock prices would solve the problem of Social Security \n     shortfalls; boost federal, state and local income tax \n     revenue; and let us all retire young, rich and happy. It \n     never happened, of course. And now that stocks have been in a \n     three-year funk, we the taxpayers are being asked to bet \n     around $500 billion on the dubious proposition that we can \n     jack up stock prices by changing the way we tax dividends. \n     And that higher stock prices will bring back the good times \n     so many of us got used to in the late '90s.\n       What I'm talking about, of course, is the dividend tax cut \n     that's the heart of the proposed economic stimulus package \n     from President Bush, our MBA-in-chief.\n       The debate has focused largely on questions of fairness and \n     affordability, which are certainly important. But lost amid \n     the din are some important unanswered questions, such as \n     whether a $33 billion-a-year dividend tax cut can really \n     provide serious help for an ailing $10 trillion economy. And \n     whether a dividend cut whose benefit is concentrated among a \n     small number of high-income households is a better way to \n     jump-start the economy than House Democrats' proposals to \n     send out millions of one-time checks in the $300-to-$600 \n     range. And, finally, whether we should even be trying to \n     stimulate the economy with tax cuts, rather than letting it \n     seek its own path.\n       Bush's proposal is designed to eliminate double taxation of \n     dividends. That's when a corporation pays taxes on its \n     profits, then pays out after tax money as dividends to \n     investors who pay tax on them.\n       Bush's plan, simple in sound-bite form but horribly complex \n     in the real world, would make some cash dividends that \n     companies pay tax-free. But a company's status depends on how \n     much income tax it paid the IRS. So you wouldn't know what to \n     count on from year to year.\n       The Treasury estimates that the dividend package will \n     reduce tax revenue by $364 billion over 11 years--my $33 \n     billion-a-year number. But we'd have to pay years of interest \n     on a larger national debt, hence my $500 billion cost \n     estimate.\n       You've got to take several leaps of faith to believe a $33 \n     billion cut can bring back the good times. The leaps look \n     like this: Cutting dividend taxes jacks up stock prices. \n     Higher stock prices make capital cheaper, encouraging \n     companies to expand, adding jobs. Combine these jobs with the \n     good feelings\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\n     that higher stock prices would generate among the populace \n     and people run out and spend, stimulating the economy big \n     time. That's enough leaps to give you shin splints.\n       This is actually a simplified version of the thesis floated \n     by economists including R. Glenn Hubbard, head of Bush's \n     Council of Economic Advisers. At various times, Hubbard has \n     said that eliminating dividend taxes would raise stock prices \n     by 20 percent or 10 percent or 7.5 percent. He's co-written \n     papers asserting that dividend taxes depress stock prices. \n     But academic opinion is divided on the subject. Besides, \n     who'd risk $500 billion on an academic theory? Not me.\n       When you enter the real world, you run into more problems \n     with the dividend-cut-to-the-rescue plan. To wit: About half \n     the dividends eligible for this break go to non-taxpayers, \n     such as pension funds and retirement accounts, for whom tax \n     cuts are irrelevant. Besides, the big players who drive stock \n     prices--professional traders, hedge funds, mutual funds--are \n     generally rated on their results without taking taxes into \n     account.\n       Finally, the double-taxation problem is smaller than it \n     used to be. That's because corporations pay less income tax \n     (as a percent of profits) than they did before the advent of \n     aggressive corporate tax shelters, and dividends are far \n     lower, relative to stock prices, than in the pre-'90s days.\n       If we're going for quick stimulus through tax cuts--which \n     I'm not sure would work--I'd take the Democrats' version. If \n     we want to fix a long-term problem, I'd reform the hideous \n     alternative minimum tax. The AMT, a complex trap designed \n     three decades ago to keep richies from ducking taxes \n     entirely, has morphed into a monster that threatens millions \n     of middle- and upper-middle-income people.\n       The Bush tax package would mitigate the problem through \n     2005; Treasury types told me it would return in 2006. But the \n     Bushies can produce happy tables showing middle-income \n     people benefiting today. Apres moi, l'AMT.\n       Even though I think the idea of reducing dividend taxes to \n     stimulate the economy is not likely to work and would be a \n     terrible waste of public money, I love the way the Treasury \n     tax types want to implement it. Instead of just making all \n     dividend payments tax-free, which is what I thought would \n     happen when I wrote about this last month, Treasury has come \n     up with an elaborate plan to make sure that only stockholders \n     of tax-paying corporations benefit from this break.\n       One of the side effects of this proposal--which I doubt \n     that many people in the White House realized--is that each \n     corporation would have to announce every year how much in \n     federal income taxes, if any, it had paid.\n       Can you imagine the uproar when someone made a list like \n     that public?\n       Alas, even if this plan gets passed, I doubt we'll see this \n     type of disclosure. For what I'm sure are perfectly good \n     reasons, Treasury would allow companies to count foreign \n     income tax credits as taxes paid to the United States. So you \n     can see corporate America lining up to seek more loopholes--\n     add back the deductions for pollution bonds, employees \n     cashing in stock options, state, local and social Security \n     taxes, all sorts of other high-minded stuff--until the \n     disclosures would become meaningless. But you've got to \n     commend the Treasury people for being intellectually honest.\n       Letting corporations deduct interest payments but not \n     dividend payments has skewed balance sheets toward debt. \n     That's bad. But the way to fix it is to let corporations \n     deduct dividends the way they deduct interest. That idea \n     ``had a short shelf life,'' a Treasury tax techie said last \n     week, because it's much more costly then Bush's plan.\n       The idea that cutting dividend taxes will save us should \n     have a short shelf life, too. This is beyond voodoo \n     economics. It's just a mistake. Call it booboo economics.\n  Mr. REID. He says, among other things:\n\n       Letting corporations deduct interest payments but not \n     dividend payments has skewed balance sheets toward debt. \n     That's bad. But the way to fix it is to let corporations \n     deduct dividends the way they deduct interest. That idea \n     ``had a short shelf life,'' a Treasury tax techie said last \n     week, because it's much more costly than Bush's plan.\n\n  Last paragraph:\n\n       The idea that cutting dividend taxes will save us should \n     have a short shelf life, too. This is beyond voodoo economics \n     [which was a term President Bush number 1 used in the \n     campaign against President Reagan]. This is beyond voodoo \n     economics. It's just a mistake. Call it booboo economics.\n\n  Mr. President, the economic tax plan the President has given us is \nbad. It is something that is doomed to failure. If it passes, it will \nwreak havoc in this country. I hope that people of good will, Democrats \nand Republicans, will prevail upon the President to have him cry uncle \nand come forward with a reasonable proposal.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if my friend will yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know my colleagues are here. I have one point I want to \nmake, and then I am leaving the floor. I think it is an important \npoint. I wonder if my friend can let me know if he agrees. I think \nAmerica is now learning who benefits from this Bush plan. It is very \nclear. It is not rhetoric; it is fact. It is a boon to the millionaires \nand the billionaires, plain and simple. I know people in this very \nChamber who have come up and said: This is absurd. We would much rather \nsee a country that invests in its children, invests in its homeland \nsecurity, and that gives tax breaks to those in the middle. They are \nfighting to stop this ill-advised plan. You have made the case that it \nmakes no sense. We are talking about deficits as high as the eye can \nsee and people being rewarded who don't need to be helped. It is not \ngoing to stimulate this economy. In the long term, it will lead to \noutrageous deficits.\n  I ask my friend this question: Isn't it bad enough that this is a \nplan that won't do what we need; namely, have stimulus and long-term \nprosperity? Isn't it worse that at the same time the President is \nsaying let's cut all these taxes for the millionaires, he is shorting \nhomeland security and education? Our colleague, Paul Sarbanes, said it \nbest when he said we ought to call this plan ``leave no millionaire \nbehind.''\n  We have President Bush sign a bill called Leave No Child Behind. We \nare going to get a bill pretty soon here that breaks the promise he \nmade to the children of this country. He stood with Senator Kennedy, he \nstood with Congressman Miller, the champions of education and children, \nand now he will not fund it because he wants to give the money back. He \nis not funding homeland security, and our States are suffering as a \nresult.\n  So the juxtaposition of these two things--a plan that does not do the \njob, plus shorting our people in terms of education and homeland \ndefense--isn't this a time that we have not seen ever before, a \ndangerous time for our people?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from California that there are some at \n16th and Pennsylvania Avenue who have tried to place upon the \nDemocratic Senate that we are creating class warfare. My response to \nthat is, we have not created class warfare; they have.\n  I know the Senator from the State of California represents \napproximately 35 million people--35 million people. The Senator from \nCalifornia has had wide-ranging support over the years from poor, \nmiddle class, and the Senator from California received lots of support \nfrom very wealthy people. We are not opposed to rich people. They are \ngood for the country. But Senator Harkin and I were here on the floor \nyesterday, and both of us, from the State of Iowa and Nevada--and I \nwould like to hear from the three Senators on the floor--with New York \nnot being here and Texas not being here, the most populous States in \nthe Nation--Florida, Illinois, and California. I would like to know if \nyou have had a ground swell of calls, people calling you who are rich \nsaying please do this; it is good for the country.\n  I say to my friend from California, for Michael Eisner--and I know \nhim-- this tax boondoggle would give him an extra $2.6 million every \nyear. Michael Eisner does not need that tax break. Michael Eisner does \nnot want that. I say to my friend, is there anyone who has received \nphone calls from rich people saying: Please take away this dividend? \nNo, they would rather, as the Senator from California said, that the \nmoney be spent on making us more secure in the form of better educated \nchildren, better protected citizens in our hometowns. The Senator from \nCalifornia is right on target.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I accept the Senator's invitation for comment. I can \nremember a comment made to me, even as I stand here. The CEO of a \nFortune 500 corporation in Chicago, when I visited him and said: Do you \nbelieve the President's approach, tax breaks for the highest income \ncategories, is the right way to stimulate this economy? He said: Of \ncourse not; we have to create demand for goods and services.\n  He told me: I am not very popular in my country club.\n  Here is what I told him. Throughout history, millions of Americans \nhave sacrificed; they have given their lives to make this a great \nNation. Is it too much to ask the wealthiest people in this country to \npay their fair share of taxes? I do not think it is too much. These are \npeople who have been blessed\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nwith creativity, skill, energy, and success, and to say they are the \nones we are going to continue to reward defies any logic. Why are we \nnot trying to reward and help the struggling families who are trying to \npay their basic bills?\n  Take a look at this chart. In terms of the Bush tax cut, the benefit \nfor those making about $40,000 a year is $265, but if you happen to be \na millionaire--$1 million of annual income--the Bush tax cut is worth \nalmost $89,000.\n  Paul Sarbanes was right--and I am going to credit him for this only \none time and never again--the Bush tax cut is clearly a policy of leave \nno millionaire behind.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Every year?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Every year this is what it comes down to. Frankly, this \nis the average annual tax cut for millionaires, an annual tax cut of \n$89,000.\n  What does the President cut to provide these tax cuts? Money for \nschools. Under his program, the education legislation, No Child Left \nBehind, the schools have all the mandates for testing, for evaluation, \nand for improvement, but the President will not put the money on the \ntable. This is a President who posed for those holy pictures with the \nleaders in education in Congress, saying he was the education \nPresident, and yet when Mitch Daniels and OMB had a chance to write a \nbudget, they did not put the money there. It is an unfunded mandate to \nthe States when the States are desperately in trouble. The President \ncannot find the money to fund education, to fund his bill, but he can \nfind money for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America. He has \nabandoned No Child Left Behind so he can embrace a tax policy of no \nmillionaire left behind, and that to me is unforgivable.\n  That is the difference in the approach between the two parties, and \nthat is the difference we need to dramatize as we talk about tax policy \nand spending policy in this Congress.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. If I can respond to the Senator from Illinois. Senator \nHarkin has done a wonderful job working with Senator Specter on the \nappropriations subcommittee dealing with Health and Human Services, \nLabor-HHS, and he has done a lot for making sure we have money for \nschool construction. We do not have nearly what we need. A little bit \nhelps.\n\n  The unfunded school construction in this country today, as we speak, \nis $189 billion. The average school in America is 45 years old. A lot \nof places, Florida and Nevada especially, have rapid growth and need to \nbuild new schools, and school districts are at the limit of what they \ncan do with floating bonds.\n  The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. I was in the Chamber \nwhen the Senator from Illinois said schools are cutting back to 4-day \nweeks. When we are fighting to keep up with the demand of modern \neducation, we are cutting back a day of these young kids' lives. I \nthink it is just awful.\n  I so much appreciate the Senator from Illinois bringing to our \nattention that we have to take care of priorities. Where are these tax \ncuts coming from? It is not as if there is a big building someplace \ndown at 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue where they can go in and start \nhauling out wheelbarrows of money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield? They are coming from the Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. When baby boomers are about to retire and counting on \nSocial Security, we are going to have the trust funds even deeper in \ndebt, and the debt we are leaving behind is for our children and \ngrandchildren.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss this same \nissue and do it with a different approach. We have been talking about \nthe unconscionable cuts in education. We are about to see some huge \ncuts in homeland defense. A lot of this burden is being shifted to the \nStates.\n  On the question of local law enforcement and the question of port \nsecurity, my State of Florida has 14 deep-water ports. The ports are an \nobvious target for those who are trying to do bad things to us. Right \nnow only 3 percent of all the containers coming into this country are, \nin fact, inspected. A lot of this financial burden is being shifted to \nthe States with the cuts that are being proposed in this coming \nappropriations bill to homeland defense.\n  Wait until there is another attack, and then what is going to be the \nanswer when this administration did not insist on an appropriations \nbill that would fully fund the adequate protection for this country's \nhomeland?\n  To come back to the issue of a tax cut, coming from Florida, I have a \nlot of folks who are retirees with a percentage of the population that \nis well above the national average--that is 65 and above--and, \ntherefore, a lot of our population looks to income from dividends. In \nan ideal world, it would certainly be good if we could cut the tax on \ndividends and eliminate it, but we are not in an ideal world. We are in \na war. We have increased expenses for war and, at the same time, we are \nin a sick economy.\n  We need to get this economy moving again. We need to stimulate this \neconomy. How can we do that? We can do it by putting dollars in the \npockets of everyone across the board so they will spend and let those \ndollars circulate through the economy and, thus, rev up the economic \nengine.\n  There is something else we can do with regard to business. We can \ngive business the incentive to invest in more plant and equipment in \nthe short term to create more jobs and to get the engine of the economy \nstoked up again. How can we do that? We can accelerate depreciation--\nnot 5 years from now, not 3 years from now, but accelerate depreciation \nin the next year.\n  If we are looking at what works with regard to stimulating the \neconomy, it would be my suggestion--and I think this is common sense--\nwe pick tax policies and tax cuts that will directly do that now, not \nsome hoped-for stimulation several years down the road.\n  When we balance that against all the needs in a huge deficit \nsituation that is being projected as $250 billion in this present \nfiscal year--in other words, we are spending $250 billion more than we \nhave coming in in tax revenue. When we realize that the sick economy \nis, in part, a reflection of lack of confidence of the American people \nin the future of the economy because of the deficit spending, while at \nthe same time we are going into a war where we are going to have more \nexpenditures, then the tax cuts that should be used should be \nsurgically and strategically determined in order to stimulate the \neconomy.\n\n  It would be this Senator's opinion that even though I would like very \nmuch to eliminate the tax on dividends and that would help a lot of my \npeople, the first requirement of our people in Florida and this country \nis to get this economy moving again and to stimulate the economy. We \ncould be much wiser in how we approach our ultimate decision on this \nstimulus of the economy through a tax cut.\n  I have been quite disturbed by what I see emerging as a means of \ncramming an appropriations bill down the throat of Congress by bringing \nabout a number of major cuts in homeland security and education. The \nmechanism that is being employed is under the gun of shutting down the \nGovernment at the end of this month. A continuing resolution is being \nproposed, which is a resolution that continues the funding of \nGovernment under last year's appropriations levels, up through the end \nof this month, but there is a threat of shutting down the Government on \nJanuary 31 unless there is a new continuing resolution or continuing \nfunding of the Government. There are huge cuts being proposed in \nhomeland security and education but some of us are going to fight that \nas not in the best interest of this country.\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\n  Ultimately, we are being maneuvered into a position, are you going to \nshut down the Government by refusing to enact a continuing resolution \nor are you going to accept that and accept it at last year's levels, \nwhich would totally not have our country prepared for the defense of \nthis homeland? That does not make sense to this Senator, and that is \nnot in the interest of my State particularly since it seems as if \nwhatever happens often happens first in Florida.\n  Anthrax happened. We even had a kid flying a plane into a tall \nbuilding. We have the threats in the 14 deepwater ports in Florida of \nwhat kind of cargo could come in that would never be inspected. It \ncould not even come in on a commercial cargo ship. It could come in on \na pleasure craft. So many of the ports of this Nation have deepwater \naccess all the way up to a highly urbanized downtown area. There is the \nopportunity for mischief by those who want to do damage to the United \nStates.\n  I urge upon my colleagues that we be very careful as we approach \nthese decisions on the appropriations bills, and on the concurrent \ndecisions on tax policy, that we do what is in the interest of the \ndefense of this country and also in the interest of the stimulus of \ngetting this sick economy moving again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need to \ntruly stimulate our economy and create jobs and how we can do that in a \nway that is fair for everyone, that puts dollars back in the pockets of \nmiddle-class Americans who we know literally drive the economic engine \nby buying cars, homes, clothes for their children, groceries, and all \nof the other purchases that keep our economy going.\n  I have grave concerns about the so-called economic proposal that has \ncome from the President. In fact, it does not meet the definition of \nthat term, and I have great concern because it does not put the \nmajority of money back in the pockets of people who drive the economic \nengine.\n  We can come together on issues such as eliminating the marriage tax \npenalty, increasing the child credit, and helping small businesses, \nwhich by the way are the majority of new jobs being created today. The \nmajority of new jobs is coming from small businesses. We need to be \nfocusing on ways to help small businesses pay for their health care and \nto have the kinds of incentives they need to invest back in their \ncompanies so they will grow.\n  When we look at the proposal the President has brought forward, if we \nwere to come together, we could easily pass relief as it relates to the \nmarriage tax penalty, with bipartisan support. We could easily pass \nincreases in the child tax credit on a bipartisan basis. We could \neasily support small business in ways that we can provide tax relief \nand other kinds of support.\n  The problem is two-thirds of the President's plan, the vast majority, \ndoes not do any of that. Two-thirds of the plan is focused on the very \ntop income earners in the United States who already have one, two, or \nthree homes, multiple cars, and who are not necessarily going to be \nspending these dollars back into the economy, at the expense of \neveryone else.\n  When we look at what this proposal from the White House means to \nAmericans, taxpayers with incomes of over $1 million would get back an \naverage of $88,873, almost $89,000 coming back to them. The majority of \ntaxpayers, the typical middle-class taxpayer in the United States of \nAmerica, would get $265. That is a huge disparity.\n  Some say, well, if we talk about the differences, if we talk about \nthe fact that the majority goes to those at the very top, we are \nengaged in class warfare. With all due respect, that is a bunch of \nbaloney. We are talking about how we can fairly put money into people's \npockets. We want to make sure the majority of the middle-income \ntaxpayers, the ones who are keeping the engine going, have tax relief \nand get dollars back in their pockets. Of course, that happens in a \nvariety of ways. Tax relief is one. This kind of a difference is not \nfair. It is simply not fair.\n\n  There is another way to make sure we have money in people's pockets. \nThat is to make sure we are not exploding the national debt and causing \ninterest rates to rise. There is another kind of tax on people we went \nthrough in the 1980s and the 1990s. That is high interest rates. When \ncitizens buy an automobile--coming from Michigan, I am very interested \nin people buying a lot of automobiles, a lot of domestically made, \nAmerican-made automobiles; we want people to be able to afford that--\nhigh interest rates affect your ability to buy that new car. High \ninterest rates affect your ability to buy your new home, or to be able \nto afford to send your children to college. Interest rates which \ndirectly relate to the national debt affect how much money goes in \npeople's pockets.\n  This proposal of the President is not fair on its face. We are \nlooking at the top .2 percent, 226,000 millionaires, receive more than \nhalf, almost two-thirds of all of the tax cuts being imposed; 68 \npercent of the people receive $15 billion; and .2 percent of the \ntaxpayers get $20 billion. It is not fair on its face. If you add in \nthe fact this is a proposal that will greatly increase the national \ndebt on the back end, what we are doing is saddling these middle-class \ntaxpayers and our baby boomers--of which I am one--and our children and \ngrandchildren with more debt. We will increase interest rates and take \nmore money out of people's pockets.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask my friend from Michigan to withhold.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to share some memories with my \ncolleagues. As I watched what is going on in this body, I was trying to \nthink of something. I have seen this before. It is sort of a deja vu \nall over again. I was thinking back to maybe 14 or 15 years ago when my \nson was playing T-ball. You remember T-ball? That is the kids' game.\n  The kindergarteners played T-ball. They had a lot of fun. But in one \ngame we had a problem because after the other side was out, they had \ntheir outs and they were finished, they wouldn't put down their bats \nand go out in the field. They didn't want to play the game. They \nthought that once they had been at bat they were going to stay at bat, \neven though their side was out and it was time for them to leave.\n  The more I thought about it, the more I thought maybe that is what is \nhappening in the Senate today. We had an election and the people of \nAmerica sent some new Republicans, a new Democrat or two, to \nWashington, and they established a 51-to-48-plus-1 majority. I mean, 51 \nis more than 48. It is more than 48 plus 1. It seems to me it would be \ncommon math, it would be reasonable politics, it would be just common \ncivility, to say once you have a majority and the people of America \nhave voted for members of the Republican Party to be the leadership, to \nbe the majority party in the Senate, it ought to move forward.\n  All the time I have been here, once we have had an election we have \nshifted power, if there has been a shift in power. A year and a half \nago when one of our Members switched and we lost the majority, I handed \nover the gavel immediately to my ranking member and she became the \nChair. That is because this is a democracy. That is how this is \nsupposed to work. We are supposed to have reasonable rules.\n  But today I am reminded of that T-ball game when the side that was \nout, they had lost but wouldn't put down their bats and go out in the \nfield. Guess what. The game can't go on. Everybody is a loser.\n  This is not a T-ball game. This is time to handle the business of \nthis Nation. The people of America voted for us. They voted for \nRepublicans and Democrats. They voted for House Members and Senate \nMembers because they expected us to come to Washington and be serious \nabout doing the people's business.\n  One of the defining marks of democracies in the modern day is that \nthere is a peaceful transition of power. The winners take over and \nlead. The losers relinquish their leadership and join in the \ngovernmental efforts. That is the rule in democracies throughout the \nworld.\n  Here is the U.S. Senate sticking out like a sore thumb, an exception \nto the principle that when there is an election and there is a change \nof power, the winning side takes over. This is truly regrettable when \nwe have so much business to be done. We have all the business that did \nnot get done last year. Unfortunately, I believe the leadership last \nyear would not let us go to a budget.\n  They wouldn't let us pass appropriations bills. As a result, we are \nnow funding 11 of the 13 appropriations bills for the jurisdictional \nfunctions of the Federal Government based on a continuing resolution. \nThings have changed. We need more money for these functions. We need to \npass appropriations bills. We are ready to move on appropriations \nbills, but we can't set up a committee. We can't get the committee set \nup until we pass a resolution and find out who is on the committee.\n  This is a serious failure to live up to our responsibility, to do the \nwork the people of America have a right to expect us to do. The longer \nwe wait, the more difficult the appropriations process is going to be, \nand the more difficult it will be for us to do this year's work, which \nis to do the 2004 appropriations bills.\n  There are a lot of things we really shouldn't even have to bother \nwith on the floor. The T-ball team is not just keeping the bats. They \nare saying some of our people who have assumed new leadership positions \ncan't even get into leadership offices.\n  This is a new day. This is 2003. There was an election in November of \n2002. The people in the United States by their votes said you as \nRepublicans should move forward. We can't do that. We can't do that \nuntil we get cooperation.\n  This is a body that operates on common decency, respect, and \ncivility. It works on unanimous consent. Obviously, we can't get \nunanimous consent. We haven't so far. There are a lot of arguments in \nthe negotiations. But the fact is we need to get on to the people's \nbusiness. I can tell you, I know our majority leader, Bill Frist. He is \na man who is more than willing to make decent provisions for the \nminority, and he will do that. But nothing we say is good enough. We \ncan't move forward in this circumstance.\n  I think that is a real tragedy. We have a lot of work to do this \nyear. We need to confirm judges to make sure our judiciary works. We \nneed to pass an energy bill. We are looking at possible hostilities in \nthe Middle East where we face potentially a cutoff of some of our \nsupply of petroleum. What are we going to do about it? We haven't had \nan energy policy for 9 or 10 years. Our energy policy bill last year \nwas blocked. This year wouldn't it be nice if we allowed the Energy \nCommittee to work on a bipartisan basis and report a bill out to the \nfloor, then vote on it, send it over to the House, work in conference, \nand bring it back to vote it up or down? We ought to be doing that. But \nwe haven't done that.\n  There are some who suggest maybe the Democratic Party lost the \nelection because they were obstructionist. I happen to think that is \ntrue. I happen to think that was one of the most telling arguments in \ncampaigns in which I participated. People of America don't want to see \nobstruction, roadblocks, and red tape. There are others who say, Well, \nmaybe the Democrats lost because they weren't confrontational enough \nand they weren't obstructionist. It looks like those people have won \nthe day, or at least they are calling the shots. I believe many of my \nDemocratic colleagues would feel the way I do. They know the election \nis over. They know we have some very important work to do this year. We \nhave to do the basic appropriations to get the Government operating and \nto fund programs. We need to do an energy bill. We have to do a highway \nbill this year.\n  If you are worried about where we are going to get stimulus, as some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, we need stimulus \nto make sure we have a highway bill that continues funding of the \nvitally important construction on our Nation's highways. That is one of \nthe most important bills we are going to have to pass this year. But we \ncan't do it when we can't even get the Senate organized.\n\n  I am very discouraged. I am very discouraged that we have run into \nthis problem. I hope the people who are listening or watching back home \nwill call, write, or e-mail. I guess you can't write anymore. You can't \nwrite us here. You can write to our offices in our States, call, and \nsend faxes and messages, and tell those of us who are in the Senate it \nis time for us to get to work.\n  All of last year I waited to bring an appropriations bill to the \nfloor under the good leadership of my colleague and friend who was \nchairman at the time. I am still waiting to bring an appropriations \nbill to the floor. It is a bipartisan bill. It is one we have worked \non. We will work on it together, and it will be a bill which we hope \nreflects the\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\ninterests of people on both sides of this aisle. But we can't do it \nuntil the other side lets us move forward.\n  A lot of people do not understand the Senate is a deliberative body. \nIt requires unanimous consent. Most of the time I have been here, we \nhave been a deliberative and decent body. We are a decent body, and we \nwill move forward. But now we have become the world's greatest dilatory \nbody. We can't get anything moving until the other side lets us.\n  We need a stimulus bill. I will address that later.\n  I think the President has put forth a good plan to help families. A \ntypical family of four with two wage earners with a combined income of \n$39,000 would receive a total of $1,100 in tax relief. The Council of \nEconomic Advisers said the plan would create 2.1 million jobs over the \nnext 3 years.\n  As one who has spent a lot of time since I have been here working for \nsmall business, I can tell you this is a bill small business needs. We \nin the Small Business Committee have long urged an increase in the \namount of expenses a small business can do from $25,000 to $75,000. So \nthe smallest of the small businesses under $300,000-plus revenue can \nwrite off immediately and they don't have to go through depreciation \nand write off against immediate income capital expenditures up to \n$75,000.\n  Second, by bringing the reduction in individual rates forward, you \nare benefiting small business. Twenty-three million small businesses \nare taxed as individuals. They are set up either as proprietorships, \npartnerships, or subchapter S corporations. So those 23 million small \nbusinesses are taxed at the individual rate. Putting this money back \ninto their pockets will give them the money to hire workers, to invest \nand to expand and grow their business.\n  That is an argument for the day when we actually can get to work in \nthe Senate and we can have committees. God bless the committee system. \nHave them work and have them put out bills. They have to put them out \non a bipartisan basis. We will bring them to the floor, and we will \ndebate them and discuss them and work on them on a bipartisan basis. \nUnfortunately and regrettably, that can't happen until this gridlock is \nbroken.\n  I call upon my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to recognize \nthe tremendous needs. These are more compelling needs than in previous \nyears because we didn't get our work done last year. Let us get over \nthis gridlock--this deadlock. Let us get going with the business of the \nSenate.\n  I urge all our colleagues to come together and work on this. I hope \nwe can do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my friend and \ncolleague from Missouri for his statement. I wish to make a few \nadditional comments as well.\n  This is my 23rd year in the Senate. Every 2 years we have passed an \norganizing resolution within a couple of days of the House and the \nSenate reconvening--almost always on the first or second day; always \nwithin a week. Every 2 years for the last 20-some years we have done \nthat within a couple of days. This year we haven't because our friends \nand colleagues on the Democrat side have objected. I am embarrassed by \ntheir objection. The resolution the majority leader introduced is \nbasically pro forma. It should have been done on the first day. It \nrecognizes the newly elected Senators and the committees on which they \nhave chosen to serve. It also recognizes the new chairmanships as a \nresult of the elections.\n\n  That is only appropriate. It is only proper. It is only fitting. It \nis normal course. It is standard practice. And it should have been done \nby unanimous consent, without any objection.\n  It has happened every year I have been in the Senate--or every other \nyear. We do it at the beginning of every new Congress. But this year, \nfor whatever reason, our colleagues on the Democrat side decided to \nobject. They indicated they would filibuster. I urge them not to. I \nurge them to keep in mind we do serve and are privileged to serve in \nprobably the greatest deliberative, elected body in the history of the \nworld. Senator Byrd may come over and talk about the Roman Senate, but \ncertainly this rivals the Roman Senate. But this is not our finest \nhour.\n  If the Democrats are saying, wait a minute, we are going to insist on \nmaintaining chairmanship of the committees, they are really refuting \nthe elected will of the people which they made clear last November.\n  In my term in the Senate, there has been a change in leadership and a \nchange in committees done automatically, within a couple of days. It \nhappened in 1981, as a result of the 1980 elections. It happened in \n1987, as a result of the 1986 elections. It happened in 1995, as a \nresult of the 1994 elections. It happened in the year 2000, as a result \nof the Senator Jeffords switch. And it happened immediately. There was \nno prolonged debate on this side, saying: Wait a minute. This is not \nfair. As a matter of fact, gavels were handed over.\n  So it is almost as if the minority party or the Democrat Party said: \nWait a minute. We don't want to be in the minority so we are going to \ndelay process indefinitely. I just read an e-mail that basically said \nthat. It said: We will continue to chair.\n  I am or will be the new chairman of the Budget Committee. I scheduled \na hearing with Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, to \ntestify today. I had to postpone that because of this embarrassment. I \nam embarrassed for the Senate. I love this institution. And to see our \ncolleagues on the other side denigrate the reputation of the Senate, by \nfalsely trying to assume that they maintain chairmanships of these \ncommittees, is ridiculous.\n  So I urge my colleagues--I see the assistant Democrat leader and \nwhip. I urge my colleagues: Enough. Let's think of the institution. \nLet's think of the Senate. Let's think of the traditions of the Senate. \nLet's think of regular order in the Senate. Let's think of the \nreputation of the Senate and not fall down into this kind of partisan \nploy to obstruct.\n  And now I have read a letter that said: Well, we don't want to get \nthis solved until we get a certain ratio of money. You are going to get \nplenty of money for committees. I think everybody knows that. Or maybe: \nWe don't want to do this until we have an agreement on square footage \nin each office space. That is ridiculous. Those negotiations usually \ntake months.\n  Or now I see a letter that says: Well, we don't want to have an \norganizational resolution until we have an agreement on the \nconfirmation of judges and how many will be taken up at what time. That \nis, again, totally ridiculous, totally out of line, totally contrary to \nthe great traditions of the Senate.\n  We are all, I think, proud to serve in the Senate, but this is \ndenigrating to the Senate. We need to think of the reputation of the \nSenate. We need to show other countries, which have struggling \ndemocracies, that you can have a transition of power, and it can move \nvery seamlessly and very smoothly and very appropriately, and not have \nsomething such as this lingering. What kind of example is this to set \nfor other countries that have aspirations for democracy to see this \nkind of episode?\n\n  This is not our finest hour. This is an embarrassment. So I implore \nour colleagues, for the sake of the Senate, for the institution in \nwhich we have the pleasure and privilege to serve, for the \nConstitution, that we should work together, that we should have a \nsmooth, seamless transition of power within our body, within our \ncommittees, and let's work together.\n  This is not a good start. The tradition of the Senate is, when we \ncome back from election time, and we come back from Christmas break, \nand holidays, that we are in a good spirit, and that we shake hands, \nand that we put elections behind us and say we are going to work \ntogether for the good of the country. And, oh, yes, maybe in the second \nyear, at some point--late in the second year--we will start worrying \nabout elections.\n  Now it seems as if people are more worried about the elections. We \nhave everybody announcing they are running for President, and \nPresidential elections are starting 2 years in advance. And the Senate \nis already somewhat in a quagmire, not even operating because some \npeople think: Well, maybe we will be better off if we just\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nobstruct. We will not even let the committees organize. And I read that \nin an e-mail.\n  That is not the way to run the Senate. That is not the way to serve \nin the Senate. So again, I implore upon my friends--and I have many \nfriends on the Democrat side--let's think of what is right for the \ninstitution, for this body, for democracy as a whole, and let's work \ntogether.\n  We have a lot of unfinished business to do. Maybe people do not want \nto do it, but we have 11 out of 13 appropriations bills that have not \nbeen passed from last year. We are already in fiscal year 2003. We have \nalready finished 3 months of fiscal year 2003. We need to finish those \nappropriations bills. We need to have those amounts fixed so we can \nbase that for the 2004 budget.\n  We have a lot of work to do. We have international threats, certainly \nin Iraq, possibly in Korea. We have a war on terrorism. We have a lot \nof work to do that is far more important than partisan gamesmanship. We \nneed to think of what is important for our country. We ought to at \nleast have a grace period where we put partisanship aside and where we \nwork together for the good of the country.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's do what the tradition of the Senate has \nalways done; let's reorganize now. Let's do it without objection. Let's \nwork together. Let's finish some of our unfinished business. And let's \nwork together to tackle some of the real critical problems we have \nconfronting our country today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to, before the Senator leaves, quote \nthe Senator, make a couple comments, and maybe have the Senator respond \nto a question. Would that be permissible to the Senator from Oklahoma?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have not yielded the floor. I would be happy to yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma and I have had the \ngood fortune, at least from my perspective, of working together on a \nnumber of items while we have served together in the Senate. We had \nserved together on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee \nfor a number of years. I think we did some good things for the \ninstitutions, both the Senate and the House. I enjoyed and have \nappreciated working with him. We also worked on the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee and, I think, did some good things for the \ncountry.\n  So the only reason I say this is that I have great respect and \nadmiration for the distinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma. I have \nvery rarely known him to speak anything that was not factual, but I \nwould like to just bring one thing to the Senator's attention today \nthat really was not factual.\n  This is not a direct quote but pretty close: Within a couple of days \nafter an election there's always been a reorganization to take place--\nwords to that effect. My friend said he was embarrassed because there \nhas not been one that has followed this tradition during the 108th \nCongress.\n  I say to my friend, I know you have a good memory, so this must be \nsomething that you forgot, because during the 107th Congress, when we \nbecame the majority party, it took us 6 weeks to organize.\n  Now, I do not think that Senator Frist----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That would be what year?\n  Mr. REID. The year 2001.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong, but at what date did we pass a \nresolution announcing the chairmanships of the committees?\n  Mr. REID. Six weeks after Senator Jeffords changed parties.\n  Mr. NICKLES. No. Correct me if I am wrong, but in January of 2001, we \npassed a resolution quickly, announcing who would be committee chairs.\n  Mr. REID. I don't really know that. We had a lot of negotiations \nbecause it was a very unique situation. We had 50-50, of which the only \ntime that happened previously, that I am aware of, was in 1880.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I did not serve in 1880. But I still believe that early \nin January we passed a resolution announcing who the committee chairs \nwere. And I also believe--correct me if I am wrong; and I am happy to \nbe corrected--after Senator Jeffords switched, we had an automatic \ntransition of who was to be committee chairmen, and I believe that \nhappened in June of 2001.\n\n  Mr. REID. From the time he switched to the time we, in effect, were \nable to go forward on the basis of the new majority, it took 6 weeks.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, again, I think he announced \nhe was switching, but I think he delayed it until we passed the tax \nbill. As a matter of fact, if memory serves me correctly--and I am \nstretching it--I believe Senator Jeffords announced his intentions to \nswitch, and some of us tried hard to dissuade him from that. I believe \nhe also said his switch would not be effective until after we passed \nPresident Bush's tax bill, which took a few weeks, which we did pass; \nand I believe shortly after the conclusion of passing that bill, he did \nannounce his affiliation as an Independent but his alignment with \nDemocrats; and I believe--I may well be corrected--shortly after that, \nnot when he announced his intention, but after he announced he would do \nthat, after we passed the tax bill, there was a transition of power \nalmost immediately in all the committees.\n  In the Jeffords case, it was a little different because that wasn't \nan election, that was a switch, and that was not as a result of \nelections, that was a unique scenario. This is not a unique scenario. \nWe have had 108 Congresses, and every Congress, until now, to my \nknowledge, after convening at the beginning of the Congress, has \nelected its chairmanships and assigned committee members. We have 10 \nnew Senators--11, if you count Senator Lautenberg who haven't even been \nformally assigned to committees. I was scheduled to have a hearing with \nChairman Greenspan. I will have seven new members on the committee, and \nwe could not have them sit in on that hearing. How absurd is that?\n  I urge my colleague--I will refresh my memory on the Jeffords case, \nbut let us work together. This is so unlike the tradition of the \nSenate. I see my colleague from Maryland here who I know has a love for \nthis institution. This is denigrating to this institution and sending a \nterrible signal to those other countries that have fledgling \ndemocracies, to say, wait a minute, there was an election and a change \nin power but the Democrats are not relinquishing that power.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Since my colleague from Oklahoma is drawing me into \nthis matter.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold for a moment, I would like to \nrespond to the statements made by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  First of all, I agree; I think it would be tremendous if we could \nhave this reorganization resolution passed 20 minutes from now. But it \nis more than chairmen appointing members to committees. I think \nturnabout is fair play. As Senator Durbin said, the golden rule should \napply here, and that is that we have the same status as when the Senate \nwas 51-49 Democrats. It is now 51-49 Republicans. We will take the deal \nthat we gave them, the same deal. We want the same makeup as when we \nwere 51.\n  I agree that we should do something about appropriations bills. I \nagree that we should not have Presidential campaigns as long as they \nare. But the issue before the Senate is not that. The issue is, why \ncan't we have the same rules that were in effect 3 months ago in effect \ntoday? Simply because the roles are reversed and we have a new \nmajority, that doesn't mean the new minority has to take a lot less.\n\n  I yield to my friend from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that what is holding up the \norganizing resolution is a difference in the course of organizing, how \nwe allocate resources, and that all this side of the aisle is seeking, \nnow that it is in the minority, is that we be treated the same way the \nother side of the aisle was treated in the last Congress when they went \ninto the minority; is that not correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. This \nmatter\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\ncould be resolved, as I indicated a few minutes ago, in 10 minutes. The \nonly thing we want is the same rule that applied when the Senate was \n51-49 Democrats.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In other words, all we are seeking is that the majority \nnow accord us as a minority the same treatment that we accorded to them \nwhen they were in the minority and we were the majority. That seems to \nme an eminently reasonable and fair thing to be seeking. I cannot, for \nthe life of me, understand why we cannot quickly reach an understanding \non that basis and move the organizing resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respond to my friend because here is what \nthey have done. They have a resolution before the Senate now that says \nwhat we want to do is appoint chairmen and members of the committees \nand we will leave the rest to further negotiations.\n  The Senator from Maryland is much more experienced than I. But the \nSenator from Maryland and I both know that if the chairmen and members \nare placed on the committees, this is all over with and the committees \nwill wind up with far less resources and the ranking members will not \nbe treated as we treated theirs. It will be a totally different ball \ngame. We want to have the same ball game and the same rules as were \napplied when we were in the majority. That seems fair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, my understanding is that we have \ntreated the organizing resolution as encompassing the allocation of \nresources in the past.\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, we have not.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We certainly did so in the 107th Congress. In the 107th \nCongress, when it came to that question and we became the majority, we \naccorded, I think, a very fair and eminently reasonable treatment to \nthe minority, and that is all we are seeking in the current \ncircumstance. I don't understand what the problem is or the difficulty \nin accepting that arrangement. That is what I don't understand.\n  Mr. REID. I will also interrupt and say this to my friend: One of the \nreasons this is going on--and we kind of beat around the bush and dance \naround it--the majority had a really serious problem after the \nelection; that is, they were having trouble finding out who was going \nto be the Republican leader. Prior to Senator Lott stepping down, \nSenator Daschle and Senator Lott had a number of communications and \nconversations and meetings as to how they would proceed. That took \nweeks and weeks after Senator Lott gave the speech we all know about \nnow, and just recently they chose a new leader. It has put us behind. \nIt is not our fault.\n  All we want is to be treated exactly the same--not one iota \ndifferently--as we treated them; that is, let's use the last 18 months \nduring the 107th Congress as the model for how we should be treated \ntoday.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that there was, in a sense, a \ndelay on the Republican side in terms of choosing their leader and then \nbeing in a position to discuss these issues with our leader, Senator \nDaschle. I have not raised the issue about that being a factor in the \ndelay, but obviously it is part of the matter. But now that that has \nbeen resolved, it seems to me we ought to be able to reach a fairly \nquick agreement here if we simply abide by the concept of reciprocal \ntreatment.\n  It seems to me that we tried very hard in the last Congress to be \nfair about this. I think we were fair and eminently reasonable. It \nseems to me a fair and eminently reasonable request now that the same \ntreatment be accorded to us in the minority that we accorded to the \nminority in the last Congress. If we could accept what I think is an \nalmost elementary principle, this matter could be settled, and could it \nnot be settled in very short order?\n  Mr. REID. In a matter of minutes. The resolution before the body \ntoday makes the appointments for Republican members of the committees. \nThat is all it does. It doesn't take into consideration all the other \nthings that make this complicated body function, which is through the \ncommittee system. As anybody reading the basic text of how the Senate \nworks knows, we operate through the committee system. We are not a \ncommittee of the whole. We work through committees.\n  We have tried to establish fairness in the distribution of resources \nand certainly membership on the committees. When there is such a close \ndivision between the majority and minority, one of which was caused by \nthe death of Senator Paul Wellstone--he was killed, unfortunately--as a \nresult of the very closeness of the Senate, 51 to 49, which it was just \nlast year, why shouldn't we have the same rules dealing with committees \nnow as we did then? That is the whole point.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend. I have the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yielded to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be happy to give him the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator would.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have a couple comments. One, I am going \nto be very strict when people start engaging in dialog and not going \nthrough the Chair. The Senate is a great institution. It is not a \nlittle chat club. I am warning my colleagues, they should go through \nthe Chair.\n  To say that when we do a Senate reorganizing resolution, we are \nsupposed to solve staffing allocations, room allocations, and now blue-\nslip policies on appellate court judges, that is absurd. It has never \nbeen done.\n  In the last Congress, after the Jeffords switch, there was a \nreorganizing resolution. It did mention staff, and it should not have.\n  Mr. REID. Should or should not?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Should not have. That was the breaking of a precedent in \nevery Congress of never mentioning the funding resolution.\n  Mr. President, 1977 was the first time funding was ever raised, and I \ndo not believe it was part of the reorganizing resolution. It did say \nthe minority should get one-third.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will not yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Just for a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will not yield. My point being, the tradition of the \nSenate has always been to adopt a resolution announcing the individuals \nserving on committees and that this person or that person will be \nchairman of a committee. That has always been the tradition of the \nSenate.\n  We broke tradition last year, and it was a terrible precedent to set \nbecause now if we are going to do a reorganization now, we have to \nnegotiate wages, staff allotment, space allotment, and now people are \ntrying to bring in blue slips. They are trying to drag in all kinds of \nissues so basically they can obstruct the Senate. That is absurd.\n  Let's pass the resolution as we have done for the last 200-some years \nin the Senate, and say: Here is the organizing resolution; here are the \ncommittees on which you will serve.\n  I have been in the Senate for 22 years, and that is what we have done \nin at least 21 out of the 22 years, and I would venture to say we did \nit 22 out of 22 years. The aberration being in the middle of last year \nafter the Jeffords switch in 2001. I believe that was a mistake. \nObviously, it was a mistake because we can have the Senate tied up in \nknots for weeks discussing all kinds of trivial issues that, frankly, \nshould be decided by the Rules Committee, not by the Senate, not by \nreorganization.\n  Reorganization is assigning individuals as chairmen and new members \nof a committee so they can serve on their committees; so we can staff \nthe committees; so we can have hearings; so we can have Chairman \nGreenspan today; so we can have hearings on nominees; so we can get our \nwork done; so the chairman of the Appropriations Committee can bring \nforward the unfinished business; so we can move on and discuss space \nallotment.\n\n  We can discuss staff allotment, and we can discuss blue-slip policy \nin committees which have their work cut out to work on those issues. It \nshould not be in a reorganization resolution. That was a mistake last \nyear, in my opinion. It was the first time we did it, I believe--this \nis now my 23rd year--for 22\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\nyears we always adopted a resolution that said: Here are the \ncommittees.\n  Now people are trying to put on more bells and whistles: Before we do \ncommittees, we have to get this. That is absurd. That is designed to \nfail. That is designed to obstruct. That is designed to say: We are not \ngoing to let you chair this committee unless you give us our way on \nblue-slip policy. Now we are going to give Senators vetoes on circuit \ncourt appellate judges which we have never had? It is a case of maybe \nthe minority not wanting to relinquish their majority or wanting to \npretend they are the majority just to obstruct the majority that is \ntrying to get some work done. It is really indefensible.\n  Again, I implore my colleagues who love this institution, let's work \ntogether. Let's adopt this reorganizing resolution. It does exactly \nwhat my colleague from Nevada said. It says: Here are the committee \nchairs; here are the members of the committees. The minority needs to \nadopt the same resolution: Here are the members of the committees. Then \nlet's go to work.\n  The funding issue is not that big an issue. It is very close to being \nsolved. The space allotment is not that big of an issue. It is close to \nbeing resolved. But it should not be resolved as part of this \nresolution.\n  This resolution says who will be committee chairs, and we should \nadopt it today. There is a lot of serious work that needs to be done. \nLet the Rules Committee do its work. That is what the Rules Committee \nis for, to divvy up space and work on allotments.\n  I worked with my colleague from Nevada, and I am very interested in \nbeing fair on space and being fair on committee allotments, but that \nshould not be done now. What should be done now is to adopt this \nresolution so we can have a confirmation hearing on the nominee for \nTreasury Secretary and so we can have a hearing on the nominee for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, so we can have Chairman Greenspan \ntestify before the Committee on the Budget about the economy so we can \nmove our Nation's business forward, so we can take up the \nappropriations bills and try to get caught up on some of the work on \nwhich we are behind.\n  It is absurd to tie it to getting this and that; we did it last year. \nLast year was unique, and maybe we did not solve it right. Let's look \nback at the tradition of the Senate and at all those struggling \ndemocracies around the world. They look to us with great pride. When \nthey visit the United States, they love to come to the Senate. They \nwant to see a functioning democracy.\n  In my years in the Senate, we changed power, we changed chairmen \nseveral times and always did it smoothly and seamlessly, but this year \nwe are not, and that is not a very good example for us to set.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's step back a little bit. Let's move off \nthis partisan excitement in which people are engaged, and together \nsolve some of these other problems behind closed doors, as we usually \ndo, in a way that is satisfactory to all. We can do that. To say we are \ngoing to filibuster this resolution and you can never be chair until we \ndo such and such--frankly, I find it demeaning to the Senate. I do not \nwant to say that. I do not want it to happen. I love this institution, \nand this situation is denigrating to this great institution. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I listened with great care to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, and I certainly agree with his point about \nseeking to sustain, maintain, and enhance the institution of the \nSenate. But I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, I am going to be the \nranking member now of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee. That is a consequence of the elections that took place in \nNovember, and I recognize that. But our ability to do our job in the \ncommittee is closely related to receiving adequate resources and staff \nresources with which to carry out our responsibilities.\n  Unfortunately, that issue has been put in some question. I do not \nquite know why this has happened, although I understand there are some \non the other side who want to really do a very radical shift from the \nallocations in the previous Congress when the margins were so close. Of \ncourse, that has created a lot of concern and apprehension about the \nability then of the minority to meet and carry out its \nresponsibilities.\n  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why we cannot in short order \nreach an agreement that would be encompassed in this organizing \nresolution that the allocation of resources to what is now the minority \nwould parallel the allocation that was made by this side of the aisle \nwhen it was a majority to the Republican minority in the last Congress.\n  I do not understand what the difficulty is with that position. Of \ncourse, the fact that there seems to be some difficulty only increases \nthe degree of concern in terms of what lies in wait.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. And only reaffirms what is perceived as a need to work \nthis matter out in the course of organizing for the 108th Congress.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for a question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I do not want to get into the funding because I do not \nbelieve it belongs in this resolution, but my understanding is that the \noffer the majority leader has made is that the committee is going to be \nheld whole, that the amount of staff money for the Banking Committee \nwould still be there for the next Congress, so there would not be a \nradical shift; there would be ample funds. I wanted to make sure the \nSenator was aware of that.\n  I ask the Senator if he is aware of the fact, not counting the last \nCongress, that in every Congress going all the way back to 1993, \nBanking traditionally had a two-thirds/one-third, but the majority \nleader is not talking about going back to two-thirds/one-third; he is \nbasically talking about giving the same amount of money that was \nallocated last year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me say to my colleague, as a consequence of what \noccurred in the 107th Congress and the very close divisions that took \nplace, and indeed the assertion by what was then the Republican \nminority of the necessity of protecting their staff positions, we \ndeveloped a new understanding with respect to the allocation of \nresources, something that many Members have been arguing for over a \nnumber of years. So the position that is being advocated by this side \nis simply reciprocity on the basis of what was done in the 107th \nCongress.\n  In fact, I ask my distinguished assistant leader, am I correct that \nwhat is now being sought by the minority is reciprocity in terms of \nbeing treated in the 108th Congress as we treated the minority in the \n107th Congress? Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely factually correct.\n  I further say to my friend from Maryland that my friend from Oklahoma \ntalks about blue slips. We just attended almost a 2-hour conference and \nthere was no decision made that this would be part of the organizing \nresolution. There is an issue going on about leadership space, but that \nhas nothing to do with this organizational resolution.\n  So in answer to my friend, all this stuff about blue slips and space \nhas nothing to do with the organizational resolution. All we want is to \nbe treated the same way we treated the minority when we were in the \nmajority--simple, direct, factual.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it not true that the resolution before the Senate has \nnothing to do with money either; that it simply deals with the \nappointment of Members to the committees and the chairmanships of those \ncommittees?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is what the resolution is, and that is the basis \nof the complaint. It is our assertion that the organizing resolution \nought to at least encompass the allocation of staff resources and that \nthe minority now should receive a treatment on that issue comparable to \nand paralleling what the other side of the aisle received when they \nwere in the minority in the 107th Congress.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it not true that the resolution, as brought forth by \nthe majority leader, is consistent with all the resolutions that have \nbeen brought forward in the last 10 Congresses relative to the language \nin that resolution specifically applying only to the membership of the \ncommittee?\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is not consistent with the resolutions brought \nforward in the 107th Congress when we first encountered this very close \ndivision between the two sides of the aisle.\n  Second of all, even if it is inconsistent, it seems to me, given what \nwe are hearing in terms of what at least some Members on the other \nside--not all of its Members, as I understand it, but what some of its \nMembers intend to do in terms of staff allocation, it seems to me \nperfectly reasonable, since our ability to carry out our \nresponsibilities as a minority is closely related to that question, for \nus to seek an understanding and an agreement right at the outset on \nthat very important issue.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it not only the tradition but the legally appropriate \naction that in a constitutional democracy, where there are two major \nparties, when a majority takes control of a body within that \nconstitutional democracy, the committees be chaired by the majority \nparty?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Under our constitutional system, we recognize the rule \nof the majority but we protect the rights of the minority. That is a \nfundamental principle of the U.S. Constitution, and indeed it has been \na fundamental principle in the operations of our various institutions \nunder the Constitution.\n  No one is arguing the proposition of who will become chairman of the \ncommittees, I recognize that, but we are asserting that in the course \nof making that decision, we need to make also the decision with respect \nto the allocation of resources for staff, which is an important \ndimension of both the majority and the minority being able to discharge \ntheir responsibilities in the operations of this institution.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Maryland raises a most important issue. \nWhen I speak to townhall meetings and especially when I speak to \ngovernment classes--high school, even elementary school, and college \nclasses--whenever I am asked about the Constitution, I always say what \nmy friend from Maryland said--that the Constitution was not written to \nprotect the majority; the Constitution of the United States was written \nto protect the minority. The majority can always protect itself. Rules, \nregulations, and laws that flow from this little document are so \ndevised to protect the minority, and that is what this is all about.\n  That is why I felt so at ease during the last Congress--because we \nprotected the minority; we did not run over the minority. In fact, \ntheir resources were allocated almost identically to what ours were \nbecause the Senate was divided 51 to 49. As the Senator from Maryland \nhas said several times today, that is all we want. We want to make sure \nthat the resources are allocated just like they were in the last \nCongress.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, when the Senator from Oklahoma was speaking, \nhe was making the point how people would come from other countries, \nparticularly fledgling democracies, to see the Congress of the United \nStates, particularly the Senate, and how we wanted them to draw the \nright lessons from seeing the Senate. One of the most important lessons \nthey need to draw in the fledgling democracies is the necessity of \nrespecting the rights of the minority. In instance after instance, they \nhave been prepared to exercise the majority rule but they are unwilling \nin these emerging democracies to accord proper respect to the \nminorities within them which, of course, are also an essential part of \nmaking a democracy work. That essentially is all we are seeking to do \nin this instance.\n  I repeat what I said before. For the life of me, I cannot understand \nwhy we cannot reach agreement in short order since what this side of \nthe aisle is seeking is simply reciprocity, seeking to be treated now \nas the minority the way we were willing to treat the other side when \nthey were in the minority in the last Congress.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will yield for a further question.\n  Mr. GREGG. It will be the last one. I agree with the purposes of \nprotecting the minority. That obviously is one of the core elements of \nour structure of government. My question is this: Under a \nconstitutional government that has a two-party system, when there is an \nelection, is it not appropriate and, in fact, an obligation of a \nmajority which loses its majority to turn over the chairmanships of the \ncommittees which operate that government and operate that house to the \nparty which has taken the majority? And is it not the sole purpose of \nthis resolution to accomplish that goal, to establish the committees, \nand thereby establish the majority party as having the chairmen of \nthose committees? And why is the minority not respecting this \nunderstanding of our form of government? Why deny the ability of people \nwho assume the chairmanships of the committees as majority Members of \nthe party?\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is very simple. We think the compass within the \norganizing resolution would be an assurance of what is now the minority \nin terms of the allocation of resources so we will be able to meet our \nresponsibilities. We are not asserting the majority will not assume the \nchairmanships of the committees. Obviously they will do so. In fact, I \nstood out here a little while ago and said I recognize now I was on my \nway to being the ranking member instead of the chairman of the Banking, \nHousing and Urban Affairs Committee.\n  We are simply saying, and it goes right to the point the Senator \nraised about the workings of the institution, part and parcel workings \nof the institution is to include within the organizing resolution an \nunderstanding with respect to the allocations, particularly since \nMembers of the majority--not all Members, but some Members of the \nmajority--have been very outspoken in asserting a position that would \nsignificantly deny to the minority adequate resources to meet its \nresponsibility and which is directly counter and in marked conflict \nwith the way the majority was treated in the last Congress when they \nwere a minority.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator state to me, at this time is the Senator \nthe ranking member of the Banking Committee or is the Senator the \nChairman of the Banking Committee?\n  Mr. SARBANES. At the moment I am still the chairman because we have \nnot passed the organizing resolution. I am quite happy to pass an \norganizing resolution which will make me the ranking member, but I want \nthat organizing resolution to contain in it an understanding with \nrespect to the allocation of resources so I can be certain we will be \nable to meet our responsibilities; furthermore, an allocation of \nresources comparable to what is now the majority received in the \nprevious Congress when they were a minority.\n  I don't understand why the other side of the aisle will not accord to \nus now the same treatment, the same fairness, and the same equity which \nthey received in the previous Congress. Why won't you do that? I ask \nthat question. Why won't they do that? If they were to do that, we \ncould conclude an organizing resolution in very short order.\n  In fact, I ask our assistant leader, is it not the case if we were \nable to receive the same treatment on this allocation of resources \nissue we extended in the last Congress when we were the majority, that \nwe would be able to wrap up the organizing resolution in short order?\n  Mr. REID. Ten or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for one last question, the \nSenator from Maryland has now declared himself the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I didn't declare myself; it \nis still the operating premise since we have not passed a new \norganizing resolution.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Senator from Maryland in the majority party in this \nbody?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am no longer in the majority party, but the \norganizing resolution to reflect that fact has not yet been passed.\n  Mr. GREGG. You made my point.\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have been careful in the committee not to exercise \nauthorities as chairman.\n  But I repeat my question that goes to fairness and equity. I cannot \nfor the life of me understand why what is now the majority in this body \nwill not extend to the minority the same treatment we were prepared to \nextend when we were the majority and the other side was in the minority \nin the 107th Congress. That is all we are seeking--reciprocity. If we \ncould obtain that, we could conclude this organizing resolution in \nshort order.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few observations after \nlistening to this debate.\n  When I came to the Senate and watched procedures and arguments, I \ncame fairly quickly to the conclusion I never wanted to become \naccustomed to the way people think in Washington. In listening to this \ndebate and wondering why we cannot vote on Senate Resolution 18, which \nvery simply states who the chairmen are of the various committees and \nalso determines who the Members are from each party on those \ncommittees, not an unfair but a very fair allocation of committees and \nspaces and seats on the committee based upon proportional \nrepresentation. It is 51-48 plus 1, so, one extra seat, for the \nmajority, the Republicans.\n  What is getting missed is representative democracy. Being from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, the home of James Madison, who wrote and \nauthored the Constitution of the United States, to listen to the \nassertions of some on the floor from the other side of the aisle about \nthe Constitution and all of their arguments in thwarting the vote on \nchairmanships and committee assignments so we can go forward on issues \nthat matter to the real people in the real world in America, they say \nit is the Constitution that protects minority parties over majority \nparties.\n  George Washington's farewell address warned against political \nparties. The Constitution was not created to protect political parties. \nJames Madison, and our Founding Fathers, put forward the Constitution \nto protect the rights of the people, to protect their God-given rights. \nTo talk about the Constitution as a defense for this obstructionism and \nthis delay and dilatory practice would have James Madison stating this \nis a shameless, dilatory dilemma. It is holding up the business of the \npeople of America. People recognize there are issues and ideas and \nmeasures that should have been acted upon last year--whether they were \nfunding bills, or whether they were a variety of other issues. You can \ntalk about improving Medicare with the prescription drug plan. It may \nbe we need greater--and I agree we need greater--energy independence. I \nbelieve we need to make sure we have a more prosperous economy with tax \npolicies and regulatory policies that allow more people to get work and \nget jobs for themselves and their families.\n  I very much support the President's ideas as far as the job creation \nand economic growth packages. There are other ideas on education, on a \nvariety of issues, including partial-birth abortion. It is all being \nstopped because of this delay.\n  We talk about elementary civics with the school groups that come up \nand watch, people from around the world. They see the peaceful \ntransition of power in this country. They see the people in the several \nStates of the Union elect Senators and, as a result, there are a \nmajority of Republicans. Now the people of this country expect a new \nleadership to go forward on a variety of issues, as I talked about, \nwhether it is jobs, or health care matters, budgetary matters, or \nfunding.\n\n  We are a representative democracy and people have seen the transition \nof power from the local level of mayors and boards of supervisors on up \nto State legislators to Governors, to Presidents. This is a very \nunfortunate situation, that we sit here idly, worrying about some of \nthese very picayune procedures.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, let's have a vote \non S. Res. 18. I would like to see a vote because then those who vote \nwill take whatever stand they want to take on it. They can say: I \ndidn't want to be in favor of it because, whether it is office space or \nfunding for staff, that can get worked out in the future; let's get \nmoving with the business of the American people. What they want us to \ndo is move forward on a variety of pressing issues, from national \nsecurity to economic security, that affect the lives of real people in \nthe real world. Bickering over such petty things as office space and \nstaff allocations is beneath the dignity and the importance and the \nauthority that is granted to us by the people of this country.\n  Mr. President, let's act. Let's move forward. Stop the dilatory \npractices and let's act in a responsible manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the Senate has under consideration S. Res. \n18.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, perhaps before I do, I should indicate I \nam a little bit perplexed about the debate going on here on the floor \nof the Senate on the funding or the reorganization resolution dealing \nwith the 108th Congress, and especially the Senate. It seems to me the \nquestion of how much money shall be allocated to committees to run the \noperations of the Senate around here ought not be difficult to resolve.\n  In the last Congress we had 51 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and we had \nan even split with a slight differential for administration.\n  Now we have 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. It seems to me we ought \nto have exactly the same split as we did in the last Congress, just in \nreverse. I don't understand why the majority now will not do for the \nminority as we did last year when we were in the majority for the \nRepublican side. It doesn't make any sense to me. This ought not be \nrocket science trying to put this together. It is about fairness. We \nought to have exactly the same circumstance we gave to the Republicans \nin the last Congress.\n  It is unseemly to me we are having this lengthy debate about it. We \nhave foreign policy questions and challenges in Iraq and Korea and \nelsewhere. We have very significant challenges with respect to the \neconomy in this country. Now we are being told by the majority: Unless \nyou agree to conditions we would have considered unfair--speaking now \nfor them--in the last Congress, we will not move forward on a \nresolution that funds the committees of this Congress.\n  Our side simply says: Why don't you do for us what we did for you? Is \nthat unfair? I wouldn't think so. Do unto others? Do we understand \nabout this? All we are asking is we have the same kind of agreement we \nhad in the last Congress. For whom is that unfair? Who decides that is \nunfair?\n  It was fair in the last Congress for the Republicans who were in the \nminority. It was fair to them because we made sure it was. Now they are \nsaying they need more than that now they are in the majority. They will \nnot give us the same deal we gave them.\n  We have a lot of problems and a lot of challenges. It seems to me the \nnew majority leader would be well advised to come to the floor and \nprovide the same kind of agreement we had in the last Congress. That is \nall we are asking. If it was fair for them when we did it to them--and \nit was--then it ought to be fair for us, and we ought to suggest that \nis the resolution to bring to the floor of the Senate.\n  I know there is a lot of genuflecting around here about this. There \nis a lot of background noise about it. The fact is, we ought to get \nthis done, get it\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\ndone fairly as we did a year and a half ago, and then move on to the \nother business of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S275-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S275-S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the challenges we face in this \nCongress is trying to find a way to stimulate the economy. Frankly, if \nwe do not move at some point, and move rather rapidly, we are not going \nto do what I think the American people deserve to have us do and that \nis to try to put this economy back on solid footing--one towards \neconomic growth and opportunity.\n  Back at the start of this century there was a fellow, I believe he \nwas from Iowa. His name was Joe Connely.\n  He actually decided to make a living by something he saw when he was \na kid. His dad took to him an event in Texas when he was a little boy. \nIt was an event in which a promoter took two railroad locomotives and \nran them together and created a train crash. People actually paid to \ncome to see it. Joe Connely thought this was a great deal: If you can \nget people to pay to see a train wreck, I am going to get in the \nbusiness of creating train wrecks. So he did. He went and found old \nlocomotives, and he had people lay a track at a town fair. He would run \nthese locomotives together and create train wrecks. They called him \n``Head-On Joe Connely.'' His business in life was to create train \nwrecks. Joe died, I believe, in 1936. But his spirit still lives--at \nleast here in some nooks and crannies of the Senate--with people who \ndesign and want to create a train wreck, whether it is on funding, or \neconomic packages, or other things.\n  But much more important than creating a train wreck is to lay some \ntrack and do it someplace where we want this country to be able to see.\n  Let me describe what I think we ought to do. The President says that \nwe have trouble in our economy. Indeed, we do. When you take a look at \nwhat the American people face in this economy, it is pretty obvious.\n  In 2002, 82,000 more Americans were unemployed in December than in \nNovember. In December, 82,000 people came home and said to their \nfamilies: By the way, dear, I lost my job. The men and women who lost \ntheir jobs had to come home and tell their families that they were no \nlonger employed. It wasn't a fault of theirs, it was that their \ncompanies were contracting and eliminating jobs. The economy is soft \nand over 80,000 people had to tell their families that they lost their \njobs. Some 8.6 million Americans were unemployed in December. 2.6 \nmillion more Americans are unemployed now than when this administration \ntook office.\n  What do we do about that? It seems to me we need to try to put the \neconomy back on track and to stimulate the economy some. The President \nsays let us have a tax cut of $670 billion over the next 10 years. I \nthink that is manufacturing a train wreck. We have a huge budget \ndeficit staring us right smack in the face. If we are to do a tax cut, \nI think we probably should try to stimulate the economy in the short \nrun. It ought to be a 1-year tax cut which would really stimulate the \neconomy. A tax cut of $670 billion over 10 years, the centerpiece of \nwhich is to exempt all dividends from taxation, is not going to \nstimulate the economy. It doesn't have anything to do with stimulating \nthe economy.\n  So what should we do?\n  I put together some thoughts which I think represent the kind of plan \nwe ought to consider. I think we ought to have a tax cut for 1 year, a \nplan that does in fact stimulate economic growth and encourage people \nto create new jobs. I think one of the best ways to do that is to \nprovide a one-time tax rebate. I would propose it be in the \nneighborhood of $500 per individual and $1,000 per couple. It is a tax \nrebate that we know works, by the way, because that rebate goes into \nthe pockets of the working Americans and then it is spent. That \nspending represents an absorption of capacity in the economy and the \ncreation of economic growth.\n  In addition to the one-time tax rebate, I would propose a 10-percent \ninvestment tax credit on new equipment purchased by December 31 of this \nyear for manufacturing and production. That, I think, is also \nstimulative and would encourage the kind of activity that can lift and \nprovide economic growth.\n\n  In addition, I would--as President Bush has suggested--increase small \nbusiness expensing to $75,000. But again, I would limit it to 1 year.\n  I would allow individuals to exclude up to $250 of dividends and \ninterest income. I would up that amount to $500 for married couple. \nFinally, I would include in a stimulus package the agricultural \ndisaster bill for family farmers that we have already passed here by a \nwide bipartisan margin in the Senate.\n  This is a 1-year plan that is affordable. A 1-year plan to try to \nstimulate the economy makes sense. There is not much stimulus in the \nAdministration's 10-year plan of $675 billion that puts less than 10 \ncents on the dollar back into the economy in 2003. There is not very \nmuch there to stimulate the economy. The number of dollars of that plan \nfor 10 years will be borrowed. We would be borrowing from our kids in \norder to create a plan that would transfer wealth to the upper income \nfolks in this country. That doesn't make much sense to me.\n  Here are the numbers with respect to the President's plan. Those who \nhave $1 million in income and more, on average, will receive an $88,000 \nper year tax cut under his plan. I don't know; it seems to me that at a \ntime when we have very large Federal budget deficits staring us in the \nface, that is not the kind of thing we want to do.\n  Just about a year and three-quarters ago, we had this debate on the \nfloor of the Senate about what kind of a tax cut we should have. At \nthat time, the administration said: We have an economy that is flowing \nalong. We have a country that is blessed with economic health. We have \nan estimated budget surplus as far as the eye can see. We propose a \n$1.7 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years.\n  Some of us said: Look. We think we ought to have a tax rebate. I \nproposed a rebate then and some other tax cuts. But we think it is \nunwise to believe that we can see 5 months or 5 years or 10 years down \nthe road. What if something happens? What if these budget surpluses \ndon't materialize? We were washed away. We were just swept away. Nobody \ncared much about that argument. Do not be conservative about this--just \nunderstand that we are going to have surpluses that last forever.\n  The Congress passed a very sizable tax cut. I did not vote for that \ntax cut, although I supported a tax rebate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder. Some of us have been waiting. Would \nthe Senator make it a little bit shorter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I take that as an objection.\n  Mr. KYL. I don't want to object to the Senator's request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I asked consent to speak in morning \nbusiness. Perhaps I should not have done that. I simply should have \nspoken about the underlying resolution. I hope I can perhaps use 5 \nminutes in morning business. If the Senator has a time deadline, I will \nbe glad to truncate mine and then he can be recognized following this \nSenator's presentation. How long does the Senator intend?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator's request \nfor an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the point I was making was that roughly a \nyear and three-quarters ago when the very large tax cut was proposed by \nthe administration and embraced by Congress, it was anticipated that we \nwould have surpluses forever. It was anticipated that these wonderful \nsurpluses were really good economic news and they would last not only \nfor a decade but much more.\n\n  Then, in a very short period of time, we had the following. We had an \nunderstanding that the country went into a recession. In March of 2001, \nwe were told that the country went into a recession. Then, on September \n11, we had a devastating terrorist attack in this country that blew a \nhole in the belly of this economy, along with the recession. Then we \nhad the war on terrorism that ensued. Then we had corporate scandals. I \nthink they were the most significant and perhaps the worst corporate \nscandals in this country's history.\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\n  All of these things converged at the same intersection, undermining \nthe confidence the American people had in this country's economy. The \nwarning, some of us suggested, should have been heeded because there \nare economic expansion periods and contraction periods. The fact is \nthat we went into an economic contraction, and those anticipated \nsurpluses are now gone, replaced by very large projected budget \ndeficits.\n  I know there are some who come to the floor and say the deficit last \nyear was $159 billion. It is not. The deficit last year was really $318 \nbillion. The only way someone can say $159 billion is if they take the \nmoney out of the Social Security trust fund and use it for operating \nthe budget and then show a lower budget deficit. That is what they do \nwhen they come to the floor of the Senate.\n  Fast forward to January 2003. The President says: Yes, now our \neconomy is in some trouble. I have a proposal. The proposal is a $670 \nbillion tax cut over the next 10 years.\n  I don't know where he gets the money for that. You borrow it from the \nkids, I guess. But the fact is we are fighting a war against terrorism \nwhich required us to increase defense spending by $45 billion last year \nalone and increases in homeland security to the tune of $25 billion to \n$30 billion. Is there anyone suggesting that anybody is paying for any \nof this? No. The President is suggesting, as the tonic for America, \nlarge tax cuts. These tax cuts would go on for 10 years and will be \npaid for by our children in the form of additional borrowing that they \nwill be responsible for in order to give the highest income earners in \nthe country--particularly those who have very large dividends--big tax \ncuts.\n  I come from a small town. I went to a small school and had a high \nschool class of nine. They only teach arithmetic one way in this \ncountry. None of this adds up. It just does not add up. So I think we \nought to start over.\n  Do we need to do something to stimulate this economy? The answer is \nyes. Should we put this country deeper in debt? Should we drink more of \nthe tonic that helped us get into this trouble? The answer is no. What \nwe ought to do is be thoughtful. What we ought to do is join in \nbipartisan agreements to say: Let's stimulate the economy, in this \nyear, to give it some lift, put it back on track, to produce more jobs \nand more opportunity.\n  We will not do that by borrowing $675 billion in the coming 10 years, \nadding it to the Federal debt, saddling our children with that \nadditional responsibility. We will do that if we are thoughtful, by \nproviding, for example, a rebate to the American taxpayers on a one-\ntime basis, perhaps an investment tax credit, on a short-term basis, \nfor business investments in capital equipment and capital goods. We \nwill do that if we make the right choices.\n  But I tell you, the wrong choice is to go back to the old formula \nthat was foisted on this country over a year and a half ago by those \nwho said: Don't worry. Don't worry. Times are good, and they will last \nforever. They did not. And now our responsibility, in my judgment, is \nto put this back on track with a plan that will work, one that is \nthoughtful, and one that respects the need to come up with the money to \npay for these initiatives of ours, and, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nsaid, to give us the privilege, as Americans, to meet our \nresponsibilities, yes, during times of national crisis.\n  So I say to President Bush, and to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, I really believe we need to do something, but we need to do the \nright thing, most importantly. I hope, as we begin to debate this issue \nof an economic stimulus, of putting the economy back on track, we can \nfind a thoughtful, aggressive way to do that without breaking the bank \nand without saddling our children with more debt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S276-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S276-S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MAKING MAJORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the American people must be wondering what is \ngoing on in the Senate today. They frequently see us just talking. We \ndo a lot of that. But sometimes they see a little action on the Senate \nfloor. And, of course, other than extending the unemployment benefits, \nwe have done nothing in the Senate since we reconvened at the beginning \nof this year.\n  Why is that so? Why is it that we have been having this squabble on \nthe floor of the Senate for the last 24 hours or so, accusing each \nother of not wanting to get on with doing the Nation's business and the \nconstructing, getting on with that business?\n  People have asked me: Why can't you all get along? Why can't you \nresolve what appears to be petty disputes and get on with the Nation's \nbusiness?\n  One person said: Didn't we elect you to the majority? He was talking \nabout me as a Republican Senator. So I had to explain what the \nsituation was. I said: Yes, as a matter of fact, last November the news \nwas full of the fact that, for the first time in a long time, \nRepublicans were supposedly in control. The Presidency was occupied by \nGeorge Bush, and the Republicans were to control both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate.\n  But he said: Well, then, why aren't you getting going? Why aren't you \ndoing things? I said: Well, there's a little problem; that is, as you \nknow, in Congress most of the work is done in committees, and the \nDemocrats, who had controlled the Congress for the last year and a \nhalf, have been unwilling to turn over the gavels to the new Republican \nchairmen.\n  My friend said: That's not possible. This is the United States of \nAmerica. You Republicans won the election. Just take them.\n  I said: Well, it's not quite that simple. It is kind of like the old \nphrase: Possession is 99 percent of the law. The Democrats are in \npossession of the gavels. They are currently considered to be the \nchairmen until we do a very simple thing in the Senate. Usually it \ntakes about 10 seconds. The majority leader asks unanimous consent that \nthe list of Republican Senators assigned to these committees be \naccepted, with the committee chairmen as indicated. The Democratic \nleader does the same thing for the Democrats. And then the Senate is \nconsidered organized. The new Senators have their committee \nassignments, the chairmen are noted, and we get to work. But that has \nbeen objected to on the Democratic side. They want to hold on to the \ngavel a little while longer, even though in the election last November \nthey lost--supposedly lost the majority control of the Senate.\n  My friend said: Well, how can they prevent change? I thought you were \nin control.\n  I said: Remember that in the Senate we have a procedure called the \nfilibuster, and in order to stop debate and force a vote on our \norganizing resolution--or committee resolution, it is called--it takes \n60 Senators to agree to force the vote. It only takes 51 to adopt the \nresolution, but 60 Senators are required to actually force the vote; \notherwise, you have to just keep talking. And that is what we are doing \nright now.\n  Obviously, with the Senate organized at 51 Republicans and 49 \nDemocrats--unless some of our Democratic friends would be willing to \nconcede that the election was won by Republicans, and be willing to \nturn the gavels over to the Republican chairmen--if they want to stick \nin their partisan mode here, at 49, they can continue to keep us from \nvoting on this resolution and, thus, continue to have control of the \ncommittees.\n\n  Well, why is this important? Things my colleague was just talking \nabout a moment ago: The budget and getting on with the President's \neconomic growth package are a good illustration.\n  For the first time in the history of the Senate, since the Budget Act \nof 1974, last year, when the Democrats were in control of the Senate, \nthey failed to pass a budget. And the appropriations bills, except for \nthe Defense bills, were not passed. That is unfinished business from \nlast year we have to hurry up and do. The President would like to see \nthat done before his State of the Union speech. We have to get on with \nthat. We cannot do it if the Appropriations Committee cannot meet, pass \nout a resolution, and get it to the floor so we can debate it.\n  We have judges who have been waiting for almost 2 years now to be \nconfirmed by the Senate because they have been held up by the \nDemocratic Senate. We need to get on with that. And there is other \nimportant business.\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\n  The point is, we ought to get on with it and stop this squabbling. \nWhat is it that is really at the bottom here? What is the complaint? \nWhat is the Democratic objective? It is a little hard to tell.\n  Part of it, I suppose, is just delay for delay's sake. But part of it \nalso has been indicated by those who say: We want our fair share of \nmoney and office space. This may seem pretty petty to people watching, \nbut it is true that both sides need to have money for their staffs and \noperations. The majority leader has been negotiating in good faith on \nthat, and he says they are very close to getting that issue resolved. \nBut that does not have to be resolved today. The funding resolution \ngoes on until the end of February. So we could easily get the committee \nprocess started, exchange positions so that Republican chairmen would \nhave a gavel, get on with the Nation's business in the committees, and \ncontinue to work to resolve the issue of funding, such as that issue \nmay continue to exist.\n  Democrats have talked about the comparison to the middle of the year \nswitch in parties when Jim Jeffords, a Senator from Vermont, left the \nRepublican side, became an Independent, and joined the Democrats. The \nday that happened, Republicans turned their gavels over to their \nDemocratic counterparts to let them run the committees, recognizing the \npower had now shifted in the Senate and they were now in the majority.\n  It took another several weeks to get all the funding issues resolved, \nbut they were resolved. We have that same amount of time here, so we \ncan go ahead and give the gavels over to the Republicans to chair the \ncommittees and continue to negotiate the funding issues. We have \nseveral weeks yet to get that done. There is no reason to continue to \ndelay this process.\n  So I urge my Democratic colleagues to stop the squabbling and act \nlike the world's greatest deliberative body that the Senate is often \ncalled. Instead, we look more like some Third World country where the \nlosing party did not want to turn over control to the party that won \nthe election. And that is just not acceptable in the Senate of the \nUnited States of America.\n  So I urge my colleagues to agree to turn the power over to the party \nthat won. Then we can continue to try to satisfy their requirements \nwith funding. We want to do the Nation's business.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Arizona agree with me that, \nunquestionably, the beginning of the previous Congress was the most \ncomplicated situation we have had in Senate organization, having ended \nup with a 50-50 tie for the first time since the 1880s?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. The first time, I guess, since the 1880s; that is \nright.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would point out to my friend from Arizona, the \nCongress was sworn in on January 3 of 2001, the beginning of that dead-\neven Senate, and 2 days later this complicated organizational \nresolution, which our friends and colleagues on the other side, in \neffect, want to continue into this Congress, was passed--2 days.\n  The reason for that, obviously, is that we had known since the \nelection what was going to happen and we were working long on it. We \nhave known since November 5, 2002, what was going to happen. I have \nheard on the other side it was 6 weeks, but in fact there were 24 days \nafter Senator Jeffords switched to get the resolution passed. But the \nchairmen switched almost immediately. I handed my gavel over to Senator \nDodd, Senator Bennett handed his over, Senator Bond did; I believe \neverybody did, including Senator Kyl.\n  We have known now for 70 days who was going to be in the majority--70 \ndays. It seems to this Senator that we have had adequate notice for \nquite some time who was going to be in the majority and yet we have \nkilled a week in failing to address the people's business from last \nyear because of an apparent unwillingness to recognize who is in the \nmajority around here.\n  Mr. KYL. I respond to my colleague from Kentucky that in the last \nfive Congresses we have organized the Senate on January 3, January 5, \nand January 7. The very latest date was January 9. We are already a \nweek beyond that, and the week has, in fact, been wasted except for a \nvery quick passage of the unemployment compensation benefit, which \nshows what we can do when we get down to work here.\n  The history is that we do this very quickly, even in the most \ncomplicated circumstances, as the Senator noted, when we were 50-50 and \nhad a lot of issues to try to resolve. That gets back to my point that \nthere is no reason to hold up the exchanges of the gavels, a routine \nmatter that recognizes who won the election, simply because there is \nstill some disagreement about whether the money is going to be split--I \ndon't even know--57/43, or whatever the numbers are.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Particularly since the funding resolution goes until \nthe first of March.\n  Mr. KYL. Precisely the point. So unless there is some other ulterior \nmotives--and I never ascribe motives to my colleagues and they can \nexplain their own actions--the result of this is delay, though, and \ngiven the fact that we have unfinished business from last year because \nof the Democrat leader's inability to pass a budget and get \nappropriations bills passed, we are already behind schedule.\n  We are in a war with terrorists. There could be a military conflict \nwith Iraq. The President has an economic agenda that the American \npeople are very interested in because it affects both their families \nand the economy as a whole. My constituents want Medicare reform and a \nprescription drug benefit to go along with that so we can strengthen \nand preserve Medicare. We have a lot on our agenda, and this delay is \nnot helping the American people and there is no reason for it. That is \nwhy I, again, urge my Democratic colleagues. We are not saying this in \nanger or in a partisan tone, I hope, but it does not serve the \ninterests of the American people, and it certainly blemishes the Senate \nto be unable to organize, to simply recognize which side won the \nelection. Let this side chair the committees so we can get on with the \nother business of the day. That is the inevitable result of what is \nhappening here.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to recognize that \nfact. It doesn't make them look good, it doesn't make the Senate look \ngood, and it is bad for the American people. I hope we can get the \nresolution adopted quickly and get on with the business of the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis comments. Before he leaves the floor, I will make the observation \nthat in addition to not being able to address the unfinished business \nfrom last year, because we don't have committees approved, we have \nSenators from 11 States who have no committees at all. They were duly \nchosen in an election last November. A week ago today, they took the \noath of office here at the front of the Chamber and became Senators. A \nweek later, they are still not on committees.\n  Now, it is almost impossible for a Senator to represent his \nconstituents if he or she is not on a committee. So we have, in effect, \ndisenfranchised those 11 States for a week. There is no crisis to \naddress if the committee funding resolution doesn't expire for some 7 \nweeks from now. There is no reason to be doing this, other than an \napparent attempt to fail to recognize the results of last year's \nelection.\n  So we have, I say to my friend from Arizona, Senators from Alaska, \nArkansas, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas who have all been \nsworn in and have no committee assignments whatsoever.\n  This is the United States of America. We had an election. All of \nthese new Senators have been certified and they are entitled to be \neffective Members of this body representing their constituents. Our \nfailure to act makes that impossible.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about committee funding. Really, \nthat is not the issue before us in this resolution before the Senate \ntoday. This is simply a resolution ratifying committee membership of \nRepublican Members of the Senate. Traditionally, Democrats offer a \nsimilar resolution putting their members on committees.\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nWhat has gotten all mixed up in this, apparently, is the whole question \nof what kind of committee funding ratios there are going to be. There \nwas a very revealing article in Roll Call before the November election \nin which--it was on October 31--a senior Democratic aide said it was \n``an extraordinary circumstance that forced them to continue the equal \nfunding.''\n  I agree with that, both in the beginning of the 107th Congress and \nafter the defection of Senator Jeffords. Both were extraordinary \ncircumstances. Here you have a Democratic aide stating the obvious, \nwith which I agree. It was an extraordinary circumstance that forced \ncontinuing funding at that level in the middle of a Congress when they \nsuddenly became a majority. But the same aide stated that ``if we pick \nup a seat or two, I think it is without a doubt we would go back to \ntwo-thirds/one-third,'' which is right before the election of last \nfall. ``If we pick up a seat or two . . . we would go back to two-\nthirds/one-third.'' It is quite stunning how accurate Roll Call's \npredictions were. They predicted that if the Democrats were to lose a \nseat, which is indeed what happened, they would fight for equal \nfunding, which is where we find ourselves today.\n  The funding issue is not before us in the Senate today. This is about \nratifying the results of last November's election. The majority leader \nhas laid down a committee resolution that would give the Republican \nMembers of the Senate an opportunity to serve on committees, so that \nthey can represent the people they were sent here to represent.\n  I hope we will be able to resolve all of this amicably. It has gone \non entirely too long. We have been doing this for over a week. Of \ncourse, it has been tougher on the majority leader than anybody else \nbecause he spends an endless amount of time each day discussing it. I \nhope we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel and may \nbe able to resolve this matter in some kind of amicable fashion, \nhopefully before the day is out.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can remember when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, the legendary Mo Udall came to a meeting. He was \nchairman of the Franking Commission. There was a big dispute as to a \nfranking issue. Members of the House paraded in and it went on for a \nlong period of time. Mo Udall, in only the way he could do it, kind \nof--how would you describe how he walked? It was kind of a saunter--\nsauntered in and took his place as chairman of this committee. He said:\n\n       Everything has been said, but not everybody has said it.\n\n  So he proceeded to say the same thing that everybody else had said. I \nhave been here for 2 days and the same thing has been said over and \nover again by the majority, the Republicans, and the same thing has \nbeen said over and over again by the minority, the Democrats. But as Mo \nUdall would say, it hasn't been said today as many times as perhaps it \nshould.\n  I repeat, what the minority wants is to be treated exactly as we \ntreated the minority during the last Congress.\n  My friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky, has \nbrought to our attention again what one Democratic aide said. I talked \nabout this previously, but I will say it again because not everyone has \nheard it, I guess, and if they have, they can listen again. One \nDemocratic aide said:\n\n       If we pick up a seat or two, I think we'd go back to one-\n     third/two-thirds.\n\n  First, this is a Democratic aide, whoever that is. But if we are \ngoing to take Roll Call for gospel, then what I suggest is the whole \narticle be looked at. In this article in Roll Call, a GOP leadership \naide said:\n\n       It will be a serious fight. It will be a series of knock-\n     down drag-out talks that last a long, long time.\n\n  Remember, he is commenting on changing the committee ratio. A senior \nGOP leadership aide said:\n\n       It will be a serious fight. It will be a series of knock-\n     down drag-out talks that last a long, long time.\n\n  Finally, this same--or it could be a different GOP leadership aide, I \ndo not know; it might be the same one--said:\n\n       There is no way we will countenance that or stand for that.\n\n  He said of the Democratic aide's comment about shifting parties.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think people watch these proceedings and think it is \nall very silly that the Senate cannot agree on an organizing \nresolution.\n  I am trying to understand, if I can, some of the statements that have \nbeen made. My colleague from Kentucky said that last summer, for \nexample, when the Senate went from Republican to Democratic control as \na result of one Senator shifting from the Republican caucus to an \nIndependent caucus and caucusing with the Democrats, he said the gavels \nwere turned over immediately.\n  As I heard that, it occurred to me that was not the case at all. \nHistory is history, and revisionist history is fun, but it is not \naccurate.\n  Isn't it the case that last summer, for example, when the Republicans \nwere in control and then one Senator moved to caucus with Democrats and \nthe Democrats actually took control of the Senate, for 3 weeks the \ngavels were not turned over to the chairmen? I am not suggesting there \nis any justification for anything by making that point. My point is, \nwhen people come to the Chamber to talk about this, let's talk about \nwhat really happened, and if we can, let's talk about what is happening \nnow for the moment.\n  Isn't it the case that the reason the Senate is hung up is because \nthe majority leader is saying: We have 51 percent of the votes in the \nSenate, and we want two-thirds of the money to run the place? Isn't \nthat exactly what is hanging this up?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I say to my friend. Revisionist history is a very good \nway of projecting what has been said on the other side--revisionist \nhistory. The fact is, I say to my friend from North Dakota, who, I am \nsure, realizes this, when Senator Jeffords announced he was going to \nmove from the Republican Party, it was about 6 weeks from the time he \nannounced that to the time the actual change took place; that is, the \nreorganizing resolution.\n  Technically, the Senator from North Dakota is right. Senator Daschle \nbecame majority leader on June 6, 2001. The organizing resolution was \nadopted on June 29, 2001. So that is a period of over 3 weeks. But the \nactual time period is 6 weeks. Let's take those 3-plus weeks we waited \naround.\n\n  Responding to my friend from Arizona, for whom I have the greatest \nrespect--and he is a fine lawyer, but sometimes lawyers make tones and \narguments that are not as factual as they appear--he said 70 days they \nhave been waiting; something should have been done during that period \nof time.\n  I said it earlier and I will say it again. It is not Senator \nDaschle's fault that he was not negotiating earlier. It was the fault \nof the Republicans because they could not determine who was going to be \ntheir leader. Senator Daschle had some early meetings with Senator Lott \nright after the election, but those meetings were for nought because \nthey got a new leader a few days ago, and Senator Daschle has been \ndoing his very best to project a very simple message. That is, if the \nSenate was divided 51-49 with the Democrats controlling and the \nRepublicans in the minority and there is a shift in power where the \nRepublicans control and the Democrats are in the minority, let's have \nthe same rules. It is simple: Let's have the same rules.\n  There have been people who have come to the Chamber and said: Why \nwould they argue over space? As we know, there are a number of issues \nthe two leaders have to work out. They have to work out the funding, \nand they have to work out making sure that is fair, as it was last \ntime, and the space is basically the same as it was last time. It has \nnothing to do with blue slips or yellow slips or green slips. There is \nanother issue around here dealing with leadership space. It has nothing \nto do with that.\n  It has everything to do with we, the minority, want to be treated \njust as the Republicans when they were in the minority. I am from \nNevada. I think we have a lot of common sense in Nevada. Some people \nmay not agree with some of the things we do or do not do. My friend \nfrom North Dakota and I have had a number of good laughs about the\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\ndifferences between Nevada and North Dakota, but the fact is common \nsense prevails in Nevada, and common sense dictates to me that if you \nhave the exact same makeup of the Senate--100 Senators--but the \nmajority has changed, two Senate seats have changed and now instead of \n51-49 Democrats, it is 51-49 Republicans, why shouldn't the same rules \napply?\n  That is my answer to my friend from North Dakota. Simple, factual; it \nis play by the same rules that we had during the last Congress.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think people will look at this debate \nand say: What on Earth is going on here? The Senate at least ought to \nbe able to organize. I listened to some of this debate. For example, my \nfriend from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, said part of the reason we have to do \nthis right now is because we have all this unfinished business from \nlast year. In fact, Senator Daschle could not pass a budget last year, \nhe said. That is true, we could not pass a budget because my friend \nfrom Arizona and his friends would not vote for it. That is why we \ncould not pass a budget.\n  The fact is, there is a lot of discussion around here surrounding \nthis resolution. I, again, ask the Senator from Nevada, isn't this the \nsimplest possible issue to solve, and doesn't it send a message to \nevery kid in school: If you ever say fractions do not matter, come \nlisten to this debate because we have a circumstance where the majority \nis now saying: We have slightly over half of the Senate, 51 Members; \nyou have almost half of the Senate, 49, but we want two-thirds of the \nmoney. The next time a kid says fractions do not matter, go talk to the \nfolks who say it is true, we have just a little over a half but we want \ntwo-thirds of the money with respect to the Senate.\n  My point is, I assume this could be resolved this afternoon, and, in \nmy judgment, it should be resolved this afternoon by doing exactly what \nwas done in the last Congress. In the last Congress, we had 51 votes on \nthe Democratic side and 49 votes on the Republican side. So there was \nan apportionment of the money, about half and half, with a slight \nincrease for the administration of those who ran the committees.\n  Now there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. It seems to me the \neasiest solution is to use the same rule we had in the last session, \njust reverse it because that would be the fairest way to deal with the \ncircumstances in which there is a 51-49 split. Just reverse the parties \nand use exactly the same functioning mechanism that was used in the \nlast Congress.\n\n  The reason I say that is this ought to be the easiest possible thing \nto solve. It ought to be done this afternoon. We have a lot of work to \ndo. Those colleagues who have been talking about the need for this \nCongress to get to work are sure right about that. We have an economy \nthat is faltering. I am sure as we speak today there are perhaps \nthousands of people prepared to go home tonight to tell their spouse \nthey lost their job. There were 88,000 last month.\n  Mr. REID. One hundred and one thousand.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So they go home and say, I lost my job. This economy is \nnot working. This economy is contracting, not expanding. Should we do \nsomething about that? Sure, we ought to be working on that.\n  We have homeland security issues. We have appropriations bills. We \nhave a lot of work to do, so let's resolve this.\n  The simplest possible way to resolve it is for the majority leader to \nunderstand he ought to use the same formula for this Congress as the \nDemocrats used when they were in control in the last Congress.\n  It seems to me that is the fair way to do it, and it seems to me it \nought to be done this afternoon. Most people would look at this and say \nthis is silly, just do this and get it done now.\n  Mr. REID. Let me respond to my friend. When I was a young boy, I \ncould not run very fast. I was never fast afoot. So I participated in \ngames where it did not matter how fast you could run. I loved tug of \nwar because I was as good as anybody. I would dig in my heels and it \nwould take a lot to move me.\n  I want everyone within the sound of my voice to know my heels are dug \nin. The Democratic caucus' heels are dug in. We will win this tug of \nwar. They can put us to the test and have a series of votes to see if \nwe can proceed. They can have all the votes they want on the motion to \ninvoke cloture, but we are not going to bend. The Democrats in the \nSenate are dug in and we are not going to bend.\n  The resolution of this is going to be the same as it was in the last \nCongress because that was fair. We were fair to the Republicans and we \nexpect them to be fair to us. If they want to get to the issues my \nfriend from Arizona brought up--Iraq, Medicare reform, prescription \ndrugs--let them do it. They can do it 15 minutes from now. Organize the \nway we organized; otherwise, they can wait because they are holding it \nup; we are not.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I heard an impassioned plea by the \nDemocratic assistant leader on the other side of the aisle, whom I \ngreatly admire and respect. I am not sure whether he considers himself \nthe assistant majority leader now or the assistant leader, but I would \npoint out some facts that maybe should be filtered out of the \nsmokescreen of dialogue that has taken over.\n  The facts are these: The resolution before the Senate is a resolution \nto appoint majority members to committees so our new Members can be \nconfirmed to committees and so the majority can take the chairmanships \nof the committees of the Senate. That is the resolution before the \nSenate. That is the resolution which has always come to the Senate.\n  This resolution does not address the issue of funding. The issue of \nfunding has not actually come up from the standpoint of needing to be \ndone until sometime in February. It does not address the issue of \nspace, because the issue of space has never been addressed in this type \nof resolution. This resolution is the prototypical resolution that \ncomes before a Senate every time a Senate organizes. Under the \nconstitutional form of government we have in the United States, after \nelections the party that takes the majority organizes the Senate, \nappoints the members to the committees and has members of the \ncommittees become chairmen as a result of being in the majority party.\n  The Senator from Nevada, who I respect, has decided to cloud this \nissue of appointments to the committees with the issue of funding. I \nguess they see this as a point of leverage which they can use to \nquestion the funding through addressing the issue of membership to the \ncommittees.\n  What is the practical effect of the actions of the Democratic \nmembership of the Senate today? The practical effect is they are \ndenying the proper transfer of power that proceeds after an election. \nThey are essentially saying the election last fall does not matter; \nthat they remain chairmen of the committees in the Senate, even though \nthey are in the minority party.\n  Earlier today, I had a discussion with a Member of the Democratic \nleadership in the sense that he was chairman of the Banking Committee, \nand he represented he still considers himself to be chairman. Yet he \nalso acknowledges, as I think anybody does who is fairminded about \nthis, that he presently is in the minority.\n  How can one be chairman of the committee in our form of government if \nthey are in the minority? They cannot. They are usurping the rights of \nthe people of this country who have elected a majority in the Senate.\n  The majority has the right to chair the committees of the Senate, and \nyet the Democratic membership has decided to deny that right to the \nAmerican people, the right which they put forward when they voted in \nNovember.\n  I suppose if I were a Member of the Democratic side of the aisle, I \nwould have been frustrated by that election.\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nIt was the first time in recent memory--or maybe ever--that a sitting \nPresident actually won control of one of the bodies of Congress in an \noff-year. It was startling. I thank President Bush for his efforts, and \nI thank those folks who subscribe to his view of the way we should \ngovern. Obviously, I am very appreciative of the fact that as a result \nof that election we ended up going into the majority on the Republican \nside. Granted, it was only by one vote, but that is all it takes. All \nit takes in our constitutional form of government is one vote to be in \nthe majority. We do not function under a super majority for the \npurposes of organizing the Senate. We do not have to have 60 votes to \norganize the Senate. We have to have a 1-vote majority. When one gets \nthat 1-vote majority after an election, in a two-party system, \ninvolving a constitutional form of government, which is what we \nfunction under, then the new minority which used to be the majority is \nsupposed to transfer power over to the majority peacefully and without \nresistance.\n  What are we seeing today? Resistance. We have heard the assistant \nleader--who may consider himself to be assistant majority leader or the \nassistant minority leader, I am not sure, but the assistant leader say \nhis heels are dug in and we could be here, I suppose, until Lake Powell \nfreezes over before we are going to get a change from their side of the \naisle.\n  That fundamentally undermines the concept of constitutional \ngovernment after an election in a two-party system.\n  They may have a legitimate concern over funding. I happen to think \nthey do not. I believe the majority leader has made very reasonable \noffers in this case and, in fact, when it becomes public I think the \npublic will feel they were extremely reasonable offers, but they have \nno reasonable argument for holding up the proper transfer of power in a \nconstitutional government. They are doing fundamental damage to the way \nwe govern if they continue down this road.\n  There are Members on their side--in fact, all of the Members on their \nside--who I greatly respect, but there are some Members on their side \nwho have an immense history and strength on the issue of the integrity \nof the process in the Senate. I cannot believe those Members are not \ncringing at the thought we have not transferred responsibility in an \norderly way in the Senate.\n  The resolution before the Senate does not deal with space. It deals \nwith who is the majority party. It is totally inappropriate for Members \nfrom the other side to be chairing committees and claiming \nchairmanships of committees when they are no longer in the majority \nposition. It frustrates not only our side of the aisle but, more \nimportantly, it frustrates the intent and purpose of our form of \ngovernment. It is a serious matter. And the Senator from Nevada has dug \nhis heels in. So be it.\n  Speaking as one Senator on this side, I find this issue to be of such \nsignificance that I don't know how we can back off of our request that \nthe majority be the majority, that the chairmanships go to the \nmajority, that the memberships of the committees be given to the \nmajority. If we did, what would have been the purpose of the last \nelection? We would be fundamentally undermining that election.\n  What happens in the future? Do we move into a government where \nelections are reasonably irrelevant if they are close? No. Close \nelections happen in America. Presidents are elected by the electoral \ncollege without winning the popular vote. But the fact is they were \nelected under the constitutional form of government. Majorities take \ncontrol of the Senate when more Members of one party arrive in the \nSenate than from the other party. We have received certification from \nthe Secretaries of State across the country who have established beyond \nquestion that the Republican Party presently holds the majority in the \nSenate. And, as such, the Republican Party has the right to and must \nclaim the chairmanships of the committees of jurisdiction in the \nSenate. If we fail to do that, we fail our responsibility to the \nelectorate.\n  It is very hard to understand how the other side of the aisle can \nattempt to undermine this most fundamental exercise of the transfer of \npower after an election in a constitutional government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from New Hampshire said some nice \nthings about me that I am grateful for because the feelings are \ncertainly mutual. I have great admiration and respect for his public \nservice. I don't know what he did before he came to the House of \nRepresentatives, but he served there representing his State admirably. \nHe left the House and became Governor of the State and then came to the \nSenate. That is a great public service career. I am surprised I have \nheard him talk more the last day or so. He is not one who spends a lot \nof time on the floor. When he does speak, I always listen because he is \nvery direct and does not beat around the bush. I have not only great \nrespect for what he has accomplished but also his style as a \nlegislator.\n  Having said that, however, this is not undermining the election. \nRegarding the chairmanships, we do not dispute who should be chairman. \nNo one disputes that. Senator Sarbanes said that today. We recognize we \nare now in a minority, 51-49, just like the Republicans were in a \nminority a few months ago. What are we talking about? They say all this \nresolution does is allow us to be a chairman and appoint members of the \ncommittee. That is the problem. That is all it does.\n  We could settle this matter, as I told Senator Sarbanes, in less than \n15 minutes if, in addition to changing the chairmen and appointing the \nmembers of the committee, there would be an agreement the staff would \nremain as it was last year. That is, whatever the minority had last \nyear, we would still have, and that the same space the minority had, \nthe committee staff we are talking about, would be the same as it was \nlast year--simple as that.\n  Now, assume that I am wrong: Illogical, unreasonable, not factual. \nSay that I am wrong. It seems to me what would happen if the majority \nwould go along with the rules we had last time, the chairmanships would \ntake place immediately, the members of the committees would be \nappointed immediately, and the only thing they would have some concern \nabout--because we agree with that--is they gave us too much space and \nthey gave us too much of the financial resources to the committees.\n  I heard Senator Nickles, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, who I also \nam very fond of, earlier today state this has nothing to do with \ncommittee resources. Well, if it doesn't, what are we arguing about? We \nagree they should be chairmen. We agree they should be able to appoint \nthe committees. Why not go one step further and keep the same \nresources--because Senator Nickles said this battle was not about \nresources--the same resources as we had last year.\n  I might be having trouble comprehending, but like a lot of people \nhere I think I understand the procedures of the Senate. I understand \nthe resolution directed and dictated what we did last time. Why not do \nthe same thing? What is wrong with that? If the matters before the \ncountry are important--and I recognize they are; I realize we have \nproblems, as the Senator from Arizona talked about--we need to have \nsome discussion about Iraq, and we need to have a discussion about \nhealth care delivery in this country--the committees should be \nfunctioning better than they are.\n  The committees, instead of having a total of 89 Members, should have \n100 Members. Let's go to work and do that. That is all we are asking. \nWe are not asking for any advantage. We are only asking we be treated \nthe way the Republicans were treated when we were the majority.\n\n  If the matters to come before the country are that important, the \nmajority party, the party that controls the House, the White House, \nwhat in the world do they fear from having the same committee structure \nas we had last time with the same resources allocated? What is there to \nfear? If there were ever the ability to exercise authority and power in \nthe United States, it is from the White House, which is Republican, \nfrom a Senate that is Republican, and from the House of Representatives \nthat is Republican.\n  That is why we believe we are not being treated fairly, and the \nresolution\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nbefore this body is inadequate and incomplete. Until it is adequate and \ncomplete, we are going to hang in for the same rule that applied during \nthe 107th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S281-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REID. I will change the subject. Mr. President, I just received a \nnews flash from my office--not a pleasant one. K-Mart is going to close \nthree Nevada stores, including one on Rainbow Boulevard in Las Vegas, \none in Reno, and one in Carson City.\n  I agree with my friend from Arizona; we should be talking about the \neconomy. That is one thing he failed to mention, but I think we should \nbe talking about that as an important issue. The economy is in trouble. \nWe talked about that earlier today.\n  I was struck by the New York Times today which had an article written \nby Edmond Andrews: ``O'Neill Expresses Doubts About the Tax Cut.'' Who \nis O'Neill? This is Paul H. O'Neill, who was Secretary of the Treasury \nin this administration until he decided he did not like what was \nhappening with the tax policies of this country. And for lack of a \nbetter word, he was dumped, unceremoniously expelled from the \nadministration.\n  Now, he is a gentleman, and he is determined not to be too blatant in \nhis criticism of the White House. But in the process of not being too \ncritical, let me emphasize a few things that he said. The President's \nplan for stock dividends is something I would not have done. O'Neill \nhas also talked about his discomfort with the sweeping tax cuts. He \ntalked about these before his departure. And, of course, reading \nbetween the lines, I am sure that is one of the reasons for his \ndeparture.\n  He told a group of executives at a public meeting in the United \nStates Chamber of Commerce he would select, carefully, tax breaks that \nmight help the segments of the industry having the most trouble.\n  Mr. O'Neill said during his confirmation hearing in 2001 that he was \nskeptical about the wisdom of big tax cuts.\n  He said he was bitter about what was going on here in Washington. And \nI quote:\n\n       It's all about sound bites, deluding the people, pandering \n     to the lowest common denominator. Real leadership requires \n     you to stick your neck out and have a point of view.\n\n  As has been discussed here on the floor, the proposal to stimulate \nthe economy that has been propounded by this administration is, using \nthe words of some, bizarre, crazy. So I think it is important the \nPresident reexamine this proposal that would give huge amounts of money \nto rich people like him, like the Vice President, like Michael Eisner, \nthe head of Disney. I was told here on the floor yesterday that he will \nget $2.6 million extra money each year. That is not going to stimulate \nthe economy. But I guess if I had my druthers, it would be I would not \nbe spending so much time here on the floor and we would be getting to \nthe business that should be before the Senate; that is, doing the \nappropriations bills, the 11 that were undone, bringing some of the \nnominations the President has told us last Wednesday at the White House \nhe would like to have quickly.\n  I wish I were not here doing the things I have done in the last \ncouple of days and we had gone about the business of the Senate. We \ncannot do that until this organizing resolution passes. I hope we can \ndo that. Then we can talk about the things the Senate should be doing, \nrather than doing the work some refer to as kind of inside politics, \ninside the beltway.\n  Mr. President, is my friend from Kansas going to speak soon?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am ready to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S281-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S281-S283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MAKING MAJORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today with some degree of \nreluctance, I might say, to discuss the apparent disagreement and the \ndifference of opinion within the Select Committee on Intelligence with \nregard to staffing. This is the kind of disagreement that is obviously \ntaking place in many of the committees in the Senate. We have heard a \nlot about this. We probably heard too much about it, to the point this \nwhole business is now at the leadership level and is holding up the \nappointment of committee chairmen, not to mention the business of the \nSenate. This is not only regrettable but, as this drags on, I think \nthis really represents the kind of sandbox silliness--that is my term--\nthat prompts folks outside the beltway to wonder if this body is the \nSenate or a partisan romper room.\n  Given the importance of our Select Committee on Intelligence and our \nobligations and our responsibilities during this time of vital national \nsecurity threat--and I am talking about the war on terrorism, I am \ntalking about Iraq, I am talking about North Korea, not to mention any \nnumber of other national security threats by state and nonstate \nterrorists--and given the committee's 26 years of history of \nbipartisanship--that means no majority, no minority, no Republican, no \nDemocrat approach or viewpoint--we should not be having this dispute. \nThe Select Committee on Intelligence is very different from any other \ncommittee in the Senate. In fact, it is a committee that serves the \nentire Senate; it is your committee, my colleagues, and the leadership, \nand given its importance at this particular time in our history this \ncommittee, above all others, should be spared this kind of public spat.\n  Senator Rockefeller, our very distinguished vice-chairman-to-be, \nmyself, the incoming chairman--I hope, I hope we can get past this--our \nleadership and the entire Senate should not be party or bystanders to \nwhat has been going on in the Senate for the last week or so. It is \nuntoward. That is the nice way of saying it. In Dodge City, KS, we \nwould say we should not be part of this hell-for-leather ride down a \npartisan trail of obstructionism like a herd of cattle milling about in \nconfusion and delay in a box canyon. That is about what it looks like \nin my hometown.\n  But here we are, and the leadership tells me the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Senate's select committee, the committee that really \nbelongs to us all, is at loggerheads. I don't know that because I have \nnot been part of the negotiations. But the leadership tells me this is \nnow a separate issue.\n  In saying this, I don't question the intent of the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. I want to point out he is a good man. He is \na good Senator. He is a personal friend. I look forward to working with \nVice Chairman Rockefeller. We have already discussed mutual goals, \npossible long-term structural reform within the intelligence community, \nnot to mention the regular business of the committee with regard to our \noversight responsibilities--and they are pressing responsibilities. We \nshould be meeting this week.\n  The truth of it is we simply have a different--an apparent difference \nof opinion on how the Intelligence Committee should be organized. So \nhere I am on the floor of the Senate, making one of those ``I had not \nintended to make a speech'' speeches.\n\n  The larger issue is whether or not the duly elected majority will be \nable to run the Senate. We should not be laying down organizational \ndemands, demands for more space--this space, that space; different \nrules on how this body will consider the confirmation of judges. The \nnext thing you know, it is going to be majority and minority restrooms. \nThat is about where we have come to.\n  But I believe the issue involving the organization of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence is important because of what is at stake, and \nwhat is at stake is our national security. The difference, as I \nunderstand it--and as I say again, this has been at the leadership \nlevel for about a week now, and I think it can be summarized quite \neasily. We should preserve the committee's 26-year history of \nbipartisanship. We should preserve our Intelligence Committee staff as \na single unified staff that works for the committee as a whole under \nthe supervision of the chairman and the vice chairman. Let me repeat \nthat, the chairman and the vice chairman.\n  The minority--or I guess we should call them the temporary majority, \nI hope it is temporary--apparently wishes to divide the committee staff \nfor the first time in history into a majority/minority or partisan \ncamps. To the contrary, we should preserve the committee's 26-year \nhistory of nonpartisanship by keeping to a minimum\n\n[[Page S282]]\n\nthose staff who are designated as partisan. The minority apparently \nwishes to increase the ranks of partisan staff.\n  We should structure the committee staff in accordance with the \ncommittee's rules and custom and practice. We should not repeal the \ncommittee's rules and ignore our custom and practice of working \ntogether with one single staff.\n  As I said before, the Select Committee on Intelligence has been a \nunique institution in the Senate and was envisioned from the start to \noperate under different rules than any other committee. The \nIntelligence Committee was created by S. Res. 400 over 25 years ago. \nThe resolution actually grew out of the intelligence abuses of the \n1970s which were highlighted by the Church Committee.\n  There were a number of proposals for the creation of the Intelligence \nCommittee--numerous hearings, lengthy debate and multiple amendments. \nIn the end, the Senate agreed to create a bipartisan committee with--I \nunderscore this--a permanent professional nonpartisan staff to serve \nthe committee as a whole.\n  The intent was to limit sharply the number of designated partisan \nstaff. In fact, our rules really contemplate only two positions to be \nwholly partisan. This is not well understood apparently by those who \nhave a difference of opinion.\n  The only positions that are wholly partisan are the minority staff \ndirector and the minority counsel. The rest of the staff works for the \n``committee as a whole.''\n  That is a quote from S. Res. 400--under the direct supervision and \ncontrol of the staff director on behalf of the chairman and the vice \nchairman--both of us.\n  The Senate report accompanying S. Res. 400 emphasizes the bipartisan \nnature of the committee. I am quoting here:\n\n       The unique importance and nature of the matters [of] the \n     committee will make such bipartisanship essential. The \n     existence of trust and confidence between the executive \n     branch and the committee will enable the committee to \n     exercise more effective oversight. This trust and confidence \n     will only be achieved if the committee does act in a fully \n     bipartisan manner.\n\n  That comes from the Senate Report 94-675.\n  In order to ensure the committee would act in this fully bipartisan \nmanner, committee rules provide for a single unified staff that works \nfor the committee as a whole under the supervision of the chairman and \nthe vice chairman. No other committee is advised by a nonpartisan and \nalso integrated staff.\n  Committee rules also provide the minority extraordinary powers \nthrough the vice chairman. Our rules emphasize and confirm the unique \nauthorities of the minority and the bipartisan nature of the \nIntelligence Committee and its distinction from the other committees of \nthe Senate. Let me give you some examples.\n  Rule 2 of the committee's Rules of Procedure permits the vice \nchairman to preside over the committee.\n  Rule 2 also permits meetings to occur without the presence of a \nmajority member of the committee.\n  Rule 6 actually permits the vice chairman to authorize a committee \ninvestigation.\n  Rule 7 actually permits the vice chairman to issue a subpoena.\n  Rule 8 actually permits the vice chairman to authorize witness \ninterrogation by committee staff.\n  Rule 9 requires that both the chairman and the vice chairman agree to \nauthorize disclosure of or access to committee information. That means \nboth the majority and the minority are made aware of requests by any \nmember of the Senate to review any committee document, and either can \nprevent it.\n  Rule 10 requires all staff work for the committee as a whole. Thus \nthe chairman or the vice chairman may direct any professional staff \naction through the staff director.\n  Rule 10 requires all staff assist the minority in the writing of any \nminority or additional views.\n  I know. I have had them help me when we were in the minority; more \nespecially in a report on the USS Cole.\n  Rule 11 requires staff members brief both majority and minority \nmembers, which means there are no secrets from the minority.\n  These authorities and privileges enjoyed by the vice chairman \nillustrate clearly the unique nature of this committee and the \nimportance of these authorities in maintaining its nonpartisan nature.\n  Some have argued this structure has not worked in the past. And I \nwould argue that it has worked--and it has worked well--when the \nchairman and the vice chairman want it to work. It requires \ncooperation, and one cannot foster a spirit of cooperation by proposing \nto fire all of our current professional staff, split the committee's \nstaff in two, and rehire on a partisan basis. The unique bipartisan \nnature of this committee is its greatest strength and is essential to \nthe ability of the committee to develop a consensus product and to \navoid all of the politics of our Nation's intelligence activities. That \nwould not serve our Nation well, and that could occur.\n  The legislative record reflects that the Senators who really created \nthe Intelligence Committee believed--this is so important--that the \nless partisan nature of the committee would serve to make the \nintelligence community more willing to keep the Congress fully and \ncurrently informed of highly sensitive intelligence activity. For a \nquarter of a century, this has permitted the committee to fulfill its \nprimary responsibility: Oversight of the intelligence activities of the \nUnited States Government. My 6 years on the committee tell me that is \nabsolutely true.\n  I remember the years when Dick Shelby was chairman, Richard Bryan was \nvice chairman, and Bob Kerrey was vice chairman. We got along well. It \nisn't that we didn't have any differences of opinion, but we acted in a \nnonpartisan, bipartisan way in the interests of the United States.\n  The incoming vice chairman has argued that under our rules the vice \nchairman has access to only two staff, and the chairman, which would be \nmyself, would control the rest. That is not true. That is absolutely \nincorrect. Under our rules, the entire staff works for the chairman and \nthe vice chairman jointly.\n  I do not know how many times I have to say this. In fact, the vice \nchairman actually controls the committee's only truly partisan staff \nbecause everybody else works for the committee as a whole.\n  That is the concept that is hard, I guess, for some people to \nunderstand. He has two minority staff. Those are the only partisan \nstaff. The rest of the entire committee works for the committee as a \nwhole, including myself and the vice chairman.\n  It is about the eighth time I have had to repeat that. I hope it \nfinally sinks in.\n  My advice to my good and excellent friend from West Virginia is you \nshould never take to ``sawin' '' on the branch that is ``supportin' '' \nyou unless you are going to be hung from it.\n  We are not hanging anybody. This is not Judge Bean. We have promised \na bipartisan approach to all issues on the Intelligence Committee.\n  You have my word that will be the case. As chairman, I have no staff \nwhich works exclusively for me. I cannot understand how one can argue \nthe minority is unsupported when the entire staff, excluding the \ndesignated minority staff, works for the vice chairman as well, and his \ndesignated staff works exclusively for him.\n  The proposal, as I understand it, is to split the staff into a \nmajority-minority camp. That is contrary to the 26-year precedent for \nthe operation of the committee, the bipartisan spirit of the \ncommittee's enabling legislation, S. Res. 400, the rules of the \nIntelligence Committee for the management of the staff, and the intent \nof the Senate.\n\n  Other than that, it is a heck of a good idea.\n  I believe the committee has worked well and effectively with the \nprofessional nonpartisan staff as originally intended and should \ncontinue to do so.\n  I have faith. I am an optimist. I have faith that the incoming vice \nchairman, Senator Rockefeller, and I can continue a long tradition of \ncooperation personally and that has been taking place on the committee \nbetween the chairman and vice chairman in this unique and valuable \ninstitution. Once we get past this tiff, this spat, these differences \nof opinion--what shouldn't be but is now a big piece in this hole, or \nwhatever we are into here--I would call it obstructionism, and I think \nany proposal to split the committee or increase the numbers of strictly \npartisan\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\nstaff would represent a break with tradition. I think it would not be \nin the best interests of the committee, of the Senate, or of our \nnational security.\n  I want to say one other thing not related to Senator Rockefeller and \nour difference of opinion but something that is of great concern. It is \nbecoming apparent in statements from some of my colleagues across the \naisle over the past several days and weeks that there is a growing \ncampaign of criticism aimed at the President, the war against \nterrorism, and what may be a necessary military confrontation with Iraq \nand Saddam Hussein, not to mention now the entire business with North \nKorea. It would appear to me as an individual Senator on the Armed \nServices Committee and on the Intelligence Committee that any criticism \non foreign policy does not stop at the water's edge. It also appears \nnow that is true of national security as well.\n  In this regard, I don't question any Member's honest intent or \ndifference of opinion relative to our national security, not to mention \ntheir patriotism. That is not what I am talking about. We need healthy \ndebate. We have strong differences of opinion. That is our obligation \nas Senators.\n  But when we hear statements that this Nation is no better prepared, \nintelligence-wise, than we were prior to 9/11, that is not right. \nNothing hurts the truth so much as stretching it. And, boy, that is a \nstretch. That is not only not true but it borders on the politics of \nopportunism.\n  Our job on the Intelligence Committee is to conduct serious, tough, \nproactive, and vigorous oversight, and to hold the intelligence \ncommunity accountable, as well, I think, as being a champion for their \nmission and enabling the community to safeguard our Nation. That is why \nwe should not allow the Intelligence Committee to split into partisan \ncamps during these perilous times.\n  Finally, in regard to this whole business of holding up the \nchairmanships and transfer of power and the Senate's business, we all \nran through partisan gauntlets of sorts to gain the privilege of being \nhere--some more than others. Yet the special fabric that binds this \ninstitution in purpose and in achievement is bipartisan.\n  I am the first to admit that no political party has an exclusive \npatent on common sense or can lay claim to what is absolutely right. \nPersonally, I try very hard to work with my good Democrat colleagues \nand friends. And, yes, they are my friends. Now, to be sure, we have \nour differences, but for the most part we work together, and we try on \nthe other fellow's boots. Sometimes they pinch--sometimes they pinch \nreally hard--but we get the foot to fit and we get something done.\n  I try to be the best Member I know how to be. That is tempered by \nover 30 years of public service as a staffer and a House and Senate \nMember. I am a piece of old furniture around here.\n  But to my friends now in the minority and acting as if you are in the \nmajority, that is the rub. Part of what we are is what the other side \nallows us to be. And during these past 8 or 9 days, you have had us on \nshort reins--in fact, no reins at all. And I know this: If this \nobstructionism keeps up--the space, the staffing, the ratios, the blue \nslips, the rules on judges, and Lord knows what is next--you will tear \nthat special fabric that holds us together as the Senate of the United \nStates.\n  If we do not end this business and get to the business of the Nation, \nand understand there is a majority and a minority and that the majority \nrules, we will open up a wound further that will not heal without \nsignificant price and scar, not to mention public ridicule for our \ninstitution.\n  The sad thing is, I say to my colleagues, we did not have to go down \nthis road.\n  Mr. President, I always figure it is a good thing to be a little bit \nnicer than is called for. I do not think too many Members would call me \ntoo nice. But in trying to be a little bit nicer than is called for, \nyou shouldn't take too much guff.\n  My colleagues across the aisle, it is time to end the guff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Kansas leaves \nthe floor, I just want to say to him that in all my years in the \nSenate, that is one of the finest speeches I have ever heard. And I \nthink it came at a particularly good time, as we remind ourselves, once \nagain, what this body is supposed to be like. No matter how bitterly we \ncontest these elections, at the end of the day we are here to do the \npeople's business. And to fail to even take the elementary steps to \nmake it possible for us to get started in doing that is an enormous \ndisservice to this institution and to the country.\n  Beyond that, I think it is important to remember what the \nIntelligence Committee is all about. I think the Senator, by laying out \nthe history of the committee, and the tradition of the committee, and \nthe way it has protected sensitive information, and the way it has, in \neffect, insisted upon bipartisan cooperation, has done a great service \nfor the Senate. That was a speech we needed to hear, given at precisely \nthe right time.\n  I thank my friend again.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I judge the parliamentary situation is \nsuch that the Senator can speak as in morning business for not to \nexceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no restriction at this point.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee will conduct a closed hearing with the Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as our witnesses. This came about \nin a routine way as a consequence of a letter that Senator Levin, the \nchairman of the committee, and I as ranking member, sent to the \nSecretary on January 8.\n  Senator Levin and I have worked closely in the joint management of \nthis committee, and I expressed to him, following the Christmas recess, \nthe need that I perceived for Members to get a current briefing with \nregard to those issues relating to the Department of Defense, obviously \none being the deployment to Iraq, the situation in Iraq, the situation \nin Korea, and other matters--generally speaking, the continuing war \nthat the President is engaging against terrorist.\n  I am about to read the letter we sent. I have been very much involved \nin these issues as a member of this committee. Senator Levin and I \nstart our 25th year as Senators, and we have been together on that \ncommittee now this quarter of a century. We have worked together very \nclosely in a trusting relationship, and that continues.\n  We have had our strong differences, particularly when we manage the \nannual Defense authorization bill. We have taken the two desks of our \nrespective leaders here and debated issues during those 25 years. We \nhave our differences with regard to certain issues as they relate to \nIraq.\n  Interestingly enough, we planned a joint trip to Korea some 18 months \nago, but that trip just could not be developed.\n  I bring that background only to say this letter reflects a perfectly \nroutine meeting that we have had through the years and the joint desire \non behalf of the committee to have these two very important witnesses \nappear to bring us up to their current knowledge with regard to these \nissues. It is a routine matter.\n\n  There is some concern that we have summoned the Secretary of Defense \nto be here tomorrow morning as a consequence of some publicity that has \nbeen put forward of recent regarding the relationships between the \nCongress and the administration and, most specifically, the Department \nof Defense. Some of that publicity relates to a conference Republican \nSenators held last week. I have always followed the rule--\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nand will continue to do so--that those are private matters between the \nrespective conferences of this side of the aisle and that side of the \naisle, and what transpires is simply our business.\n  Nevertheless, certain facts have emanated from the one held by the \nRepublicans.\n  Coincidentally, the morning after that conference, Senator Levin and \nI--just the two of us from the Senate--had a breakfast meeting with the \nSecretary of Defense and about, I would say, eight of his senior \nmembers to discuss a wide range of issues. At that meeting, we brought \nup the subject of this letter, and the Secretary said: Of course, let's \nschedule whatever time you want. I have the letter. I am ready to come.\n  In fact, he had just briefed the House Armed Services Committee in a \nsimilar way.\n  This letter is straightforward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. It states in part:\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary, we are writing to request that you or \n     your Deputy, together with Joint Chiefs . . . testify before \n     the Armed Services Committee next week, in both open and \n     closed session--\n\n  We have now decided it will be just in closed session--\n\n     on current and potential U.S. military operations. . . .\n\n  And the letter flows thereafter. It will be part of the Record.\n  In no way is this to be construed as a summons to the Secretary by \nmyself or Senator Levin with respect to our concerns about the \nconsultation process between the Department of Defense and the \nCongress.\n  To amplify on my concern about certain inquiries that have been \nreceived in my office in the last roughly 36 hours, I do feel very \nstrongly about the situation in Iraq; likewise, the situation in Korea. \nI believe every Member of this body feels very strongly about it.\n  Frankly, candidly, and proudly, I say that our President has \nexhibited the extraordinary leadership with regard to particularly the \nsituation in Iraq and the manner in which he has taken steps in the \ninternational arena--the United Nations, the Security Council--working \nwith the heads of state and governments of nations which are now and \nhave been close friends and allies in trying to bring about peace in \nthis world.\n  I have said in this Chamber, and I will continue to say, that in my \nhumble career, almost a quarter of a century in this body and some 5 \nyears I spent in the Pentagon where I was exposed to international \nsituations, foremost among them the war in Vietnam, Mr. President, the \nsituation in Iraq is one of the most complex and serious situations I \nhave ever witnessed in my professional career as a public servant. I \nthink it requires the highest degree of attention that it is receiving \nby our President, that it has, is, and will be received by this august \nbody, the Senate, and working with the House as a Congress as a whole. \nI think our President has received strong support with regard to the \nsteps he has taken.\n\n  I was proud with Senator McCain, Senator Bayh, and Senator Lieberman \nto draw up a resolution which was passed by this body on which, for the \nrecord--and it is in the Record--Senator Levin and I had disagreements, \nbut there was a strong endorsement of the actions being taken by our \nPresident.\n  In that context, I think the consultation process between the \nPresident and his principal Cabinet officers and others in the Congress \nhas to be stronger than it has ever been because of the complexity of \nthis situation. That is why I urged Senator Levin to have this hearing \ntomorrow. That is why I am taking other steps to see that our \ncommittee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, which presumably in the \nnot too distant future I will be named chairman, receives the maximum \namount of information, not only that it desires but that it needs to \nproperly perform our oversight process, that it needs to properly not \nonly relate to our constituents but to members of the administration to \nconvey our feelings and views which indeed could be contrary in some \nrespects to actions taken or that are about to be taken by the \nPresident and others as it relates to this situation.\n\n  North Korea is a very special and complex situation. Again, I think \nour President is following the correct steps.\n  Had I had the opportunity, I probably would have advised a greater \nrelationship in terms of visitations and otherwise with the regime in \nNorth Korea, assuming the opportunity had been provided, but that \ngovernment completely abandoned the commitments they had made earlier, \nand indeed the commitments which presumably they were continuing with \nthis administration of President George Bush.\n  I will not get involved in the various details there, but I am \ngravely concerned about the some 37,000 men and women in the Armed \nForces who are essential on that border to show the resolve of this \ncountry to protect South Korea and to try to promote first the \ndeterrence of any combat and then perhaps promote closer relationships \nbetween the North and the South. Those forces, together with other \nassociated forces on standby, are in the area of North and South Korea \nfor peaceful purposes.\n  I do not know what will evolve from the efforts by the \nadministration, which I think are very positive. The administration has \nsent a high-ranking official over there to see whether, in working with \nour principal allies on this matter--Japan, China, Russia--we can work \ntogether as a group of nations to once again bring back a course of \naction which will involve the cessation of the manufacture of weapons \nof mass destruction by North Korea and to foster a closer and more \npeaceful relationship with those two countries and North Korea as it \nrelates to the neighboring countries in that area of the world, and \nhopefully to curtail the continued export by North Korea of weapons of \nmass destruction to other nations.\n  I return to this whole subject of the consultation and its importance \nat this particular time because of the complexity and the difficulty of \nthe American people to really fully grasp the seriousness of this \nsituation in Iraq and the threat posed by Saddam Hussein.\n  I saw where there is being planned what has been termed a peaceful \nmarch, a protest march, protesting the possibility of military \nengagement with Iraq at some point in time. I underscore that our \nPresident has made no decision about that and repeatedly says he has \nmade no decision about it.\n  For over 5 years during the war in Vietnam, I was privileged to serve \nin the Navy Secretariat. I remember so many times coming up to the Hill \nto testify. I remember the widening gap between the Congress of the \nUnited States and the administration in that period of time because of \nthe different views with regard to that conflict. Who suffered the \nmost? It was really the men and women of the Armed Forces who were \ncourageously fighting in that war.\n  I suppose at no time in the long public career which I have been \nprivileged to have in this country have I had such heartfelt compassion \nfor the men and women in the Armed Forces than in that period. They \nwould come home on leave or come home wounded or tragically, in many \ncases, not come home as a consequence of being a casualty on the \nbattlefields, battlefields which I visited on occasion, and the ships, \nand they would come home to a nation that did not understand what they \nwere doing, a nation that was hostile to them individually and \ncollectively, as well as to the families of those service persons.\n\n  Strengthening the consultation between the Congress and the executive \nbranch at this time is essential to see that that chapter in American \nhistory is never repeated.\n  Today we have an all-volunteer force, and I think it is magnificent. \nI do not think we have to return to the draft--but I will save that for \nanother day--because I experienced the draft periods. I was privileged \nto serve briefly in a very modest way in the Navy in the concluding \nmonths of World War II when the draft was on. I happened to volunteer \nat 17. Most of my age group at that time did volunteer for selective \nservice. I served again in the Korean war, briefly again in Korea. \nAgain, it was a draft situation. I do not want to return to those \nperiods where men and\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\nwomen--well, in those days men were drafted. Any future draft would \nhave to involve both sexes, but that is a subject for another time.\n  I harken back to those periods of Vietnam, and I will watch very \ncarefully what transpires in the next few days during this hopefully \npeaceful protest of the policies of the Government as they relate to \nthe possible use of our troops in the war.\n  I want to recount one other chapter which I will never forget. My \nrecollection is it was Saturday afternoon and I was in my office and my \nbeloved, dear friend John Chafee, who used to sit right at that desk, \nwas Secretary of the Navy and I was Under Secretary, and Secretary \nLaird telephoned me and said: I would like to have you and John Chafee \ngo down to The Mall and take a look at another demonstration--by the \nyoung men and women of that era--in protest to Vietnam and come back \nand have a talk with me.\n  I remember so well that in those days we were all dressed up in our \nbusiness suits even though it was a Saturday. We used to work pretty \nmuch 6 days a week during that war. We dispensed with our chauffeur-\ndriven cars. We got in an old car and drove down to The Mall in some \nsort of cobbled together set of gym clothes, or whatever we had on. We \nblended right into that crowd. I can see it as clearly this moment as I \ndid then.\n  Estimates were there were close to a million--I want to repeat that--\nclose to a million young men and women. There was no particular anger, \nbut they were protesting the war in Vietnam and the impact that war was \nhaving on their lives, their future, and their loved ones or friends or \notherwise who had suffered the consequences of serving in uniform in \nthat period. I do not want to see a return to that.\n  I remember we went back and talked to Secretary of Defense Laird \nabout what we had seen, and I can see him now. He was very concerned \nbecause we did not have in place then a clear policy by which at some \npoint in time we as a nation had to come to the conclusion that we had \nto basically make an honorable and dignified exit in that situation. \nThat is for another day for historians to examine. It is emblazoned in \nmy mind. I do not see nor do I sense among our people across the Nation \ntoday any feeling that such magnitude of a problem exists at this point \nin time with regard to Iraq.\n\n  Nevertheless, those situations come about sometimes quickly. That is \nwhy I will always be an advocate--whether it is the Bush \nadministration, whether it is the Clinton administration, the Carter \nadministration, or the previous Bush administration; I have worked with \nthem all; I have been privileged to work in this body a quarter of a \ncentury--why I have been a steadfast proponent for consultation. I will \ncontinue. I hope it is not misconstrued by way of criticism. It is \nconstructive thinking and drawing upon my own, you might say limited, \nexperiences in previous military conflicts in this country.\n  I recall at the conclusion of World War II when those in uniform came \nhome. They were welcomed with open arms. It is impossible in these few \nminutes to describe the gratitude of the Nation, of the world, for the \nparticipation of those upward 16 million who served in that conflict \nand how all doors were open when they came home.\n  That was not present in Korea. It is why it is called the forgotten \nwar. When they came back, there was no warm reception. We read \nsomething about it, but we were not entirely sure what it was they were \nfighting for over there. It is called the forgotten war. Over 50,000 \nmen, and some women, from the United States of America gave their lives \nin that conflict. That is why it is called the forgotten war. \nFortunately, today there are a number of things that have taken place \nto properly put in perspective the enormous sacrifice this country gave \nto secure for South Korea the freedoms they have enjoyed, the freedoms \nthat have flourished. It is with a certain sense of sadness I read from \ntime to time now that certain elements of the South Korean people \nresent our presence there.\n  The principle focus of these remarks is to reflect in the quiet \nmoments at the end of a long day in the Senate a subject I feel \nstrongly about, the consultation between the executive branch--whatever \nPresident it would be--and his principal Cabinet and other officers \nwith this body, particularly in times as stressful and as complex as we \nare now facing here with the Iraqi situation or with the Korean \nsituation.\n  I encourage the Department of Defense at the earliest point to \nrelease such statistics they keep with regard to the consulting \nprocess, the number of times that the Secretary of Defense has been up \nto brief the Congress--as they are going to do tomorrow. To the extent \nI can reflect on those brief remarks that I make to our conference, \nthey were done in a constructive tone, a noncritical tone, and against \nthe background that I briefly described of what I have experienced in \nmy years as a public servant in times that are parallel, in many \nrespects, to what we have now with the extraordinary tensions in this \nworld as a consequence of terrorists, as a consequence of a despot such \nas Saddam Hussein.\n  Much is unknown about the Government of North Korea and its principal \nleaders. That is, in itself, very difficult. We have so little insight \ninto that regime and particularly the leader of that nation at this \ntime.\n  I conclude by saying I will continue to speak out. If I feel strongly \nenough I will criticize. I have been known to do it. At this time I am \ntrying to provide an element of constructive leadership as it relates \nto my good friend and longtime friend. When I was in the Navy, \nSecretary Rumsfeld was on President Nixon's staff in the White House, \nand we have known each other from that period of time. We formed a \nfriendship then and have seen each other in the intervening years. We \nremain trusting and good, close working colleagues. Now and then he has \na few choice words about me about some of the things I have done over \nhere. He was not entirely pleased with my efforts on TRICARE For Life \nand current receipts, but those are honest differences between public \nservants.\n  In this instance, what I said at that conference was done in a \nheartfelt, constructive manner and it was not in any way directed it as \na personal criticism against any of the President's Cabinet or the \nPresident himself. It was done simply to lay down a format for \nconsultation with this body in the weeks and months to come, as we are \ncontinuing to lead as a nation to secure freedom in this world and a \ngreater degree of peace for others.\n  Tomorrow's hearing will be very important before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I am confident the Secretary will share such \ninformation that is essential for us to perform our functions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense, the Pentagon, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing to request that you or \n     your Deputy, together with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman \n     General Richard B. Myers, USAF, testify before the Armed \n     Services Committee next week, in both open and closed \n     session, on current and potential U.S. military operations. \n     In particular, we request that you discuss the commitment of \n     military forces in and around Afghanistan allocated to the \n     global war on terrorism, the buildup of U.S. military \n     personnel and equipment in the Persian Gulf region to \n     confront the threat posed by Iraq, and potential military \n     commitments in support of a diplomatic solution to the \n     enhanced tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n       As the 108th Congress convenes, our nation is facing a \n     broad range of national security challenges. Together with a \n     large coalition of nations, our troops are engaged in the \n     second year of operations in Afghanistan; on an almost daily \n     basis, U.S. military forces are deploying to areas around \n     Iraq; and for the past month, we have witnesses escalating \n     tension over the North Korean nuclear weapons program.\n       Our Committee last conducted hearings on Iraq in September \n     of 2002, prior to the vote on the resolution to authorize the \n     use of force against Iraq, followed by a briefing in \n     December. We had comprehensive hearings on Afghanistan in \n     July 2002, and North Korea in March 2002, when the combatant \n     commanders responsible for those regions testified.\n       As the new Congress convenes, and the Committee has a large \n     number of new Members, it is essential to our oversight \n     responsibilities to gain a timely update on vital national \n     security issues in order to fulfill our constitutional \n     responsibilities.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Warner.\n     Carl Levin.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the fllor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, I will take just a very brief moment to \nupdate our Members as to where we are in our recent discussions. We \nhave spent most of today, while debate has been underway, continuing \ndiscussions in terms of the committee resolution. Pending on the floor \nis that resolution making the majority party appointments for the 108th \nCongress. A number of the issues have been raised, both on the floor as \nwell as between the leaders, and we have made tremendous progress. We \nhave, over the course of the day, resolved many of the concerns that \nhave been raised. I believe we are very close to working out an \nagreement that will let us adopt the respective committee resolution--\nand very quickly begin work on the appropriations bill.\n  My hope is that over the course of this evening and in the morning, \nthe last of these issues will have been worked through and we can \nachieve the objective of organizing the committees.\n  I will say that as a backstop, or a preventive measure, I am \ncompelled tonight to file cloture on the resolution in the event--\nagain, this is not anticipated at all because of the great progress \nthat has been made--in the event that we are unable to reach an \nagreement on the committee resolution. Again, I am very hopeful that \nearly tomorrow we will be ready to pass the respective party \nresolutions and begin the appropriations process.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I send a cloture motion to the desk to S. Res. 18 making \nmajority party appointments for the 108th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say, through the Presiding Officer, to the majority \nleader, there have been a lot of speeches on the floor today. People \nsaid what they said. I think everything has been said, but not quite \neveryone has said it.\n  I feel good about the progress that has been made. However, I say to \nthe majority leader, you and Senator Daschle are really close to being \nable to work something out. This is where it really gets hard. This is \nwhere you and Senator Daschle really have to show your leadership. I am \nconfident that will happen. It would be good for the institution if we \ncould get this done. We could move on, as the leader knows, to the \nappropriations bills which need to be done.\n  In spite of the threatening nature of the speeches on both sides \ntoday, tomorrow will be a better day. I am hopeful and very confident, \nand so is Senator Daschle, that we can work this out. I express to the \nmajority leader my wishes for a productive final half yard to the goal \nline.\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, progress has been made. I appreciate the comments. \nI expect continuing progress to be made such that tomorrow we will have \na very successful day in progressing the agenda that the American \npeople expect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S286-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred March 6, 2001 \nin Middleburg, PA. A gay man was severely beaten by two neighbors. \nMichael Aucker, 41, and two brothers, Todd Justin Clinger, 20, and Troy \nLee Clinger, 18, were drinking beer in a trailer when the brothers \nthought Aucker made a sexual advance towards them. Police said the \nbrothers took Aucker out on the deck and stomped on him with heavy work \nboots. Aucker was discovered a day and a half later by another neighbor \nand co-worker. He was in a coma and every bone in his face and nose \nwere broken. I believe that government's first duty is to defend its \ncitizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S286-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S286-S287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SITUATION IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to call my colleagues' attention \nto a situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last month, the \nparties to the bloody conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nsigned an accord intended to end the country's 4-year civil war. But \ncentral Africans may not have much reason to celebrate yet, because \nunless this step is accompanied by meaningful new initiatives, the \nagreement promises little change from the insecurity and repression \nthat have killed millions of their countrymen and dominated their lives \nthroughout the conflict.\n  As the outgoing chairman and incoming ranking Democratic member of \nthe Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs, I have monitored events in \nthe Congo in recent years, and I must share some of this skepticism. \nThe international community has been eager to certify a withdrawal of \nforeign forces so that it could move the Congo file out of the \ninternational crisis bin and into the overstuffed stack of civil \ncollapses. Consequently, the world has demanded very little of the \nsignatories to this new accord. Meanwhile, the demands of the Congolese \npeople appear to have not been taken into account at all.\n  The agreement provides for Joseph Kabila, who was installed as \nPresident in Kinshasa after his father's assassination, to remain in \nthe Presidency, and establishes four Vice-Presidential positions to \naccommodate his own party, the two major armed rebel groups, and the \nunarmed political opposition. But neither the President nor this bevy \nof Vice-Presidents can boast of any real political legitimacy, and thus \nfar plans to ensure an eventual democratic transition have a feeble, \nwishful quality that suggests no one takes them terribly seriously.\n  Intercommunal tensions in Eastern Congo continue to simmer violently \nin the context of atrocious governance, but this is treated as an \nextraneous and inconvenient detail. Violence continues to rage in the \nIturi region, displacing tens of thousands, it is clear,\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nkilling many civilians caught in a brutal struggle for power between \nfactions uninterested in any aspect of governance save the accumulation \nof power and riches.\n  Evidence that virtually all parties now ensconced in an \ninternationally sanctioned government have participated in rapacious \nexploitation of Congo's natural resources merited ambitious reports \nfrom a U.N. commission, but the United States appears to have largely \nignored the commission's recommendations. Mr. President, I want to \nstress how important the commission's work truly is, in exposing the \nmotives of the actors involved and revealing the extent to which the \ncountry's resources and future have been sold out to the highest \nbidder, leaving little for rebuilding the Congolese state and providing \nfor the needs of the Congolese people. The commission's work should \ncontinue, and the U.S. should work with our partners in the \ninternational community to make its recommendations reality.\n  But I want to underscore an important fact. Our failure to hold \nactors within Congo and within the Governments of Rwanda, Uganda, and \nZimbabwe accountable for looting the country is a lesser crime than our \nfailure to address the killing, rape, and deprivation that these forces \ninflicted on the Congolese. Despite the fanfare accompanying recent \nagreements, no one has meaningfully addressed the need to hold those \nresponsible accountable for the horrific human rights abuses that have \ncharacterized this conflict. In fact, the international community has \ncountenanced the slaughter of innocents with impunity throughout the \nregion for years, and appears to have even lost its taste for making \nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in the wake \nof the 1994 genocide, an effective and impartial body.\n  To consider the history of the Congo is to confront an appalling \nlitany of exploitation and manipulation--first orchestrated by \nBelgium's rapacious King Leopold, then by the American-backed \nkleptocrat, Mobutu Sese Seko. The Congolese people deserve finally to \nhave a voice in decisions about their political leadership and some \ndegree of control over their own destiny. But I fear that they are \nabout to get more of the same--more harassment of civil society and the \nfree press, more underdevelopment, and more thuggery disguised as \nauthority. The hundreds of millions of dollars that the U.S. is \ndevoting to peacekeeping in the Congo must be accompanied by real \npolitical leadership that underscores the need for accountability, \nimproved governance, grassroots participation, and focused \nreconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. Without that leadership, the \nAmerican people will have simply made a costly investment in continued \ninjustice.\n  The current approach is not merely morally reprehensible and fiscally \nirresponsible, it is also dangerous. In hearings I convened earlier \nthis year, I tried to draw out the links between unstable and lawless \nswathes of Africa and international criminal networks--including \nterrorist networks. Experts have warned about the potential for \nterrorists to acquire uranium from central African sources. A free-for-\nall of corruption and instability is appealing to money-launderers, \narms and mineral traffickers, and others who would prefer to keep their \nactivities in the shadows. The spillover effects of sustained chaos in \nCongo are simply too serious to be ignored. The U.S. needs a coherent, \nlong-term policy aimed at building stability and strengthening \ninstitutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S287-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAYOR ``DU'' BURNS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Mayor Clarence Henry Burns.\n  Mayor ``Du'' Burns was born to an economically poor family--but he \nwas rich in hope and spirit. No one gave Du Burns anything on a silver \nplatter. What he had and what he became--he did on his own--using his \nGod-given skills. He used his grit and gifts to make life better for \nthe people of Baltimore. He went from being a locker-room attendant to \nbecome the first African American Mayor of Baltimore, and he took his \nwhole community with him.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with Du Burns on the Baltimore City \nCouncil. I had such great respect and affection for him. We worked \ntogether to strengthen neighborhoods and built communities. He \nbelieved, as I do, that the best ideas come from the people. His \nmission was to meet the day to day needs of the people of Baltimore.\n  Mayor Burns was a coalition builder, forging an alliance for East \nBaltimore that included the different communities that give our city \nits strength. He started Baltimore's first homeless program. He \nstrengthened schools and libraries and public housing. He made our city \nwork.\n  Mayor Du Burns left an indelible mark on the city of Baltimore. He \nalso left a strong and loving family--and so many friends, including \nme. His wife Edith and his family are in my thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S287-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING A BROADCASTING PIONEER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize a Floridian who has made significant contributions to his \ncommunity through the field of broadcasting and communications.\n  A resident of St. Petersburg, Patrick L. McLaughlin is a broadcast \nengineer whose career began after service in the United States Navy in \nWorld War II and culminated with this retirement from the television \nindustry in 1985.\n  He, and many radio-and-television pioneers like him, literally helped \nget television off the ground, laboring behind-the-scenes to usher in \nthe dawn of modern, electronic television. For the technicians and \nengineers of those early days of TV, it often was a low-budget, low-\nglamour profession. But they pressed on and built an extraordinary \nindustry.\n  In 1954, Mr. McLaughlin helped build up West Central Florida's first \ntelevision station, WSUN-TV, Channel 38. Later, he served as chief \nengineer at WFLA-TV, Channel 8, in Tampa, now one of the country's \nlargest media markets.\n  Under his guidance, WFLA and other television stations initiated \nimportant technological changes that have been models for later \nindustry transformations. Along the way, he made sure local stations \nremained on the air during times of crisis to provide an essential \nlifeline and source of information for dispersed Tampa Bay area \ncommunities when they were hit by hurricanes and riots.\n  Nowadays, we take television so much for granted that it's easy to \nforget that innovative technicians and engineers, such as Mr. \nMcLaughlin, helped transform broadcasting stations into a source of \nentertainment and education for current and future generations, as well \nas a powerful medium that helps shape both popular culture and \ncontemporary history.\n  For this, we owe that early generation of broadcast engineering \npioneers our gratitude.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me today in recognizing one of \nthem, Patrick L. McLaughlin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S287-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S287-S288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STEVE YOUNG\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSteve Young, the National President of the Fraternal Order of Police, \nwho passed away on January 9, 2002. One of the most rewarding things \nabout serving in the government is having the opportunity to meet some \nvery special people, and Steve was one of them. Every so often in life \na person is fortunate enough to cross paths with someone who makes them \nfeel good about being in their presence, someone who is caring, \ngenuine, sincere and who brings a special life to the lives of others. \nThat was Steve Young and I feel blessed to have known him. Steve, a \nnative of Upper Sandusky, OH and graduate of upper Sandusky High \nSchool, is survived by his wife, Denise; his two sons, Steven David and \nStaten Daniel; ;his three sisters Gloria Steurer, Kay Baker, and \nDeborah Smith and his mother, Lillian Heffelfinger.\n  Serving as a member of the Fraternal Order of Police, F.O.P., for 26 \nyears, Steve dedicated his life and career to law enforcement. His \ndistinguished membership included eleven years as\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\nPresident of the Ohio State lodge, four years as National Vice \nPresident, and 17 months as National President.\n  Steve's understanding of the rigorous demands placed on law \nenforcement officers who protect our citizens each and every day made \nhim an extremely effective and well-respected leader. His innovative \nleadership style produced a list of accomplishments that set a new \nstandard for success.\n  During his career, Steve helped to create the Ohio Labor Council, \nwith more than 8,000 members, to improve the effectiveness of labor-\nmanagement negotiations within police forces. Remarkably, fourteen \nStates across our Nation are using this methodology as a model for \nimproving labor-management relations. He also implemented the Critical \nIncident Response program, to rapidly assist officers psychologically \ndamaged in the line of duty, a program that has been implemented across \nthe country.\n  It came as no surprise that Steve's numerous accomplishments led to \nhis overwhelming election as the National President of the F.O.P. in \nAugust 2001. During his tenure, Steve's enthusiasm, spirit, and love of \nlaw enforcement never diminished. In fact, he continued to dedicate his \ncareer to the citizens of Ohio serving as Lieutenant in the Marion City \nPolice Department, until his passing.\n  One would not know by looking at his achievements, but his term as \nPresident of the F.O.P. was all too brief. Under his Presidency, the \nF.O.P. developed a close relationship with the Bush Administration, \nwhich led to Steve's appointment to the Homeland Security Advisory \nCouncil. Thanks to Steve, the F.O.P. will now play an important role in \nthe transition as the various law enforcement agencies are folded into \nthe new Department of Homeland Security.\n  Under Steve's presidency and at the request of the Administration, \nthe F.O.P. was asked to serve as a Charter member of the National \nCitizens Corps Council. This group is dedicated to bringing together \nnational leaders from first responder groups, emergency management \nagencies, volunteer service organizations, State and local governments, \nand the private sector in an effort to engage citizens in homeland \nsecurity and promote community and family safety practices across the \ncountry.\n  Recognizing the importance of family and the commitment that law \nenforcement officers make each day, Steve worked with Secretary Elaine \nChao to obtain a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor so \nthat the F.O.P. could design and administer a scholarship program for \nthe spouses of fallen officers.\n  It is evident that Steve Young served our country and his community \nwith honor, courage, and distinction. However, in times of great loss, \nwords often fail to comfort the anguish loved ones feel for their \ndeparted. I can only hope that the entire Young family will find solace \nin the thoughts and prayers of loved ones, friends, and the countless \nother lives that Steve touched.\n  May God bless Steve Young and his entire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S288-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S288-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in Executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S288-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Ms. Cantwell, \n             Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Carper, Mrs. \n             Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n             Craig, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Edwards, Ms. \n             Collins, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Allen, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n             Kohl, and Ms. Stabenow):\n       S. 152.

A bill to assess the extent of the backlog in DNA analysis of \nrape kit samples, and to improve investigation and prosecution of \nsexual assault cases with DNA evidence; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise along with the distinguished Senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to introduce the DNA Sexual \nAssault Justice Act of 2003, a bill that guarantees prompt justice to \nvictims of sexual assault crimes through DNA technology. This bill is \nnot new to my colleagues. Last session, I introduced the DNA Sexual \nAssault Justice Act with Senators Specter, Cantwell, Clinton, and \nSchumer. The bill was voted favorably out of the Judiciary Committee \nwith the key support of my good friend across the aisle, Senator \nSpecter. And in September, with twenty co-sponsors, Republicans and \nDemocrats, the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act unanimously passed the \nSenate. Regrettably, our House counterparts were not able to act so \nquickly or decisively on a DNA bill, so I am back to re-introduce the \nbill and to urge quick passage of the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of \n2003. I am pleased that, once again, this bill has strong bipartisan \nsupport and I look forward to working with my good friend from Utah, \nthe distinguished Senior Senator, Senator Hatch, in acting promptly in \nmarking up this bill when he assumes chairmanship of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Promoting and supporting DNA technology as a crime-fighting tool is \nnot a new endeavor for me. A provision of my 1994 Crime Bill created \nthe Combined DNA Index System, called ``CODIS'', which is an electronic \ndatabase of DNA profiles, much like the FBI's fingerprint database. \nCODIS includes two kinds of DNA information, convicted offender DNA \nsamples and DNA from crime scenes. CODIS uses the two indexes to \ngenerate investigative leads in crimes where biological evidence is \nrecovered from the scene. In essence, CODIS facilitates the DNA match. \nAnd once that match is made a crime is solved because of the incredible \naccuracy and durability of DNA evidence.\n  99.9 percent--that is how accurate DNA evidence is. 1 in 30 billion, \nthose are the odds someone else committed a crime if a suspect's DNA \nmatches evidence at the crime scene. 20 or 30 years, that is how long \nDNA evidence from a crime scene lasts.\n  Just ten years ago DNA analysis of evidence could have cost thousands \nof dollars and taken months; now testing one sample costs $40 and can \ntake days. Ten years ago forensic scientists needed blood the size of a \nbottle cap, now DNA testing can be done on a sample the size of a \npinhead. The changes in DNA technology are remarkable, and mark a sea \nchange in how we can fight crime, particularly sexual assault crimes.\n  The FBI reports that since 1998 the national DNA database has helped \nput away violent criminals in 6,257 investigations in 40 States. How? \nBy matching the DNA crime evidence to the DNA profiles of offenders. \nIndividual success stories of DNA ``cold hits'' in sexual assault cases \nmake these numbers all too real.\n  Just last month, Alabama authorities charged a man in the rape of an \n85-year-old woman almost ten years ago after he was linked to the case \nby a DNA sample he was compelled to submit while in prison on unrelated \ncharges.\n  In Colorado Springs, CO, a trial will soon begin of a man accused of \nat least fourteen rapes and sexual assaults. Due to the national DNA \ndatabase, prosecutors were able to trace the defendant to rapes and \nassaults that occurred in Colorado, California, Arizona, Nevada and \nOklahoma between 1999 and 2002.\n  In Florida, Kellie Green was brutally attacked and raped in the \nlaundry room of her apartment complex. Because of lack of funds, her \nrape kit sat on the shelf for three years until a persistent detective \nhad it analyzed. The evidence matched the profile of a man already \nincarcerated for beating and raping a woman 6 weeks before Kellie.\n  Or take, for example, a 1996 case in St. Louis where two young girls \nwere abducted from bus stops and raped at opposite ends of the city. \nThe police were unable to identify a suspect. In 1999, the police \ndecided to re-run the DNA testing to develop new leads. In January \n2000, the DNA database matched the case to a 1999 rape case, and police \nwere able to identify the perpetrator.\n  Last spring, the New York Police Department arrested a man linked to \nthe rape of a woman years ago. In 1997, a woman was horribly beaten, \nrobbed and raped, there were no suspects. Five years later, the \nperpetrator submitted a DNA sample as a condition of probation after \nserving time for burglary. The DNA sample matched the DNA from the 1997 \nrape. Crime solved, streets safer.\n  Undoubtedly, DNA matching by comparing evidence gathered at the crime \nscene with offender samples entered on the national DNA database has \nproven to be the deciding factor in solving stranger sexual assault \ncases--it has revolutionized the criminal justice system, and brought \nclosure and justice for victims.\n  In light of the past successes and the future potential of DNA \nevidence, the reports about the backlog of untested rape kits and other \ncrime scene evidence waiting in police warehouses are simply shocking. \nIt is a national problem, plaguing both urban and rural areas, that \ndeserves national attention and solutions. One woman, in particular, \nhas reminded State and Federal lawmakers that we cannot ignore even one \nrape kit sitting on a shelf gathering dust, Debbie Smith. In 1989, Mrs. \nSmith was brutally taken from her home and raped. There were no known \nsuspects and Mrs. Smith lived in fear of her attacker's return. Six \nyears later, the Virginia crime laboratory discovered a DNA match \nbetween the rape scene evidence and a State prisoner's DNA sample. Mrs. \nSmith had her first moment of real security and closure and since then, \nshe has traveled the country to advocate on behalf of assault victims \nand champion the use of DNA to fight sexual assault. I am pleased that \nthe DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2003 bears a provision entitled, \n``The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grants.''\n  Today I am introducing legislation, ``The DNA Sexual Assault Justice \nAct of 2003'', to strengthen the existing Federal DNA regime as an \neffective crimefighting tool. My bill addresses five pressing issues.\n  First, exactly how bad is the backlog of untested rape kits \nnationwide? A\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\n1999 government report found over 180,000 rape kits were sitting, \nuntested, on the storage shelves of police department and crime \nlaboratories all across the country.\n  While recent press reports estimate that the number today is \napproaching 500,000 untested rape kits, I am told that there are no \ncurrent, accurate numbers of the backlog. Behind every single one of \nthose rape kits is a victim who deserves recognition and justice. \nAccordingly, my legislation would require the Attorney General to \nsurvey law enforcement agencies nationwide to assess the extent of the \nbacklog of rape kits waiting to undergo DNA testing. To combat the \nproblem of rape kit backlogs, it is imperative to know the real \nnumbers, and how best to utilize Federal resources.\n  Second, how can existing Federal law be strengthened to make sure \nthat State crime labs have the funds for the critical DNA analysis \nneeded to solve sex assault cases? To fight crime most effectively, we \nmust both test rape kits and enter convicted offender DNA samples into \nthe DNA database. There has been explosive growth in the use of \nforensic sciences by law enforcement. A government survey found that in \n2000 alone, crime labs received 31,000 cases--a 47 percent increase \nfrom almost 21,000 cases in 1999. In addition, the labs received \n177,000 convicted offender DNA samples, an almost 77 percent increase \nfrom 100,242 samples in 1999.\n  The backlog in DNA testing is found all across the country. Last \nmonth a Michigan newspaper reported that its State police forensic unit \nis expected to have a 10-year backlog of items in need of DNA testing. \nSimilar news reports are elsewhere. The Florida crime lab system is \nfacing a backlog of more than 2,400 rape, murder and assault and \nburglary cases with DNA evidence waiting for testing. In North \nCarolina, up to 20,000 rape kit tests sit on evidence shelves because \nthe lab does not have the resources to conduct timely DNA testing.\n  Many crime laboratories report personnel shortages in the face of \nthis overwhelming work. According to a government survey, on average, \nthere are 6 employees in a State crime lab, a lab that must not only \nconduct DNA testing for hundreds of cases, but also run forensic tests \non blood, footprints or ballistic evidence.\n  The bill I'm introducing would: 1. Increase current funding levels to \nboth test rape kits and to process and upload offender samples; and 2. \nallow local governments to apply directly to the Justice Department for \nthese grants. I thank my colleagues Senators Kohl and DeWine who began \nthis effort with the DNA Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 and \nacknowledge their ongoing interest in this area.\n  Third, what assistance does the FBI need to keep up with the crushing \nnumber of DNA samples which need to be tested or stored in the national \ndatabase? I am told that the current national DNA database, ``CODIS'', \nis nearing capacity of convicted offender DNA samples. My bill would \nprovide funds to the FBI to 1. Upgrade the national DNA computer \ndatabase to handle the huge projections of samples; and 2. process and \nupload Federal convicted offender DNA samples into the database.\n\n  Efforts to include more Federal and State convicted offenders in our \ndatabase just makes plain sense to fight crime. We know that sexual \nassault is a crime with one of the highest rates of recidivism, and \nthat many sexual assault crimes are committed by those with past \nconvictions for other kinds of crime. Their DNA samples from prior \nconvictions help law enforcement efforts enormously. We cannot wait; \nthe 2001 FBI crime records show that one forcible rape occurs every 5.8 \nminutes, and the most recent reports from the first six months of 2002 \nindicate a 1.8 percent increase in the number of rapes as compared to \n2001 statistics.\n  Fourth, what additional tools are needed to help treat victims of \nsexual assault? One group that understands the importance of gathering \ncredible DNA evidence are forensic sexual assault examiners, who are \nsensitive to the trauma of this horrible crime and make sure that \npatients are not revictimized in the aftermath. These programs should \nbe in each and every emergency room and play an integral role in police \ndepartments to bridge the gap between the law and the medicine.\n  I first recognized the importance of sexual assault nurse examiners \nin solving rape cases when I authored the Violence Against Women Act. A \nkey provision in the Violence Against Women Act requires the Attorney \nGeneral to evaluate and recommend standards for training and practice \nfor licensed health care professionals performing sexual assault \nforensic exams. So I knew that any DNA bill aimed at ending sexual \nassault must include resources for sexual forensic examiners, and not \njust one type. My bill ensures that sexual forensic nurses, doctors, \nand response teams are all eligible for assistance.\n  Tapping the power of DNA requires well-trained law enforcement who \nknow how to collect and preserve DNA evidence from the crime scene. \nTraining should be a matter of course for all law enforcement. No rape \nkit evidence will lead to the perpetrator if the DNA evidence is \ncollected improperly.\n  The DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act would create a new grant program \nto carry out sexual assault examiner programs and training. And it \nwould train law enforcement personnel and prosecutors in the handling \nof sexual assault cases, including drug-facilitated assaults, and the \ncollection and use of DNA samples for use as forensic evidence at \ntrial.\n  Fifth, what can be done to ensure that sexual assault offenders who \ncannot be identified by their victim are nevertheless brought to \njustice?\n  Profound injustice is done to rape victims when delayed DNA testing \nleads to a ``cold hit'' after the statute of limitations has expired. \nFor example, Jeri Elster was brutally raped in her California home, and \nfor years the police were unable to solve the crime. Seven years later, \nDNA from the rape matched a man in jail for an unrelated crime. Yet the \nrapist was never charged, convicted or sentenced because California's \nstatute of limitations had expired the previous year.\n  The DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2003 would change current law \nto authorize Federal ``John Doe/DNA indictments'' that will permit \nFederal prosecutors to issue an indictment identifying an unknown \ndefendant by his DNA profile within the five year statute of \nlimitations. Once outstanding, the DNA indictment would permit \nprosecution at anytime once there was a DNA ``cold hit'' through the \nnational DNA database system.\n  John Doe/DNA indictments strike the right balance between encouraging \nswift and efficient investigations, recognizing the durability and \ncredibility of DNA evidence and preventing an injustice if a cold hit \nhappens years after the crime. Criminal law must catch up with DNA \ntechnology without the wholesale eradication of prevailing statutes of \nlimitations.\n  I started looking at the issue of improved prosecution of sexual \nassault crimes almost two decades ago when I began drafting the \nViolence Against Women Act. The DNA Sexual Justice Act of 2003 is the \nnext step, a way to connect the dots between the extraordinary strides \nin DNA technology and my commitment to ending violence against women. \nWe must ensure that justice delayed is not justice denied.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 152\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``DNA Sexual Assault Justice \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this important \nlegislation to address the shameful backlog of unanalyzed DNA evidence \nin rape kits. Senator Biden, Senator Spector and I worked closely on \nthis issue last year and this bill is an excellent compromise that \ncombines aspects of bills introduced by myself and by Senator Biden. \nThis bill provides critical resources to State and Federal Governments \nto ensure that all the DNA evidence sitting in storage rooms across the \ncountry can be tested and perpetrators found and convicted. As more and \nmore states have moved to require DNA samples from all convicted \nfelons, the Federal resources that this bill provides to aid in the \nbuilding of convicted offender records has also become more critical. \nThe bill unanimously passed both the Judiciary Committee and the full \nSenate last year. It once again has strong bipartisan support, and I \nanticipate that we will work quickly to pass the bill in this new \nCongress, so that the bill can also pass the House of Representatives \nand become law. This bill reauthorizes a 2000 bill and time is of the \nessence as those authorizations expire soon. The power of DNA to find \nand convict rapists in cases where there have never even been an \nidentified suspect cannot be overstated. We must act now to help law \nenforcement and prosecutors across the country be able to make full use \nof the most valuable tool at their disposal.\n  One of the things that I am most pleased about is that the grant \nprogram in this bill to fund DNA testing of existing rape kits \nthroughout the country will bear the name of Debbie Smith. In her \ntestimony before the Crime Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee last \nJune, she proved herself an extraordinary spokesperson on the power of \nDNA evidence to bring not just justice but peace to victims of sexual \nassault.\n  The heart of this bill is about getting DNA evidence from rape cases \nthat is currently sitting in police evidence rooms tested and checked \nagainst the DNA profiles of convicted felons. We all know that DNA is a \ntool that works and as more states begin building their felon data \nbases, more and more cases of rape where police have no suspect are \nbeing solved.\n  We owe every woman in this country who has had the courage to come \nforward and undergo an invasive physical exam and evidence gathering \nafter the trauma of a sexual assault, at a minimum, the absolute \nguarantee that the collected evidence is being checked against known \nfelons. That is what this bill does.\n  In my state of Washington alone, in the past five years at least \n12,950 women have submitted to humiliating and traumatic exams for the \ncollection\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\nof evidence that has not been analyzed to help solve their rape. When \napplied on a national scale, these findings would indicate a national \nbacklog of 615,000 cases of untested evidence. Washington State \nUniversity is currently in the process of conducting a national \nassessment of the backlog of rape kits and I look forward to learning \nthose results but we simply must provide the resources to get this \nevidence analyzed now.\n  We need to pass this bill and fund this bill to help police solve \nmore rapes and give women receive the peace of mind of knowing that \neverything that can be done to catch their attacker is being done.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 152, the DNA \nSexual Justice Act of 2003. Building on the success of the Kohl-DeWine \nDNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act enacted during the 106th Congress, \nthis legislation will provide law enforcement and prosecutors with \ncritical physical evidence that will help put more criminals behind \nbars. Currently, DNA evidence is languishing untested at laboratories \nnationwide, simply for lack of funding. The DNA Sexual Justice Act will \nassess the extent of the backlog and provide funding for its \nelimination. Further, this legislation will ensure that DNA evidence \nfrom cases involving sexual assault is handled properly by providing \ntraining for emergency personnel, medical examiners, law enforcement, \nforensic analysts and prosecutors.\n  Currently, all 50 States and the Federal Government require DNA \nsamples to be obtained from certain convicted offenders, and these \nsamples increasingly can be shared through a national DNA database \nestablished by Federal law. This national database, part of the \nCombined Database Index System, CODIS, enables law enforcement \nofficials to link DNA evidence found at a crime scene with any suspect \nwhose DNA is already on file. By identifying repeat offenders, this DNA \nsharing can and does make a difference.\n  Before passage of the Kohl-DeWine Backlog Elimination Act in 2000, \nlaw enforcement was in large part unable to take advantage of DNA \nanalysis as a crime-fighting technology. This was primarily due to the \nfact that DNA sample collection was not required of all Federal \noffenders, forensic labs did not have enough resources or equipment to \nanalyze collected samples, and State databases were not interoperable \nwith Federal databases. This bill will further address these issues by \ndirecting the Attorney General to survey forensic laboratories across \nthe country to determine the scope of the backlog and authorizes the \nfunding necessary to eliminate the backlog over the next four years.\n  However this legislation goes even further, focusing new, targeted \ngrant programs toward DNA evidence collected from crimes of sexual \nassault or violence. By authorizing funding for the training of \nemergency personnel and medical examiners, this legislation ensures \nthat DNA evidence will be properly collected. With funding for forensic \nequipment and the training of forensic examiners, it ensures that DNA \nevidence will be accurately analyzed. And by providing funding for the \ntraining of prosecutors, this legislation ensures that the evidence \nwill be used to its greatest possible effect in the courtroom.\n  This measure will ensure that women who have been victims of sexual \nassault or violence will have the most reliable tools to bring their \nassailants to justice. Most importantly, this legislation will help \npolice use modern technology to solve crimes and prevent repeat \noffenders from committing new ones.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Sessions, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 153. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to establish \npenalties for aggravated identity theft, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce the Identity \nTheft Penalty Enhancement Act along with Senator Kyl, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Sessions, and Senator Craig.\n  I first introduced this bipartisan legislation last June with the \nfull support of the Justice Department. The bill will make it easier \nfor prosecutors to target those identity thieves who, as is so often \nthe case, steal an identity for the purpose of committing one or more \nother crimes.\n  I am hopeful that we can build on the momentum generated by this \nlegislation in the 107th Congress. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nTechnology, Terrorism, and Government Information conducted a hearing \non the bill on July 9, 2002.\n  The Judiciary Committee subsequently passed the legislation out of \nCommittee on November 14, shortly before the Senate went out of \nsession.\n  As we enter the 108th congress, there remains a compelling need to \nstiffen the penalties for identity thieves.\n  A little more than a month ago, the largest single identity theft \ncase in U.S. history was uncovered. Federal authorities arrested Philip \nCummings who, along with two accomplices, allegedly sold the credit \nreports and other personal information of 30,000 victims for as little \nas $30 each. Investigators have confirmed $2.7 million in losses so \nfar, and the totals are expected to be much greater. This case is an \nexample of the tremendous damage that an identity thief can cause.\n  Moreover, many serious crimes, even including terrorism, are aided by \nstolen identifies.\n  Lofti Raissi, a 27-year old Algerian pilot from London who is \nbelieved to have trained four of the 9/11 hijackers, was identified in \nBritish court papers as having used the Social Security number of \nDorothy Hansen, a retired factory worker from Jersey City, NJ, who died \nin 1991.\n  Last year, the Department of Justice filed charges against an \nAlgerian national who stole the identifies of 21 members of a health \nclub in Cambridge, MA. He then transferred those stolen identities to \none of the individuals convicted in the failed plot to bomb Los Angeles \nInternational Airport in 1999.\n  Joseph Kalady of Chicago was charged with trying to fake his own \ndeath using the identity of another. Kalady, who was awaiting trial on \ncharges of counterfeiting birth certificates, Social Security cards and \ndriver's licenses, allegedly suffocated a homeless man and sought to \nhave him cremated under Mr. Kalady's identity in order to fake his own \ndeath and avoid prosecution.\n  The stories go on and on, and it is those stories that make the \nlegislation we introduce today so vital. Identity theft has become the \nmajor escalating crime of the new millennium, and Congress needs to \ngive law enforcement the tools to prosecute these crimes.\n  Let me just outline what this bill would do.\n  First, the bill would create a separate crime of ``aggravated \nidentity theft'' for any person who uses the identity of another person \nto commit certain serious, Federal crimes.\n  Specifically, the legislation would provide for an additional two-\nyear penalty for any individual convicted of committing one of the \nfollowing serious Federal crimes while using the identity of another \nperson: Stealing another's identity in order to illegally obtain \ncitizenship in the United States; stealing another's identity to obtain \na passport or visa; using another's identity to remain in the United \nStates illegally after a visa has expired or an individual has been \nordered to depart this country; stealing an individual's identity to \ncommit bank, wire or mail fraud, or to steal from employee pension \nfunds; and other serious Federal crimes, all of them felonies.\n  Furthermore, the legislation would provide for an additional five-\nyear penalty for any individual who uses the stolen identity of another \nperson to commit any one of the enumerated Federal terrorism crimes \nfound in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B). These crimes include: The \ndestruction of aircraft; the assassination or kidnapping of high level \nFederal officials; bombings; hostage taking; providing material support \nto terrorism organizations; and other terrorist crimes.\n  Under the legislation, aggravated identity theft is a separate crime, \nnot just a sentencing enhancement. And the two-year and five-year \npenalties for aggravated identity theft must be served consecutively to \nthe sentence for the underlying crime.\n  This bill also strengthens the ability of law enforcement to go after \nidentity thieves and to provide their case.\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\n  First, the bill adds the word ``possesses'' to current law, in order \nto allow law enforcement to target individuals who possess the identity \ndocuments of another person with the intent to commit a crime. Current \nFederal law prohibits the transfer or use of false identity documents, \nbut does not specifically ban the possession of those documents with \nthe intent to commit a crime.\n  So if law enforcement discovers a stash of identity documents with \nthe clear intent to use those documents to commit other crimes, the \nperson who possesses those documents will now be subject to \nprosecution.\n  Second, the legislation amends current law to make it clear that if a \nperson uses a false identity ``in connection with'' another Federal \ncrime, and the intent of the underlying Federal crime is proven, then \nthe intent to use the false identity to commitment that crime need not \nbe separately proved.\n  This simply makes the job of the prosecutor easier when an individual \nis convicted of a Federal crime and uses a false identity in collection \nwith that crime.\n  This legislation also increases the maximum penalty for identity \ntheft under current law from three years to five years.\n  And finally, the legislation we introduce today will clarify that the \ncurrent 25-year maximum sentence for identity theft in facilitation of \ninternational terrorism also applies to identity theft in facilitation \nof domestic terrorism as well.\n  Identity theft is a crime on the rise in America, and it is a crime \nwith severe consequences not only for the individual victims of the \nidentity theft, but for every consumer and every financial institution \nas well.\n  Identity theft comes in many forms and can be perpetrated in many \nways, and that is why I have worked for many years now with Senator Kyl \nand others to put some safeguards into the law that might better \nprevent the fraud from occurring in the first place, and to crack down \non identity thieves.\n  And other legislation I have introduced would put into place certain \nprocedural safeguards to protect credit card numbers, personal \ninformation, and other key data from potential identity thieves.\n  The legislation we introduce today is meant to beef up the law in \nterms of what happens after an identity theft takes place. In seriously \nenhancing the penalties for identity thieves who commit other Federal \ncrimes, we mean to send a strong signal to all those who would commit \nthis increasingly popular crime that the relatively free ride they have \nexperienced in recent years is over.\n  No longer will prosecutors decline to take identity theft seriously. \nNo longer will identity thieves get off with just a slap on the wrist, \nif they are prosecuted at all. Under this legislation, penalties will \nbe severe, prosecution will be more likely, and cases against identity \nthieves will be easier to prove.\n  Every day in this country serious criminals and criminal \norganizations are stealing and falsifying identities with the purpose \nof doing serious harm to common citizens, government officials, or even \nour Nation itself. It is time we did something about it, and this bill \nis an important step in that process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to reauthorize \nthe Price-Anderson provisions; to the Committee on Environmental and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today, as the Chairman of the \nClean Air, Climate Change, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, to \nintroduce a bill to reauthorize the Price-Anderson Act. While the Act \nwas first passed in 1957 and has been renewed three times, the current \nauthorization expired on August 1, 2002 for Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission licensees. The growth of nuclear power depends greatly on \nthe reauthorization of this Act, which provides liability for damages \nto the general public from nuclear incidents.\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\n  It is important for the American public to understand how the Price-\nAnderson liability program works. The nuclear industry actually funds \nthe program; it is not a Federal subsidy. Each nuclear power plant \npurchases liability insurance from private insurers to cover the first \n$200 million for immediate response in the case of an accident. If the \ndamages amounted to more than this amount, a second level of financial \nprotection would apply. In these cases, each of the U.S. licensed \nnuclear units would pay up to $10 million annually into a collective \nfund to cover the damages, with a maximum payment of $88.1 million per \naccident. This, together with the $200 million in insurance money, \nprovides a total of about $9.3 billion in insurance coverage to \ncompensate the public in the case of a nuclear accident. If more than \nthis amount is needed, Congress could then go back to the industry and \ndemand a larger contribution.\n  This is an incredible system. I am not aware of any facility in the \ncountry or world that is insured for up to $9.3 billion. Neither do I \nknow of any other industry in which all of the competitors agree up \nfront to pay for the mistakes or acts of God that affect any one \ncompany. Furthermore, instead of fighting claims in court, the industry \nwaives its traditional tort defense so that the fund begins making \npayments immediately. This means that if there were a nuclear disaster \nsomewhere, the insurance companies would immediately start paying out \nclaims. In fact, after the Three Mile Island incident, claims offices \nwere on the site within 24 hours. This program provides extensive \ninsurance coverage and provides it up front.\n  The expiration of this program affects only new NRC licenses, not \nexisting licensees. Without the program, a new nuclear facility would \nbe unable to obtain the liability insurance that this program provides, \nmaking new licenses very improbable, if not impossible.\n  Nuclear energy is important to our Nation's national security, \neconomy, and environment. America's nuclear energy industry currently \nprovides approximately 20 percent of our energy. It is a safe, \nreliable, and zero-emission source of energy. This has had a tremendous \npositive effect on the environment and public health. Since 1973, \nnuclear energy has prevented 62 million tons of sulfur dioxide, a key \ncomponent of acid rain, and 32 million tons of nitrogen oxide, a \nprecursor to ozone, from being released into the atmosphere. Arguably, \nnuclear power has contributed more to achieving a reduction in \nemissions than any other source of energy, except possibly solar, wind, \nand hydropower.\n  Our Nation needs to do whatever it can to promote a safe and \nefficient nuclear energy industry and encourage the development of new \nnuclear reactors. Reauthorizing the Price-Anderson Act is a major step \nin that direction.\n  During the previous administration, both the Department of Energy and \nthe NRC issued reports to Congress recommending the reauthorization of \nPrice-Anderson. Last Congress, I introduced legislation to reauthorize \nPrice-Anderson, S. 1360, and included these provisions in an amendment \nthat I proposed to the energy bill. My amendment, S. Amdt. 2983, was \nagreed to by a vote of 78-21 on March 7, 2002. This amendment \nreauthorized the program for both DOE contractors and NRC licensees. \nThe amendment falls under the shared jurisdiction of both the Energy \nCommittee for contractors and the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for NRC licensees. I look forward to working with the EPW \nCommittee to pass this bill to reauthorize the Price-Anderson Act for \n10 years for NRC licensees.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe for joining me in cosponsoring this bill. The \nPrice-Anderson Act is so vital to the future expansion of our nuclear \nenergy industry. I urge the speedy consideration and passage of this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to help protect the public against the threat of \nchemical attacks; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce an important \npiece of legislation that I worked on in the 107th Congress, the \nChemical Security Act. I am proud to be joined by Senators Jeffords, \nBoxer, Clinton, and Lautenberg in reintroducing this bill. Senators \nJeffords, Boxer, and Clinton were all strong allies in the 107th \nCongress, and I thank them for their continuing support. And I am \npleased to have Senator Lautenberg as a cosponsor. He has a long \nhistory of working to protect communities from all types of chemical \nthreats. I particularly want to thank Senator Jeffords for his hard \nwork on this legislation in the 107th Congress. As Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works committee, he provided critical leadership \nin bringing this bill through the committee successfully. I thank him \nand his staff for their hard work and look forward to continuing to \nwork with them on this important issue.\n  I'll describe what the bill does in a minute. But first I want to \nbriefly explain why I think this legislation is so important.\n  September 11 shocked us into the realization that our assets can be \nturned against us by terrorists. If you are a New Jersey Senator, you \ndon't have to think about that idea for too long before you realize \nthat chemical plants and other facilities that have hazardous chemicals \nwould be high on a terrorists' list. The fact is, that we have a lot of \nthose types of facilities in my State, and because we're such a densely \npopulated State, chemical releases from these facilities pose grave \nrisks. In fact, according to EPA data, there are eight plants in my \nState where a worst-case release of toxic chemicals could threaten more \nthan a million people.\n  But this is not a parochial issue. The same EPA data shows that there \nare 110 plants nationwide where such a release could threaten more than \na million people. These plants are located in 22 States. And there are \n44 States that have at least one facility where such a release could \nthreaten more than 100,000 people.\n  I want to be clear that I am stating these facts here today in an \neffort to advance a measure that would protect workers and communities, \nnot in an attempt to vilify our nations' chemical companies. Indeed, \nthese companies are a key part of our industrial fabric, providing jobs \nand producing products essential to our lives. This is certainly true \nof my home State of New Jersey, as I have already indicated.\n  But when you look at the numbers, as I have laid them out here today, \nyou realize that we have a problem to deal with. I'm certainly not \nunique in recognizing this issue, EPA, the Justice Department, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commissions, industry groups, and public safety \ngroups all agree. In addition, the White House Strategy for Homeland \nSecurity recognizes the chemical and hazardous materials sector as an \ninfrastructure protection priority. Governor Ridge amplified this point \nin his testimony before the Senate Environment Public Works committee \non July 10 of last year. He said that:\n\n       The fact is, we have a very diversified economy and our \n     enemies look at some of our economic assets as targets. And \n     clearly, the chemical facilities are one of them. We know \n     that there have been reports validated about security \n     deficiencies at dozens and dozens of those.\n\n  I want to pick up on that last point that Governor Ridge made about \nsecurity deficiencies, because it speaks to why I am putting this bill \nforward.\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n  Some companies have taken actions and are continuing to work to \nimplement security measures in light of the post-September 11 \nenvironments. Others, however, are not. That's one crucial reason why a \nFederal program is needed. We need to be able to assure our \nconstituents that this major vulnerability is being addressed in a \nswift and effective manner. We also want to assure them that certain \nminimum standards are being met throughout the country.\n  We already do that to address certain infrastructure vulnerabilities. \nMost notably, we require nuclear power plants to meet extensive \nsecurity standards as a condition of their operating licenses. I think \nwe ought to tighten those standards, but the fact is that we have no \nstandards at all for our chemical facilities.\n  Before I go into specifics, I want to outline the general \norganizational scheme of the bill. In my view, addressing the risk to \ncommunities from a terrorist-caused release of hazardous chemicals \nrequires two fundamental components. The first is improving security, \nso that the likelihood of a successful terrorist attack is lowered. The \nsecond is reducing hazards so that the impact of a successful attack is \nminimized.\n  This requires two fundamentally different types of expertise and \nskills. That's why the bill involves both the EPA and the Department of \nHomeland Security. EPA has the chemical hazard expertise, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has the security expertise. EPA has a \nlead role in most of the bill, because it already has relationships \nwith chemical facilities through its existing accident prevention \nprograms.\n  As to the specifics of the bill, I think it is a common-sense \napproach to dealing with the issue. I want to note that this bill is \nnearly identical to the version of the bill that was reported out of \nthe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last July by a 19-0 \nvote. Two minor technical changes have been made to clarify the intent \nof the legislation, but it is otherwise exactly the same as the \ncommittee-reported bill that was acted on unanimously by the EPW \ncommittee last year.\n  The heart of the bill is section 4. This section requires EPA and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to identify ``high priority'' chemical \nfacilities and then require those facilities to assess vulnerabilities \nand hazards, and then develop and implement a plan to improve security \nand use safer technologies.\n  Section 4(a)(1) establishes the priority setting process, by which \nthe EPA Administrator, in consultation the Secretary of the Department \nof Homeland Security, as well as States and local government entities, \nis directed to identify high priority chemical facilities, based on \nfactors identified in section 4(a)(2). These factors include the \nseverity of harm that could be caused by a chemical release, proximity \nto population centers, threats to national security or critical \ninfrastructure, threshold quantities of substances of concern that pose \na serious threat, and such other safety or security factors that the \nAdministrator considers appropriate.\n\n  Because of the way the bill is structured, this means that EPA and \nthe Department of Homeland Security are directed to start with the \nfacilities that are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program \nrequirements. This program applies to approximately 15,000 facilities \nin the United States that use, produce or store large quantities of \nhazardous chemicals. By applying the factors I mentioned, the priority \nsetting process is meant to shorten this list of 15,000 facilities \nconsiderably. But the bill leaves it up to the Administration to \ndetermine exactly how many facilities within this universe ought to be \ncovered by the bill.\n  So that's step one, setting priorities, and that has to be done \nwithin one year of enactment.\n  At this point, I want to mention the first of the clarifying \ntechnical changes that I have made to the bill. It was never the \nintent, nor I believe the effect, of the bill to include propane \nretailers as potentially regulated entities under this bill. But there \nwas some confusion about the point after the bill was marked up last \nJuly. So last fall, I worked with the National Propane Gas Association \non language that eliminates this confusion, and it is included in this \nbill. So I again want to make clear that the same propane retailers who \nare not subject to the EPA Risk Management Program requirements will \nnot be ``high priority'' facilities under this bill, and therefore will \nnot be subject to its requirements.\n  In addition to identifying high priority facilities within the first \nyear, EPA and the Department of Homeland Security must also promulgate \nregulations to require the high priority facilities to take the \nfollowing steps: conduct a vulnerability and hazard assessment within \none year after the regulations are promulgated; prepare and implement a \nresponse plan that addresses those vulnerabilities within 18 months \nafter the regulations are promulgated.\n  I want to say more about the assessments and response plans, because \nthese requirements are really the core of the amendment.\n  First, the amendment requires chemical facilities to work with local \nlaw enforcement and first responders, such as firefighters, in \ndeveloping the assessments and plans. The second of the clarifying \ntechnical changes that I referred to in the opening part of my \nstatement is simply to make clear the firefighters are among the first \nresponders that the bill is referring to.\n  September 11 showed us how brave and important these our first \nresponders are. Every day, they are willing to risk their lives to \nrespond to terrorist attacks if they need to. So it makes sense that \nthey ought to be a part of the process of developing vulnerability \nassessments and response plans, as this bill would require.\n  The same goes for employees of the high priority chemical facilities. \nThey're on the front lines, which means two things. First, they are \nmost at risk in case of a terrorist attack on their plants. Second, \nbecause they work in the plants every day, they will have ideas about \nhow to secure the facilities and reduce hazards. So employees are part \nof the process as well.\n  As to the assessments and plans themselves, the requirements in the \nbill are fairly general. There are a variety of vulnerability \nassessment tools that have already been developed by groups such as \nSandia laboratories and the Center for Chemical Process Safety. I would \nexpect that EPA and DHS would take advantage of existing methodologies \nsuch as these, but the bill leaves it up to the experts to decide what \ntypes of approaches make the most sense. And that probably won't be the \nsame for everyone, I'm not advocating a one-size-fits-all approach \nhere. But I do want to be sure that all of the high priority chemical \nfacilities do a credible vulnerability assessment.\n  The response plan requirements are also fairly general. Each facility \nis required to prepare prevention, preparedness and response plan that \nincorporates the results of the assessments. The plan must include \nactions and procedures, including safer design and maintenance, to \neliminate or significantly lessen the potential consequences of a \nrelease.\n  What this means in simple terms is that each facility has to develop \na plan and take steps to reduce both the likelihood of a successful \nattack and to the harm that would occur if an attack were successful. \nIn other words, they have to look at traditional security measures, \nsuch as fences, alarms, and guards. But they also have to look at \nwhether they can make the plant safer. In other words, can less \nhazardous chemicals be used? Can containment technology such as fans or \nscrubbers be improved or employed to contain chemicals that may be \nreleased? Chemical facilities ought to evaluate the full range of \noptions, look at the tradeoffs among them, and go forward with the best \nmix of security and technology options.\n  Facilities are then required to send their assessments and plans to \nthe EPA. EPA and DHS must review those assessments and plans, and \ncertify compliance with the regulations. Any deficiencies identified by \nEPA and DHS can be remedies by issuance of an order. But the order can \nonly be issued after a deliberate process that includes notification, \ncompliance assistance, and an opportunity for a hearing.\n  The certification process is there to ensure the public that \nfacilities are complying the law. Those certifications will be the only \ninformation\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\nfrom the assessments and plans that is publicly available. The bill \nexempts all other information produced under the bill, most \nimportantly, the assessments and plans themselves, from disclosure \nunder the Freedom of Information Act. I don't take FOIA exemptions \nlightly. I believe strongly that, in general, the public has a right to \ninformation collected by the government. But I think it's pretty \nobvious that in the case of the information that would be submitted to \nthe government under this bill, the vulnerability assessments and \nresponse plans, we simply can't allow the security details in these \nplans to be publicly available. But I think it does make sense that \npeople who live near a chemical plant be able to find out from EPA and \nthe DHS whether or not that plant has complied with the law.\n\n  The bill goes even beyond FOIA exemptions to protect the assessments \nand plans. To ensure that the assessments and plans are properly \nsafeguarded, the bill includes a requirement for EPA and Homeland \nSecurity to develop protocols to prevent unauthorized disclosure of \nthose documents. And it attaches penalties to unauthorized disclosure.\n  That's the essence of the bill.\n  First, identify ``high priority'' chemical facilities.\n  Second, require those facilities to assess vulnerabilities and \nhazards, and then develop and implement a plan to improve security and \nimplement safer technologies.\n  Third, EPA and the Department of Homeland Security review the \nassessments and plans, and they have the authority to require changes \nif deficiencies are identified.\n  Fourth, assessments and plans are protected from unauthorized \ndisclosure through a FOIA exemption and penalties that apply to \nunauthorized disclosure.\n  The bill also includes an early compliance section that is designed \nto address concerns that the bill might slow ongoing voluntary security \nefforts. This provision enables companies to submit assessments and \nplans prior to promulgation of the regulations and have them judged by \nthe standards in the Act. So companies don't have to wait for the \nregulations to come out to continue work or to submit plans.\n  In conclusion, I think this is a balanced bill that puts common-sense \nrequirements in place to deal with a significant problem. I think the \nbill has moved a long way from the introduced bill. It has accommodated \nmany of the concerns that industry raised about the bill I introduced \nin the 107th Congress. It reflects intensive bipartisan negotiations, \nand I think it's a good bill.\n  At the same time, I recognize that some of my colleagues have \ncontinuing concerns about the legislation. Last fall, I worked with \nSenators Inhofe, Breaux, Landrieu and Lincoln on these issues. I want \nthem to know that I remain open-minded and committed to working with \nthem, the rest of my colleagues and the Administration to resolve these \nissues so we can move quickly to protect Americans from the threat of \nattack on chemical facilities. And I want to extend the same commitment \nnot only to the environmental and labor organizations that have \nsupported the bill in the past, but also to the various industry groups \nthat have worked on this bill. It's vital that we all find common \nground quickly, and I stand ready to work with all interested parties.\n  I want to close by expressing both my sense of urgency about this \nissue and my optimism that we will be able to move legislation quickly. \nLast fall, Governor Ridge and Administrator Whitman wrote to the \nWashington Post expressing their support for bipartisan legislation to \ndeal with the chemical security threat. I ask unanimous consent that \nthat letter be printed in the Record.\n  I believe the letter was sincere, but the Administration has not yet \nengaged the Congress on this issue. I urge President Bush to provide \nleadership to ensure that his Administration works with us as the \nprocess moves forward.\n  I am also encouraged that Senator Inhofe has identified chemical \nsecurity as a legislative priority as he assumes the Chairmanship of \nthe Environment and Public Works committee. I congratulate him on his \nnew post, and again express my willingness to work with him on this \nimportant issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 6, 2002]\n\n                         A Security Requirement\n\n       The Bush administration is committed to reducing the \n     vulnerability of America's chemical facilities to terrorist \n     attack and is working to enact bipartisan legislation that \n     would require such facilities to address their \n     vulnerabilities [news story, Oct. 3].\n       We applaud voluntary efforts some in the industry have \n     undertaken, but we believe that every one of the 15,000 \n     chemical facilities nationwide that contain large quantities \n     of hazardous chemicals must be required to take the steps the \n     industry leaders are taking at their facilities; performing \n     comprehensive vulnerability assessments and then acting to \n     reduce those vulnerabilities.\n       Voluntary efforts alone are not sufficient to provide the \n     level of assurance Americans deserve. We will continue to \n     work with Congress to advance this important homeland \n     security goal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 158. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe depreciation benefits available to small business, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Expensing Improvement Act of 2003 on behalf of the Nation's \nmillions of small businesses and self-employed individuals. I am \npleased to be joining with my colleague in the House, Congressman Wally \nHerger, to move this important initiative for small business toward \nenactment.\n  This legislation embodies a leading provision of the President's \neconomic recovery package for small businesses and entrepreneurs in \nthis country. By enabling small firms to expense more of the equipment \nthey purchase, this bill provides a tailor-made incentive for the small \nbusiness sector of our economy to invest in new technology and expand \ntheir operations.\n  We should never under-state the role that small businesses play in \nour economy. They represent 99 percent of all employers, employ 51 \npercent of the private-sector workforce, provide about 75 percent of \nthe net new jobs, contribute 51 percent of the private-sector output, \nand represent 96 percent of all exporters of goods. In short, size\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nis the only ``small'' aspect of small business.\n  The bill I introduce today recognizes the vitality of the small \nbusiness and entrepreneurs in America. Regrettably, when we enacted \nstimulus legislation last year, we missed a tremendous opportunity to \nimprove a provision of the tax law aimed directly at small firms, \nSection 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, which enables small \nbusinesses to write off the cost of new equipment, rather than \ndepreciate it over a period of years. During the Senate's consideration \nof last year's stimulus bill, we approved an increase to the expensing \nlimits by a vote of 90-2. Sadly, that provision was dropped from the \nfinal package that was sent to the President.\n  As the incoming Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I intend to correct that error by responding to the \ncalls from small businesses in my State of Maine and from across the \ncountry for greater expensing of new equipment. I applaud the President \nfor making this issue a key part of his economic recovery proposal.\n  By tripling the current expensing limit to $75,000, broadening the \nphaseout of this provision, and indexing these amounts for inflation, \nthis bill will achieve two important objectives. First, qualifying \nbusinesses will be able to write off more of the equipment purchases \ntoday, instead of waiting five, seven or more years to recover their \ncosts through depreciation.\n  That represents substantial savings both in dollars and in the time \nsmall businesses would otherwise have to spend complying with the \ncomplex depreciation rules. Moreover, new equipment will contribute to \ncontinued productivity growth in the business community, which Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly stressed is essential to \nthe long-term vitality of our economy.\n  Second, as a result of this bill, more businesses will qualify for \nthis benefit because the phase-out limit will be increased from the \ncurrent $200,000 to $325,000 in new equipment purchases. At the same \ntime, small business capital investment will be pumping more money into \nthe retail-sector of the economy. Accordingly, this is a win-win for \nsmall business and the economy as a whole.\n  I am confident that small businesses will lead us out of the current \neconomic problems as they have in past downturns. We have a tremendous \nopportunity to help small enterprises succeed by providing an incentive \nfor reinvestment and leaving them more of their earnings to do just \nthat. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation as we work with the President to enact this bill into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my statement, the text of the \nbill and an explanation of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Expensing \n     Improvement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MODIFICATIONS TO EXPENSING UNDER SECTION 179.\n\n       (a) Increase of Amount Which May Be Expensed.--\n       (1) In general.--Paragraph (1) of section 179(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to dollar limitation) \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Dollar limitation.--The aggregate cost which may be \n     taken into account under subsection (a) for any taxable year \n     shall not exceed $75,000.''\n       (2) Increase in phaseout threshold.--Paragraph (2) of \n     section 179(b) of such Code is amended by striking \n     ``$200,000'' and inserting ``$325,000''.\n       (3) Inflation adjustment of dollar amounts.--Subsection (b) \n     of section 179 of such Code is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any taxable \n     year beginning in a calendar year after 2003, each dollar \n     amount contained in paragraph (1) or (2) shall be increased \n     by an amount equal to--\n       ``(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable \n     year begins by substituting `calendar year 2002' for \n     `calendar year 1992' in subparagraph (B) thereof.\n\n     If any amount, as adjusted under the preceding sentence, is \n     not a multiple of $1,000 ($10,000 in the case of the dollar \n     amount contained in paragraph (2)), such amount shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000 or $10,000, as the \n     case may be.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to property placed in service in taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Small business Works Act of 2001--Description of Provisions\n\n       The bill amends section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     increase the amount of equipment purchases that small \n     businesses may expense each year from the current $25,000 to \n     $75,000. This change will eliminate the complexity and \n     burdensome recordkeeping involved in depreciating such \n     equipment and free up capital for small businesses to grow \n     and create jobs.\n       The bill also increases the phase-out limitation for \n     equipment expensing from the current $200,000 to $325,000, \n     thereby expanding the number of small businesses that can \n     qualify for section 179 expensing and the value of equipment \n     that can be expensed currently. This limitation along with \n     the annual expensing amount will be indexed for inflation \n     under the bill beginning in 2004.\n       The equipment-expensing provisions will be effective for \n     equipment placed in service in taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 159. A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nallocate additional spectrum for unlicensed use by wireless broadband \ndevices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, Senator Allen and I are introducing \nthe Jumpstart Broadband Act. The Act directs the FCC to set aside an \nadditional 255 megahertz of spectrum in the 5 gigahertz band for \nunlicensed devices to use to deploy broadband connections. It also \ndirects the FCC to establish rules to minimize interference in that \nspectrum among devices and to ensure that Department of Defense systems \noperating in that spectrum are not compromised.\n  We need this legislation to unleash the potential of new, exciting \ntechnologies that promise to deliver high-speed broadband connections \nwirelessly. Currently, congestion and interference from numerous \ndevices such as cordless phones, ham radios, microwave ovens, ham \nradios and garage door openers is limiting the potential of these new \nnetworks. If we can tap the potential of high-speed broadband, then we \ncan provide numerous benefits to the American people as well as create \njobs in high tech industries.\n  I know that talking about megahertz and spectrum seems somewhat \nesoteric. But we strongly believe our bill will have real world \nimplications for families, workers, and communities. Making additional \nspectrum available for new wireless broadband technologies will help \nmake broadband connections more attractive to consumers by extending \nthe reach of those connections. That means more people will sign up for \nwired connections, creating jobs in the turbulent telecommunications \nand high-tech industries. Also, as technologies thrive in this area, \nmanufacturers will also create jobs producing and selling more devices \nto make the connections work.\n  One such technology is called wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi for short. \nIn the home, wireless networking can link all the digital products in \nyour house, computers, printers, handheld organizers, DVD players, to \neach other and to the Internet without cables. Imagine a PC in the \nbedroom transfering songs to a music system in a car parked in the \ngarage. Imagine an oven being turned on via the Internet by a worker \nstuck at the office, allowing him to get home to a meal that cooked \nwhile he or she commuted.\n  In rural areas, wireless technologies have the potential to allow \ncommunities to use signal repeaters to bring Internet connections to \nplaces where wires do not reach, or where the signal over the wire is \ntoo weak. Another possibility is that current or new technologies can \nbe manipulated to extend the reach of the initial connection longer \ndistances without repeaters. Our legislation will make all of those \nkinds connections more likely and reliable.\n  The benefits greater use of wireless broadband connections are \nnumerous. For rural health clinics, for example, these new wireless \nconnections would connect them quickly to resources at hospitals in \ncities hundreds of miles away. For schools anywhere, an efficient \nwireless connection would save\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nthem the cost of knocking down walls to wire the entire school.\n  Senator Allen and I circulated a draft of this legislation in \nNovember 2002 and the response we received from the technology and \nconsumer electronics communities was very positive. We made some \nmodifications to address the concerns that some in the cellular \ncommunity expressed and worked hard to ensure that the new spectrum \nwould allow a variety of new technologies to thrive with minimum rules \nof operation in the spectrum . Our first modification was to specify \nthat the spectrum would be allocated in the 5 gigahertz band rather \nthan below 6 gigahertz. The previous language was of concern to \ncellular companies that operate below 3 gigahertz. The second \nmodification was to limit any new FCC rules only to rules that ensure \nrobust and efficient use of the spectrum for broadband delivery \ndevices.\n  It is our hope that this bill will provide the sparkplug necessary to \nhelp jumpstart the broadband market. I look forward to working on this \nbill with Senator Allen and the rest of our colleagues in the 108th \nCongress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 159\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce and present to my \ncolleagues the Jumpstart Broadband Act of 2003. I am happy to be the \nlead Republican sponsor of this legislation and I want to thank my \ncolleague from across the aisle, Senator Boxer, for working with me on \nthis positive important issue.\n  The goal of the Jumpstart Broadband Act is to create an environment \nthat embraces innovation and encourages the adoption of next-generation \nwireless broadband Internet devices. Most important, our legislation \nwill build confidence among consumers, investors and innovators in the \ntelecommunications and technology industries to eventually make the \nbroadband dream a reality.\n  Unfortunately, we are all too familiar with the recession in the \ntelecom sector. Analysts estimate that over the last 24 months \napproximately 500,000 jobs have been lost. Debt loads in the \ntelecommunications sector range from anywhere between $500 billion to \n$1 trillion dollars. Since 1999 approximately $2 trillion dollars in \nmarket value has been lost in the telecom sector.\n  We know that promises of the Internet doubling every 100 days were \nnever realized. Fanciful expectations like these have left this country \nwith Internet bandwidth capacities that no levels of demand can \nsustain. Unfortunately for investors and the industry the ``if you \nbuild it, they will come'' business model did not materialize and is \nthe primary reason the telecom and technology sectors are in a weak \neconomic state.\n  Over this past few years Congress, and specifically the Senate, have \nbeen locked in debate over the best approach to promote and encourage \nwidespread broadband adoption. There is no doubt that consumers, \nbusinesses and government officials fully recognize the importance of \nbroadband to our communications capabilities and the economy. Indeed, \nthe proliferation of next-generation broadband Internet connections \nwill reinvigorate growth in the technology and telecommunications \nindustries and improve our lives.\n  Economists at the Brookings Institution estimate that widespread, \nhigh-speed broadband access would increase the national GDP by $500 \nbillion annually by 2006. Full deployment of broadband will \nsubstantially change and significantly impact every aspect of our \nsociety. Whether in education, healthcare, commerce, entertainment or \ngovernment services; broadband deployment is a key aspect to improving \nthis nation's overall economy and competitiveness.\n  However, the current debate over broadband has focused only on two \nplatforms, Digital Subscriber Line, DSL, and cable and the regulatory \ntreatment of those services. This perspective fails to consider that \nalternative modes or other technologies are available that can \njumpstart consumer driven investment and demand in broadband services. \nI think it is beneficial to shift the policy discussion away from this \ndebate and focus on something positive Congress can do that fosters \ninnovation, stimulates the technology and telecom sectors, and \nencourages the adoption of broadband services.\n  The Jumpstart Broadband Act seeks to create an environment where \nalternative modes of broadband communications can be created and \ndeployed into homes, schools, public places and businesses by making \nmore spectrum available for exciting, new unlicensed wireless \ntechnologies. In doing so, the legislation directs the Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC, to set aside an additional 255 \nmegahertz of spectrum in the 5 gigahertz band for unlicensed broadband \ndevices. This allocation will harmonize wireless devices in the United \nStates with the international allocation in countries like Japan, \nBrazil, Canada and Europe. The 5 gigahertz band also contains favorable \npropagation and power levels to provide reliable wireless service. Our \nlegislation also directs the FCC to establish minimum rules of \ninterference protection for devices in that spectrum and to ensure that \nDepartment of Defense systems operating in that spectrum are not \ncompromised.\n  Our legislation complements and encourages the exciting work being \ndone in the area of Wireless Local Area Networks, WLANs. Also known as \nWireless Fidelity or WiFi, this technology provides wireless broadband \nservice operating in the unlicensed spectrum bank with up to 10 \nmegabits of capacity and an always-on connection. WiFi is a technology \ndriven platform, viewed by many as a possible answer to wire-line\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\nlimitations and obstacles that exist in the current marketplace. WiFi \nhowever is only the beginning and this legislation will create an \nenvironment where cognitive radios and dynamic frequency selection of \ntechnologies can grow and innovate to offer services that are \nunimaginable today.\n  While I support a competitive telecommunications environment and have \nbeen an advocate for federal deregulation, the Jumpstart Broadband Act \nof 2003 moves the policy discussion away from this stagnant maginot \nline battle and offers an alternative invigorating approach that \nencourages innovation and creates confidence in the market.\n  Providing a way to jump start high speed broadband Internet access \nthrough the adoption of wireless broadband devices is vital to helping \nus keep pace with the new global economy. The benefits to Americans \nwould include more jobs, increased productivity, improved health care \ndelivery, and more accessible education. Our economy needs it, our \ntechnology sector needs it, and the American people will benefit from \nthese new and innovative technologies.\n  I have been working together in a bipartisan fashion with Senator \nBoxer, and I am hopeful by also working with technologists, the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the Department of Defense, we can move \nforward to create an alternative that promotes broadband adoption using \nadvances in technology and spectrum efficiency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bunning, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Graham of South \n        Carolina).\n  S. 160. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe expensing of broadband Internet access expenditures, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with my colleague \nfrom Montana to introduce legislation to provide tax incentives to \naccelerate the deployment of ``broadband'' high-speed Internet access \nacross the country. Broadband is an issue about which I feel very \nstrongly, and upon which I will be very focused this year as chairman \nof the telecommunications subcommittee of the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee.\n  Although many urban and suburban areas now have access to a broadband \nconnection, many rural areas still do not. And that places rural areas \nat a disadvantage in a number of ways in terms of economic development, \neducational opportunities, health care and numerous other applications. \nBy creating a financial incentive to encourage broadband providers to \nextend their networks into rural and other underserved areas, we can \nhelp overcome that disadvantage.\n  The bill will create a temporary tax incentive for providers in the \nform of ``expensing,'' allowing an immediate deduction of a capital \nexpenditure in the first year of service rather than depreciating that \ninvestment over time. In the case of ``current generation'' broadband \ninvestments in rural and underserved areas, the bill will allow 50 \npercent expensing of the investment, with the rest to be depreciated \naccording to normal depreciation schedules. And where providers build \nout ``next generation'' broadband networks, which are typically more \nexpensive, the bill will provide for 100 percent expensing.\n  This legislation generally mirrors the broadband tax credit \nlegislation introduced by my friend from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, in the last Congress. I want to thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia for his leadership on this issue. The only difference in \nthat bill and the one we are introducing today is the form of the \nincentive, expensing rather than tax credits.\n  I am proud to tell you that the first broadband tax incentive in the \nNation occurred in great State of Montana. In 1999, Montana enacted a \nbroadband tax credit, which was in effect for 2 years. In those 2 years \nit had very positive results. Here is a quote from one of our public \nutility commissioners, Bob Rowe, in one of our State newspapers, The \nMissoulian, in June 2001, describing the effect of the Montana \nbroadband credit:\n\n       The results are impressive. Dozens of projects were awarded \n     tax credits, most of them in rural Montana, places like \n     Circle, Crow Agency, Superior and Big Timber. Projects \n     included DSL, cable modems, and wireless. They also included \n     projects to provide ``redundant'' access that is critical to \n     many technology businesses in case service goes out.\n\n  That is the kind of effect which a broadband tax incentive can have. \nCircle, Crow Agency, Superior and Big Timber are not large metropolitan \nareas. They are small communities of a few hundred people. If a \nbroadband incentive can have that kind of effect in those places, it \ncan have that kind of effect anywhere.\n  Now, what has happened to the Montana broadband credit? Like many \nother State tax breaks all across the Nation, it has been suspended, \nnot repealed, but suspended, because of the current budget shortfall \nwhich the state is facing, which is exactly why we should consider a \nFederal broadband incentive at this time, when we are beginning the \nprocess of crafting a package of growth measures to put our economy \nback on a solid footing.\n  And I firmly believe that broadband can have a positive effect on our \neconomy. A number of very solid studies lead me to this conclusion. A \nstudy conducted by economists at the Federal Reserve Board concluded \nthat information technology accounted for over 60 percent of the \nproductivity growth occurring from 1995 to 1999.\n\n  During the first half of the 1990s, the average productivity increase \nwas only 1.5 percent per year. Then, when the Internet began to be \nwidely used, average annual productivity jumped to 2.8 percent in the \nsecond half of the decade. That is a very significant increase, and it \noccurred largely from the ``network effect'' of linking our computers. \nNow, what broadband will do is allow us to use those linked computers \nfor much more advanced applications, video conferencing, real-time \ncollaboration on large computer files, telemedicine, distance learning, \netc.\n  And, for those of us from agricultural States, we should be aware of \nthe applications that our farmers and ranchers might use: Remote \nlivestock sales, remote monitoring of irrigation facilities, tele-\nveterinary, etc. Anyone who thinks farmers don't care about technology \nshould spend some time on today's modern farm, and they will learn that \nAmerican agriculture is one of the most innovative industries in the \nworld.\n  Let me give you an example. Deere and Company, the farm equipment \nmaker, has supported legislation of this type. Others may dismiss this \ncompany as they just make tractors. However, if you were to talk to \nthem, you would learn that the tractor of tomorrow, indeed of today, \nhas a lot of high-tech equipment on board that, as it drives through \nthe fields, gathers information on plant conditions and soil conditions \nand moisture content and so forth.\n  And that is incredibly valuable information to a farming operation. \nBut to really use that information, you need a broadband connection to \nsend it from the tractor to, say, a plant specialist a hundred miles \naway. Without that broadband connection, it will take a very long time \nto transmit the data, which makes it a lot less useful.\n  One economist, Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institute, has \nestimated that accelerated deployment of broadband will generate up to \n$500 billion in economic growth annually. Talk about an economic \nstimulus. I think we would all be delighted to have that happen, and I \nbelieve we should take steps to allow it to do so. This legislation is \nan important step in that direction.\n  And one important reason for us to encourage more broadband \ninvestment is international competitiveness. A number of other \ncountries, like Japan and China, are now making much greater \ninvestments than the United States in optical fiber and other advanced \ntelecommunications infrastructure. Japan is now the world's largest \npurchaser of fiber, much of which is going to deploy fiber-to-the-home. \nIn 1 month last year, they wired more homes with fiber than we did in \nthe entire year.\n  And although China has been playing catch up on building out their \nInternet backbone, they are doing so at a very fast pace and could soon \novertake Japan as the world's biggest fiber market.\n  It is also happening in Europe. The Government of Sweden has \ndedicated\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\n$800 million for broadband deployment in rural areas of the country, \nwhile they have already wired much of Stockholm with fiber-to-the-home. \nLast year, France announced that it would invest $1.5 billion on \nbroadband infrastructure over the next 5 years.\n  I believe it is extremely important that the United States not fall \nbehind in telecom and Internet technology, and a financial incentive of \nthe type provided by this legislation will help ensure that we do not.\n  Let me briefly describe the specifics of the bill. As I said earlier, \nit provides 50 percent expensing for investments in rural and \nunderserved areas of ``current generation'' broadband technologies, \nwhich are defined as those delivering at least 1.0 megabits per second \nof information downstream to the subscriber, and at least 128 kilobits \nper second upstream from the subscriber.\n  It provides 100 percent expensing for investments in ``next \ngeneration'' broadband technologies, which are defined as those \ndelivering at least 22 megabits per second of information downstream to \nthe subscriber, and at least 5 megabits per second upstream from the \nsubscriber. It is technology neutral, it makes no difference if you are \nusing as your medium copper wire, coaxial cable, optical fiber, \nterrestrial wireless, satellite or something else. If you deliver the \nthreshold speeds, you are eligible for the benefit. And it sunsets in 5 \nyears. The intent is not to provide a permanent benefit to the telecom \nsector, but rather to provide incentive to build out new infrastructure \nwithin a short time period.\n  And so that my colleagues and the public can read the specifics \nthemselves, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  Let me just conclude by saying that I believe this is important \nlegislation, and I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting it. \nI look forward to working with my home State colleague, Senator Baucus, \nand also Senator Rockefeller and others to ensure that we push it \nthrough the Congress this year and send it to the President for \nsignature.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and fellow \nMontanan, Senator Burns, in introducing the Broadband Expensing Act. \nMontana has led the way in the innovation of a tax incentive to promote \nbroadband deployment to rural and underserved areas. And today, Senator \nBurns and I are continuing to work together to provide Montana and the \nNation with the tools it needs to stay on the cutting edge of \ncommunication technology.\n  My top goal for my State and the country is to help boost our economy \nand create more good paying jobs. This bill will help to do that.\n  The Broadband Expensing Act will allow businesses to depreciate their \ncapital investment quicker, allowing them to deploy next generation \nnetworks at a faster pace. In short, the benefits are two-fold: \nbusinesses will benefit by receiving an incentive to roll out their \nnetwork into rural areas. And customers will benefit by being able to \nsend and receive massive amounts of data much faster than before.\n  The ability to communicate clearly, quickly and effectively is vital \nto a healthy economy. The Internet has been an incredible innovation, \nbut its abilities are limited by an outdated infrastructure. Much of \nthe network still relies on the same copper wire that Alexander Graham \nBell used when he first designed our telephone system.\n  It is time to update that infrastructure to soup up the copper wire, \nto soup up coaxial cable, to move to optical technologies, and to \ndevelop new wireless products.\n  As many in the industry have told me, our communications network is \nslowly being upgraded all across the country--but often not in rural \nAmerica. The main reason is cost. Companies are in business to make \nmoney, and if their costs are too high, they are reluctant to make the \ninvestment. But rural Americans deserve the same kind of high-speed \nservice that urban Americans have access to.\n  Long ago we determined that rural Americans deserved the same basic \nservices electricity, telephone and transportation--and we found \ncreative ways to provide them with those services. Now it is time to \nensure they have access to broadband as well.\n  In addition to helping us bring ``current generation'' broadband to \nrural and underserved areas, this bill that Senator Burns and I have \nintroduced will help us move to the ``next generation'' of broadband \nstate-of-the-art systems that carry much greater amounts of data than \ncopper wire and coaxial cable.\n  It is fitting that we introduce this bill today, as we are beginning \ndiscussions about an economic stimulus package. Boosting broadband \nservice across the country is one more way to boost the economy and \nbring more jobs to our rural areas. Broadband will help ensure that our \nproductivity remains high and that our citizens receive the best \nservices modern telecommunications have to offer.\n  The potentials of broadband are limitless. From telemedicine to \ndistance learning to video conferencing. In rural areas, we will find \neven more ways to use broadband, such as tele-veterinary services, \nremote monitoring of crops or on-line livestock auctions.\n  And I want to echo Senator Burns concerns about international \ncompetitiveness. A recent study by the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development found that the United States is now sixth \nin the world in broadband penetration. Two years ago, we were third. \nLast year, we were fourth. Now we are sixth, behind South Korea, \nCanada, Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n  We need to move back up the ladder. The United States invented the \nInternet. We invented the computer. We invented optical fiber. We \ninvented many of the devices upon which the Internet depends. So we \ncan't allow ourselves to fall behind in high-speed Internet service.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, for his important work on the broadband tax credit \nlegislation. I look forward to his reintroduction of that important \nbill and working together to provide Americans with broadband \nincentives.\n  Let me conclude by asking my Senate colleagues for their support of \nthis bill that will stimulate broadband investment around the country. \nEvery single American, urban or rural, rich or poor, young or old, \ndeserve access to this new and exciting technology. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Burns and others to get this legislation enacted \nthis year.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join my \ncolleagues from Montana in introducing the Broadband Expensing Act. If \nenacted, this legislation would bring economic growth to rural America, \nand it would help bring community benefits to rural and underserved \nareas of the Nation, including many in my home State of Utah.\n  I think it is striking that most Americans still rely on very \noutdated telecommunications infrastructure, the same copper wire we \nhave used for decades, for their connection to one of the most \nimportant communications innovations in history, the Internet.\n  This is true in my home State of Utah, where the telecommunications \ninfrastructure has not kept pace with the growing number of high-tech \nfirms, manufacturing companies, and very sophisticated workers. Our \nmajor metropolitan areas, of course, have access to high-speed Internet \nservices. But the connections to most homes and many businesses have \nnot been upgraded, meaning that data signals hit a bottleneck there and \nslow down dramatically.\n  Consequently, many wonderful Internet applications, such as video \nconferencing, large file sharing, telemedicine, and distance learning, \nare ineffective or unavailable. And this is certainly true outside the \nmetropolitan areas of Utah, in the rural communities that are found all \nover the State.\n  One way to help overcome this situation is to offer a financial \nincentive to encourage broadband providers to extend their networks to \nunderserved areas of the Nation. That is what this legislation would \ndo. It would help broadband providers reduce the cost of new \ninfrastructure. But it is important to note that they will only receive \nthe benefit of this incentive if they actually build new infrastructure \nand actually provide broadband service. No new broadband network, no \ntax benefit. That is eminently fair and reasonable, and it is good tax \nand public policy.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  This is a two-tiered tax incentive. Companies that bring new \n``current generation broadband'' to rural and underserved areas would \nbe able to expense, or write-off, half of their investment immediately. \nCompanies that bring new ``next generation broadband'' to those rural \nor underserved areas, or to other residential areas, would get to write \noff immediately 100 percent of their investment.\n  What is ``current generation'' broadband? It is essentially cable \nmodem, digital subscriber line, DSL, or wireless broadband service, and \nis generally five to ten times faster than a dial-up connection. \nCurrent generation broadband brings photo images to a computer screen \nvery quickly, and allows the use of simple video applications. ``Next \ngeneration'' broadband, on the other hand, is hundreds of times faster \nthan dial-up and allows television-quality images to flow from one \ncomputer to another.\n  In many rural areas of the Nation, dial-up service is all that is \navailable. Current generation broadband is available in many urban and \nsuburban communities, but still generally unavailable in rural areas. \nAnd next-generation broadband is only in its infant stages, available \nto fewer than 100,000 homes in the United States.\n  This legislation is well crafted to meet the broadband needs of the \nNation. It would help spur current generation broadband deployment in \nareas of the Nation still relying on dial-up, but it would not provide \ntax incentives to areas that already have a broadband connection. And \nit would help spur the deployment of next generation broadband \neverywhere, since that level of service is available to very few people \nin the country today.\n  I look forward to taking a leading role in helping move this bill \nthrough the Finance Committee and the Senate. I am confident that this \nlegislation will make an important contribution to the construction of \na 21st century telecommunications network that will serve the Nation \nwell.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Dorgan, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 161. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require \nthat violent video programming is limited to broadcast after the hours \nwhen children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion \nof the audience, unless it is specifically rated on the basis of its \nviolent content so that it is blockable by electronic means \nspecifically on the basis of that content; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children's \nProtection from Violent Programming Act. This legislation is of vital \nimportance to our young children and their families.\n  The purpose of the bill is to require the Federal Communications \nCommission to consider whether to institute a ``Safe Harbor'' during \nwhich gratuitously violent television programming could not be \ntelevised to America's children. Today, I am joined in this effort by \nseveral of my colleagues, Senators Hutchison, Inouye, and Dorgan, who \nare all original cosponsors of the legislation. I have sponsored \nsimilar legislation in each of the last five Congresses and this same \nlegislation was reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee during \nthe 106th Congress by a vote of 17 to 1. I feel compelled to \nreintroduce this bill again to stem the tide of violent programming \nthat is becoming more and more prevalent in our society. Unfortunately, \nviolence in the media begets violence by our youths and we have an \nobligation to address this societal problem head on. We know commercial \ninterests will not, so we must act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S.J. Res. 3. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress with \nrespect to human rights in Central Asia; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe Joint Resolution expressing the sense of the Congress with respect \nto human rights in Central Asia, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 3\n\n       Whereas the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, \n     Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan provided \n     the United States with important assistance in the war in \n     Afghanistan, from military basing and overflight rights to \n     the facilitation of humanitarian relief;\n       Whereas America's victory over the Taliban in turn provided \n     important benefits to the Central Asian nations, removing a \n     regime that threatened their security, and significantly \n     weakening the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a terrorist \n     organization that had previously staged armed raids from \n     Afghanistan into the region;\n       Whereas, the United States has consistently urged the \n     nations of Central Asia to open their political systems and \n     economies and to respect human rights, both before and since \n     the attacks of September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \n     and Uzbekistan are members of the United Nations and the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, both of \n     which confer a range of human rights obligations on their \n     members;\n       Whereas, according to the State Department Country Reports \n     on Human Rights Practices, the Government of Kazakhstan \n     harasses and monitors independent media and human rights \n     activists, restricts freedom of association and opposition \n     political activity, and allows security forces to commit \n     extrajudicial executions, torture, and arbitrary detention \n     with impunity;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, the \n     Government of the Kyrgyz Republic engages in arbitrary arrest \n     and detention, restricts the activities of political \n     opposition figures, religious organizations deemed \n     ``extremist,'' human rights activists, and nongovernmental \n     organizations, and discriminates against ethnic minorities;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, the \n     Government of Tajikistan remains authoritarian, curtailing \n     freedoms of speech, assembly, and association, with security \n     forces committing extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, \n     disappearances, and torture;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, Turkmenistan \n     is a Soviet-style one-party state centered around the \n     glorification of its president, which engages in serious \n     human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrest and \n     detention, severe restrictions of personal privacy, \n     repression of political opposition, and restrictions on \n     freedom of speech and nongovernmental activity;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, the \n     government of Uzbekistan continues to commit serious human \n     rights abuses, including arbitrary arrest, detention and \n     torture in custody, particularly of Muslims who practice \n     their religion outside state controls, the severe restriction \n     of freedom of speech, the press, religion, independent \n     political activity and nongovernmental organizations, and \n     detains over 7,000 people for political or religious reasons;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom has expressed concern about religious \n     persecution in the region, recommending that Turkmenistan be \n     named a Country of Particular Concern under the International \n     Religious Freedom Act of 1998, and that Uzbekistan be placed \n     on a special ``Watch List'';\n       Whereas, by continuing to suppress human rights and to deny \n     citizens peaceful, democratic means of expressing their \n     convictions, the nations of Central Asia risk fueling popular \n     support for violent and extremist movements, thus undermining \n     the goals of the war on terrorism;\n       Whereas President Bush has made the defense of ``human \n     dignity, the rule of law, limits on the power of the state, \n     respect for women and private property and free speech and \n     equal justice and religious tolerance'' strategic goals of \n     United States foreign policy in the Islamic world, arguing \n     that ``a truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of \n     dissent for all groups that pursue their aspirations without \n     violence''; and\n       Whereas the Congress has expressed its desire to see deeper \n     reform in Central Asia in past resolutions and other \n     legislation, most recently conditioning assistance to \n     Uzbekistan on its progress in meeting human rights and \n     democracy commitments to the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it \n     is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the governments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, \n     Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan should accelerate democratic \n     reforms and fulfill their human rights obligations including, \n     where appropriate, by--\n       (A) releasing from prison all those jailed for peaceful \n     political activism or the nonviolent expression of their \n     political or religious beliefs;\n       (B) fully investigating any credible allegations of torture \n     and prosecuting those responsible;\n       (C) permitting the free and unfettered functioning of \n     independent media outlets, independent political parties, and \n     nongovernmental organizations, whether officially registered \n     or not;\n       (D) permitting the free exercise of religious beliefs and \n     ceasing the persecution of members of religious groups and \n     denominations not registered with the state;\n       (E) holding free, competitive, and fair elections; and\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\n       (F) making publicly available documentation of their \n     revenues and punishing those engaged in official corruption;\n       (2) the President, the Secretary of State, and the \n     Secretary of Defense should--\n       (A) continue to raise at the highest levels with the \n     governments of the nations of Central Asia specific cases of \n     political and religious persecution, and urge greater respect \n     for human rights and democratic freedoms at every diplomatic \n     opportunity;\n       (B) take progress in meeting the goals outlined in \n     paragraph (1) into account when determining the level and \n     frequency of United States diplomatic engagement with the \n     governments of the Central Asian nations, the allocation of \n     United States assistance, and the nature of United States \n     military engagement with the countries of the region;\n       (C) ensure that the provisions of the foreign operations \n     appropriations Acts are fully implemented to ensure that no \n     United States assistance benefits security forces in Central \n     Asia implicated in violations of human rights;\n       (D) follow the recommendations of the United States \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom by designating \n     Turkmenistan a Country of Particular Concern under the \n     International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and by making \n     clear that Uzbekistan risks designation if conditions there \n     do not improve;\n       (E) press the Government of Turkmenistan to respect the \n     right of imprisoned opposition leader Boris Shikmuradov to \n     due process and a fair trial and to release democratic \n     activists and their family members from prison, and urge the \n     Government of Russia not to extradite to Turkmenistan members \n     of that country's political opposition;\n       (F) work with the Government of Kazakhstan to create a \n     political climate free of intimidation and harassment, \n     including releasing political prisoners and permitting the \n     return of political exiles, most notably Akezan Kazegeldin, \n     and to reduce official corruption, including by urging the \n     Government of Kazakhstan to cooperate with the ongoing \n     Department of Justice investigation; and\n       (G) support through United States assistance programs those \n     individuals, nongovernmental organizations, and media outlets \n     in Central Asia working to build more open societies, to \n     support the victims of human rights abuses, and to expose \n     official corruption; and\n       (3) increased levels of United States assistance to the \n     governments of the Central Asian nations made possible by \n     their cooperation in the war in Afghanistan can be sustained \n     only if there is substantial and continuing progress towards \n     meeting the goals outlined in paragraph (1).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/14/senate-section/article/S305-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S305-S306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 19--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS \n  SHOULD INCREASE THE MAXIMUM INDIVIDUAL FEDERAL PELL GRANT AWARD TO \n                            $9,000 BY 2010.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted \nthe following resolution;
