Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss our \nNation's effort in the war on terrorism.\n  Tens of thousands of American soldiers have placed their lives on the \nline to fight this war, and its outcome affects the security of every \nAmerican. No one doubts our troops have performed courageously and \neffectively in this war. The entire world saw how quickly they were \nable to topple the Taliban in Afghanistan. Less visible, yet certainly \nno less significant, is the fact that they are taking the fight to \nterrorists in scores of other countries around the world.\n  While there is no question about how our troops have performed in the \nwar on terror, there are a growing number of questions about our \nGovernment's policies in this critical struggle\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\nagainst al-Qaida and other terrorists. These questions are being raised \nby the families of the nearly 3,000 victims of the heinous terrorist \nacts on September 11. These questions are being raised by the \nbipartisan 9/11 Commission which is currently holding public hearings \nto understand the events surrounding that terrible day. And most \nrecently, questions are being raised by former Bush administration \nofficials with firsthand knowledge of the administration's \ncounterterrorism efforts.\n  The responsibility for getting answers to questions surrounding the \ntragic events of September 11 rests with the 9/11 Commission. \nTherefore, the importance of cooperating with the Commission simply \ncannot be overstated. Only with complete cooperation will the \nCommission be able to produce a report that explains how these attacks \noccurred in the first place, and what can be done to reduce the \nlikelihood of future attacks. Only with complete cooperation can the \nCommission produce the kind of report that our families, our troops, \nand the American people deserve.\n  While the former Clinton administration officials have cooperated \nfully with the Commission, for some reason, the Bush administration's \nrecord on access to officials and documents is, in a word, \nunsatisfactory. As a result, I am confident the Commission and the \nAmerican people will get a full picture of the Clinton administration's \nactivities against al-Qaida. All Americans will have an opportunity to \nevaluate both the things the Clinton administration did right and the \nthings it may have done wrong.\n  Unfortunately, unless senior Bush administration officials have an \nimmediate change of heart, I am much less confident the same can be \nsaid about their activities. If the Bush administration is truly \nserious about allowing the Commission to examine its actions against \nal-Qaida before September 11, it must provide answers to the following \nquestions: Was defeating al-Qaida the Bush administration's top \nnational security priority before September 11?\n  Although both Clinton administration officials and the intelligence \ncommunity repeatedly warned the Bush administration that al-Qaida posed \nan immediate threat to America, accounts indicate defeating al-Qaida \nwas not, in fact, the administration's top priority. The President's \nmost senior advisers did not meet to discuss terrorism until September \nof 2001, 9 months after the administration took office. In fact, some \nsenior Bush officials reportedly believed the Clinton administration \nwas obsessed with al-Qaida. According to both former Treasury Secretary \nO'Neill and Richard Clarke, the President's top counterterrorism \nexpert, President Bush and senior administration officials viewed Iraq \nas a greater threat to our security.\n  Did the Bush administration have a strategy for defeating al-Qaida \nprior to September 11? Reportedly, the Bush administration was \nunsatisfied with the Clinton administration's approach for dealing with \nal-Qaida, and the President requested a new strategy.\n  Dr. Rice recently wrote in the Washington Post that ``the President \nwanted more than occasional retaliatory cruise missile strikes. He was \n. . . tired of swatting flies.''\n  However, even as the administration was being told that the threat \nposed by al-Qaida was growing, press accounts indicated President Bush \ndid not see, let alone approve or implement, the new strategy until \nafter the terrible attacks on September 11.\n  The American people need to know what really happened. What did the \nBush administration do before September 11 to defeat al-Qaida? During \nthe nearly 9 months it took the administration to develop and sign off \non a terrorism strategy, it does not appear the Bush administration \ntook any decisive or effective action to cripple al-Qaida.\n  Perhaps the most potentially significant action the administration \ntook prior to September 11 was in May of 2001.\n   At that time, reportedly in response to an increase in ``chatter'' \nabout a potential al-Qaida attack, President Bush appointed Vice \nPresident Cheney to head a task force ``to combat terrorist attacks on \nthe United States.''\n   But, according to The Washington Post and Newsweek, the Cheney \nTerrorism Task Force never met. The American people need to know \nwhether this is true.\n   Did the Bush administration commit adequate resources necessary to \ndefeat al-Qaida prior to September 11?\n   In the months before September 11, Attorney General Ashcroft listed \nthe Justice Department's top objectives. According to this document, \nthe Attorney General listed at least a dozen objectives that were more \nimportant than fighting al-Qaida and terrorism.\n   And in his September 10, 2001, submission to OMB, Attorney General \nAshcroft did not endorse FBI requests for $58 million for 149 new \ncounter-terrorism agents, 200 intelligence analysts, and 54 translators \neven while he approved spending increases for 68 programs not related \nto counterterrorism.\n   Even in the immediate aftermath of September 11, press reports \nindicate the White House budget office cut the Department of Justice's \nfunding requests by nearly two-thirds.\n  It might be that the Attorney General has a good explanation for why \nthe other items on his list where higher priorities than terrorism. \nThere might be a good explanation why the Attorney General did not \nsupport the FBI request for these funds. The American people need to \nknow why this happened.\n   Finally, did the Bush administration's apparent focus on Saddam \nHussein detract from efforts to defeat al-Qaida and leave America less \nsecure?\n   Paul O'Neill and Richard Clarke are very different people with \ndifferent backgrounds and experiences. Yet both have spent the majority \nof their public lives serving Republican Presidents and both had an \ninsider's vantage point on the current administration's security \npolicies and priorities.\n   And both agree that from the very beginning of this administration \nthrough the terrible events of September 11 and beyond, President bush \nand his senior advisors were fixated on Iraq.\n   O'Neill revealed that at the very first meeting in January 2001 of \nthe President and his senior national security advisors, these \nofficials discussed what to do about Iraq--not terrorism.\n   Mr. Clarke's observations confirm Secretary O'Neill's assessment.\n  According to Clarke, after failing to get a Cabinet level meeting to \ndiscuss terrorism, administration officials relented and permitted a \ndeputies meeting in April 2001.\n  At this meeting, Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz argued that Iraq \nposed a terrorist threat at least as grave as al-Qaida.\n  Even after September 11, both Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy \nSecretary Wolfowitz reportedly made the case that the administration \nshould use the attacks of September 11 as a reason to invade Iraq.\n  In Secretary Rumsfeld's case, the reason was that there were no good \ntargets in Afghanistan.\n  If the administration's focus on Iraq appears to be coming clearer, \nso too are the consequences--for our troops, their families, and our \nsecurity.\n  In the debate leading up to the authorization of the use of force \nagainst Iraq, a number of us sought administration assurances that \naction against Iraq would not harm our efforts to capture bin Laden and \ndestroy al-Qaida; would not shift the focus from those responsible for \nSeptember 11 to a less immediate threat; would not drain away much-\nneeded intelligence analysts, translators, and certain military assets \nin short supply; would not inflame the Arab world and alienate our \nallies and others whose cooperation was essential if we were to prevail \nin the war on terrorism.\n  Even at the time, we were amazed at the swiftness and certainty of \nthe administration's response. Far from harming our efforts in the war \non terrorism, the administration repeatedly insisted that attacking \nIraq would help them.\n  Unfortunately, like so many other predictions advanced by the \nadministration as it made the case for invading Iraq, these assertions \nhave not been borne out.\n  Osama bin Laden is still at large.\n  No one can deny that vital intelligence collection, intelligence \nanalysts and special forces were shifted away from Afghanistan and \ndirected to Iraq.\n  And no one can deny that our credibility and standing in the Arab \nworld\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\nand with our allies and others have suffered greatly as a result of the \ndecision to attack Iraq based on an apparently false claim that it \npossessed weapons of mass destruction.\n  As a result, even the administration has been forced to back off just \na bit from some of the bolder claims it made before the start of the \nwar in Iraq.\n  In a much discussed memo released late last year, Secretary Rumsfeld \nwondered whether we were winning or losing the war on terror:\n\n       Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more \n     terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical \n     clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?\n\n  At a minimum, the administration's missteps in Iraq have greatly \ncomplicated the answer to this question, and attacking Iraq, at least \nin the short to medium term, may have made Americans less secure, not \nmore, against terrorist threat.\n  The American people need to know whether attacking Iraq has helped \nour efforts against al-Qaida and made them more secure.\n  These are the critical questions currently confronting this \nadministration.\n  Unfortunately, while the administration has chosen to make its \naccomplishments in the war on terror a centerpiece of its re-election \ncampaign, it has resisted telling the American people precisely what it \ndid and did not do to win this war.\n  It has resisted allowing the 9/11 Commission access to the \npolicymakers and documents that can provide some answers.\n  It has refused to provide the families of the victims of September 11 \nand the American people with the information they deserve so they can \njudge for themselves the administration's record.\n  Rather than attacking those who raise questions about the \nadministration's policies, President Bush and senior administration \nofficials should do all they can to clear up these troubling questions.\n  The first step is to make themselves and any supporting documents \nimmediately available to the 9/11 Commission, which is running up \nagainst a deadline for its important work of ensuring the American \npeople that we do everything possible to prevent another September 11.\n  This includes having National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice \ntestify publicly. It also includes having the President and Vice \nPresident appear privately before the full commission for as long as \nneeded to clear up these critical issues.\n  America's soldiers have performed heroically in the defense of their \nNation. All America stands united in our pride and gratitude for their \nservice.\n  In order to be certain our Government has done and is doing all it \ncan to defend us, Americans have a right to know more about our \nGovernment's priorities and actions in the months leading up to the \nattacks of September 11.\n  Americans have placed the security of this Nation in the hands of \nthis administration.\n  That trust is a privilege, and alongside it comes the obligation to \nanswer the questions and concerns of the American people.\n  To continue to refuse the 9/11 Commission's requests and to criticize \nthose who raise legitimate questions about its actions merely adds to \nthe doubt felt by an increasing number of Americans.\n  It is time for the administration to honor our citizens' right to \nknow.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to express tremendous \nconcern about the latest news regarding the Medicare trust fund and the \nsolvency of the trust fund. We are now hearing that Medicare, in fact, \nwill become insolvent 7 years sooner than we had been told last year.\n  During the time between last year and this year, there has been a \nMedicare bill passed by the Senate. I believe there is a direct \ncorrelation between what was passed, which I have deep concerns about, \nand the new number we are hearing about Medicare being jeopardized and \nbecoming insolvent 7 years sooner.\n  We know that in the bill that was passed last year, there were \npayments for the first time to private plans so they could compete with \ntraditional Medicare. We know that, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, it in fact has cost 13.2 percent more for the private \nsector through Medicare+Choice to provide the very same services as \ntraditional Medicare. Rather than saying we should go, then, with the \nmost cost-effective way to provide health care services for seniors and \nuse traditional Medicare, the response, unfortunately, from the \nCongress and the President was to subsidize private insurance companies \nand HMOs so they could compete more favorably.\n  Originally, it was $14 billion taken away from providing prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors, helping to pay for their medicine, taking \nthose dollars away from other preventive services that could be paid \nfor, other direct services that could be given to our seniors, and it \nwas put into providing subsidies for the private sector.\n  Now we see in the new numbers how all of this has changed with the \nrevelation of the tremendous increase in the cost of the Medicare bill \nwhich we were told after it passed. We are now told the first estimate \nof $14 billion being diverted is now really $46 billion being \ndiverted--$46 billion not going to pay for our seniors receiving help \nwith their medicine, to afford their medicine through Medicare, but \nbeing diverted to essentially privatize or help private plans be able \nto compete because it costs more to provide Medicare coverage and \nprescription drug coverage under private plans. We see greater costs \nthere.\n  Then right at the time we need to be doing everything possible to \nleverage and lower our costs, we know this Medicare prescription drug \nbill actually says in the middle of the bill that Medicare is not \nallowed to group purchase, to get bulk discounts, which is astounding. \nEvery time I say that to a group of people at home in Michigan, they \nlook at me in bewilderment: What in the world were you thinking that \nyou would not try to get the best possible price through a bulk \ndiscount? Yet we know that one of the reasons there is increased costs \nin this bill is because they are not doing bulk purchasing.\n  Why are they not doing bulk purchasing? Because the pharmaceutical \nindustry does not want that to be done. They do not want us to get \nlower prices. They want us to pay the highest possible prices. So, \nunfortunately, this bill says that, which is another reason why I \nopposed the passage of the Medicare bill.\n  Over and over we are seeing situations unravel that cause me great \nconcern, not only about the new dollar amount, the new substance in \nthis bill, but also about the process that brought us to the passage of \nthe Medicare bill. I will speak now to some of what we have been \nhearing and reading in recent days and weeks.\n  The Government's top expert on Medicare costs was warned he would be \nfired if he told key lawmakers about a series of Bush administration \ncost estimates that could have torpedoed congressional passage of the \nWhite House-backed Medicare prescription drug plan. This was written on \nMarch 12 of this year, just last week, in the Miami Herald. We know \nthere were new estimates, new actual costs that were identified, and we \nwere not told about them before the passage of this bill.\n  We know that between November 20 and 24 of last year, administration \nofficials repeatedly stated without qualification that the prescription \ndrug bill ``will not cost more than $400 billion over 10 years.'' In \nmaking these representations, administration officials relied on CBO \nestimates without citing the conflicting estimates from their own \nanalysts. This comes from a special report Health and Human Services\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\nSecretary Tommy Thompson gave at the time, as well as other news \nreports.\n  We then found out after the new year on January 29--not November, now \nwe move up to January 29--the administration announced the Medicare \ndrug bill would cost at least $534 billion over 10 years--$139 billion \nmore, just as we find the new subsidies for private plans, insurance \ncompanies, and HMOs have gone up, and certainly there is no cost \ncontainment in this bill.\n\n  On January 30, the President indicated he learned of the new \nestimates only 2 weeks earlier, but yet we find on February 12 \nSecretary Thompson testified to the House Ways and Means Committee that \nthey were given the final higher drug cost on Christmas Eve of 2003, \nwhich contradicts the President's earlier statements.\n  Then on top of having conflicting information about the cost and when \nthe administration knew about the cost, we also hear from a colleague \nof mine in Michigan, Representative Nick Smith, who said last fall \nunknown GOP colleagues had tried to bribe him into voting for the \ncontentious prescription drug bill on November 22 by promising campaign \nhelp to his son who is running to replace his retiring father. This was \nreported in the Washington Post on March 15 of this year.\n  We now know there is an ethics investigation going on in the House of \nRepresentatives regarding this process. We know when this bill first \ncame up in the House, they did not have the votes for it and kept the \nboard open an unprecedented 3 hours plus to change votes, to get the \nvotes for this Medicare bill.\n  Republican colleagues have said that if they had known the true cost \nat that time, they would not have voted for it. The cost was hidden. We \ndid not find out what the true costs are, and then we see tremendous \npressure on colleagues to vote for this bill, and now the Ethics \nCommittee is looking into what happened in at least one circumstance.\n  Then we move to another area of great concern to me, and that is the \nadvertising of this particular legislation, this new Medicare bill. \nAccording to the New York Times on March 16:\n\n       The administration then attempted to rally support and take \n     political credit for the prescription drug plan with \n     Government-produced TV ads masquerading as news reports. \n     Actors were hired by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to pose as television journalists purveying facts, \n     upbeat ``news'' segments about the expanded Medicare \n     coverage.\n\n  I also have concerns because in that particular taxpayer-funded \nadvertising, we have found, as a result of a GAO report and a request \nfor investigation that we asked to have done on March 10, the GAO \nconcluded that the Bush administration's Medicare advertisements \ncontain notable omissions and other weaknesses. While they indicate \nthey are not unlawful, they have notable omissions and other \nweaknesses.\n  One of my concerns about all of this is that we are seeing a lack of \ntruthfulness regarding the cost of this bill. Many of us had great \nconcerns about this bill in the beginning. We had colleagues being told \none thing and then finding out another, saying if they had known, they \nwould not have supported the bill; high pressure tactics going on and \nan ethics investigation now related to what was done in the House; and \nthen we see taxpayers' dollars being used to put forward less than \naccurate information.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today we are talking on a series of \nissues where credibility is at stake. Frankly, I think the credibility \nof the Senate is at stake with regard to this jobs initiative we are \ndebating on the floor of the Senate today.\n  I understand it is very possible we will not be able to move this \nmost important legislation that is about creating jobs in an economy \nwhere Americans are not getting access to available opportunities to \nprotect their families, help their families, or improve their quality \nof life.\n  We have seen far too little job creation. For us to back away from \nthis initiative today would be extremely disappointing and, in fact, \nlead to a roughly $4 billion tax hike for American business and for job \ncreation.\n  I think it fits a pattern of failure and unfortunate emphasis with \nregard to the state of our economic affairs in this country. \nApparently, we do not want to take a vote on providing overtime for 8 \nmillion Americans. That is what is keeping us from dealing with a \nfundamental jobs program.\n  We already overwhelmingly voted in this body to pull back from \nregulations that would strip overtime pay for 8 million working \nAmericans. Because we do not want to go on record about that, we are \ngoing to allow a $4 billion tax hike that is going to end up \nundermining jobs. It is just the latest in steps of failed economic \npolicy.\n  I think the administration, the President, ought to be demanding that \nwe get this JOBS bill passed so we have the capacity to keep pushing \nforward on economic growth and, most importantly, job growth for \nindividuals. This failure, in my view, comes against a backdrop that is \nremarkable for its, frankly, inanity and distorted perspectives with \nregard to economic policies that Senator John Kerry has proposed in his \ncurrent campaign for the Presidency.\n  I say ``remarkable'' because it is incredible to me that anyone with \nthe economic record that this administration has, which has basically \nfailed, would have the temerity to try to attack the policies that are \nvery consistent with ones that produced 22.5 million jobs and created \nthe greatest economic boon in the 20th century that this country had. \nThere was growth in productivity, growth in real wealth, and growth in \naverage median income for all Americans. It is hard for me to \nunderstand how, when we have gone from that kind of success to the \nfailed policies we have today, that we are trying to attack some return \nto that effort.\n  I will review the record in specific. Since President Bush came to \noffice, we have lost about 3 million private sector jobs--I think it is \nabout 2.2 million overall jobs because the Government was actually \nincreased. So, literally, it is the worst jobs record since the Great \nDepression. Currently, the situation is not exactly getting better. In \nthe month of February we created 21,000 new jobs in this economy. That \nis against a projection that was in the President's economic report to \nthe country of presuming that we would produce 368,000 jobs per month. \nIt was 21,000 in reality against a projection of 368,000; none in the \nprivate sector, by the way.\n  What 21,000 were created were created in the governmental sector. I \nagain contrast that with the fact that under the policies of the \nprevious administration, we created 236,000 jobs a month on average. \nRight now, on average, we have negative creation under the current \neconomic policies, and before we have done any kind of analysis, we \nwant to attack the kinds of proposals that actually lead us back to \nfiscal sanity and responsible funding of our Government. We would get \non with job creation.\n  If we had the right leadership, we would pass this jobs bill that is \non the Senate floor right now and get forward momentum building in our \neconomy.\n  By the way, if we were to continue that pace of 21,000 jobs, just to \nreplace the jobs we have already lost under this administration, it \nwould take us to 2013, a remarkably slow pace. This is not what \nPresident Bush promised\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\nwhen we saw these large tax breaks, particularly for those affluent in \nthis society. We were told this was going to be a job creator. It has \nnot worked. I think it is time for people to focus on the realities as \nopposed to trying to hyperventilate about what they would like to think \nis going to happen. The differences between projections and reality \njust continue over and over. So when it comes to jobs, this \nadministration's record, in my view, is a complete failure.\n\n  Sadly, though, that is just the beginning on economic policy. The \nPresident has not only produced the worst jobs record in several \ngenerations, in fact, he has created the worst fiscal situation we have \nseen in the history of the country. Frankly, it is shifting the tax \nburdens and the financial burdens of paying for Government from one \ngeneration to the next. The reality is that we are putting on the backs \nof our kids and their kids the responsibility to pay for the actions of \nthe Government both today and obviously future responsibilities as we \ngo forward, but particularly creating debt. There is $530 billion worth \nof debt being created this year. Actually, it is about $630 billion \nbecause we are using the Social Security trust fund which is going to \nhave to get paid back to be able to fund Social Security as we go \nforward.\n  Over the long term, in my view, this failure on fiscal policy is a \nmore serious problem than even the job creation issue because it is \ngoing to undermine the capacity of our economy to be able to grow and \nbe strong in future years, and we are going to get even greater \nresistance to job growth over a long period of time because the Federal \nGovernment is going to be out there competing for every dime in the \nprivate capital markets. That competition is going to end up dampening \ngrowth and creating a situation where we have very little opportunity \nto see job creation as we go forward.\n  To put it in perspective, when this administration came into office \nthere were projections that we would have $5.6 trillion worth of budget \nsurpluses over the succeeding 10 years. Today, the budget projections \nare $5 trillion worth of deficits. That is a negative cash flow swing--\nthat is an old term I remember from business--of over $10 trillion. It \nis mind-boggling that we could see a flip of the switch in policies \nthat would take us from $5.6 trillion surpluses that would allow us to \npay down the debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator has \n1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CORZINE. It is absolutely essential that we get focused on \nreality. I hear people suggest that Senator Kerry, because he wants to \npropose a health care plan that over 10 years will cost $900 billion, \nis going to impose a tax increase on the American people just to fund \nthat. That is flat out wrong. It would be like saying the Bush \nadministration is proposing a $10 trillion tax increase because they \nhave run up budget deficits of these kinds.\n  There is a lot more to say about the economy--failure on jobs, \nfailure on the deficit, and we ought to be passing this JOBS bill in \nthis Senate today so that we put America back to work. I will come back \nat a later point and finish up with some of the other remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3053-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3053-S3055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleague from New Jersey in \ndiscussing jobs, job creation and whether we will have the opportunity \nto vote on two key amendments that will help stimulate our economy--one \namendment addresses overtime pay and the other would reinstate the \nfederal unemployment insurance program.\n  Many of my colleagues know that when we took a vote on reinstating \nthe unemployment program on February 26, we actually had a majority of \nMembers of this body supporting the program. On February 4, a majority \nof Members of the House of Representatives supported a similar \nprovision.\n  Congress supports this program, and supports an extension. The reason \nwe created the State and Federal unemployment programs was to provide \ntemporary and partial wage replacement to people who are involuntarily \nunemployed and to help stabilize the economy during recession. That is \nwhy we created the program.\n  Yet, for some reason, we have put that notion aside and somehow think \nthe economy is getting better and unemployed workers who have lost \ntheir jobs, through no fault of their own, somehow should not be able \nto participate in this Federal program.\n  My own newspaper, the Spokesman-Review, had an editorial this week \nthat basically said: Let us put money in the pockets of those who are \nnot to blame for being out of work. Such a move will help businesses \nthat rely on consumer spending, help them stay afloat, and was one of \nthe chief reasons for creating unemployment benefits in the first \nplace.\n  What we are doing this morning is continuing to ignore the plight of \nthe American workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their \nown. We are being irresponsible, not allowing Americans to participate \nin a Federal program that was designed to create opportunity for people \nand to allow them to sustain themselves in an economic downturn when \nthere are no jobs being created.\n  So much has been bandied back and forth about whether we are actually \nrecovering from this recession and whether and how many jobs will be \ncreated. I think it is important to look at the facts to see what \neconomic projections have been made in comparison to what has really \nhappened.\n  My point is not to place blame for what has happened. At this point \nmy concern is with the unemployed workers who are struggling to make \nmortgage payments, pay insurance bills, put food on the table.\n  Any economist will tell you that sometimes projections are wrong. In \nthe case of job creation in the past several years, we have been dead \nwrong about what was going to happen to the U.S. economy. In 2002, the \nBush's Council of Economic Advisers said: We are going to have job \nloss, but it is not going to be that severe: We are going to lose about \n100,000 jobs. But, in fact, in that year we actually lost 1.5 million \njobs.\n  As a result, the President proposed his policies that were based on \nthat projection. I didn't support his policies, but I am not going to \nspend a lot of time this morning critiquing whether or not they were \nsound. Instead, I am asking my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to not make this a partisan issue. I am asking them to make this \nabout the American worker who needs our help utilizing a Federal \nprogram designed to help out in times just like this.\n  So, then in 2003, the President's economic forecast projected that \nthe economy would create 1.7 million new jobs. But in reality, there \nwas no job growth. In fact, we lost jobs. Instead of growing the \neconomy, we lost 406,000 jobs.\n  This year, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nsaying we don't have to keep the Federal unemployment benefits program \ngoing because the President has projected that we are going to have a \nrecord year--that we are going to create 2.6 million jobs. That was the \nactual forecast from the Council of Economic Advisors. I can provide to \nmy colleagues the specific page, the specific citation.\n  When several members of the President's Cabinet traveled to my state \nof Washington in February, they backed away from the projections. They \nsaid: We don't think that 2.6 million really is the number of jobs that \nare going to be created this year. We don't really think the forecast \nmeans what we thought it meant. I can tell you, the unemployed worker \nis not a rounding error; they are real people with real needs they have \nto meet on a day-to-day basis.\n  To reach this 2.6 million jobs by the end of the year, the economy \nwould need to create between 200,000 to 300,000 jobs per month. That is \nnot what is happening at all. That is not what happened in January and \nit is not what happened in February. It is probably not what is going \nto happen in March.\n  The real issue is that, while some people are saying the economy is \nbetter, and gee, things are rosy since the unemployment rate is only \n5.6 percent, they are hiding the fact that the unemployment rate held \nsteady last month largely because 392,000 people are no\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nlonger counted as unemployed. Many economists and many newspapers \naround the country have said the national average would be more like \nabove 7 percent if you actually included those people who aren't \ngetting counted.\n  Some people question whether the Federal program helps or hurts in \nthe end. They say, don't we want these people out looking for jobs? \nWell, I can guarantee they are out looking for jobs. I have had so many \nconstituents who have come to my Web site and told me their personal \nstories about how they are trying to find a job, often competing with \n20 or 30 other people for a job for which they are all overqualified \nbecause there are not jobs being created. Consequently, they are \nwithout the opportunity we all would like to see in their communities. \nThey have lost a job through no fault of their own, they are working \nhard to find a new opportunity, but jobs are not being created.\n\n  What do you do when jobs are not being created? You utilize this \nFederal program that could provide opportunity to people for 13 weeks \nbeyond the State program. And this program creates an economic \nstimulus. Even Alan Greenspan recently said he believed we should have \nprograms like this one in times of economic downturn. In fact, he \ntestified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee before \nwe adjourned for our last recess and he said:\n\n       In times like this, I have supported the issue of extension \n     of unemployment insurance.\n\n  He said that is because it is important to stimulate the economy.\n  The program we are talking about right now would generate billions of \ndollars of stimulus that would go directly into the economy over the \nnext 6 months. In fact, for every dollar spent on unemployment \ninsurance, those individuals turn around and spend that money, $2, in \nour local economies. They pay their mortgage payments, their health \ncare bills, their tuition for education, for their children to go to \ncollege. It helps sustain them until economic growth actually returns.\n  When the first Bush administration was faced with this dilemma, when \nthey had a recession in the 1990s, the first Bush administration said: \nLet's extend the Federal unemployment insurance program. Actually, the \neconomy had been creating substantial numbers of new jobs for several \nmonths when the first Bush administration extended the program. Why? \nBecause they knew that it would take time for the economy to recover. \nThey knew all of those people were not going to find jobs immediately. \nEven though jobs had been created, the Bush administration extended the \nunemployment benefit program for another 9 months. As we all know, that \nwas the right policy decision and many people went back to work over a \nperiod of time and they had the wherewithal to sustain their families \nin the meantime.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it is time to \nget past the obstructionists who are holding this up. A majority of \nMembers in both the House and the Senate want this legislation passed. \nThey want to help the American worker. 5.6 is not the real number of \nunemployed people in America. It is not a fair representation.\n  Even Business Week did a fabulous story presenting the issue of jobs \nin America, ``Where Are The Jobs?'' I urge all my colleagues to read \nthrough it in detail and see where exactly the jobs are in America. In \nreading it, you will find there has been an increase in productivity. \nThere has been an increase in productivity and consequently there have \nbeen fewer new hires. While corporate CEOs have made more money and the \nstock market has benefited from the efficiencies of business, the \nperson who has not benefited is the American worker who has not found a \njob. Unlike the 1990s when there were millions of jobs created at the \nsame time that we achieved gains in productivity, now we have \nproductivity gains and no jobs are being created. It is going to take \nus longer to recover.\n  This Senator believes very much in the economy of the future. I \nbelieve there are some very strong sectors. As my colleague said \nyesterday, I believe we have to have the right fiscal plan, we have to \nhave the right sectors--sectors like biotechnology and nanotechnology, \nsoftware, and aerospace will continue to grow with the American \neconomy. I think if we make this investment in unemployment now, we can \ngive the American workers the help and the assistance they need during \nthis time of job loss.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the JOBS bill and \nthe importance of passing the JOBS bill. In particular, a portion of \nthe JOBS bill called Invest In The USA Act, which I authored with \nSenator Boxer last year. I just want to take a couple of minutes to \nrespond to the comments of the Senator from Washington about \nunemployment and extending the temporary extension of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  We have had this debate many times on the Senate floor and it has \nbeen shown that when the Democrats were in control of the House, the \nSenate, and the White House, the extension of unemployment benefits was \nterminated when the unemployment rate in the country was 6.4 percent, \nalmost a full percentage point higher than it is today. Historically, \nthe termination criteria remains true.\n  In the past, both President Clinton and the Democrat leader of the \nSenate, Tom Daschle, talked about a 5.6 percent unemployment rate and \nwhat a strong economy the US had at that time. Today, people's mindsets \nare different. People think that our current rate is actually a high \nunemployment rate.\n  I believe we need to continue to look for things that will create \njobs in America. We need to have job training, in fact we have passed a \nbill in the Senate that would improve job training. But we need to stop \nthe filibuster of the Workforce Investment Act and allow it to move \ninto conference, in order for the benefits to be seen. That bill will \nhelp train almost 1 million new workers and help them find new jobs in \nUnited States. The Workforce Investment Act is an important piece of \nlegislation.\n  There is a large number of jobs going overseas, and on the other side \nthere are a lot of jobs that have moved to the United States. That is \nwhat makes up a global economy. It is a constantly changing global \neconomy. Lower paying jobs usually move overseas, while higher paying \njobs are created in this country. But there is a problem. In the last \nfew years, as our economy has changed, not as many jobs have been \ncreated in this country as there could have been.\n  We have a provision called the Invest in USA Act, which recognizes \nthat over $500 billion has been accumulated in bank accounts for U.S. \ncompanies overseas because of the tax rates that would be charged on \nthat money if it was brought back to the United States. U.S. companies \npay up to a 35-percent corporate tax rate to bring that money home.\n  This is a list of some of the various developed countries around the \nworld. This is their normal corporate tax rate. The United States has \nthe highest corporate tax rate when compared to countries in the world. \nThis is just one fact that represents the stark contrast of what the \nUnited States does to its companies compared to what other countries do \nwhen companies invest in countries outside their own market.\n  If a U.S. company goes to China and earns income over there, when it \nbrings that money back, it has to pay up to a 35-percent tax rate on \nthe money it brings returns to the U.S. If a company from France goes \nto China and makes money over there, and they bring the money back to \nFrance, it is zero percent. France charges them zero percent; Germany, \nzero percent; Canada, zero percent; Australia, zero percent; and, Great \nBritain, zero percent. These countries have recognized that it is a \npositive thing for the money to come back into their country.\n  The Invest in USA Act, which I introduced with Senator Boxer last \nyear, passed 75 to 25. Every Republican voted in favor of it and half \nof the Democrat Senators voted in favor of the Invest in USA Act. \nUnfortunately, it was dropped out in the tax debate in what is called a \nconference committee. It is now part of the bigger JOBS bill we have \nbefore us today. I might add--because of the tariffs the European Union\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nwill be putting on American companies--it is important to have this \nJOBS bill passed. I believe, of everything in this JOBS bill which is \nimportant, this is the most important piece.\n  First, I talked about the $500 billion in the overseas markets. Of \nthe $500 billion or so in American companies' bank accounts overseas, \n$400 billion conservatively--I think the lowest estimate of any of the \nstudies I have seen is that $300 billion comes back--will come from the \nfour corners of the world back into to the United States.\n  To put this $400 billion number in perspective, from 1996-2002, it \nwas clear that the United States was experiencing pretty good economic \ntimes. There are IPOs--initial public offerings--on the stock market. \nWith IPOs, people raise money to be able to invest and pay down debt. \nThere are all kinds of various uses for IPOs. During 1996-2002, all of \nthe money raised with those IPOs does not equal this $400 billion \nnumber. With this one simple Act, Congress can bring back more money to \nthe United States and create jobs than in all of the initial public \nofferings that were done for the stock market from 1996-2002.\n\n  It is critically important we enact this legislation in order to \nbring jobs back to America. Some critics say it is unfair for the \ncompanies that are here in America which have paid their 35-percent \ncorporate taxes. I am supportive of lowering the corporate tax rates, \nas often companies pass their taxes on to the consumer and are not \ndirectly responsible for them.\n  We need to make American businesses more competitive. One of the ways \nwe can do that is to lower the corporate tax rate. But given the fact \nthat the rate is where it is, companies have no incentive to bring the \nmoney back here to the United States.\n  For all of those companies that are paying that higher tax rate, if \nthey want to share in a better economy, let us bring $400 billion back \nto the United States to invest, pay down the debt, invest in new \ncapital improvements, do research and development in the United States, \nand create jobs right here in the United States.\n  Various studies have been done regarding this important issue. Alan \nSinai is probably one of the most respected economists in the United \nStates. He certainly is not considered a conservative. Many would say \nhe is maybe a little more liberal than conservative. I do not know that \nyou can really paint him one way or the other, however he is well \nrespected by both sides of the aisle. His estimate is that 660,000 jobs \nwould be created by this one Act alone.\n  The Joint Tax Committee says that over a 10-year period of time, if \nwe enact the Invest in USA Act, it will help reduce the deficit by \naround $4 billion over 10 years. That in and of itself is a very small \nnumber compared to the over $2 trillion budget we have on an annual \nbasis. But the Joint Tax Committee does not count any jobs that are \nproduced. They do not count any of the taxes that are paid by those \njobs that are being produced. Alan Sinai, on the other hand, looked at \nwhat kind of total impact this bill would have on the U.S. Government. \nIn other words, would there be a loss of taxes or a gain of tax \nrevenues because of the health in the economy. He has estimated that \n$75 billion in deficit reduction would be possible because of this one \nprovision in the JOBS bill.\n  The Invest in the USA provision will create 660,000 jobs, and I \nbelieve that is a conservative estimate. It will bring back $400 \nbillion in cash for all kinds of positive things for U.S. companies and \nU.S. workers. It will help the taxpayer and help pay down the debt, and \neverybody around here talks about how important it is to ensure the \ndeficit is reduced.\n  Of all the good things in the JOBS bill that we are talking about \ntoday, for those who are truly interested in creating jobs in America, \nwe need to pass this incredibly important piece of legislation.\n  Of the few objections I have heard to this legislation, one is that \nit is not fair to American companies. I believe that issue has been \naddressed. The second is you should not implement a temporary fix, that \ncompanies and people are content to wait. Instead of paying 35-percent \ncorporate tax rate, they are only charged 5\\1/4\\ percent. Critics say \nyou should not do that just for 1 year because then companies will wait \nfor the next tax holiday. I agree, doing temporary tax holidays is not \nnecessarily a good idea, however, I want to use this as a model to show \nthat if we encourage United States companies that have invested \noverseas to bring their money back--if the tax laws in America are \nchanged--we can, indeed, create more jobs on American soil in this \ngrowing global economy.\n  There is an clear imbalance. Most of which is not the fault of the \ncompanies. Lou Dobbs constantly talks about job outsourcing and paints \nUnited States companies as evil companies. The bottom line is the \ncompanies are doing what is in their best financial interest. It is the \nCongress that has set up these incentives to go overseas and to keep \nthe money overseas.\n  What the Invest In The USA Act does, is allow a temporary fix to \nbring the money back in the next 12 months, stimulate the economy, and \nthen show the model of how a permanent fix can make America more \ncompetitive in the global marketplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3055-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3055-S3057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TERRORISTS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this morning I heard the minority leader \ntalking about a couple of books that have been written, one by Mr. \nO'Neill and one by Mr. Clarke. It appears there is an effort in the \nSenate to use the September 11 Commission and its work as an effort to \npoint fingers, to say--in this instance, by the minority leader--\nsomehow President Bush and his administration were responsible for the \nSeptember 11 attack.\n  I took a post on the Senate Intelligence Committee this past year \nbecause I believe the most important thing we can do to safeguard the \nUnited States and our citizens from further terrorist attacks is to \nfigure out how to improve the intelligence-gathering system. There is \nno question there were flaws, there were holes in the intelligence \nsystem, that we did not get as good intelligence as we should have.\n  Some of those were legislatively mandated. We had walls between the \nCIA and the FBI that prevented them from sharing information. We took \nthose down in the PATRIOT Act. We had problems with inadequate funding \nfor intelligence, particularly human intelligence. We found a lot of \nareas with sophisticated electronic surveillance and aerial \nsurveillance. While they could tell us the movements on the ground and \npick up conversations, they were not good at knowing what was going on. \nWe did not have the sources we needed inside of the countries and even \ninside of the terrorist organizations themselves to find out what \nshould be done.\n  I hope the focus of this body when we talk about intelligence is not \non what political advantage we can gain. I have seen some of Senator \nKerry's political advisers say we are going to carry the battle for the \nWhite House to the floor of the Senate. When we start talking about \nintelligence and trying to bring that in as part of the political \ncampaign, we are not serving the needs of this country and its \nintelligence service well.\n  There is much we need to do and there are lots of votes in Congress \nwe ought to debate. The joint inquiry into September 11 has identified \na number of systemic problems which contributed to the intelligence \ncommunity's failure to prevent the September 11 attacks. There was a \nlack of comprehensive counterterrorist strategy, a lack of information \nsharing among intelligence agencies, and even a lack of military \nresponse to al-Qaida and others.\n  There have been problems for a number of years, predating the Bush \nadministration, I might add. When Mr. Clarke points to the Bush \nadministration in his book and claims there were all kinds of failures \nand faults on behalf of the Bush administration, those people who look \nat his previous statements, read his testimony, and listen to the other \ntestimony, tend to believe there was a lot of fiction going into the \nwriting he put into that book. He has made unfounded statements that \nare contradicted in a number of other places where he has made \ncomments.\n  The article that appeared in the New Yorker on March 24, by Jane \nMayer, in\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nan interview at Mr. Clarke's home in Arlington, VA, July 28, 2003:\n\n       Richard Clarke, the country's first counterterrorism czar \n     told me--the writer, in an interview at his home in \n     Arlington, Virginia--that he wasn't particularly surprised \n     that the Bush Administration's efforts to find Osama bin \n     Laden had been stymied by political problems. He has seen \n     such efforts fail before. Clarke, who retired from public \n     service in February . . . served every President since Ronald \n     Reagan. . . . Clarke emphasized that the C.I.A. director, \n     George Tenet, President Bush and, before him, President \n     Clinton were all deeply committed to stopping bin Laden. \n     Nonetheless, Clarke said their best efforts were doomed by \n     bureaucratic clashes, caution, and incessant problems with \n     Pakistan.\n\n  Those efforts were clear if you listen to some of the testimony. I \nwill try to refer only to the testimony that is being made in public \nbefore the joint terrorism, joint September 11 inquiry. There were \ngrave concerns raised. There were concerns raised about whether it was \nappropriate for the United States, as has been suggested by some, \nperhaps in 2001, to launch an attack on Afghanistan. Given the \nreluctance some seem to have about launching an attack on Iraq, to \nthink we could muster votes or muster international support for \nlaunching an attack on Afghanistan to disband the Taliban is a stretch \nbeyond reason.\n  Furthermore, we know by June of 2001, 16 of the 19 terrorists who \ncarried out the tragic airplane bombings on September 11 were already \nin the United States. Even had we been able to take out bin Laden, \nwhich is no easy task, we would not have stopped the terrorist cells \nalready in the United States planning the attacks.\n  There is a very good article in today's Washington Times by Jack \nKelly, national security writer for the Pittsburgh, PA Post-Gazette, a \nformer marine, Green Beret, and deputy assistant secretary for the Air \nForce in the Reagan administration. He notes Mr. Clarke's charge that \nworries about al-Qaida took a back seat to concerns about Iraq and \nballistic missile defense have been effectively countered by Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice, security adviser. He notes the very first foreign \npolicy strategy adopted by the Bush administration in early September \nprior to the attack was a plan to compel the Taliban in Afghanistan to \nstop providing sanctuary to al-Qaida, but that was a program that would \ntake a long time to carry out.\n  Mr. Kelly goes on to say:\n\n       The thrust of Mr. Clarke's complaint is that Mr. Bush \n     failed to do in eight months what President Clinton failed to \n     do in eight years. But all he has to offer is a continuation \n     of the ``law enforcement'' approach to terrorism that failed \n     to deter the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993; the \n     bombing of the Khobar Tower barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996; \n     the attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in \n     1998, and the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.\n\n  He goes on to say, it is no wonder that Mr. Bush wanted a new \napproach, a different approach. As President Bush told Dr. Rice, it was \ntime to stop swatting flies and to go after al-Qaida and its support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article from Cal \nThomas and Jack Kelly be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. There are those who say the President was totally focused \non Iraq and he was unaware of the dangers of al-Qaida. Well, that is \njust totally false. Was he focused on a regime change in Iraq? Did Mr. \nO'Neill say he was focused on a regime change in Iraq? Perhaps. If so, \nit was because this Congress in 1998 passed a very strong resolution \nwarning about the dangers of Iraq and saying its weapons of mass \ndestruction--which had not been accounted for, and particularly after \nthe U.N. had been moved out--posed a great danger and that we should \npursue a policy of regime change.\n  This was stated. This was the policy of the Clinton administration, \nclearly stated by President Clinton; Secretary Albright; Secretary \nCohen; his National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger. Well, when you go \nbeyond that, it is not unusual the new administration would have that \nas a top concern. But to say they did not have a plan, they were not \nconcerned about al-Qaida, has absolutely nothing to do with reality.\n  I think you are going to find out as you look at the testimony before \nthe Joint Commission--and I hope we will have a report that will be \ndeclassified coming out of the Intelligence Committee which will also \ndeal with these and other questions, not, as I emphasized before, in an \neffort to point fingers, but as an effort to find out what we need to \ndo to get the kind of intelligence system we need.\n  If one is interested in pointing fingers and reading books, the \nminority leader has talked about Mr. O'Neill's book, talked about Mr. \nClarke's book. I would urge my colleagues to also read a book written \nby Richard Miniter called ``Losing bin Laden.'' Mr. Miniter, in that \nbook, talks a great deal about Mr. Clarke's role and the frustrations \napparently Mr. Clarke and others had because the Clinton administration \nwas either unwilling or did not have the will to take strong action to \ndeal with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.\n  Now, I do not think that is a necessary basis for our actions in this \nbody. I do not think that is a constructive matter for us to be totally \nconsumed in debating. Certainly, we did not have the intelligence we \nneeded, and there were extenuating circumstances why the Clinton \nadministration did not take action, did not accept the offer of Sudan, \ndid not move against suspected locations of al-Qaida. Those can be \ndebated by historians.\n  But for some people to come to the floor and say after 9/11 President \nBush was focused solely on Iraq is absolute nonsense. When you listen \nto the testimony, it is clear when the attack occurred, the questions \nwere raised. Everybody thought it was probably al-Qaida. They asked \nquestions. Was it Hamas? Was it Hezbollah? Was it Iraq? Within a day or \nso, the conclusion the intelligence community came to was it was, in \nfact, al-Qaida. So when the President and his staff retired for the \nplanning conference, they had one map on the wall. It was a map of \nAfghanistan. It was a map of the Taliban-controlled country of \nAfghanistan, which was harboring the terrorist Osama bin Laden and his \nal-Qaida.\n\n  They developed a plan. They formulated the plan, and they attacked. \nThey attacked and they disbanded the Taliban forces, and they drove \nOsama bin Laden away from his training camps. We are still pursuing \nhim.\n  I think you will hear in testimony, if people are asked, that all of \nthe available resources have been focused on capturing Osama bin Laden. \nIt think it is clear when you look at the mountainous regions between \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, this is not an easy area to track someone \ndown, particularly when that person has the support of a terrorist \norganization in a very hostile country.\n  We note that it took 5 years to find the bomber of the Atlanta \nOlympics in North Carolina. That should have been friendly territory.\n  But now the good news is, the Pakistanis are working with us, and we \nare continuing the effort to capture al-Qaida and al-Zawahiri, who is \nthe mastermind behind it. We have captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. We \nare slowly but surely taking down the leadership of al-Qaida, as we \nhave taken down the leadership of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  I think it is clear when you look at what Dr. Rice has done--and I do \nnot need to apologize for Dr. Rice. I think if you listen to her \ntestimony, read the comments she has written, you will see she, through \nher work, has earned the high reputation and distinction she has \nreceived as a valued National Security Adviser.\n  As a matter of fact, Dr. Rice requested in January of 2001 that Mr. \nClarke present her with ideas to address the al-Qaida threat. The \nadministration acted on the ideas it made since: weaponization of the \nPredator; increased funding to Uzbekistan, a front-line state opposed \nto al-Qaida. Yet to say we did not go forward with an attack on \nAfghanistan at the time was clear because there was not the sufficient \nfoundation readily developed by that time.\n  The President has never ignored al-Qaida. But the President and the \nadministration were legitimately concerned about the threat posed by \nIraq, which we know Iraq had sponsored terrorism, attacked its \nneighbors, used chemical weapons, violated 16 U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors, circumvented\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\nsanctions to acquire billions of dollars to fund its illegal \nactivities, and continued to try to shoot down over 1,000 times United \nStates and United Kingdom aircraft that were patrolling the no-fly \nzone.\n  Based on all that information and the intelligence provided to those \nof us in Congress, 78 Senators--and I was one of them--voted to use \nforce for a regime change in 1998.\n  When senior advisers and the President met at Camp David on September \n15, 2001, the Director of Central Intelligence said there was no \nevidence Iraq was responsible. That is when the President focused, in \nthat time, on al-Qaida.\n  There is so much to be done to improve our intelligence. I would hope \nwe could leave our political battles for the campaign trail. I have \nlots to say about some of the votes of our colleague who is running for \nPresident. That is not going to help us with this battle on terrorism. \nWe need to use the 9/11 Commission and the work of the Intelligence \nCommittee to develop a sound policy for combating terrorism with good \nintelligence.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 24, 2004]\n\n                   The Blame Game . . . With Misfires\n\n                            (By Cal Thomas)\n\n       At least two things should raise suspicions about the \n     motive of Richard Clarke, the former antiterrorism adviser to \n     four presidents, whose name, face and book were all over the \n     newspapers last weekend and on ``60 Minutes'' Sunday night.\n       One is that Mr. Clarke's book, in which he accuses the Bush \n     administration of not heeding ``warnings'' from the Clinton \n     administration about possible terrorist attacks by al Qaeda, \n     was available only to journalists and not to those in the \n     administration on the receiving end of Mr. Clarke's \n     criticism. So says an administration spokesman with whom I \n     spoke.\n       The other red flag that should make us cautious about Mr. \n     Clarke's assertions is that his former deputy, Rand Beers, is \n     now an adviser to the presidential campaign of John F. Kerry. \n     Part of Mr. Kerry's campaign strategy is to persuade the \n     public President Bush has failed to effectively fight the war \n     on terror.\n       Mr. Clarke is right about one thing. He admits ``there's a \n     lot of blame to go around [for September 11, 2001], and I \n     probably deserve some blame, too.'' Yes, he does, and he can \n     begin with the first World Trade Center bombing and continue \n     with the bombing of the USS Cole and the attack on the \n     American Embassy in Tanzania, all of which occurred on the \n     watch of President Bill Clinton, whom Mr. Clarke was \n     advising.\n       Was Mr. Clinton not listening to Mr. Clarke's advice? Did \n     Mr. Clinton ``do a terrible job on the war against \n     terrorism,'' the charge he levels against President Bush, who \n     was in office less than nine months prior to September 11, \n     2001?\n       Responding to Mr. Clarke's allegations, senior \n     administration official told me Mr. Clarke is engaged in a \n     ``flagrant effort to avoid responsibility for his own \n     failures.''\n       He added, ``The Clinton administration never gave the Bush \n     administration a plan that included the possibility of \n     hijacked airplanes used as missiles to be flown into \n     buildings. Most of their advice was general in nature.'' Even \n     if it had specifically warned the Bush people, he said, it \n     probably would not have prevented September 11, which was \n     well on its way to execution by the time the Bush \n     administration took office.\n       The official confirmed press reports that al Qaeda suspects \n     at Guantanamo Bay are providing ``good stuff that's \n     reliable'' and are helping locate wanted suspects still in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Does he think there is a possibility Osama bin Laden will \n     be captured or killed this year? ``There are a lot of \n     military and CIA people who are surprisingly optimistic he \n     will be found this year,'' he said. Even so, he noted, \n     capturing or killing Osama, while gratifying will be mostly \n     ``symbolic,'' because others among ``the death worshippers'' \n     will take his place.\n       The senior official thinks press reports of nuclear \n     suitcase bombs are exaggerated but he cannot rule out the \n     possibility.\n       Where was Mr. Clarke while all these threats were \n     developing? He was the chief adviser to President Clinton on \n     terror. The Clinton administration approached terror as a law \n     enforcement problem, not a national threat, which is \n     precisely the strategy Democratic presidential candidate John \n     F. Kerry would pursue were he to become president. At least \n     that is the strategy he says he will employ today. Who knows \n     what he'll propose tomorrow or next week?\n       The ineffective response to terrorism by the Clinton \n     administration encouraged the terrorists to go for broke with \n     such high-profile targets as the World Trade Center, the \n     Pentagon and the Capitol or White House. We know it was only \n     because of the bravery of passengers on the fourth plane, \n     which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania, that the horror \n     was not greater.\n       If Mr. Clarke wants to cast blame for September 11, he \n     should look in a mirror. It was he, not the Bush \n     administration, who controlled the power, strategy and \n     direction of U.S. policy toward terrorism for the last \n     decade. That we were hit hard on September 11, 2001, was not \n     the fault of George W. Bush, but William Jefferson Clinton \n     and his chief adviser on terrorism, Richard Clarke.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            (By Jack Kelly)\n\n       If the Clinton administration had a plan to capture or kill \n     Osama bin Laden and to dismantle the al Qaeda terrorist \n     network, as his former counterterrorism chief claims, how \n     come the Clinton administration didn't implement it?\n       Lesley Stahl of CBS did not ask this question of Richard \n     Clarke in her fawning interview on ``60 Minutes,'' but \n     somebody should.\n       Mr. Clarke claimed in the ``60 Minutes'' interview and in \n     his just-published book, ``Against All Enemies,'' that Bush \n     administration officials weren't much concerned about \n     international terrorism until the September 11, 2001, \n     attacks.\n       ``I find it outrageous that the president is running for \n     re-election on the grounds that he's done such great things \n     about terrorism,'' Mr. Clarke told Miss Stahl. ``He ignored \n     terrorism for months, when maybe we could have done something \n     to stop September 11.''\n       Mr. Clarke and other Democrats want to blame Mr. Bush for \n     his predecessor's failings, but it won't wash. The Bush \n     national security team did listen to the recommendations of \n     Mr. Clarke and other Clinton holdovers, but found them \n     wanting, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice wrote in \n     The Washington Post Mar. 22. ``We judged that the collection \n     of ideas presented to us were insufficient for the strategy \n     President Bush sought,'' Miss Rice said. ``The president \n     wanted more than occasional, retaliatory cruise missile \n     strikes. He told me he was `tired of swatting flies.' ''\n       Mr. Clarke's charge that worries about al Qaeda took a back \n     seat to concerns about Iraq and ballistic missile defense is \n     false, Miss Rice said. The first foreign policy strategy \n     document adopted by the administration was a plan to compel \n     the Taliban in Afghanistan to stop providing sanctuary to al \n     Qaeda, or to oust the regime if it failed to comply, she \n     said.\n       The thrust of Mr. Clarke's complaint is that Mr. Bush \n     failed to do in eight months what President Clinton failed to \n     do in eight years. But all he has to offer is a continuation \n     of the ``law enforcement'' approach to terrorism that failed \n     to deter the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993; the \n     bombing of the Khobar Towers barracks in Saudi Arabia in \n     1996; the attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \n     in 1998; and the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.\n       No wonder Mr. Bush wanted a different approach. But a new \n     strategy takes time to devise and put into effect. The speed \n     with which Mr. Bush acted against the Taliban after September \n     11 indicates considerable planning had been done in the \n     preceding months.\n       The September 11 plot had been hatched well before Mr. Bush \n     became president. Most of the conspirators were in this \n     country before he took the oath of office. It would be unfair \n     to blame Mr. Clinton for the parlous state of intelligence \n     and counterintelligence in the CIA and FBI at the time. But \n     it is fair to note he did nothing to improve the situation \n     during his two terms of office.\n       President Bush has.\n       Though there is no evidence Mr. Bush lacked concern about \n     al Qaeda, there is considerable evidence Mr. Clinton didn't \n     worry about the terror group as much as hindsight suggests he \n     should have. Britain's Sunday Times reported Jan. 6, 2002, \n     that Mr. Clinton turned down at least three offers from \n     foreign governments to help seize Osama bin Laden.\n       ``The main reasons were legal,'' the Sunday Times said. \n     ``There was no evidence that could be brought against bin \n     Laden in an American court.'' Mr. Clinton's legalistic \n     approach to terror may explain why his administration also \n     passed up an opportunity to kill bin Laden in the fall of \n     2000.\n       NBC news obtained a surveillance videoshot by a Predator \n     drone of bin Laden at the Tarnak Farms training camp in \n     Afghanistan. An air strike could have taken him out. But Gary \n     Schroen, former CIA station chief in Pakistan, told NBC's \n     Lisa Meyers the White House instructed the CIA to try to \n     capture bin Laden alive, not kill him.\n       Can terrorism be defeated with subpoenas, dialogue and \n     nuance, or are bombs and bullets required? The key issue in \n     this election is whether we will continue waging war on \n     terror, as Mr. Bush plans, or retreat to the failed \n     legalistic approach of the Clinton years, as advocated by Mr. \n     Clarke and Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the new \nprescription drug bill, a bill that is going to benefit senior citizens \nstarting June 1 of this year on a temporary basis, and then in a \npermanent program to benefit senior citizens starting November 15, \n2005. If somebody wonders why a temporary program, why a permanent \nprogram, when we passed the first changes in Medicare in 38 years, very \ndramatic changes, by adding prescription drugs to the Medicare bill, we \nasked the people in the Department of Health and Human Services \nadministering this new law how long it would take to put this new \nexpansion and modernization and strengthening of Medicare into \noperation. They said they needed about 18 months to 2 years, probably \nabout 6 months longer than it took to get the original Medicare bill in \nplace after its passage in 1965. We didn't want seniors to have to wait \n18 months to 2 years to get some money from it, so there is a temporary \nprogram of the drug card that will save seniors 25 percent on drugs, \nand also the subsidy for low-income American seniors and disabled who \nare under $12,000-a-year income--a $600 subsidy for that. So we have a \nnew prescription drug program.\n  This was a relatively close vote on the floor of the Senate. I think \nabout 10 or 12 votes separated those of us for it and those of us \nagainst it. We have had colleagues who have opposed this bill \ncontinuing several attacks, and some of those as recently as today, on \nthis bipartisan legislation that was passed into law and signed by the \nPresident on December 10, last year.\n  This law represents years of hard work by Republicans and Democrats \nalike. We had the chance to fulfill a commitment to our seniors last \nyear. We took that opportunity and we have delivered. I am glad we did. \nFor the first time in the history of Medicare, seniors will have a \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit. For the first time seniors will \nreceive, in addition to a drug benefit, a coordinated disease \nmanagement program, better coverage of preventive screenings, and \nprotection against catastrophic drug costs.\n  In regard to the coordinated disease management program, what we are \ntrying to do is zero in on the 5 percent of the seniors who are \nresponsible for 50 percent of the costs from Medicare. By zeroing in on \nthem, we can enhance our quality of life during retirement and we can \nalso save taxpayers some money by keeping people out of the hospital \nwho otherwise might go immediately to the hospital if you were only \nconcerned about getting sick people well. If you are concerned about \nkeeping sick people from getting sicker, or keeping people from getting \nsick in the first place, it is always cheaper. It is always cheaper to \nprevent a sickness than it is to cure one. That is why we zero in on \nthat 5 percent with coordinated disease management.\n\n  The plan we passed helps to reduce drug costs by harnessing the \nbuying power of 40 million Medicare beneficiaries to negotiate lower \nprices, and by speeding up the entry of lower cost generic drugs into \nthe market. I remind my colleagues who insinuated that the bill was \nsome fly-by-night idea cooked up in some back room and passed in the \ndark of night that over 350 outside groups supported this law, and that \nincludes the AARP, the Alzheimer's Association, the National Council On \nAging, and 347 other organizations. Do you think that 350 organizations \nin America that are concerned about the welfare of our seniors and the \nwelfare of the disabled are going to put their reputations on the line \nfor something that was hastily put together and passed at the midnight \nhour? That sort of statement does not do justice to Members of this \nbody and some who are not even Members of this body now because it \nstarted 4 or 5 years ago. People then were working on a prescription \ndrug program for seniors.\n  This is something that was well thought out, well considered, \ncompromised as necessary under the way we do business in the U.S. \nCongress, particularly in the Senate to accommodate bipartisanship \nbecause nothing gets done in the U.S. Senate that is not bipartisan.\n  Now I would like to speak directly to some of the criticisms from my \ncolleagues about this new prescription drug program, the strengthening \nand improvement of Medicare that prescription drugs bring to it.\n  The first criticism is toward the administration because they are \nadvertising on radio and television to the 44 million seniors and \ndisabled of America. Probably a large percentage of them do not even \nknow this program exists. The advertising is to tell them about the \nopportunities they will have under this new legislation. It is to alert \nthem to the legislation and encourage them to get information about the \nlegislation.\n  Once a senior sees this sort of advertisement, then as I am talking \nto the seniors, I think of them having at least four areas where they \ncan get help, at least four areas in the State of Iowa. One is the 1-\n800 Medicare number. No. 2 is the AARP and the very good booklets they \nput out describing this. No. 3 in my State is the Department of \nInsurance that administers the federally funded SHIPP program where \nthey can get one-on-one counseling from that program. Number 4, they \ncan go to any congressional office and get help.\n  What is this criticism about the administration advertising on TV? It \nis exactly what the law requires. Wouldn't you expect the President of \nthe United States and the Secretary of HHS to carry out the law if we \nin this Congress said take X number of dollars and educate people about \nthis legislation? I am surprised some of my colleagues would oppose \nproviding seniors with timely and accurate and clear information about \nchanges made in this law.\n\n  Do you know why seniors need to know? Because this is not a program \nCongress and the President is shoving down anybody's throat. There are \nthree words about this program that seniors ought to remember. One is \nit is voluntary. Second, it is universal; anybody who wants to \nparticipate can participate. Third, it is targeted because of the \nlimited resources we have. It is targeted toward heavy subsidy to \npeople with incomes under 150 percent of poverty, and targeted with a \nheavy subsidy to those who have catastrophic drug costs. But everybody \nbenefits. On average, seniors are going to benefit to the tune of 50-\npercent reduction in drug costs.\n  In January of this year several Democratic Members of Congress \naccused the administration of robbing the Medicare Program. Those are \ntheir words. Then they asked the General Accounting Office to \ninvestigate whether the ads constitute a misuse of Federal funds.\n  I use the General Accounting Office quite often to do investigations \nfor me, so I don't have any problems with anybody asking the General \nAccounting Office to investigate anything. That is their job. They do a \ngood job of it. But the General Accounting Office confirmed for these \nDemocratic Members of Congress that the law mandates the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to educate seniors, and that the ads are not \npolitical, as they were accused of being political. The General \nAccounting Office report makes clear that the Department has a \nresponsibility, in fact, to inform seniors and to make sure they \nunderstand the new benefits and how they might help the seniors and \ndisabled of America.\n  What information is currently available to seniors may be coming from \nunscrupulous sources as well, because in the February 17, 2004, New \nYork Times there was a feature story about people going door-to-door \noffering what they called Medicare-approved cards though none at that \npoint, nor maybe even at this point, have, in fact, been approved. And \nenrollment doesn't even begin until May. Don't you think, for consumer \nprotection, people ought to know something about this legislation?\n  Again, in regard to scam artists, one Federal official said these \nartists are fraudulently impersonating or misrepresenting Medicare by \ntelephone and by door-to-door visits to beneficiaries' homes. In some \ncases, a caller obtained personal information about beneficiaries \nbefore even visiting their homes.\n  These ads are not propaganda as confirmed by the GAO. They fill an \nimportant void that not only educates American seniors but will also \nprevent criminals and scammers from taking advantage of and potentially \nharming America's seniors and disabled.\n  Educating our seniors on the new Medicare Drug Modernization Act is\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\nnot only required by law, it is the right thing to do.\n  If I could refer to another criticism of this legislation or maybe \nsomething that happened since the legislation, these accusations we \nhave heard, that the so-called true cost of the Medicare bill was \nsomehow hidden from Congress before the final vote, is simply political \nelection year hyperbole.\n  The opponents of the drug benefit are making this claim because the \nfinal cost estimate from the Center for Medicare Services, Office of \nthe Actuary, was not completed before the vote took place.\n  Let us be very clear. The cost estimate was not withheld from \nCongress because there was not any final cost estimate from the Center \nfor Medicare Services to withhold in the first place. Their cost \nestimate wasn't even completed until December 23. That was 2 weeks \nafter the President signed the bill, and a month after Congress passed \nit.\n  So let us again be clear. We did not have from the Center for \nMedicare Services the official cost estimate on the Medicare bill \nbefore the vote because the bill had to be passed before they were \ngoing to come to a final figure. But we did have what Congress uses and \nthe only figure we use in official estimates of anything. We had \nMedicare bill estimates from the Congressional Budget Office before we \nvoted. And that is what Congress goes by.\n  Even if we had had the Center for Medicare Services with some figure \nout there, that may have meant something to some people but there could \nnot have been a point of order made on some estimate of the Center for \nMedicare Services because the only point of order is if it is contrary \nto the Budget Act. The Congressional Budget Office makes that \ndetermination.\n  Around Congress, the Congressional Budget Office is God. Even if they \nare wrong, they are still God. They are the basis for determining \nwhether a supermajority has to be required to move to legislation. If \nyou violate the Budget Act and exceed the estimate of the cost, then \nyou have to have a supermajority. We only go by the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n\n  I happen to believe, as some people have criticized, maybe some \nGovernment official was muzzled not to communicate with Congress on \nsomething they believed. I happen to believe that no Government \nofficial should ever be muzzled from providing critical information to \nCongress. If that happened last year, that was wrong.\n  These accusations about whether the information was withheld have \nraised questions as to whether Congress had access to a valid and \nthorough cost estimate for the prescription drug bill before the final \nvote. It should also be made clear that, while the cost analysis by the \nOffice of the Actuary is perhaps helpful, it is not the cost analysis \nthat Congress relies on, and it is not the one that Members make points \nof order against because we rely exclusively upon cost estimates of the \nCongressional Budget Office. It is CBO's cost estimate that we use to \ndetermine whether legislation is within authorized budget limits. For \nCongress, if there is a true cost estimate, it happens to be from the \nCongressional Budget Office. We had a true cost estimate from them. It \nis the only one that matters.\n  When Congress approved a $400 billion reserve fund to create a \nMedicare prescription drug program, this meant $400 billion according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, not $400 billion according to the \nCenter for Medicare Services.\n  With all due respect to the dedicated staff who work at the Center \nfor Medicare Services, Office of the Actuary, their cost estimates are \nirrelevant to our process of legislating, except to the extent to which \na Member might want to have that as a factor. But it surely isn't going \nto govern what a majority of this body does.\n  The Congressional Budget Office worked closely with the conferees, \nand the staff, on the prescription drug bill to ensure that a full \nanalysis of projected costs was completed. The conferees and staff \nregularly and constantly consulted with the Congressional Budget Office \nthroughout the development of the Senate bill, and also through the 3 \nmonths of arriving at a conference committee compromise between the \nHouse and the Senate. The Congressional Budget Office had to work \nnearly around the clock and on weekends for a month to do a complete, \nthorough, and rigorous cost analysis on the prescription drug bill. \nThat official cost estimate was available to every Member of Congress \nbefore the measure was presented to the House or the Senate for a vote.\n  It is also pretty disingenuous for the opponents of the Medicare bill \non the other side of the aisle to suggest that the pricetag for the \nMedicare bill causes them concern. The fact is, they have supported \nproposals that cost hundreds of billions of dollars more. Don't \ncomplain to me about a bill costing $359 billion, or maybe it was CMS \ncoming up with a larger number when in the first place those \nindividuals are supporting bills that cost $600 billion or $800 \nbillion--or in the other body.\n  Last year, the Democratic proposal over there would have cost nearly \n$1 trillion, $605 billion more than our bill. In fact, as to the Senate \nDemocratic proposal in 2002, when we had the debate on the tripartisan \nbill, when we had the debate on bills on that side of the aisle, we \ndidn't pass them. But we had a long debate that summer. That Senate \nDemocrat proposal was $200 billion more than the bill we enacted into \nlaw this year. Further, there were more than 50 amendments offered on \nthe floor of the Senate during the debate on this Senate bill that \nwould have increased the cost of the bill by tens of billions of \ndollars. Then people are complaining about $395 billion, or people are \ncomplaining about the cost estimate by the Center for Medicare \nServices, which is higher.\n  The bottom line is there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that we \nhad a true cost estimate for the prescription drug bill last year, and \neveryone had access to it before the vote. That source was our \ncongressional God, the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The impact on the Medicare trust fund is something also that needs to \nbe addressed. I will speak about that a little bit. The trustees' \nreport revealed yesterday the Medicare trust fund insolvency date has \nbeen moved up 7 years, to the year 2019. Most of the change is due to \nhigher health care costs, changes in the economy, better data analysis \nand projection, and improved data on the health of beneficiaries.\n  In the Medicare bill we just passed, we put money in there for \nenhanced quality care, particularly in rural America. Thirty States are \nbelow the national average of reimbursement. We gathered together in \nthis Senate to pass overwhelmingly a bill to give equal treatment to \nrural areas that we give to urban areas on reimbursement for doctors \nand hospitals. That is responsible for 2 of the 7 years that Medicare \nis closer to insolvency than last year based upon the trustees' \nestimate.\n  We all have to admit we have concern about the future solvency of \nMedicare. We have to stay focused on improving and protecting Medicare \nfor future generations. We have to do this while not jeopardizing \naccess to care.\n  Another topic discussed this morning was the prohibition on \nnegotiating. There is a paragraph in the bill that says the Federal \nGovernment cannot be involved in the negotiation for drugs. That was \nput there for a specific purpose. We want to keep the Federal \nbureaucrat out of the medicine cabinet. We learned our lesson from the \nVA. I will give a personal experience I had in the last month. I have \nbeen holding several town meetings since the first of the year in my \nState to help seniors understand this prescription drug program they \nhave to make some choices on. Since the first of the year, I have held \nmeetings in 32 different counties. In Des Moines, IA, the first \nquestion I had after my presentation was from a woman who said her \ndoctor said she ought to have such and such a pill, but the Veterans' \nAdministration was not going to pay for it. Why? Because it probably \ncost more than some other drug VA thinks is just as good. But the \ndoctor does not think it is just as good.\n  We could have the same thing happening if the Federal Government is \ngoing to negotiate for all seniors. We do not need to have that. Our \nbill provides every therapeutic class have one of a kind available of \nevery drug that is known to meet that need. We want the doctor and the \npatient to have access.\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\nWe want to keep the Federal Government out of the senior citizen's \nmedicine cabinet.\n  Let me go into detail why we have it this way. First of all, the \naccusation is this legislation prohibits negotiation with drug \ncompanies. We have learned from 40 years of Federal employee health \nbenefit plan about plans negotiating with drug companies and other \nhealth care providers to bring down costs. It has worked very well. We \nhave different plans seniors can join to decide what kind of service \nthey want. Then the plans are going to negotiate the drugs down. It has \nworked before. It can work now. It will work now. In fact, this is the \nonly thing in the bill the Congressional Budget Office said was going \nto bring down the costs of the program. If the Government did it \ndirectly, it was going to cost more. That is what the Congressional \nBudget Office said.\n  We are going to have negotiation with drug companies. This accusation \ncould not be further from the truth. The truth is the Medicare \nprescription drug plans will be negotiating directly with drug makers. \nThese negotiations are at the heart of the new Medicare drug benefit. \nThe absurd claim the Government will not be negotiating with drug \nmakers comes from the noninterference clause in the Medicare bill. This \nclause did not prohibit Medicare from negotiating with drug makers. It \nprohibits the Center for Medicare Services from interfering in those \nnegotiations.\n\n  Let me be clear. The noninterference clause is at the heart of the \nbill's structure for delivering prescription drug coverage to seniors \nand disabled. This clause ensures those savings will result from market \ncompetition rather than through price fixing by the Center for Medicare \nServices bureaucracy.\n  This same noninterference clause was in the Daschle-Kennedy-\nRockefeller bill and the Gephardt-Dingell-Stark bill in 2000. It is \nalmost identical to the noninterference clause in the Gephardt-Dingell-\nStark bill and the Medicare Modernization Act which was signed into \nlaw.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded the market-based \napproach in the new Medicare bill will result in higher prescription \ndrug costs management factor for Medicare than any other approach being \nconsidered last year by the Congress.\n  Here is what the Congressional Budget Office said about eliminating \nthe noninterference clause in a letter earlier this year:\n\n       The Secretary would not be able to negotiate prices that \n     further reduce federal spending to a significant degree.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office said in the letter:\n\n       CBO estimates substantial savings will be obtained by \n     private plans.\n\n  Let me be clear. Direct government negotiation is not the answer. We \nran into that with the VA, the VA bureaucrats getting in the medicine \ncabinet of the veterans of America. The Government does not negotiate \ndrug prices. The Government sets prices. The bill's entire approach is \nto get seniors the best deal through vigorous market competition, not \nthrough price controls.\n  Even the Washington Post editorial page wrote on February 17:\n\n       Governments are notoriously bad at setting prices, and the \n     U.S. government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the \n     medical realm.\n\n  Price controls won't work, whether we are talking about all drugs or \njust so-called single-source drugs, as one of our colleagues from \nOregon has proposed.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said such a proposal would ``generate \nno savings or even increase Federal costs.''\n  It would seem, then, the devil is in the details.\n  We did not rely on the Center for Medicare Services for price fixing \nbut instead created a new drug benefit that relies on strong market \ncompetition and creates consumer choices. This approach has been \nanalyzed by experts as getting the best deal for seniors on lower drug \nprices.\n  To sum up, it is an election year and plenty of people are using \nMedicare to play politics. The new Medicare law is a bipartisan \nproposal that resulted from years of work by both Republicans and \nDemocrats. The new law creates a volunteer benefit that is targeted to \nlow-income seniors and those with high drug costs. The new law lowers \ndrug costs by speeding the delivery of new generic drugs to the \nmarketplace, lowering costs to all Americans, not just those on \nMedicare. The new law also revitalizes the rural health care safety net \nwith the biggest package of rural payment improvements in the history \nof the program. The AARP has made that clear when providing its strong \nendorsement that the Medicare bill ``helps millions of older Americans \nand their families'' and is ``an important milestone in the Nation's \ncommitment to strengthen and expand health security for its citizens . \n. .

Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have a huge inequity in the Tax \nCode today. There are seven States that have a sales tax but no income \ntax. The States that don't have an income tax generally have a higher \nsales tax. That is the case with my State of Texas and six other \nStates.\n  Fifty-five million taxpayers who have only sales taxes for their \nState and a local major tax revenue base do not get to deduct from \ntheir Federal income taxes what they pay in local and State sales \ntaxes. On the other hand, income tax State taxpayers do get that \ndeduction. So if you have a high sales tax and that is the basis of \nyour revenue for your State and local government, you are paying taxes \non your taxes. This is not equitable. Fifty-five million taxpayers have \nthis inequity.\n  My amendment would treat everyone the same. It would give you the \nopportunity to either deduct sales taxes or income taxes on your \nFederal income tax return. This discrepancy has a huge impact on my \nState of Texas. According to the Texas Comptroller, if taxpayers could \ndeduct their sales taxes, more than $700 million would be kept in \nTexans' pocketbooks. This could lead to 16,000 new jobs and add $900 \nmillion in economic activity.\n  Many States are facing financial crises. Our State certainly is, and \nmany other States are. What we want is not an advantage. What we want \nis equity.\n  I realize this bill is very important to end punitive tariffs the \nEuropean Union has begun to impose on U.S. products. I do not want to \nimpede this bill. It is so important for American manufacturers not to \nhave this punitive tariff on our products going into European commerce. \nI am willing to work with the managers of the bill. I am willing to \nwithdraw the amendment. But I am serving notice that we have had this \ninequity since 1986. Since 1986, seven States have had this \ndiscrimination. When there was a reform of taxation in 1986, they took \naway the deduction for sales taxes, and no one stood up and said there \nis an inequity in that there are seven States that have no income taxes \nand we are leaving the income tax deduction, but we are discriminating \nagainst States such as Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and \nNevada.\n  We need to correct this inequity. I ask that the chairman withdraw \nthe amendment at this time. I certainly support the underlying bill, \nbut I am serving notice this inequity must be corrected soon.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2888, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator has asked to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, for proposing an amendment to change the Federal Tax Code to \npermit those citizens that live in States without State income taxes to \ndeduct State and local sales tax payments. The current law allows \ndeductions from Federal income tax for State and local income and \nproperty taxes, but not for local and State sales tax. That is unfair. \nTennesseans should not be unfairly penalized at tax time simply because \nthe State decided to have a sales tax, not an income tax.\n  Prior to 1986, individuals were permitted to deduct all State and \nlocal taxes on their Federal tax returns. But, when Congress enacted \nthe 1986 Tax Reform Act, the deduction for State sales taxes was \neliminated. My colleague introduced this amendment, which I \ncosponsored, because she and I both want to draw attention to this \ninjustice. I also appeal to my colleagues' sense of fairness and ask \nthat, in the future, my colleagues work with me to try to fix this \nproblem.\n  Again, citizens should not be penalized simply because their State \ndoes not have an income tax. Tennesseans could save more than $470 \nmillion on their Federal tax bills if they could deduct sales taxes. \nThis retained income could provide an important economic stimulus to \nTennessee. Changing the Code to permit deduction of sales tax is also \nconsistent with the principle of fundamental fairness to all taxpayers. \nWhen deductibility for State sales taxes was eliminated in 1986, but \ndeductibility for State income taxes was retained, it was a political \ncompromise with no foundation in policy. It is long past time to \nrectify this fundamentally unfair and counter-productive result.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas for submitting her amendment and \ndrawing attention to this fundamentally unfair provision of the Federal \nTax Code. I look forward to working with her on this issue in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                amendment no. 2926 to amendment no. 2898\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send a further amendment to the desk. \nThis amendment is the same as what I previously had withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2926 to amendment No. 2898.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment strike ``one day'' and insert \n     ``two days.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to make very clear that the vote that is coming up, that we \ncall cloture, is an effort to reach finality on this legislation. We \nwon't be able to do it otherwise. So I think it is a very important \nvote, particularly considering the fact that Europe has put a 5-percent \ntariff on a lot of agricultural and manufacturing and timber products. \nWe need to think in terms of a 5-percent tariff making a very uneven \nplaying field for American manufacturing\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\nand agriculture, if we are going to do business with Europe.\n  I hope each person in the Senate will think of the products they \nmight export to Europe, the extent to which those products now have, \nalready, a 5-percent tariff. Then there is going to be a 1-percent \ntariff added each succeeding month, up to 17 percent. Think in terms of \nour inability to export to Europe those products.\n  I have in front of me several pages of items that they have already \nlegally put these tariffs on because we lost the World Trade \nOrganization decision. And pretty soon, when you keep getting a percent \nadded every month, there is going to be a lot of layoffs in these \nindustries because they can't compete.\n  I already met with a group at 9 o'clock this morning that told me \nwith the 5-percent tariff on their products, they are unable to make \nsales in Europe. That happened to come from the timber and paper \nindustry. I can say that.\n  This legislation, if we pass it, will not only take care of the \nproblem of the tariffs being put on, they will go away when we pass \nthis legislation. So there is no more sanctions, no more penalizing \ntariffs against American products. Not only that, but we are going to \nreduce the taxation of manufacturing that is done in the United States \nby American workers. We are going to reduce the corporate tax on \nmanufacturing here. American corporations that manufacture overseas \nwill not get the benefit from it. Foreign corporations that come to \nAmerica to set up plants hiring American workers will get the benefit \nof the lower rate of taxation. So this is tilted very much toward the \npreservation of jobs.\n  I remind people on the other side of the aisle who have been \nlegitimately wondering when jobs are going to start being created in a \nvery healthy economic climate of 5-percent growth and only .5- and .6-\npercent unemployment, we are all concerned about that--very healthy \nrecovery, but particularly in manufacturing, not jobs being created the \nway they would normally happen. This is the opportunity for any Members \nof the Senate who are concerned about that to help us get cloture and \npass this bill so we preserve jobs in manufacturing and we create jobs \nin manufacturing by emphasizing made in America.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I oppose cloture at this point, and let me explain why. This is an \nimportant bill--a bill that would help to create and keep good \nmanufacturing jobs in America. We need to move on this bill.\n  Senator Harkin has offered an amendment about the quality of jobs in \nAmerica and he deserves to get a vote. On a major bill like this, \nSenators deserve a full and fair opportunity to offer and get votes on \namendments. We should allow that process to continue.\n  The effect of the cloture motion is simple: It would block a vote on \nthe Harkin amendment--at least for now. I do not believe the Senate \nshould prevent such a vote. For one thing, blocking a vote on the \nHarkin amendment would be only a temporary measure. The Senator from \nIowa has made it abundantly clear that he will be back. The majority \ncannot avoid this vote forever. When something will happen sooner or \nlater, sometimes the better course of action is to address it straight \non, not sweep it under the rug.\n  So I will oppose cloture and vote against cloture to allow the Senate \nto get to a vote on the Harkin amendment. If, as I expect, the Senate \nfails to invoke cloture, I urge the majority leader to stay on the \nbill. If the Senate fails to invoke cloture, I will work with other \nSenators to reach an agreement limiting amendments to a reasonable \nnumber. I believe, for example, that Senator Harkin is amenable to a \nshort time agreement himself. We have been in discussions with a number \nof Senators attempting to schedule consideration of their amendments. \nMany Senators would be willing to enter into very reasonable time \nagreements.\n  For example, Senators Dorgan and Mikulski have an amendment on \nrunaway plants; Senators Breaux and Feinstein have an amendment to \nmodify the repatriation agreement; Senator Kennedy has an amendment to \nstrike an international provision and use the money to expand the \nmanufacturing deduction; Senator Hollings has an amendment on the \ninternational provisions. I believe each of these Senators would enter \ninto workable time agreements. We will have other amendments than \nthese, but not many.\n  The number of amendments to this bill is not vast. We have \naccommodated many Senators in the managers' substitute. If the Senate \ncan work through the Harkin overtime amendment, we could handle the \nremaining amendments expeditiously.\n  I urge the majority leader to join in pursuing that course I have \noutlined and working with us to bring this bill to completion by the \nend of the week. Once again, it is important that we do so. We need to \nrespond to the European Union's sanctions. And we need to do what we \ncan to help create and keep jobs in America. We need to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  There are over 500 products on this list. There are 500 products on \nthis list on which we know there are sanctions and tariffs from Europe, \nwhich will make our products uncompetitive. I thought I would list a \nfew of these and the States these products come from so Senators will \nknow they are voting against jobs in their own States by this process \nof European sanctions:\n  Precious stones and metals would be affected in New York, New Jersey, \nUtah; nuclear reactors and boilers, California, Texas, Ohio, Michigan; \ntoys, games, and sports equipment, California, New York, and Wisconsin; \nelectric machinery, California, Massachusetts, Texas; wood products, \nMinnesota, California, Georgia, Pennsylvania; wood industry residues \nand animal feed, Louisiana, Florida, Illinois; aluminum, New York, \nOhio, Georgia, California; iron and steel, Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nCalifornia; glass and glassware, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey; \nleather art, saddlery, handbags, California, New York, Texas; tools, \nNew York, Ohio, Pennsylvania; paper, paperboard, and articles, Georgia, \nSouth Carolina, Massachusetts; articles of iron and steel, California, \nIllinois, Pennsylvania; apparel that is not knit, California, New York, \nNew Jersey; meat and edible meat, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota; \ncopper, Illinois, Pennsylvania, California; animal or vegetable fats, \nNew York, Texas, California, Louisiana; edible vegetables, California, \nWashington, Oregon; apparel, knit or crochet, California, New York, \nNorth Carolina; oilseeds and grain, California, New York, Oregon; \ntextile art and needlecraft, New York, Illinois, and California; \nceramic products, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois; footwear, \ngaiters, California, Massachusetts, New York; carpets, Georgia, New \nYork, South Carolina; cereal, flour, starch, or milk, California, New \nYork, Illinois; soap, waxes, polish, candles, Ohio, Massachusetts, \nCalifornia; edible fruit and nuts, California, Florida, Washington; \nproducts of animal origin, New York, California, Pennsylvania.\n  We can go on and on because there are more that I could give. For \none, I hope that every Senator realizes this 5-percent tariff is going \nto go up 1 percent a month for the next 12 months, adding up to a 17-\npercent tariff. The extent to which these products are hurt by that 5-\npercent tariff each month we wait to get this legislation passed, it is \ngoing to place more of a burden on American industry, lose more \nAmerican jobs, and lose an opportunity to create jobs, which this \nlegislation does.\n  I also remind some Members that have asked us to put provisions in \nthis bill, if they vote against cloture, they are voting against these \nprovisions. There is a new homestead provision for\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\nrural development providing special assistance for businesses in \ncounties losing population. There is a provision that allows payment \nunder the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program to \nexempt that payment from taxation.\n\n  We have provisions in this bill to clean up brownfields.\n  We have provisions in this bill for mortgage revenue bonds.\n  There are 70 Senate cosponsors of this bill.\n  We allow deductions for private mortgage insurance for people \nstruggling to afford a new home.\n  We have extended and enhanced the Liberty Zone bonds for the \nrebuilding of New York City.\n  We also included $100 million in tax credits to be used on rail \ninfrastructure projects within the New York Liberty Zone.\n  We have bonds for rebuilding school infrastructure.\n  We have some provisions in this bill for Native Americans.\n  These are provisions Members have asked us to accommodate them on in \nthis legislation. Is it worth killing off these important priorities by \nvoting against cloture, not letting us get to finality, not letting us \nmake American industry more competitive, which obviously is going to \ncreate jobs, about which we heard so much concern on the part of \nMembers of this body, that we have a healthy recovery of 5-percent \ngrowth, only 5.6-percent unemployment, which, historically, is very low \nunemployment, but still not enough jobs being created?\n  The situation is going to get worse if we do not pass this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold that request. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. I yield it all to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for \nthe remaining time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa for \nyielding what time he has remaining.\n  Rarely does the Senate have a simple decision on whether to create \njobs or destroy jobs. That is a decision we are going to make shortly. \nToday we have that clear choice. We can create jobs or we can destroy \njobs. We can destroy jobs by letting a 17-percent tariff on American \nbusinesses kick in, as has already begun, at 5 percent on March 4, or \nwe can create jobs by stopping that tariff and instead giving \nmanufacturing business a tax deduction of 9 percent from U.S. income \ntaxes. We can, as I said, destroy jobs or we can create jobs.\n  It has been over 2 years since the WTO ruled the FSC/ETI tax break \nwas illegal. It has been a year and a half since WTO decided $4 billion \nof EU tariffs could be charged against U.S. exporters. It has been \nalmost 1 year since final approval was granted by the WTO to impose \nthese tariffs. And now it is almost a month since the 5-percent tariff \nwas imposed. Next month that rises to 6 percent and another percent \neach month until it gets up to 17 percent next March.\n  We have known for years we need to protect manufacturing businesses. \nThat is what this bill is about--protecting manufacturing businesses. \nWe have known for months the sword of Damocles was about to fall, and \nnow it has fallen and we are still talking.\n  No one can claim to be surprised about our need to act. Over 6 weeks \nago, we were told this by our minority leader. Six weeks ago, our good \nfriend from South Dakota said we need to act. He said 6 weeks ago this \nlegislation was urgent. He said 6 weeks ago we need to begin addressing \nthe American manufacturing crisis. That was the Democratic leader of \nthe Senate.\n  I could not agree more. He was exactly right 6 weeks ago, and he is \nexactly right today. It is time to pass this bill if we are concerned \nabout manufacturing jobs in the United States. But here we are, 6 weeks \nlater, and the EU has begun taxing, but we have not stopped talking. \nThey have begun taxing, and we have not stopped talking.\n  This is a jobs bill we have before us. It is a manufacturing jobs \nbill. This is a manufacturing jobs bill reported out of the Finance \nCommittee by a bipartisan vote of 19 to 2. Usually when a bill comes \nout of a committee with that kind of bipartisan support, we take it up \nand we pass it in short order.\n  The way to do that is to invoke cloture in a few moments. We have \nthis 19-to-2 committee vote--Republicans for it, Democrats for it--\ntariffs kicking in, and jobs being lost as a result of our failure to \nact. It is time to act, and we ought to act now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reluctantly, I will vote for cloture on \nthe motion to recommit S. 1637 to the Finance Committee. I support the \nunderlying bill because I fully appreciate the need to resolve the \ncontroversy between the United States and the European Union over the \nextraterritorial income--ETI--exemption tax benefit for exports. As my \ncolleagues know, the World Trade Organization--WTO--has ruled that ETI \nis essentially an export subsidy and is prohibited under international \ntrade agreements. Subsequently, on March 1, the EU began to impose \nretaliatory tariffs on imports from United States manufacturers. \nTherefore, it is critical that we pass this legislation to bring the \nUnited States back into compliance with WTO agreements and stop the \nburdensome tariffs now imposed on our manufacturers.\n  It is unfortunate that this important bill is becoming a vehicle for \nwasteful spending and tax breaks for special interests and the super \nrich. With the Nation facing a half-trillion dollar deficit, now is not \nthe time for Congress to be enacting new tax credits. The proponents of \nthis bill are fond of pointing out that it is ``revenue neutral'' and \nthat all of the tax cuts in the bill are paid for with offsets. I \nfirmly believe that, due to our current fiscal crisis, any proposed \noffsets should simply be used to reduce the deficit. It is \nincomprehensible to me, at this time of record deficits and debt, that \nwe would consider risking the future of our manufacturing base and our \nstanding in the international community by wasting time and \njeopardizing corrective action while carving out sweet deals for \nspecial interests.\n  Let me outline just a few of the most egregious provisions contained \nin the proposal before us today:\n  The bill includes an extension of the tax credit for the creation of \nelectricity from ``renewable resources.'' This provision would extend \nfor a year the tax credit for facilities that produce electricity from \nwind, poultry waste or closed-loop biomass. While I know wind is the \nfavored renewable technology and various tax credits have made it \ncompetitive with conventional energy production in some locations, \nrenewable solar technology has greater potential in my State and does \nnot receive this favored tax status to make it more affordable. Turning \npoultry waste into electricity may be an efficient way to generate \nelectricity at particular facilities, but again, with our fiscal future \nso bleak, I cannot understand the urgency in extending such a \nquestionable tax credit at the expense of the American taxpayers.\n  Another provision would allow for a ``bonus depreciation'' of an \nadditional 50 percent for noncommercial aircraft in the first year of \nownership. In order to qualify for this incentive, the aircraft must be \npurchased and placed in service before January 1, 2005. I assure my \ncolleagues--we will see many of America's wealthiest citizens running \noff to buy new private airplanes--while the American taxpayer \neffectively foots half the bill.\n  Included in the manager's amendment to this bill is $1 billion in tax \ncredits for railroads--a 4-year $500 million subsidy for shortline and \nregional railroads, and a 3-year, $500 million subsidy for intercity \npassenger rail service.\n  The proposed tax credit for small freight railroads makes all \nmaintenance eligible for a tax credit, whether or not the maintenance \nis a capital project under generally accepted accounting principles. It \nis totally inappropriate to provide a tax credit for routine \nmaintenance items like snow removal and routine equipment servicing, \nwhich do nothing to enhance the value or life of railroad assets. Nor \ndoes it make sense to provide a tax credit for maintenance that the \nrailroads will perform anyway, without\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nthe tax credit. The purpose of a tax credit is to provide an incentive \nto perform capital projects that a company would not otherwise \nundertake.\n  Further, the shortlines intend to sell tax credits they cannot use to \ntheir shippers and suppliers. There is no requirement, however, that \nthe shortlines use the proceeds to fund additional capital investments. \nThe proceeds from selling tax credits could be used for anything--\nprofit-sharing for the owners, a vacation to the Bahamas, or even to \nfund lobbyists on Capitol Hill.\n  The Department of the Treasury, in preliminary, informal comments on \nthis proposal, has indicated that the tax credit for intercity \npassenger rail projects would be quote ``problematic''. Business \ncredits are typically in the 10- to 20-percent range, far less than the \n50 percent credit proposed by the substitute. Treasury also commented \nthat:\n\n       It provides for a national cap and allocation among states \n     but has no provision for allocation within states. Also, it \n     is transferable and we generally oppose transferable tax \n     benefits because they are difficult to administer.\n\n  This proposal also is another scheme to provide money to expand \nintercity passenger rail service without dealing with the failure of \nAmtrak. I oppose providing any funding above the President's request of \n$900 million for fiscal year 2005 without Amtrak reform and \nrestructuring. The American taxpayers have invested nearly $27 billion \nin Amtrak over the past 34 years, yet Amtrak still carries less than 1 \npercent of intercity travelers. Every 2 days, our transit system \ncarries as many passengers as Amtrak handles in a year. How can my \ncolleagues seriously consider expanding Amtrak, when it carries so few \npassengers and still manages to lose over $1 billion annually?\n  Additionally, Section 646 of this bill would amend the Internal \nRevenue Code to permit a taxpayer who owns and operates a shipyard to \nelect to use the completed contract accounting method with respect to a \nqualified construction contract. This means that large shipyards, owned \nby even larger defense contractors, would be allowed to defer paying \ntaxes on U.S. Navy ship construction contracts until the ship is \ncompleted. In some cases this could be as long as 7 years. This benefit \nresults in these contractors getting an interest-free loan from the \nAmerican taxpayer. These shipyards should pay taxes on an annual basis \non income earned that year.\n  Some of the more interesting--and indefensible--proposals in the \nmanagers' amendment include capital gains relief for horse owners, \nspecial tax breaks for car dealers and favorable treatment of track \nfacilities.\n  Again, I will vote for cloture because passage of this legislation is \nimperative, not only to our reputation in the world community, but also \nto the continued health of the American manufacturing industry and to \nthe creation of desperately-needed new jobs. However, I continue to be \namazed about this body's lack of fiscal discipline. We are setting \nourselves up for a very rude awakening. We simply cannot continue this \nendless wasteful spending spree while carving out tax breaks and good \ndeals for the special interests. It's about time we realize that our \nactions have consequences. Unfortunately, it will most likely be our \nchildren and our grandchildren who will have to deal with those \nconsequences.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier today in my floor speech \nconcerning the products on the European Union sanction list, I offered \nto put this sanction list in the Congressional Record. However, the \ncomplete list is over 300 pages and would be too costly to reproduce \nfully. Nevertheless, the complete list and description can be found on \nthe Senate Finance Com-\nmittee's website, at www.finance.senate.gov.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use a couple of minutes we have \nallocated to our side simply to say I agree with the last statement \nmade by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky: The time to act is \nnow. He and I may be talking about two different things.\n  I share with him the view we ought to act on this legislation, but I \nalso believe strongly now is the time to act with regard to the Labor \nDepartment regulations. If we do not act, 8 million people, including \npolice officers, firefighters, service providers in a lot of different \nways will lose their overtime.\n  I do not know how we can sit here and accept that fact. Why some on \nthe other side of the aisle would put the loss of overtime ahead of \nthis legislation is something I do not understand. But I must say, \nthere is no more important protection we can make than to allow the \nopportunity for the Senate, once again, to do what it did on an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan basis just last year. The Senate said \nunequivocally we want to repeal the overtime regulations; we do not \nthink they are fair. Telling 8 million Americans they are going to lose \ntheir overtime is not right.\n  All we are suggesting today is to give us a vote because in the dark \nof night, even though both Houses have acted and spoken out, that \nlegislation was taken out of the conference report. We have to go back \nand repair what was done last year. That is all we are asking. We are \nasking for one vote, no time.\n  Don't tell me we cannot act on that now. That is what this cloture \nvote is all about. I am hopeful on a bipartisan basis we can defeat \ncloture, get the vote on the amendment, and move this legislation \nthrough in time to do both things: provide the protection for overtime \nand pass this legislation as we know we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \ngiving me this time. I thank the leader for his comments and those who \nhave fought so valiantly on behalf of American workers and their jobs.\n  A Senator on the other side said this is about creating jobs or \nlosing jobs. That is what overtime is about. It is about creating jobs \nor losing jobs, and it does not take a genius to figure it out. Common \nsense dictates if an employer can work you longer hours per week and \nnot have to pay you overtime, that is exactly what they will do, and \nthey will not hire new workers.\n  In fact, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938, \nestablishing the 40-hour workweek, President Roosevelt said at the time \nthis was for creating jobs so people would not be working 50, 60 hours \na week; they would be working 40 hours a week and spending more time \nwith their families, and we would create more jobs. That is exactly \nwhat happened.\n  I agree with the Senator on the other side when he said this bill is \nabout creating jobs and losing jobs and, yes, that is exactly what this \namendment on overtime is about--creating jobs or losing jobs.\n  Last evening, the majority leader complained about extraneous \namendments blocking progress on the bill. I don't know, but I assume he \nmay have been talking about my amendment on overtime. He did not say so \ndirectly. But how can any Senator stand here on the floor and say with \na straight face an amendment aimed at protecting overtime pay for \nmillions of American workers is extraneous to a jobs bill?\n  Then I heard someone else on the other side say something about we \nhave to have cloture. That is the vote coming up in about 10 minutes. \nWe have to have cloture so we do not have these nongermane amendments \non this bill.\n  The chairman of the committee and others have already added a whole \npackage of nongermane amendments. So I guess what they are saying is we \nwant to add our nongermane amendments but they do not want us to even \nattempt to add any of our nongermane amendments. It is sort of, my way \nor the highway. Well, that is not what this Senate floor is about. The \nSenate floor ought to be about open debate, discussion, and voting on \nimportant issues that matter to our constituents.\n  Right now there is nothing more important in front of the Senate than \nthe issue of overtime. There is a lot of good in this FSC bill, much of \nwhich I will support. I would like to see the bill get through. But \nthis bill, without a protection for American workers to protect their \novertime, is not a bill worthy of passing, nor is it worthy of being \ncalled a jobs bill.\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\n  People say we are slowing this down somehow, that we are making it \nimpossible to pass this bill. I have been on this floor day after day \nsaying I will agree to a time limit. I say to my friend and colleague \nfrom Iowa, if he wants a time limit, we will have a time limit and then \nwe will have an up-or-down vote. Plus, there are other amendments \npeople want to offer. That is, again, why the other side wants cloture. \nThey have their package of nongermane amendments but they do not want \nus to offer any.\n  I do not know if they will win but at least we ought to have the \nright to offer them and to have a vote on them. All we are asking for \nis fairness and openness on the Senate floor. I know that may sound \nkind of odd to people but all we are asking is just the right to offer \nan amendment, have it debated within a reasonable amount of time, and \nhave a vote. I do not think that sounds too un-American to me.\n  Yet the other side, the Republican side, is saying they do not want \nto vote on my overtime amendment. They are going to go through all of \nthese parliamentary maneuvers. But we will vote on this amendment. All \nof this parliamentary maneuvering that we are going through right now \non the motion to recommit and filing cloture just puts off the \ninevitable. If the other side was really interested in getting this \nbill through, we could have had a vote on my amendment 2 days--well, at \nleast yesterday, and been halfway through the bill, probably have the \nbill done today or tomorrow. So it is not our side that is slowing this \nbill down at all.\n  As I have said before, our friends in the majority leadership have \ntried to stymie and stop a vote on overtime. We voted on it last \nsummer, with a strong bipartisan vote, to say no to the proposed \nregulations of this administration to take away overtime rights of \npeople. The House of Representatives followed suit, but in conference \nthe administration came in and got it taken out.\n  The American people spoke, and I can say with no uncertainty that the \nvast majority of American people want their overtime pay protected. In \nfact, a poll taken last fall, when this question was put to a \nrepresentative sample of the American people, overwhelmingly showed \nthey wanted their overtime pay protected. This goes back to a kind of \ntaking of the right of people to earn a fair wage, a fair salary.\n  This is from the Wall Street Journal, and this says it all:\n\n       While employees like overtime pay, a lot of employers do \n     not.\n\n  That is not surprising.\n\n       Violations are so common that the Employer Policy \n     Foundation, an employer supported think-tank in Washington, \n     estimates that workers would get an additional $19 billion a \n     year if the rules were observed. That estimate is considered \n     conservative by many researchers.\n\n  Think about that. Because the rules are not being enforced, American \nworkers are being cheated out of $19 billion a year in income. What has \nhappened is employers in various parts of the country are trying to go \naround these rules and some of them have gotten caught redhanded.\n  We had a case on the west coast where people were clocking out and \nthen coming back to work, working overtime but it was not showing up on \nthe pay stubs. That case went to court and the jury found the company \nguilty. So what did the companies do? They said, well, if we are \ngetting caught and hauled into court, we better get the rules changed.\n  Last year, the administration proposed the most fundamental sweeping \nchanges ever in the Fair Labor Standards Act that would deny the right \nof up to 8 million Americans to get overtime pay. So now they can go \nahead and work them longer than 40 hours a week and they will not have \nto be worried about being taken to court. That is the core of what we \nare talking about.\n  Quite frankly, there was a case in Oregon where a Federal jury, on \nDecember 19, found Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., guilty of off-the-clock \nviolations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. It was Wal-Mart--people \nchecking out, coming back to work and not getting paid overtime. That \nis not fair. It is not right to the American worker, and that is why \nthe American people, by an overwhelming margin, want us to vote on this \namendment.\n  Here was the poll taken last fall. The question was:\n\n       There is now a proposal to change the Federal law that \n     determines which employees have the legal right to overtime \n     pay. This proposal would eliminate the right to overtime pay \n     for several million employees who now have that right. Do you \n     favor or oppose this proposal?\n\n  I am sure it comes as no surprise; overwhelmingly 74 percent said \nthey opposed it, while 14 percent said they would favor it.\n  This goes to the gut of what we are talking about for the American \nworker in this country. We are already shipping jobs overseas. There is \na small provision in this bill before us, subpart F--I will not get \ninto all of that--that will actually make it easier for companies to \nship jobs overseas. Now we are telling our American workers they have \nto work longer and not get any pay for it.\n  Already American workers are working longer hours than anyone else in \nthe industrialized world and now we are asking them to work even \nlonger.\n  The motion before us is a cloture motion. I say to my fellow \nSenators, defeat the cloture motion, because if the cloture motion is \ninvoked, we will be prohibited from offering our amendment on overtime. \nThat is not fair. That is not right.\n  Two weeks ago we had a unanimous consent agreement on the Senate \nfloor that I would be allowed to offer this amendment. They knew that. \nBut after a week's break, we came back and they decided to go through \nall of this parliamentary maneuvering to prevent me from offering \nmy amendment and to prevent us from having a vote on it.\n\n  I ask my fellow Senators to think of their constituents, think of \nthat man and woman out there who have a family, they want to be with \ntheir kids in the evenings or on the weekend, and they are being asked \nto work overtime. As one woman, who I quoted yesterday, said: My time \nwith my family is premium time. My time at home is premium time. If I \nam asked to give up my premium time with my family, I ought to get \npremium time, which is time and a half over 40.\n  So when my colleagues think about voting on this cloture motion, do \nnot think about the President of the United States, do not think about \nwhether we can go against the administration. I do not see it in those \nterms. I only see it in the terms protecting the legitimate right of \nour American workers to get time and a half when they work over 40 \nhours a week. That is what this is all about, make no mistake.\n  I am hopeful when Senators come to vote that we will have a \nresounding ``no'' vote on the cloture motion. Then maybe we can get to \nthis amendment and we can have a time agreement. We have already talked \nabout it enough. We could have half an hour for closing arguments and \nthen vote up or down on this overtime amendment.\n  I think the other side may be afraid it might pass. Well, it passed \nlast year. I think it would probably pass big time now because more and \nmore American people are aware of what the administration is trying to \ndo to take away their overtime.\n  I think we have had our say. The American people are going to watch. \nPeople in the United States are working longer hours than their \ncounterparts in any other country. They are working longer hours now \nthan ever and they are now being told, well, guess what, we are going \nto work you longer but we are not going to pay you any more.\n  Last, the people who will be hurt the most will be women. Annual \nhours worked by middle-income wives with children went from 895 in 1979 \nto 1,388 in 2000. Women with these kinds of jobs are the ones who will \nbe hit first because they have the type of clerical jobs that will be \nreclassified. They are the very people who are being asked to give up \ntheir premium time with their kids and their families--their second \njobs at home. As one woman said: I have a second job, at home.\n  They will not be paid overtime. That is grossly unfair.\n  I ask for a resounding ``no'' vote on the cloture motion.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to correct the record with \nrespect to some comments made by my friend and colleague, Senator \nHarkin.\n  Senator Harkin said that the managers' package was non-germane\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\namendments. All of the amendments were tax relief measures that were \nrequested by Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  The bill before us is a tax relief bill. It deals with a tax \nincentive designed to help our exporters. This bill deals with tax \nrelief for domestic manufacturers and international tax reform.\n  The sum and substance of this bill is about tax relief. The managers' \npackage is about bipartisan tax relief. It is germane to this bill.\n  The amendment of my friend from Iowa is a labor law matter. It is not \nin the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know we will be starting to vote shortly, \nbut I did want to make a few comments on behalf of myself and \nleadership because today we do have a chance to help U.S. \nmanufacturers. The legislation was developed in an admirable, \nbipartisan way, with the two managers participating equally. Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus have worked very closely to develop \nthis bill. I spent time with both of them yesterday, and the leadership \non the other side of the aisle. We are working very hard. I would have \nliked not to have to have this cloture vote today, but it is clear it \nis the only way to get people moving along in a direction so we can \nwork toward completion.\n  This bill came out of the Finance Committee 19 to 2. It was \ncosponsored by the distinguished minority leader. It is a good bill. \nEvery day we delay action has implications. European tariffs have \nalready been imposed. In truth, these European tariffs are a European \ntax on U.S. manufacturers. The Europeans could be imposing right now a \nfull $4 billion in sanctions that they have approved. So far they have \nnot done so. They have chosen to begin with a 5-percent tariff which \nincreases 1 percent each month. They have acted with restraint because \nthey believed we would act quickly and that we would act responsibly. I \nbelieve this vote, indeed, will be a test of that faith.\n  As has been discussed, we compete in a global economy. Some have \nsuggested that we close our borders to the world. Some think we can \nretreat into economic isolationism. But we can't. We all, deep inside, \nknow that. We should not. It would be a declaration of defeat. We are \nthe most innovative society in the world. Our workers lead in \nproductivity. We lead the world. If we are allowed to compete on a fair \nplaying field, U.S. manufacturers will, indeed, lead the world.\n  I think back to my home State of Tennessee. We compete well in the \nworld economy. Exports increased 26 percent since 1997. Those exports \nsupport 232,000 jobs in Tennessee, and that is about 10 percent of the \nTennessee workforce.\n  We all know--again, this has been discussed over the last several \ndays--U.S. manufacturers are increasingly burdened by unnecessary \ncosts. A study by the National Association of Manufacturers on the \neffect of rising costs to the United States found that the costs \nimposed by Government have done the most damage to our U.S. \nmanufacturing base. That study concluded that, while U.S. manufacturers \nhave many challenges in today's global business environment, \ndomestically imposed Government costs are damaging U.S. manufacturers \nand harming workers more than any foreign competitor.\n  So now, when we can least afford it, we have this new Euro tax on \nU.S. manufacturers. Survey after survey of U.S. businesses confirms the \nsame thing: The incentive to move jobs overseas is the direct result of \nthe escalating cost of doing business right here at home. If we want to \nreverse the trend toward outsourcing, we have to address the issues \nthat are motivating American companies to go offshore.\n  Like all of my other colleagues, I know this is an election year. \nLike everyone else in this Chamber and most within the sound of my \nvoice, I know in an election year there is this temptation to view \neverything through a political lens. There is a time and a place for \npolitics. This is simply not that time and not that place. I urge my \ncolleagues to come together and to do the right thing for American \nmanufacturers, for American jobs, and for the American spirit. Every \none of us should vote for cloture and be proud of that vote to repeal \nthis Euro tax. We must move forward quickly on this critical \nlegislation. We cannot afford to wait and risk having the world pass us \nby.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture on the pending motion to Calendar \nNo. 381, S. 1637.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     motion to recommit to the Committee on Finance, Calendar No. \n     381, S. 1637:\n         Bill Frist, Charles E.

By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nhas been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to recommit S. 1637, Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act, \nshall be brought to a close.\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 60 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are \n47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote \nby which cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will have more to say later, but I do \nwant to express my disappointment by the vote today, especially the \nactions of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This \nlegislation is essential if we are to accelerate the rate of job \ncreation. The JOBS bill will bring our trade and tax laws into \ncompliance with our trade agreements. It will also provide badly needed \nreforms to further stimulate manufacturing growth.\n  As I mentioned prior to the vote, the bill was developed in a strong \nbipartisan fashion under the superb leadership of Chairman Grassley and \nSenator Baucus. It was voted out of the Finance Committee 19 to 2. \nEvery single Democrat on the committee voted in favor of the bill. That \nis why I am very concerned that the Democrats have now decided to \nfilibuster yet another bill for what may be election\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nyear partisan purposes. It is a terrible mistake and one that will have \na detrimental impact on the recovery of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Every \nday we delay action on this bill is another day American jobs are at \nrisk, and every day of delay is inexcusable.\n  As I mentioned, the European tariffs have already been imposed. The \ntariffs, in effect, are a European tax on U.S. manufacturers. By voting \nagainst cloture, our Democratic colleagues have voted, in effect, in \nsupport of the Euro tax on U.S. manufacturing. I had hoped our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would have been able to find \nthe wherewithal to do the right thing. The Senate would pass this \nlegislation by a wide margin if we could get through this election year \nposturing.\n  I look forward to working with the leadership on this particular bill \nto see exactly where we should go from here and plan on doing that over \nthe next couple of hours as we go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we agree with the majority leader that \nthis is an important piece of legislation. Cloture was not invoked on \nit. It came out of committee in a bipartisan fashion. However, the \nSenate has been this way for more than 200 years. People have the right \nto offer amendments.\n  There was an extremely important amendment dealing with overtime. \nSenator Harkin agreed to take 15 minutes and vote on it. If there is \nanything to be said about bringing down the bill, it is not us. We want \nthe bill to pass. We also want a vote to recognize the plight of 8 \nmillion Americans, men and women who are in the process of being denied \novertime, something they have had for more than a half century.\n  So we can give all the speeches we want about political posturing. \nThe fact is, the majority didn't want to vote on overtime. We voted on \nit before; the amendment carried then. The House instructed its \nconferees that they wanted the Senate's position. So it is a simple \nmatter where we have now wasted 2 days, and this is the third day. We \ncould have been covering the few amendments Senator Baucus has lined \nup. He has pared it down from 75 amendments to probably 10. On every \none of those, there would be short time agreements.\n  This bill could be finished. I think it is a sad day for the country \nthat we have not been able to move forward on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I reinforce the words of Senator Reid. \nWe want this bill passed. This is a jobs bill. This bill provides a tax \nbreak for the domestic manufacturing industry. An overwhelming majority \nof Senators on both sides support this bill.\n  Actually, this bill is being held up at this point because the other \nside of the aisle doesn't want to vote on the Harkin amendment. That \namendment is a very simple amendment. It is to maintain a current \novertime provision, which clearly is related to jobs in America. \nSenator Harkin will agree to a time agreement.\n  At the same time, Senator Grassley and I have worked with other \nSenators to bring the list down to a manageable number. I have talked \nto Senators during the vote and we have all agreed to time limitations \non their amendments.\n  I call upon the majority to let us proceed with the bill, with a vote \non the Harkin amendment, and let us proceed with votes on the \nlegitimate amendments we have pared it down to, which is very \nmanageable. We can proceed. That is what is happening.\n  Our side would like to continue to work on the bill and get votes on \nimportant amendments. I hope the other side agrees to let us vote on \nthat amendment. I think we can get the bill passed this week. We can \nshow the European Union we are taking action on the WTO ruling. Also, \nwe can show the other body we are moving quickly. The other body is not \nmoving as fast as I believe it should be.\n  For those reasons, I urge us to reach an agreement and let's get on \nwith the usual way the Senate operates--with amendments we can deal \nwith very expeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I know the Senator from Wyoming wants \nto speak. I will not give a long speech at this point on the vote that \njust occurred. I wish to take a second to respond to the partisanship \naspect of this debate. I cannot speak for anybody but this Senator.\n  It would be one thing if the overtime amendment were the only one \nthat we had to deal with, but we have seen lists, I think, of up to \nmaybe 10 nongermane amendments that may have been potentially part of \nthis debate. So you can understand, there may be 10 legitimate issues \nthat are nongermane to this debate which ought to be discussed on the \nSenate floor, as per the right of every Senator, as expressed by the \nSenator from Nevada; but they don't all have to be discussed on this \nvery important bill before the Senate.\n  This is a very important bipartisan bill before the Senate. It is one \nthing to deal with an overtime amendment; it is quite another thing to \ndeal with an environment in which the minority may be expecting us to \ndeal with vast numbers of nongermane amendments. That is very difficult \nand it is that sort of environment which brings about a cloture vote.\n  As my friend from Montana has stated, I hope we do get this behind \nus. The germane amendments will take very little time and we can then \nmove past this bill. This bill will pass overwhelmingly when we get it \nup for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I was going to speak on something else \nrelated to the bill, but I feel compelled to speak a little bit about \nthe cloture vote and the smokescreen that is being put up there.\n  We have American manufacturing businesses being penalized by the \nWorld Trade Organization, and the bill before us would eliminate that. \nIt would solve the problem and would create jobs in America, not \noutsourced, and it would allow the companies to have the competitive \npossibility in other countries. We are not able to pass that bill.\n  So when people talk about jobs, they need to be clear that those who \nare putting up the smokescreen amendments are not really interested in \nincreasing jobs. They would prefer that none of that happened until \nafter November. I think the American people will see through that and \nthey will see through all of the motions and amendments that will be \ndone between now and November and all of the delays done between now \nand November.\n  The overtime bill is one of those smokescreens. What we are talking \nabout is a rule that has been written and published for public comment. \nIt is not in place; it is not finalized; it is not finished. It is for \ncomment, and 80,000 people commented on it.\n  What this amendment does is stop them from looking at the public \ncomments. That is not American. We want the public to be able to \ncomment. We want the comments from the public on any rule we are \nwriting. We want the Department to have to take a look at those \ncomments, and then we want to see what they are going to do with the \ncomments. That is when the rule becomes important.\n\n  I can tell you, any Department that has made substantial changes \nbased on the comments, I have applauded the Department and I have asked \nthem to republish it for more comments, because it is a different rule \nafter it has been changed. I am certain I would be doing that on this \none as well. But there is a process.\n  The reason the Department of Labor looked at the rule is because they \nwere told they had to look at the rule. They were doing their job. They \nwrote a rule, published the rule. Everybody doesn't agree with the \nrule. I expect any rule that is done, everybody would not agree with \nit. If they did, it would probably have some pretty big flaws in it or \nbe worthless. So there are going to be some comments and changes. We \nneed to let those happen.\n  We will never have a rule that is clear so that small business can \noperate, so that they can understand what is going on. That rule was \nwritten so long ago that jobs mentioned in there don't even exist \nanymore. But they still have to evaluate the jobs and see if they match \nup with that kind of description, to see if it falls under overtime.\n  What it has turned into is a bonanza for lawyers who want to sue. \nAnytime\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\nthey think there is one of those little gray areas, they see dollar \nsigns and they go after the business that has those gray areas.\n  You would also get the impression from the overtime discussion that \nno business pays overtime unless it is clearly required to pay. That is \nnot the fact, either.\n  You would also get the impression that businesses force people to do \nthis overtime all the time. I have a son in the housing business and \nthis is a good time of year to sell houses. They give all kinds of \nincentives to try to get the houses finished up. There is not only \novertime but bonuses, and people still don't want to do overtime. So \nthere has been a lot of rhetoric on this, and I will go through that \none point at a time. If we are going to actually get to that debate, I \nwould be happy to do that.\n  But the reason this cloture vote was killed was so it would still \nstay a part of the debate. Now, why would it not be a part of the \ndebate? Because it is not germane. We are not talking about overtime in \nthis bill. The word ``overtime'' isn't mentioned in the bill at all. It \nis about penalties that our companies have to pay because of the World \nTrade Organization decision. We need to solve that problem and make \nsure America keeps working. Yes, we need to work on these other \nproblems; yes, they ought to be brought up. But we should not do it at \nthe expense of industry in America and then say, oh, you are \noutsourcing. We are forcing companies to go overseas and build things; \nwe are forcing them to do that because we don't want to make a decision \non this bill because we want to bring in peripheral items.\n  Yes, it sounds like just one peripheral item. No, it is not; it is ad \ninfinitum. You can keep drafting these amendments until the final vote. \nWe have to vote on all of them until the final vote. So it is a \nfilibuster by amendment. If you can make an amendment that is as \nunpleasant as possible, politically, I guess that is good.\n\n  What I prefer we do is work on the 80 percent of the legislation that \nwe agree on, get it done, and keep America working, which brings me to \nthe main point I wanted to talk about because we keep talking about \nthis loss of American jobs due to increasing globalization.\n  We have talked about the loss of American jobs because of increasing \nproductivity. Yes, the workers in the United States are the best at \nwhat they do. I have heard a lot of talk about job loss, but our \nactions do not match up with our words.\n  I want to point out one very important program we have that helps \nAmerican workers who want to improve their skills and get a better job, \nto make a better life for themselves and their families. It is called \nthe Workforce Investment Act. That act has been around. This is a \nreauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act, bringing it up to date \nso that it matches the job problems of the country at the present time.\n  This workforce investment legislation will help over 900,000 \nunemployed workers a year get back to work. We keep talking about \nworkers, but we cannot get this important bill into conference. The \nother side of the aisle blocks appointing conferees so that Republicans \nand Democrats--House and Senate--can get it all together so we can come \nup with an agreement.\n  Should this be a tougher agreement? This bill passed the committee \nunanimously. It does not happen very often in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. It also passed the Senate unanimously. \nThat means we thought it was good enough that we did not need to put a \nsingle amendment on it. We are talking about 900,000 jobs, and we \ncannot meet to work out the differences with the House when this \nlegislation passes a unified Senate.\n  For generations, the skills and ingenuity of the American workforce \nhave fueled the greatest economy in the world. Today our challenge is \nto equip our workforce with the skills needed for jobs in the new \nglobal economy. Our prosperity rests with our ability to create and \nfill the high-skilled jobs of the 21st century, filling those 21st \ncentury economy demands.\n  There is a growing skills gap in this country that threatens our \nability to compete and succeed in a more complex, knowledge-based \neconomy. Many high-skilled jobs in this country remain unfilled because \nemployers cannot find qualified workers. According to the 2003 survey \nconducted by the Center for Workforce Preparation, which is an \naffiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, half of the employers \nreported difficulty in finding qualified workers. The gap between the \ndemand for high-skilled workers and the supply will only widen in the \nfuture unless we do something about it.\n  Looking ahead 2 years, only 30 percent of the employers surveyed \nbelieved that the skills of their workforce will keep pace with the \ndemand. The current workforce development system is not effectively \nequipping American workers with the skills American businesses need. We \nneed to match them up. Only a systematic reform of our Nation's job \ntraining system will enable American workers and businesses to compete \nand succeed in this global economy.\n  Our job training and employment system created under the Workforce \nInvestment Act is intended to prepare our workforce for the good jobs \nthat the evolving economy demands.\n  We need to improve our job training and employment system created \nunder the Workforce Investment Act to better prepare American workers \nfor the good jobs of today and tomorrow.\n  We need to link workforce development with economic development, \nrecognizing that job training and job creation go hand in hand.\n  We need to partner the public workforce system with private sector \nemployers, including, especially, small businesses, and with training \nproviders to prepare American workers for jobs in high-growth \nindustries.\n  We must improve access to job training and employment services in all \nparts of the country.\n  There is good news. As I have mentioned, we have a bill that does all \nof that. It is called the Workforce Investment Act Amendments of 2003. \nIt is a bipartisan bill that passed out of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee unanimously. Check the record. See how \noften that happens. It passed unanimously last November. Unanimous is \nas bipartisan as you can get. It passed the Senate unanimously as well. \nAgain, that is as bipartisan as you can get.\n  Where is that bill now? As I have mentioned--here is the bad news--we \ncannot appoint a conference committee; that is, a committee made up of \nRepublicans and Democrats from the Senate and we would meet with the \nHouse and we would work out the differences. If we can work out the \ndifferences in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nand if we can work out the differences on the floor of the Senate, we \ncertainly ought to be able to work them out between the Senate and the \nHouse. There is no reason not to have a conference committee except, in \ncase you haven't noticed, we are not doing any conference committees. \nThey said: We are not going to conference on anything, unless that side \nof the aisle gets to write the bill. It has never happened in the \nhistory of the United States. It is not going to happen now.\n  If we really want to take care of jobs in this country and make sure \njobs stay in this country, we would appoint a conference committee for \nthe Workforce Investment Act and enact this vital legislation.\n  How long do we want to wait to get those 900,000 people trained and \ninto the workforce? Obviously, after the November elections. If we \nreally want to keep high-paying jobs and American factories and \nAmerican businesses on American shores, particularly in small \nbusinesses, we would appoint the conferees to that legislation \nreauthorizing and improving the Workforce Investment Act. We would \nmodernize that legislation, get it on the road, and get people \nemployed.\n  I think it is a crime that we cannot appoint a conference committee. \nAmerican workers deserve a conference committee on workforce \ninvestment. They should be demanding it, and we should be doing it \nbecause it is doable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nhis excellent comments as usual. He is a senior member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He is a small businessman and\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nhas a talent, more than most people in this body, of understanding how \nthis economy works and what we need to do to create more jobs.\n  I think the job situation has shown some real improvement. We were at \n6.3-percent unemployment last June. It has dropped consistently, and we \nare now at 5.6-percent unemployment. The numbers show that is about the \naverage rate of unemployment over the last 20 years.\n  Growth in the third quarter of last year was over 8 percent, the \nhighest growth of GDP in 20 years, and the first time jobless claims \nhave dropped to the lowest since 2001; that is, people who file for \nunemployment compensation. That is a good hard number that tells us \nsomething about the economy. Every day people who lose jobs in this \nvolatile economy can claim their unemployment compensation. Those \nclaims are dropping and continue to drop, and jobs have been added for \nthe last 6 months, consecutively.\n  So this is some good news, but we are not satisfied. We would like to \nsee record lows of unemployment. We would like to see the economy \ngrowing at such a rate that people will have choices among higher \npaying jobs, they can make more money, have an opportunity to work \novertime if they choose, bank that money, make bonuses, and have good \nhealth care.\n  So what is it that is occurring? This jumpstart bill dealing with the \nFSC/ETI program that has us in a confrontation with Europe is not going \nto go away. I was confident everybody in this body understood the WTO \nruling and how it could adversely affect jobs in America and that we \nneed to pass some legislation to fix it and get on with life.\n  The committees worked on it, the House and the Senate worked on it, \nand they came up with this jumpstart bill and now we find it blocked. \nWe cannot get it up for an up-or-down vote. It was blocked by \nfilibuster, led by Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader. If they do \nnot filibuster the bill, they filibuster going to conference, which \nalso in effect kills legislation. So we have obstruction, obstruction, \nobstruction.\n  This is not good. We should do this bill. If we cannot agree on this \nbill, it is going to be part of the partisan obstruction agenda, then \nwe really have to go to the American people and we need to talk to them \nabout what is happening in their Senate. We need to ask the American \npeople, when they are selecting Senators to come to this body--and they \nwill be doing that soon--do they want Senators who are going to \nparticipate in obstructing needed legislation that is important for \njobs? Maybe we are not at that point.\n  Maybe this Senate can get itself back together, but the trends are \nreally disturbing to me. The trends indicate a concerted effort to \nblock, through one method or another, important legislation that is \ngood for this country.\n  There was a lot of effort on the asbestos legislation we passed out \nof the Judiciary Committee. Senator Hatch, the chairman of the \ncommittee, put his heart into it. It was a bipartisan vote to come out \nof committee. It is being blocked. As many as 60 asbestos companies are \nin bankruptcy or on the verge of bankruptcy. The unions at those \ncompanies are beginning to realize the litigation over asbestos is \nkilling off our industry, which represents thousands and thousands of \njobs. We need to move that to final passage, but it looks like it is \ngoing to be blocked, too, perhaps. I hope not.\n  Something is wrong in the American legal system when defendant \ncompanies are willing to pay out billions of dollars in benefits to \npeople who have ingested asbestos and only 40 percent of what they pay \nout gets to the victims. Sixty percent of it goes to lawyers. Sixty \npercent of it is eaten up in court costs and expenses.\n  This bill would fix that. Most people could simply make a claim and \nget a check if they are entitled to it, just like that. People who are \nnot sick do not get paid until they do get sick, if they do. They will \nbe monitored, be given health monitoring and all that makes for a good \nand rational way to compensate people who may become ill from asbestos. \nAs many as 60 companies could be in trouble that could actually go \nbankrupt.\n  Is this going to create jobs in America to allow that to occur? We \nreached an agreement that had bipartisan support in the Judiciary \nCommittee that could make this happen. It will get more money to the \npeople who are sick. They will not have to pay 60 percent of it in \nlegal fees, and other costs will not come out of it. That is what we \nought to be doing to create jobs.\n\n  A lot of these companies dealt with asbestos 20 years ago and have \nnot dealt with it since. Yet their whole company is being put into \nbankruptcy because of it. It is one more example of what we need to do.\n  Class action suits are a part of our noncompetitiveness in the world. \nThere are such high insurance costs so many of our companies are paying \nbecause of litigation. It is unprecedented. We have that in medical \nliability, which is driving up the costs of medicine in America.\n  We can do those things that do not cost the taxpayer a dime. We can \ncreate a fairer, more rational system of law in the country, reduce the \ncosts of the American economy so more money can go to jobs.\n  I know the President deeply believed in and supported the production \nof oil and gas in ANWR. I have heard people complain recently they are \nupset that the price of gasoline has gone up. They have said, oh, they \nare so surprised and hurt, and it must be President Bush's fault.\n  For years in this body we have been debating the production of this \nhuge amount of oil and gas from the ANWR region of Alaska. It can be \ndone scientifically. It can be done without damage to the environment. \nIt can produce billions of dollars in oil and gas, keeping that money \nhere. If I recall the numbers, it was 600,000 jobs that might be \ncreated by that pipeline and that production. That is what the unions \nwho supported this told us, 600,000 jobs, keeping American money at \nhome.\n  Who do we want to pay for oil and gas, the people in Alaska and keep \nit in the United States, or do we want to send the money to Saudi \nArabia, Venezuela, or some other foreign country? We can do that. We \nare driving up the cost of energy as a result of unwise practices. In \nfact, I think the failure to drill in ANWR is one of the most absurd \ndecisions this Congress has ever made. Frankly, we need to produce more \nnatural gas off the coasts. If we do not, we are going to see a surge \nin natural gas prices that is also going to cost us jobs in the long \nrun.\n  We can do that. We can do it safely, just as we are doing it safely \ntoday. Twenty percent of our electricity comes from nuclear power, yet \nwe have had in this body, from Members on the left, a blocking of \nefforts to allow nuclear power to expand. Twenty-four hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, nuclear power generates electricity with no carbon \nemissions into the environment, no pollution into the air. We ought to \ndo that. France is going that way. Japan is going that way. We are \nsitting around shutting off natural gas production, attacking coal \ngeneration of power, not allowing production in ANWR and off our \ncoasts.\n  We are doing all that and then we moan and groan when the economy has \nto sustain a higher cost for energy. I think it is not good. The \nAmerican people need to ask, who is at fault here? Who is blocking \nthis?\n  We are in an unprecedented period of obstruction, it seems to me. I \nhave never seen anything like it. I thought we could at least pass this \njumpstart bill to deal with our world trade problem. Surely we can \nagree on that. If we cannot agree on that, it indicates to me there is \na systematic period of obstruction going on in this body, and it is not \nhealthy for America. It is going to cost American jobs. It is \nirresponsible and wrong. We need to be strengthening this economy.\n  The economy is growing right now. A lot of good things are happening. \nFor heaven's sake, why would we want to demonstrate to the financial \ncommunity and to world investors the United States cannot get its act \ntogether on this trade problem? That would be a very bad signal.\n  We somehow have to come together on this. I hope we can respect \nmajority leader Bill Frist. I know he is working tirelessly to do what \nhe can to get support for this legislation. It was 51 votes to 47, but \nthat is not enough. A majority supports it, as they support so many \nother things in this body, but\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\nif we do not get that 60 when a determined leadership on the other side \nobstructs the legislation, then we still cannot get it up for a final \nvote.\n  I am frustrated. I think a lot of us are. Hopefully something will \nhappen. Maybe Senator Daschle will meet and talk with Senator Frist and \nthat can help us move beyond the blocking of this important \nlegislation. I certainly hope so. I think the ball is in his court. We \nhave a responsibility to the American people to pass this Jumpstart \nbill and get out of this fix with international trade rules that can \nhurt us. We need to do it. I hope that can happen but, frankly, from \nwhat we have been seeing, I don't think it is likely.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks and I yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I believe under the procedure we are in \nnow I can speak on the pending legislation? There is no time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am very much concerned about the vote \nthat just occurred in the Senate. We had a cloture vote so we could get \nbeyond irrelevant amendments on this very important legislation. You \ncould still have relevant amendments offered postcloture. We could \nstill have debate and we could move to conclusion on this very \nimportant legislation. But we did not get the necessary 60 votes. This \nis a very irresponsible act by the U.S. Senate because we cannot afford \nto set this legislation aside and not get it completed.\n  Just for those who may have just tuned in, this is the Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Strength (JOBS) Act. It is very critical for two important \nreasons.\n  First, this is legislation we are going to have to pass in order to \ncomply with the World Trade Organization rulings on the FSC/ETI benefit \nin a manner that preserves jobs and production activities. This is a \ntax activity. The World Trade Organization has ruled the U.S. policies, \nour laws, do not comply with the World Trade Organization's rules in \nareas of tax incentives or subsidies for our companies in this world \ntrade area, and if we do not comply with them we are going to be hit \nwith fines from the World Trade Organization, from the European Union. \nIt is going to go up 1 percent a month until--I think these duties \ncould reach as much as 17 percent.\n  This is a very negative impact. It is a case where we have said to \nthe World Trade Organization, Give us fair rulings. Yet when there is a \nruling against us and we are given not weeks but months--years to \ncomply with the WTO ruling and have not done so, now we are faced with \nthese penalties against our products all over the country. These are \ncritical products we need to export into this world market. In order to \navoid that, we have to pass this legislation. I don't think any Senator \nwants to be on record voting in such a way that would block legislation \nto put us in compliance with the WTO ruling.\n\n  The second part of this is, because of the tax policy changes in this \nlegislation, it will create jobs in the manufacturing sector. We need \nthat. There are not many things we can do this year that will have an \nimmediate effect on job creation, but this is one of those bills that \nwill. A highway bill, an energy bill, and this Jumpstart Our Business \nStrength would make a huge difference.\n  If we do not pass this legislation, we get hit two ways. No. 1, if we \ndon't comply with WTO, it means our goods will be hit with additional \nimport duties, whether it is citrus in Florida or textiles in North \nCarolina, and it will spread all across the country; and No. 2, we \ndon't get the benefit of the jobs that come from this.\n  I say to my colleagues, it is one thing to argue over some amendments \nyou want voted on. I assume our leadership will work this out, but they \nneed to do it quickly because this is already in overtime. We are \nalready being penalized because we have not acted as a result of this \nWorld Trade Organization ruling. The very idea we would have to vote on \n5, 10, 15, 20--who knows how many irrelevant amendments also because \nsomebody wants to make their political statement in this election year \nI think is going to be pretty hard to defend. The American people may \nnot understand all the nuances of this very complicated legislation, \nbut they will understand when our products wind up being hit with what \nare basically fines from the World Trade Organization.\n  This is very serious legislation. We should not be playing political \ngames. I am not accusing anybody of doing that, but the fact is if we \ndon't find a way to get an agreement to bring it to a conclusion, \nsomebody is going to get the blame for not doing so.\n  I still believe the best way to win an election is governance, not \npolitics. If you produce results, the people know it. If you don't, \nthey know it. And they know right now this Senate is not producing very \nmuch.\n  Again, I don't want to presume to blame one side or the other, but I \ncan tell you in this case if we don't pass this legislation, if our \ncolleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle don't come to some \nreasonable agreement to have some limited number of amendments and get \nto final passage, the country is going to pay a price. I think that is \na huge mistake.\n  I don't usually come to the floor and make this kind of a statement, \nbut the very idea that we would not complete action on this legislation \nis totally unacceptable. I urge our colleagues on the other side of the \nCapitol to get going, get it out of the Ways and Means Committee, bring \nit to a vote, let's get this into conference, and let's get this \nlegislation completed. If we don't do any other bill this year, this is \none we must do because we are going to be penalized if we don't and we \ndon't get the benefit of the jobs it would create.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and say if we don't get an agreement \npretty quickly on limiting amendments, I think we should get another \ncloture vote. If we don't get cloture to cut off irrelevant amendments \nand get to completion of this amendment, we are going to have to move \non and the blame will fall somewhere. Unfortunately, the American \npeople will pay the price. We need to find a way to get it done and it \nneeds to get done quickly. This legislation has to be completed within \nthe next week and we should just find a way to get it done.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 MILDRED McWILLIAMS ``MILLIE'' JEFFREY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, today I have lost a very dear friend, \nas have the people of Michigan and hundreds of thousands of people \nacross the country. Millie Jeffery is an icon in the State of Michigan \nand in our country for civil rights, women's rights, and workers' \nrights. Her life has epitomized the principles by which we all strive \nto live our lives--justice, equality, and compassion.\n  Although small in stature, Millie has been a giant among all of us \nwho have known her. Words cannot express the depth of affection and \nrespect in which Millie is held, nor can words quantify the lives that \nshe has touched.\n  Mildred McWilliams Jeffrey, social justice activist, retired UAW \nDirector of the Consumer Affairs Department and a Governor Emerita of \nWayne State University, died peacefully surrounded by her family early \nthis morning in the Metro Detroit area. She was 93. In 2000, President \nWilliam Clinton awarded her the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian \naward bestowed by the United States Government.\n  In seeking world peace by ensuring equality for all, Millie spent a \nlifetime working on labor, civil rights, education, health care, youth \nemployment, and recreation issues. She\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nbrought inspiration and humor to the many people she touched--and did \nso with optimism and undaunted spirit.\n  Millie's list of accomplishments and awards is long but what she is \nmost remembered for is her zest for organizing. She mentored legions of \nwomen and men in the labor, civil rights, women's rights, and peace \nmovements. As President Clinton noted: ``Her impact will be felt for \ngenerations, and her example never forgotten.''\n  Millie was one of the most important mentors in my life and I will \nalways be very, very grateful to her.\n  Born in Alton, IA, on December 29, 1910, Millie was the oldest of \nseven children. She graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1932 \nwith a bachelor's degree in psychology and received a master's degree \nin social economy and social research in 1934 from Bryn Mawr College. \nIn graduate school, she realized that to improve the lives of working \nwomen and men she would have to change the system. In the 1930s, that \nmeant joining the labor movement.\n  Millie became an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of \nAmerica in Philadelphia and then Educational Director of the \nPennsylvania Joint Board of Shirt Workers. In 1936, she married fellow \nAmalgamated organizer Homer Newman Jeffrey, and they traveled \nthroughout the South and East organizing textile workers. During World \nWar II, the Jeffreys worked in Washington, DC, as consultants to the \nWar Labor Board, where they became close friends with Walter, Victor, \nand Roy Reuther.\n  Mildred and Newman Jeffrey moved to Detroit in 1944 when Victor \nReuther offered Millie a job as director of the newly formed UAW \nWomen's Bureau. Millie's commitment to equal rights fueled her career \nat the UAW. She organized the first UAW women's conference in response \nto the massive postwar layoffs of women production workers replaced by \nreturning veterans. From 1949 until 1954, Millie ran the union's radio \nstation. She moved on to direct the Community Relations Department. She \nwas director of the Consumer Affairs Department from 1968 until her \nretirement in 1976.\n  Millie joined the NAACP in the 1940s and marched in the south with \nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. Former executive secretary of \nthe Detroit Branch of the NAACP, Arthur Johnson, said that ``in the \ncivil rights movement, she knew how to fight without being \ndisagreeable.''\n  Mildred Jeffrey also was very active in the Democratic Party, \npreferring to work behind the scenes organizing, canvassing, \nconsulting, and fundraising. She was the consummate strategist. Millie \nprovided savvy advice to Democratic officeholders and presidents from \nJFK to Bill Clinton. Senator Edward Kennedy--D-MA--observed ``whether \nit was a worker in a plant or whether it was a Congressman or Senator \nor President, Millie inspired people.''\n  As a founding member and chair of the National Women's Political \nCaucus, Millie supported female candidates for public office. Twenty \nyears ago she led the effort to nominate Geraldine Ferraro as Walter \nMondale's running mate. Most recently Millie delighted in being \nrepresented by Michigan women she supported, Governor Jennifer \nGranholm, and myself. Millie is the ``political godmother'' for many of \nus, and we are extremely grateful for her love and support.\n  Millie ran for public office in 1974 and was elected by the people of \nthe State of Michigan to the Wayne State University Board of Governors, \nan office she held for 16 years--1974-1990. She was so proud of her \nrole in supporting this wonderful university. She served three terms as \nboard chair. Millie loved Wayne State University and was a long-time \nresident on campus. She never tired of showing visitors around her \n``neighborhood''--the Adamany Undergraduate Library, the Hilberry \nTheatre, and the Walter P. Reuther Library. Millie thrived in the \nacademic environment enriched by Wayne State University students.\n  Her friendships extended worldwide across all ages and nationalities. \nWhether discussing math with teenagers in Wayne State's Math Corps or \nstrategizing at the UN Conference on Women about the plight of \nsweatshop workers, Millie's capacity for connecting with people was \nunmatched.\n  Millie's capacity for connecting with people was unmatched. As one \nwho traveled with her to the Fourth World Conference on Women in \nBeijing, it was amazing to see people from all over the world, hearing \nwe were from Michigan, asking if we knew Millie Jeffrey and if we could \ntell them where she was; or that their grandmother, their aunt, \nsuggested they meet Millie Jeffrey.\n  I often said the way to world peace was to let Millie loose; sooner \nor later we would all know Millie Jeffrey and come to understand each \nother.\n  Millie was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame and was an \noriginal board member of the Michigan Women's Foundation. She served in \nvarious leadership roles in a wide variety of national and State \norganizations such as the Michigan Women's Political Caucus, the \nCoalition for Labor Union Women, Americans for Democratic Action, \nNational Abortion Rights Action League, Voters for Choice, EMILY's \nList, and the American Civil Liberties Union. She served on the peer \nreview board of Blue Cross and was an active member of the First \nUnitarian Universalist Church in Detroit.\n  She was also an adoring mother of a son and a daughter and adoring \ngrandmother who developed and nourished creativity and curiosity in her \ntwo grandchildren who she loved dearly, Erica Jeffrey and Thomas \nJeffrey. She encouraged Erica's love of ballet. She urged Thomas to \ntravel to learn about the world and was so proud of his AmeriCorps \nService.\n  All of these lists of awards, duties, responsibilities, and \ncommittees do not say what Millie is all about: Millie Jeffrey was a \none-of-a-kind woman of great passion, of great commitment, of great \ninterest in knowing about each one of us and what we were doing and \nwhat we cared about and how she could help. Millie is no longer with \nus, but she will be with us forever because her spirit will continue in \nall of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Stabenow, \nfor those wonderful words about a fantastic woman who always supported \nother women in their endeavors. You are right, her spirit will live on.\n  I heard a little bit of Senator Lott's comments about Democrats \nplaying politics with the bill before the Senate. No one should pay \npolitics with a bill in the Senate, but no one should play with \npeople's overtime. The reason it is so important to insist on a vote is \nI have millions of people in my State who will be adversely impacted \nbecause the administration wants to repeal the overtime laws. This \ngroup that is very concerned includes the first responders, my police, \nmy fire, my emergency personnel. Say all you want; no one will play \nwith their overtime. I will fight for their overtime pay.\n  There is no point getting a bill through here--by the way, the bill \nis very important--if on the one hand you say we are helping with job \ncreation and on the other hand you take away people's overtime. The \ndebate will continue.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  I come to the Senate to show my colleagues a tribute to the men and \nwomen who are dying in Iraq every single day. I want to also thank the \nSan Francisco Chronicle, Insight section, dated March 14, 2004. They \nturned their entire magazine into a tribute to the fallen in Iraq, page \nafter page, so they will not be forgotten. This is well over 500 \npeople.\n  It is so touching because it has the feel and look of a yearbook, of \na high school yearbook or a college yearbook. You recognize these \nbeautiful faces belong to some of the best and the brightest, cut down \nso early in their lives.\n  We tend not to pay enough attention around here so I will take some \ntime. I took this very important magazine and turned it into charts, \nportraits of sacrifice. It says:\n\n       This special section commemorates the 556 members of the \n     U.S. Armed Forces, as of Thursday, who have lost their lives \n     in Iraq. While views on the wisdom of the war vary, there's \n     no doubt about the commitment and valor of these Americans. \n     The portraits can also be viewed online.\n\n  I have chart after chart of the fallen. This shows exactly how the \nwar proceeded and how many war deaths, month by month. This shows the \nhome States of those who have died. In Nebraska, six have died; in \nSouth Dakota, four; in California, 61. We are the No. 1\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\nstate, unfortunately, in losses of these beautiful people.\n  The charts go on. This shows how they died. How many in helicopter \ncrashes, vehicle accidents, illness, weapons discharges, drownings, \nhostile fire, combat, noncombat. Bombs are not the only risk of war. I \nknow the Presiding Officer understands that very well.\n  This chart shows an incredibly somber photograph of a burial and the \nfolding of the American flag on the casket.\n  This is an editorial of the paper. I will read a few things from it.\n\n       The Iraq war won't quit. Since Baghdad's fall, there are no \n     battle lines. Fighting takes on a new lethal form in \n     ambushes, bombings or plane crashes. Injury and death come \n     almost daily.\n       On May 2, after a lightning-quick sweep through Iraq, \n     President Bush declared that major combat was over. This \n     country's vaunted armed forces had made short work of the \n     Iraqi military.\n       But the president's proclamation didn't stop the \n     fatalities, which as of Thursday included 556 American \n     troops. More than 415 of them lost their lives after Bush \n     declared that the major fighting was finished.\n\n  It goes on.\n\n       Many parents of the fallen describe their children as \n     enormously proud of military service and the chance to serve \n     in Iraq. Among the thousands from Northern California who \n     went to Iraq, consider the stories of several who died.\n\n  And they go through them.\n\n       Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Menusa from San Jose joined the Marines \n     after high school. Born in the Philippines, he became a proud \n     Marine recruiter, snappy in dress blues, before taking on \n     more active duty in Japan, the Persian Gulf, Cuba and Hawaii. \n     He died in an ambush near Nasiriya in the early days of \n     active fighting.\n\n  It talks about Karina Lau, and Genaro Acosta, and Joseph Norquist, \nhow he played football before earning a degree at Diablo Valley College \nin Pleasant Hill.\n  His parents said:\n\n       Joe believed in the job he was doing in Iraq.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Iraqis families have suffered, too. Thousands of their sons \n     and daughters, mothers and fathers, friends and acquaintances \n     have died in the conflict. We should recognize their losses.\n       Before the war is wrapped up and American troops depart, \n     there will be more fatalities. Only then can the full human \n     cost of the war be measured. But as the first anniversary of \n     the war approaches, it is time to stop and think about those \n     who have given their lives and why.\n\n  And there are more charts. We have these soldiers' faces. Then there \nis this cartoon drawing of an American eagle--a big bird with a little \nbaby bird on a branch and an olive branch. It says, ``Abstractions are \njust abstract until they have an ache in them.''\n  Then we have: ``The rifle and helmet of Marine Jason D. Mileo stand \nas a memorial after he was killed by friendly fire in Baghdad.''\n  This concludes this particular tribute.\n  Since the day this tribute ran--which was on Sunday, March 14--the \nfollowing have been killed:\n  Fern L. Holland, 33, of Oklahoma, died on March 9; Robert J. Zangas, \n44, of Prince William County, VA, died March 9; SGT Joe L. Dunigan Jr., \n37, of Belton, TX, died March 11; SP Christopher K.

Hudson, 21, of \nCarmel, IN, died March 21; and LCpl Andrew S. Dang, 20, of Foster City, \nCA, died March 22.\n  That is the last I have. I hope it stops and I do not have to come \nback to this floor. I have done this from time to time.\n  We pray so much the Iraq war will end and the people there will have \nfreedom and democracy, that they will respect each other, and our \ntroops can come home; and, in the meantime, that the burden can be \nshared by the world rather than falling on their shoulders.\n  As I read this, and I read the ages, we saw ages from 19 to over 50 \nyears old. Imagine what these people are leaving behind. I wish to say \nhow my heart goes out to their families and how I will do everything I \ncan to see this killing ends.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, prior to our cloture vote on the FSC/ETI \nbill, I read a list of some products that, if they are going to be \nshipped out of the United States and exported to Europe, are going to \nhave, right now, a 5-percent tariff added to them because of European \nretaliation against the United States because we have not passed this \nlegislation yet. That is going to cause jobs to be lost. That tariff is \ngoing to go up, over the course of the next 12 months, 1 percent every \nmonth, to 17 percent.\n  I will be a little bit more specific in how some of those products \nand the manufacturers of those products, or the producers of those \nproducts, will be affected.\n  In jewelry manufacturing, we would have $2 billion in annual exports \nbeing jeopardized. Ninety-five percent of jewelry manufacturers are \nsmall businesses, so obviously it would have a huge potential impact on \njobs. Folks such as Stamper Black Hills Gold in South Dakota are \ntargeted, as one example of jewelry manufacturing.\n  Racehorses: The average value of U.S. exports of racehorses is about \n$100,000. At 5 percent, that is an extra $5,000 cost to our exports. By \nthe end of the year, it will be an extra $14,000 on average. For high-\nvalue horses, it will be several times more. These sanctions would \nimpact States such as New York, California, Florida, and Maryland. In \nthe area of dairy, we will have sanctions on cheese exports impacting \nStates such as Wisconsin, Vermont; fruits and vegetables, California; \ncitrus fruits, peppers, Florida, and tomatoes, as an example.\n\n  I could go on and on, but I will include for the Record a list beyond \nwhat I have just referred to.

We just had a cloture vote on the bill. I have spoken \nbefore about that not being my preferred route for moving a strongly \nbipartisan bill, but leadership decided to do it. Obviously, I want to \nget to finality, so I voted to close debate and move on.\n  The JOBS bill is a bill to create manufacturing jobs. It should not \nhave required a cloture vote to get it passed. But politics have \nstepped in the way, and that seems to be the rule of the day.\n  I wanted to act on this bill last year because I was fearful that \nelections this year and the politics connected thereto would get in the \nway of the Senate's ability to do its job. It looks as though I may \nhave been right after all. The procedural shenanigans when we first \nbrought up the bill confirmed my worst fears. Senator Baucus and I had \nan agreed order of amendments that would have improved the bill and \nbrought important relevant issues forward. Many of those issues \nincluded in this amendment by Senator Baucus and I were at the request \nof a lot of people who voted against cloture.\n  The agreement we had was undermined by the Democratic leadership. \nThey would prefer to turn a bipartisan bill into a political football. \nThat is inexcusable because we have worked hard throughout this process \nto make sure everyone's concerns, Republican and Democrat, were \nincorporated in the bill.\n  You should not play political games with a bipartisan bill that \npreserves the jobs of manufacturing workers across the land, and \nprobably greatly increases the number of manufacturing jobs.\n  I would like to repeat points I made yesterday about the bipartisan \naspects of this legislation. The construction of the JOBS bill began \nwhen Senator Baucus was chairman of the Finance Committee. He held a \nhearing in July 2002 to address the FSC/ETI controversy within the \nWorld Trade Organization. We heard vital testimony from a cross-section \nof the industries that would be adversely affected by repeal of the \nExtraterritorial Income Act. We also heard from U.S. companies that \nwere clamoring for international tax reform because our tax rules were \nhurting their competitiveness in foreign markets. Their foreign \ncompetitors were running circles around them because of our \ninternational tax rules. That is what we were told during the hearing.\n  Also during the hearing, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator \nHatch expressed concerns about how our international tax laws were \nimpairing the competitiveness of U.S. industry.\n  In response, at that particular time, still in 2002, Senator Baucus \nformed an international tax working group with Senator Graham, Senator \nHatch, and this Senator. It was open also to any other member of the \nFinance Committee who wanted to serve and had an interest in this \nissue. This bipartisan Finance Committee working group formed the basis \nfor the bill that is now before us. We directed our staff to engage in \nan exhaustive analysis of international reform proposals to glean the \nvery best ideas from many different sources, and as many as possible. \nSenator Baucus and I also formed a bipartisan, bicameral working group \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee in \nan effort to find some common ground on dealing with repeal of the \nForeign Sales Corporation extraterritorial income language in our law \nthat had been declared contrary to our international treaty \nobligations.\n\n  After that effort failed, working with the Ways and Means Committee, \nSenator Baucus and I continued to work with our Finance Committee \ncolleagues on bipartisan development of the repeal of that language and \nalso to expand and improve the international tax reform package. We \ncontinued our bipartisan efforts when I became chairman last year.\n  In July 2003, following on the impetus of the Baucus hearings, we \nheld two additional hearings on FSC/ETI and the international reform \nissue. These two hearings concluded our final bipartisan effort in \nreviewing all of the policy options for creating the bill now pending \nbefore the Senate. Let me emphasize that there is not one provision in \nthis JOBS bill that was not agreed to by both Republicans and \nDemocrats. We have acted in the best faith to produce a bill that \nprotects American manufacturing jobs and makes our companies globally \ncompetitive. And we did this in a fully bipartisan manner, which is \nwhat the American people expect us to do on such an important issue as \nmanufacturing jobs and our Nation's economic health and also because, \nquite frankly, nothing gets done\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nin the Senate that does not have a bipartisan approach.\n  But these efforts toward bipartisanship and all the other efforts \nthat went into it do not seem to be enough for some. I believe some \npeople don't want this bill to pass. I will bet those very same people \nwill end up voting for it anyway, if we ever get to that point, because \nI don't think they can openly oppose it. That would be bad form, \nconsidering all the talk there has been in this body about outsourcing \nand offshore manufacturing. Instead, these people who might not want to \nsee this bill pass would try to destroy the bipartisan product with \namendments on controversial issues that are what we call ``not \ngermane'' but are also totally unrelated to the JOBS bill.\n  That is why we found ourselves facing the cloture vote today. The \ncloture motion did not get the 60-percent supermajority. Consequently, \nwe are in a position of limbo on this legislation.\n  I am speaking because I want people to reconsider their position, \nparticularly in light of all of the products that I have read that are \ngoing to have a 5-percent tariff on them, making our manufacturing less \ncompetitive and consequently losing jobs to a greater extent. When I \nthink about efforts, for political reasons, to destroy this bill, I can \nquote, at least, from a Washington Post article that quoted a \nDemocratic tax aide as saying--and this person is not named in the \narticle--\n\n       There's not a lot of incentive for us to figure out this \n     problem--\n\n  Meaning the FSC/ETI problem. This Democratic aide went on to say:\n\n       Allowing the extra-territorial income controversy to fester \n     would yield increased sanctions that could benefit the \n     Democrats in November.\n\n  Well, that is exactly what is accomplished by not getting the \nsupermajority of 60 to stop debate and to move on. This is, in fact, \nfestering. Now, all of this, to me, is an appalling statement, whether \nit comes from a Member or whether it comes from a top staffer of a \nDemocratic Member, because this debate should be about policy, not \nabout petty politics.\n  Today, Democrats said no to cloture; Republicans said yes to cloture. \nThe Democrats are on record opposing the provisions in this bill. Some \nof those provisions, if we don't get beyond where we are now, will be \nkilled because of this morning's vote. This bill will end $4 billion a \nyear of European Union tariffs against U.S. exports. These sanctions \nare already being imposed against many U.S. products. I named over 500 \nof them. They fall into the category of grain, timber, paper, and \nvarious manufactured goods.\n  Those sanctions started on May 1. They increase 1 percent each month \nwe fail to act, adding up over 12 months to 17 percent. They will be 13 \npercent by the end of this year. That is too politically tempting for \nsome to let pass.\n  We could have ended the $4 billion in sanctions with this bill, but \nthe Democrats said no. The Congressional Budget Office says we have \nlost 3 million manufacturing jobs since the middle of the year 2000--6 \nmonths before President Bush became President--when a depression in \nmanufacturing set in. The JOBS bill provides $75 billion of tax relief \nto our manufacturing sector to promote rehiring in U.S.-based \nmanufacturing. But the Democrats said no.\n  The Democrats claim they are worried about the scope of proposed \novertime regulations--regulations that are not even out yet, not final. \nBut how can you worry about overtime if you don't have a job in the \nfirst place? You have to have a job to earn overtime. We need to \naddress the manufacturing job loss right now by voting for the \nbipartisan JOBS bill.\n  The JOBS bill gives a 3 percentage point tax rate cut on all income \nderived from manufacturing in the United States. This will not benefit \nmanufacturing offshore. So you can see this is tilted toward \nencouraging manufacturing in the United States, creating jobs in the \nUnited States. This reduction in taxes starts as soon as the President \nsigns this bill. This manufacturing rate cut applies not only to big \ncorporations but to sole proprietors, partnerships, farmers, \nindividuals, family businesses, multinational corporations, and foreign \ncompanies that set up manufacturing plants in the United States and \nhire workers here. This should keep the Government out of their pocket \nwhile they try to recover from the economic downturn by lowering this \ntax and also because it is an incentive to expand production here \nrather than overseas. But on that vote we had about 2 hours ago, the \nDemocrats said no.\n  The JOBS bill extends the research and development tax credit through \nthe end of 2005. This credit is a domestic tax benefit that incentives \nresearch and development, translating to good, high-paying jobs for \nAmericans here in America, not overseas. But the Democrats said no \ntoday.\n  There are other important provisions in this bill. The bill extends \nfor 2 years tax provisions that expired in 2003 and 2004. This includes \nitems such as the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work \ntax credit. Why did the Democrats say no to these measures that are \nmeant to help lower income people and young people get into the \nworkforce to work their way up the economic ladder--particularly to \nmove people off welfare into the world of work, because in the world of \nwelfare, you are going to be in a life of poverty. If you move people \nover here and give them an opportunity to move up, quite frankly, they \nare going to be able to improve themselves, enhance their \nopportunities, enhance their livelihoods.\n\n  There are also in the bill enhanced depreciation provisions to help \nthe ailing airline industry. There are new homestead provisions for \nrural development. These provide special assistance for businesses in \ncounties that are losing population. It provides incentives for newly \nconstructed rural investment buildings, for starting or expanding a \nrural business in a rural high outmigration county. But the Democrats \nsaid no when they voted to continue the debate rather than reach \nfinality on this bill.\n  We have a provision that allows payments under the National Health \nService Corps loan repayment program to be exempt from tax. This is \nalso for rural development--again, responding to a lot of Senators who \nsupport that because they are concerned about having high quality \nhealth care in rural America.\n  The JOBS bill includes brownfields revitalization. The bill waives \ntaxes for tax-exempt investors who invest in the cleanup and \nremediation of qualified brownfield sites.\n  It includes a mortgage revenue bonds provision. That proposal would \nrepeal the current rule that mortgage revenue bond payments received \nafter the bond has been outstanding for 10 years must be used to pay \noff the bond rather than issue new mortgages. There are 70 Senate \ncosponsors of that bill. But the Democrats said no today on the cloture \nvote.\n  We allow deductions from private mortgage insurance for people \nstruggling to afford a home. The no vote on today's cloture motion was \na vote against homeowners.\n  We have extended and enhanced the Liberty Zone bonds for the \nrebuilding of New York City because of September 11. We included $100 \nmillion in tax credits to be used on rail infrastructure projects in \nthe New York Liberty Zone. The Democrats actually tied up funding for \nthe Liberty Zone to prove a political point on a Labor Department \novertime regulation that isn't even finalized. Well, we tried to help \nsome Senators with that provision. Yet they voted no.\n  There is a lot here to help economic development. We have increased \nindustrial development bond levels to spur economic development. We \nhave bonds for rebuilding school infrastructure. We have included \ntribal bonds, which allow Native Americans to obtain bond financing for \nreservation projects in the same manner as State and local governments.\n  We have a new tribal new markets tax credit. This would add $50 \nmillion annually in new markets tax credits dedicated to community \nentities serving Native Americans.\n  The JOBS bill provided $500 million over 3 years in the Federal tax \ncredits to States for intercity passenger rail capital projects, and \nfor so-called short-line rail service.\n  Was it worth killing off these important priorities by voting against \nan unfinished regulation? But that is what the Democrats did with this \ncloture vote.\n\n  We also have a special dividend allocation rule for the benefit of \nfarm cooperatives. We have provisions that\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\nhelp cattlemen when drought, flood, and other weather-related \nconditions--all beyond the control of the individual farmer--might wipe \nout their livestock.\n  We have a provision to benefit rural letter carriers.\n  The JOBS bill enhances a broadband expense so people in rural America \ncan have a quality of life through IT, the same as those people in \nurban America.\n  We have included the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act so people who win \nlawsuits actually get benefits from them because we have some people \nwinning lawsuits and by the time they pay their taxes and pay the \nlawyers, they do not have anything left. So what good does it do to win \na civil rights lawsuit?\n  Our bill includes a tax credit for employers for wages paid to \nreservists who have been called to active duty. There is a lot of that \nnow because of the war.\n  The Democrats voted against cloture and killed all these measures. \nAll these benefits are being held hostage because the other side is \npushing for a vote on a nongermane amendment.\n  When we are faced with 5-percent sanctions, and next month it is \ngoing to be 6 percent and the following month 7 percent and eventually \n17 percent after a year, I think in that environment it is fair to call \nthis obstruction and maybe, in the case of this divided vote, political \nobstruction, partisan obstruction, particularly when this bill was \ndeveloped in complete cooperation with the Democrats, not only on the \nunderlying bill, but a lot of these amendments that were added by \nSenator Baucus and me were a direct result of trying to satisfy \nDemocrats as well as Republicans.\n  That sort of obstruction did not work in 2002, and I do not think it \nis going to work today. When it was tried in 2002, Mr. President, do \nyou know what happened? That sort of obstruction was supposed to win \nthe Democrats continued majority in the Senate, and it cost them the \nmajority. Do you know why? Because politics is not good policy, but \ngood policy is good politics.\n  It is inexcusable to hold up a bill that will benefit millions of \nmanufacturing jobs to score political points. We have worked hard \nthroughout this process to make sure everyone's concerns--both \nRepublicans and Democrats--were in this bill. In the committee, we did \nmore to satisfy the Democrats. There were two votes against this bill \nand those two votes were from Republicans. How is that for a Republican \nchairman working with the Democratic leader of that committee to get a \nbipartisan bill to satisfy the Democrats, and in the process I irritate \ntwo Republicans? But it is still a bipartisan bill.\n  We tried to make sure everyone's concerns were taken care of in this \nbill. We see that concern reflected in the amendments I just listed. \nAnyone who voted against cloture voted against all those items I just \nlisted because a few on the other side--or maybe I should say all on \nthe other side--wanted to vote on another amendment, an amendment that \nwas not germane. Then we had some people on the other side who were \ninvolved in that amendment saying all these amendments I listed are \nnongermane as well. Every one of them is in the jurisdiction of the \nFinance Committee, and every one of them is a tax-related item. So tell \nme tax-related items are nongermane and use that as an excuse to bring \nup a nongermane amendment that is in the jurisdiction of the Labor \nCommittee. It just does not make sense. It is not true.\n\n  I hope somehow there can be some accommodation and get serious about \nthe manufacturing job crisis that is facing America. We need to move \nthis JOBS bill forward. Sooner or later, it is going to move forward \nbecause the more we tack on 1 percentage point a month for the next 12 \nmonths and get up to 17 percent, there are going to be enough \nbusinesses, as well as working people, complaining, and I hope they \nforward their complaints to the Democratic Party in the Senate because \nthose are the people who voted against cloture.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that within the JOBS \npackage, not only does it stop the tariffs from going into effect and \nbeing raised by 1 percent a month, but within this JOBS package, the \nprovision known as the Invest in the USA Act would bring over $300 \nbillion back into the United States to be reinvested to create American \njobs? One estimate from a very well-respected economist, Alan Sinai, \nhas said 660,000 jobs would be created by that one provision alone. Is \nthe Senator aware that by killing this bill, at least 660,000 jobs just \nin that one small provision will be killed along with it?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am aware of that, and it gives me an \nopportunity, because I did not highlight it in my remarks, to \ncompliment the Senator from Nevada because he is the brains behind that \namendment. That amendment probably will do as much good--or at least \nalmost as much good--as the underlying legislation. It is a part of \nthis bill. It ought to be passed, and I am sure the Senator from Nevada \nwill be constantly reminding people on the other side of the aisle that \ntheir voting against cloture has also, at least temporarily, killed \nthis provision as well.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will further yield for another question, \nis the fear of the chairman, who has done such great work on this \nbill--it is my fear and I wonder if the chairman has the same fear--\nthat in the mix of an election cycle, some of these other issues that \nare being brought up are being brought up to confuse the issue, where \nthey really do not like the underlying bill but they do not want to \nvote against the underlying bill because they know they are voting \nagainst jobs in America; that if they would vote for cloture, we could \nhave a clean bill with only germane amendments and we could actually \nstart creating jobs in America?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is entirely \nright, 100 percent right. He may have not heard me say this, but I keep \nreferring during this debate to a statement made by the Washington Post \ndescribing a Democratic tax aide as saying there was not a whole lot of \nincentive for the other side to move this bill along because as \nsanctions come on and people get laid off, that is going to benefit \nthem in the next election. I said to my colleagues and I say to the \nSenator from Nevada that is politics getting in the way of good policy. \nI hope the other side realizes that the best politics is good policy.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Iowa, who \nhas worked very hard on this bill, it is a bill that should be voted on \nand it is a bill that will be voted on before the session is ended. It \nis an important bill for business, for America, and for jobs. But the \nreason this bill has not been voted on is because we on this side of \nthe aisle believe that Senators from both parties should stand up and \ncast their votes and take a position on the Bush administration's \nproposal to take the right to overtime pay away from 8 million working \nAmericans.\n  When we look at the people who will be disadvantaged by this Bush \nadministration change, they include policemen, firefighters, nurses, \nveterans, and scores of other occupations in America that will lose the \nright to overtime pay because of the Bush administration policy.\n  All we have asked for on the Democratic side of the aisle is a simple \nup-or-down, yes-or-no vote. Let those who agree with the Bush \nadministration--for the first time since 1938 we have a President who \nis going to remove the right to overtime pay--vote with their \nPresident. Let them vote to take away overtime pay from 8 million \nAmericans.\n  Let those of us who think this is a bad thing to do, taking away \novertime pay from nurses at a time when hospitals are desperate to keep \nthem working, taking away overtime pay from veterans who picked up \ntraining when they were in the military and will now be penalized by \nthis Bush administration overtime change, let those of us who think \nthese are horrible outcomes vote no. That is all we have asked for, and \nbecause the Republican leadership does not want to go on record again \nagainst the Bush administration on overtime pay, they have\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\nchosen instead to pull the bill off the calendar.\n  All the things the Senator from Iowa said notwithstanding, if they \nwould give us a vote on that amendment, we could move forward on this \nbill, and we should. This is one of the few chances we are going to \nhave to address meaningful issues that relate to jobs and the economy. \nWe cannot in any way squander this opportunity.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his hard work. The Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, has joined him in this effort. For goodness' sake, \ngive us an up-or-down vote on this overtime pay issue and let us move \nforward and pass this bill. Unless and until that occurs, we are going \nto continue to have this standoff.\n\n\n                    Morning Edition and Bob Edwards\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning when I left my apartment on \nCapitol Hill, I bought a Washington Post. The first thing that caught \nmy eye was a front page story that will be repeated in newspapers \nacross America and probably other sources. The headline says: ``NPR \nYanks Top-Rated Show Host.'' I stopped what I was doing and read it. It \nturns out National Public Radio has decided to remove Bob Edwards from \nMorning Edition after 25 years in front of the microphone.\n  Morning Edition is one of the most popular radio shows in America. It \nhas 13 million listeners. Whether I am in Springfield, IL, listing to \nWUIS or I am in Chicago listening to WEBZ, when the clock radio goes on \nin the morning, the first voice I hear is Bob Edwards.\n  They decided at NPR it is time to tell Bob Edwards he can no longer \nserve as the host of Morning Edition. What was Bob's reaction to that? \nThe newspaper says:\n\n       I would have loved to have stayed with ``Morning Edition.'' \n     But it's not my candy store.\n\n  Well, the article goes on to really analyze why in the world NPR, \nafter 25 years, would remove from the Morning Edition show a person \nwith such a reputation as Bob Edwards'. Well, it cannot be because of \nthe audience, because from the time Bob Edwards has been on Morning \nEdition the audience has more than doubled for NPR in the last 10 \nyears. As he says, who else can say that?\n  Bob Edwards is running rings around other radio talk show hosts. Bob \nEdwards came to the show in 1979. They asked him to take over Morning \nEdition for 30 days until they found a permanent host. Twenty-five \nyears later, he is still at the microphone. So they went to some of the \nleaders at National Public Radio and asked: Why are you removing Bob \nEdwards from the Morning Edition?\n\n  Well, they think the decision was made primarily by Jay Kernis, an \nNPR senior vice president. They explained it as such. They said the \nidea behind it was:\n\n     . . . to make sure we were in the best position to serve the \n     changing needs of our listeners.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       In today's news environment, people demand both immediacy \n     and depth.\n\n  That is the reason why they want to remove Bob Edwards from Morning \nEdition? Frankly, that is not good enough. I went to the NPR Web site, \nNPR.org. On that Web site is an explanation of Bob Edwards leaving the \nshow. They do not say they forced him out, just that he is leaving the \nshow.\n  Here is the kind of response one would expect from Bob Edwards:\n\n     . . . Morning Edition will continue to be my first source of \n     news.\n\n  He is still loyal to that program.\n  On the NPR Web site they list his achievements. Bob Edwards has \nreceived two Gabriel Awards; the 1984 Edward R. Murrow Award from the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting for ``outstanding contributions to \npublic radio;'' an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award for \nExcellence; and the prestigious 1999 George Foster Peabody Award for \nhosting Morning Edition.\n  There is a letter from Bob Edwards on the NPR.org Web site. He says:\n\n       I am leaving a post that I have loved and have given my \n     heart to.\n\n  It is pretty clear that Bob Edwards does not want to leave Morning \nEdition. For many of us, mornings in America will not be the same \nwithout the voice of Bob Edwards to greet us. I have never met him, but \nI really consider him a friend. He is a reliable source of information, \nhas a voice that calms me when terrible things are happening around the \nworld. He is an American institution.\n  So here is what I am asking those who are following this debate to \nconsider: If you believe, as I do, that Bob Edwards should continue as \nthe host of Morning Edition, that America's Mr. Morning should stay in \nfront of that NPR microphone, let us do something about it. If you are \none of the thousands who contribute to National Public Radio, frankly \nwe have a vested interest in what is going on on National Public Radio. \nBob said, and I think he is right, ``It's not my candy store,'' but let \nme say this: National Public Radio is a candy store that belongs to a \nlot of us, those of us who listen and those of us who contribute. \nListeners who donate are actually the shareholders of National Public \nRadio. I think it is time for a shareholders revolt, and what I am \nasking friends of Bob Edwards to do at this point is to log on to \nNPR.org and send an e-mail to them. Let them know what you think about \nthe removal of Bob Edwards from Morning Edition. Share that with the \nmanagement who believes we need a new voice, a new style. I frankly \nthink Bob Edwards is as good as it gets.\n  We have listened to a lot of Bob Edwards' Morning Edition lying down \nin our beds but we should not take this dismissal from Morning Edition \nlying down. If people have followed this debate and they believe Bob \nEdwards is worth an e-mail to NPR.org, please do so. Possibly you may \nwant to share that with some friends on your e-mail list. Let's see if \nwe can tell some of our friends at National Public Radio we have a \nnational treasure we cannot afford to lose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about high gas prices \nand high natural gas prices and what we could be doing about it and \nwhat I would urge the administration to do about it. I would like to \noutline 13 concrete steps I believe the President can take to address \nand to lessen the impact these high prices are having on the U.S. \neconomy and on American families.\n  Several others in the Senate have talked in recent days to suggest \nthat the cure-all for the current high energy prices would be to take \nup and pass either the Energy bill conference report that was blocked \nlast fall or a new comprehensive Energy bill that is now on the Senate \ncalendar. Clearly there are some specific legislative provisions \nrelated to energy that we in the Congress should be passing this year, \nand I strongly support getting to those.\n  The truth is, though, that neither last year's nor this year's bill \ndoes much to address the high prices we now face, either in the area of \nnatural gas or in the area of gasoline one gets at the pump. That was a \nconclusion the Energy Information Administration, EIA, reached after a \nthorough analysis of last year's conference report that they carried \nout at the request of Senator Sununu.\n  The EIA conclusion on that conference report, which applies equally \nto the Energy bill that is currently on the Senate calendar, is: On a \nfuel-specific basis, changes to production, consumption, imports, and \nprices are negligible. As the Wall Street Journal stated so succinctly \nyesterday in an editorial on the NRC legislation:\n\n       No energy bill has the ability to ease the crunch in oil \n     and natural gas prices before this fall's election.\n\n  Even though there is not a legislative fix, or an immediate fix to \nthis set of problems, nevertheless there are a number of effective \nsteps the President can take under current law using existing statutory \nauthority. These steps would actually do more to address current high \nenergy prices, as well as the root causes, than anything we have in the \n1,200-page Energy bill that is still awaiting action.\n  Let me first talk about the high price of natural gas and what could \nbe done to deal with that. The first set of specific steps the \nadministration could take to address current high prices involves \nincreasing the domestic supply of natural gas. Those steps would allow \nthe President to reprogram additional funds in fiscal year 2004, the \ncurrent year--reprogram those to Federal oil\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nand gas programs--and request supplemental funds to reverse the cuts to \nFederal oil and gas programs that the administration has requested in \nnext year's budget.\n  Federal programs to support increased domestic oil and gas production \nhave fared very poorly in the President's most recent budget request to \nCongress. This is in spite of the many public statements of support for \nincreased domestic production by administration officials. The \nrhetoric, unfortunately, has not been matched by actual requests for \ninvestment in these activities.\n  Here is a chart that tries to summarize a couple of points. This is \nentitled ``Bush Administration Budget Cuts for Oil and Natural Gas \nProduction--Fiscal Year 2005.'' It is broken into, first, the budget \ncuts related to the Interior Department and, second, the budget cuts \nrelated to the Energy Department. Let me go through this.\n  A case in point is the oil and gas management program in the BLM, the \nBureau of Land Management of the Department of Interior. This is the \nprogram that governs onshore oil and gas production on Federal lands \nsuch as the oil and gas production on the Federal lands in New Mexico. \nThe 94,000 Federal onshore oil and gas wells currently account for 11 \npercent of U.S. natural gas production and 5 percent of our oil \nproduction. The administration's own figures show there is a backlog of \noil and gas lease applications and drilling permits on Federal lands of \nabout 2,100 for the current fiscal year.\n  That is a remarkable statistic. It means we are foregoing additional \noil and gas production and essentially preventing it, not because of \nsome environmental restriction, not because we have closed off some \npromising new area to development, but because the administration will \nnot hire the people to process the paperwork needed to approve the \ndrilling applications that companies are willing and anxious to \nundertake.\n  You would think getting adequate Federal resources to support oil and \ngas exploration in the field in areas that are not controversial would \nbe fairly easy to accomplish. I can assure my colleagues it is not. My \nhome State of New Mexico is a State that produces a substantial \nquantity of oil and natural gas. I had to go back to the Bureau of Land \nManagement again and again over the last couple of years to get them to \nhire additional personnel in the Farmington field office to process \nnatural gas drilling permits. Farmington is not alone in this respect. \nThis is a problem all throughout the Intermountain West.\n\n  Instead of taking aggressive action in this year's budget to reduce \nthe backlog to zero over the next year, the President's latest budget \nrequest cuts $3 million from the budget of the oil and gas management \nprogram with the difference being made up by raising fees on \nindependent oil and gas producers for each lease application or \ndrilling permit for which they apply.\n  Think about that a moment. In the face of very high natural gas \nprices, the administration says we should cut Federal expenditures for \nthe very people needed to approve more drilling, and we should make up \nthe difference by bumping up the cost of a drilling permit. Not only do \nwe not get more supply, but the additional costs that are levied on \nproducers most likely get passed along to consumers and get reflected \nin natural gas prices.\n  As a result of this so-called status quo effort in the BLM, the \nadministration's own figures estimate the bureaucratic backlog in BLM \nwill only decline by 200 in fiscal year 2005. The net backlog of 2,100 \nwould be reduced to 1,900 during that fiscal year, so 18 months from \nnow we would have approximately 1,900 lease applications awaiting some \nkind of action. This is an inadequate response in light of the current \nhigh prices we face. Instead of making it more costly for domestic \nproducers to look for oil and gas on Federal lands and doing little or \nnothing to make the necessary resources available in the field to speed \nthe processing of leases and permits, the administration should be \nasking Congress for an increase in this budget.\n  To address the problem, I recommend the administration take the \nfollowing three actions to boost domestic natural gas production: \nFirst, the Department of Interior should request that fiscal year 2004 \nfunds be immediately reprogrammed to start reducing the drilling \nbacklog at the BLM.\n  Second, the President should submit a supplemental request for an \nadditional $8 million for fiscal year 2005, to get that backlog down to \nzero.\n  And, third, the President should direct the BLM to abandon the notion \nof a rulemaking that would erect greater fiscal barriers to the \nexploration and production of oil and gas on Federal lands.\n  A second set of deep budget cuts affecting natural gas production can \nbe found in the administration's budget requests for the \nadministration's oil and gas R programs. These programs are focused \non helping independent producers with access to new technologies that \nmake domestic production of oil and gas more efficient and more \neffective. They fund efforts such as the Petroleum Technology Transfer \nCouncil, which has demonstrated a strong track record in boosting the \nproductivity for independent oil and gas producers. They account for \nmuch of our domestic oil and gas production. The President's budget \nrequest for 2005 cuts these programs by nearly half.\n  One particularly important program, the Department of Energy's \nPetroleum Exploration and Production Research Program, proposes an 84-\npercent cut under the administration's budget request. Again, given the \nneed to sustain domestic production and the strong support for these \nprograms that has been repeatedly shown in Congress on a bipartisan \nbasis, it is difficult to justify these funding requests.\n  So my fourth recommendation to the President is that at a minimum the \nadministration submit a supplemental request for $37.1 million for \nfiscal year 2005 for the Department of Energy oil and gas R programs. \nAll we are asking for is that we maintain these programs at current \nfunding levels. Frankly, these programs should be increased, but at the \nvery least we should not be phasing them out as the President is \ncurrently proposing.\n  That is natural gas. Let me move to the issue of the high price of \ngasoline at the pump. Let me make some recommendations as to how that \ncould be relieved.\n  My first recommendation in this regard would be for the \nadministration to temporarily suspend using royalty-in-kind oil to fill \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  The Senate voted in favor of such a suspension while we were \nconsidering the budget resolution 2 weeks ago. I supported that action. \nIt was proposed on a bipartisan basis by Senators Levin, Collins, and \nClinton. I recognize the Senate vote was not binding on the \nadministration. But, the idea of not diverting oil from the market to \nfill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time of exceptional tightness \nin oil markets makes sense at least as a signal to the market that the \nadministration recognizes the depth of economic hardship being caused \nby current high prices.\n\n  The President has the authority and discretion to either put the \nGovernment's royalty share of oil in the SPR, or to let it be sold on \nthe market, where it will help provide more supply. I believe that the \nPresident should direct the Department of Energy to suspend this policy \ntemporarily, to be reinstated when oil prices return to more normal \nlevels. Some have argued that putting the Government's royalty share of \noil on the market is some sort of attack on the SPR. That is not true. \nThe practice was started during the Clinton administration, at my \nurging--and at the urging of others in the industry--because oil prices \nthen were very low, and the extra Government oil being placed on the \nmarket was threatening the long-term financial viability of small \nproducers. It was started as a counter-cyclical measure; we should stop \nit as a counter-cyclical measure in the same way, in my view.\n  My second recommendation to help reduce high gasoline prices would be \nfor the President to press the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries--OPEC--to increase world oil supply.\n  OPEC has successfully managed the global oil market with an \nincreasing degree of precision since its announcement in March 1998 of \na pact to lower output and keep oil prices within a $22 to $28 per \nbarrel price band. Supply has been tight and prices have remained\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nhigh in particular over the past 12 months.\n  On February 10, 2004, OPEC announced a surprise agreement to cut its \noutput quotas by 1 million barrels a day, or 4 percent, starting in \nMarch, because of concern that prices may fall once winter ends in the \nnorthern hemisphere. Meanwhile, crude oil prices in New York reached a \n13-year high of $38.18 a barrel on March 17, 2 weeks before OPEC's next \nmeeting.\n  Given the economic impact that high energy prices are having on \nAmerican families and businesses, I believe that the administration \nneeds to act more aggressively to combat the mounting economic crisis. \nWith a decrease in supply, the demand for oil could send prices at the \ngasoline pump well above $2 a gallon this summer.\n  It is time that this administration uses every means at its disposal \nto bring down high energy prices. OPEC has limited its production of \noil to drive prices higher and collect additional profits. This is not \nacceptable. I recommend that the administration exert diplomatic \npressure on OPEC to abandon its agreement of February 10 and to \nincrease oil supplies instead of decreasing. Doing so would not set \nsome new precedent. The Clinton administration used its international \nleverage to encourage OPEC to keep oil prices stable and affordable \nduring its two terms in office. If President Clinton and his top \nofficials could act in the interest of consumers and the American \neconomy, then I think President Bush can, as well.\n  My third and fourth recommendations to help moderate gasoline price \npressures on consumers would be for the administration to fine-tune the \ncurrent gasoline sulfur regulation to ease price pressures resulting \nfrom the transition to low-sulfur gasoline.\n  EPA is in the process of implementing a new rule on sulfur in \ngasoline. This rule sets the acceptable level of sulfur in gasoline at \n120 ppm as of January 1, 2004. Over the next two years, this level will \ndrop to only 30 ppm. The move to cleaner, more sulfur-free \ntransportation fuels is necessary and should continue. The rule rewards \ncompanies that achieve early reductions in their operations' baseline \nlevel of sulfur to generate sulfur credits for use in 2005.\n  An additional level of special credits called ``allotments'' was \ndeveloped to reward companies which made significant capital \ninvestment. The rule, however, does not have a reliable mechanism for \nindependent fuel importers to participate in the system if markets are \ntight and the number of allotments they need to buy--to stay in \ncompliance--are not available. I recommend that the administration \nrevise this rule to allow independent importers to carry a small \ndeficit balance in case they are unable to buy enough allotments. By \ndoing so, we will facilitate the ability to move more gasoline that is \ncurrently on the world market to U.S. consumers this summer, without \ncompromising environmental protections.\n  If unexpected significant refinery or pipeline disruptions occur, or \nif gasoline prices rise to levels that cause significant economic harm, \nI recommend that the administration be prepared to issue an emergency \nrule allowing the use of the sulfur credits for 2005 in this year. This \nadditional flexibility in the use of sulfur credits would not result in \nany greater emission of sulfur dioxide over the 2-year period of 2004-\n2005, but would add to the ability to bring more gasoline into the \nUnited States so that consumer are not paying more than they should.\n  While some of the preceding actions show how fuel prices can be \ntemporarily moderated by lowering barriers to fuels already on world \nmarkets this summer, we need to get our national fuels systems in order \nfor the longer term. Although the administration published a general \nreport on national energy policy in 2001, our country still lacks a \nfocused national fuels strategy. Current policies on issues such as the \noperation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--SPR--are simply outdated. \nThe administration has made no progress towards stopping and reversing \nthe increasing balkanization of U.S. fuel markets--a balkanization that \nhits every consumer right in the pocketbook with higher fuel prices \nthan necessary. And there has been no attempt over the past few years \nto build consensus around a balanced approach to both increase the \nsupply of refined fuels and increase the efficiency of our oil use \neconomy-wide.\n\n  These changed circumstances and new needs call out for a number of \npolicy initiatives that should be undertaken as part of a broader \nnational fuels strategy.\n  First, such a strategy should look at how conservation in \ntransportation fuel use can be enhanced. Instead of debating on the \nmerits of any single approach to the problem, it would be more \nproductive if the administration were to set a policy target for itself \nof oil savings it would like to achieve economy-wide over the next 10 \nyears. This would give the administration and the public a yardstick to \nevaluate the effectiveness of various policy proposals. Such a target \nwould likely be broadly supported across the political spectrum. In the \nSenate, one such proposal for an oil savings target was supported last \nyear by a vote of 99 to 1. I recommend that the administration set such \na policy target, after public consultation.\n  Second, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection \nAgency should start addressing the need for further refining capacity \nin areas, such as the east coast, that are now importing gasoline to \nkeep pace with demand. States, localities, consumer groups, \nenvironmental groups, and industry should all be invited to participate \nin a process to identify measures to facilitate capacity expansion. For \nsuch a process to succeed, there would have to be credible actions \nongoing at the same time to spur increased conservation. But that is if \nthat is possible. I believe that such a process would identify the \ncurrent barriers to building additional refining capacity, such as \npermitting and financial disincentives. I would recommend that the \nadministration immediately set such a process in motion, and that it \nissue a report to the Congress and the public within 6 months, \nidentifying specific options for improving regulatory practices or \nstreamlining permitting processes in order to increase U.S. refining \ncapacity.\n  Third, the administration needs to review its policies regarding the \noperation and use of the SPR. Right now, we lack ``rules of the road'' \nfor tapping the SPR that are clearly defined and clearly understood. As \nI have pointed out in previous letters to the Department of Energy, a \nclearer understanding of how SPR oil will be managed in a new \nenvironment of volatile markets and increasingly higher prices would \nprovide more certainty to the market.\n  Fourth, when fuel pries are tight, product flexibility is crucial. If \na region needs more gasoline than its refineries can produce, or if a \nrefinery or pipeline shuts down unexpectedly, flexibility becomes the \nkey factor in determining the speed at which motor fuels can be \nsupplied from other regions to meet the shortfall and to dampen the \nprice spikes to consumers.\n  The proliferation of boutique fuel specifications across the country \nhas greatly reduced the overall flexibility and efficiency of our fuel \nsystem. It is a major factor in the increasing fragility of our fuel \nsystem to price spikes.\n  The Clean Air Act authorized States to regulate fuels through \nfederally approved State implementation plans in order to attain a \nnational air quality standard. That was the right policy, but the \nimplementation of the policy has been flawed. There are now dozens of \ndifferent kinds of fuels being required by different States, all with \nFederal approval, leading to more than 110 different formulations of \nthese boutique fuels throughout the United States. These 110-plus \ndifferent fuel types make the use of existing transportation \ninfrastructure for fuels much less efficient, and, correspondingly, \nmore expensive to run. Those costs get passed directly on to consumers. \nThe large number of types also limits flexibility in product \ndistribution, particularly if a disruption occurs. Consumers pay for \nthat lack of flexibility whenever there is a price spike.\n  The President's 2001 energy policy report directed the EPA to study \n``opportunities to maintain or improve the environmental benefits of \nState and local boutique clean fuel programs while exploring ways to \nincrease the flexibility of the fuel distribution infrastructure,\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nimprove fungibility, and provide added gasoline market liquidity.''\n  There have been 3 years since that directive was given to the EPA, \nand as far as I know the administration has not taken any significant \nsteps to reduce the growth of these boutique fuels. This is a major \nfailing which we need to address at this time.\n  I believe it is time to take real action. The administration can do \nthat. It has the authority under current law in each of these areas I \nhave cited.\n  The President should direct the Administrator of the EPA, with \ntechnical assistance as needed from the Secretary of Energy, to require \nrevisions of State implementation plans to reduce the overall number of \nfuel specifications by at least a factor of 5 and, preferably, closer \nto a factor of 10.\n  Finally, a recommendation aimed at preventing fuel shock prices in \ngasoline or other fuels would be for the administration to encourage \nthe IEA, the International Energy Agency, to direct the strategic stock \nmodeling methods.\n  The IEA monthly oil market reports are critically important to the \nglobal oil market. The supply, demand, and stock figures that the IEA \nprojects each month literally turn markets. Energy experts tell us that \nthe method the IEA uses to calculate monthly demand and supply figures \nis flawed, that it encourages OPEC to undershoot the market in terms of \nthe amount of crude oil it supplies to the world. A revision of the \nstrategic stock calculation methodology could fix this.\n  The root of the flaw lies in the fact that the current IEA market \nreport treats stocks of oil in the major consuming countries as a fixed \nand variable amount. This treatment of stocks is not realistic. Its \neffect on IEA models is to bias toward understating the amount of oil \nOPEC needs to produce for the world market, the so-called ``Call on \nOPEC.'' Recently it appears that OPEC has given great credence to the \n``Call on OPEC,'' in determining what it would supply to the market.\n\n  Further, key OPEC nations, such as Saudi Arabia, have at times \ninterpreted IEA data to mean the IEA will not punish certain behavior \nby the cartel to maintain high prices so long as they meet these ``Call \non OPEC'' levels.\n  Given the importance of this IEA forecast methodology, it is crucial \nit be based on the best possible real-world data and not on a static \nand unrealistic treatment of stock levels. A more real-world treatment \nof stocks in IEA oil forecast methodology would alleviate some of the \ntensions which many analysts believe is keeping crude prices higher \nthan they otherwise might have been.\n  For this reason, I recommend the administration engage vigorously \nwith the IEA to improve the realism of the models underlying its \nmonthly oil market report. That change, though seemingly esoteric, \ncould make a real difference, for instance, at the pump to Americans. \nThe United States is a leading member of IEA, so our ability to \ninfluence and improve this key market driver is very great.\n  Carrying out the 13 recommendations I have outlined today will help \nto relieve some of the pressure on our fuel markets that are affecting \nconsumers, adversely affecting them and perhaps will continue to \nadversely affect them in the coming days and weeks. These \nrecommendations could set the stage for a long-term improvement in our \nfuels security.\n  My colleagues should know that none of the 13 recommendations require \nnew legislative authority from Congress. The President already has the \npower to implement these recommendations. I urge him do so.\n  I put these recommendations in a letter to the President, a copy to \nthe Secretary of Energy, and a letter I have sent today. I hope he will \nconsider these commonsense and effective recommendations and take \naction on them. I will come back to the Senate floor once we receive a \nresponse to that letter and hopefully report on the progress being made \nto help bring down both the cost of natural gas and the cost of \ngasoline at the pump before this summer is on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from the great \nState of New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. While Senator Bingaman is still on the floor, might I \nsay, Senator, we have an energy bill pending that has received 58 votes \nin a cloture situation. Some like it. Some don't like it. You are \nsomewhere in the middle and you want to change it.\n  I wonder, in light of your talking today, at least what I heard, \npositive about the problems and solutions, and I also heard a couple of \ncomments that made me feel good--you think we ought to produce more \nfrom our public lands which is very good and I am very proud of that--I \nwonder why the Senator would not agree to a number of amendments so we \ncan get the energy bill passed? Even if you were to say you need 13, \nyou got 13 proposals, even if you agreed to 13--I don't know how many \nof those are legislative--but it would be helpful.\n  I wonder if the Senator has any thoughts about that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to the question, first, let \nme say these are 13 recommendations that do not require legislation. \nThese are all recommendations that I believe the President has full \nauthority to implement and enact under current law.\n  The purpose of my letter to him and this statement today in the \nSenate was to urge he do right now what can be done under existing law \nto help deal with these problems.\n  As far as the energy bill is concerned, it is my view that if the \nmajority leader wishes to bring the energy bill to the Senate floor and \nis willing to allow Senators to offer amendments, then we should \ncertainly proceed in that way.\n  I don't think it is realistic, and I certainly told my colleague from \nNew Mexico and others this repeatedly, I don't think it is realistic to \nbe requiring Democratic Senators to limit amendments at this stage \nsince the bill that will be coming to the floor was written without the \ninput of Democrat Senators.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say, Senator, your concern about the impact has \ngone on so long that one wonders how much impact you really need. We \ndid expose this entire proposal, put it online so everyone could see \nit. Maybe your staff or you did not see it, but we did that as a new \nway to expose it. Then we had a meeting and you had every opportunity \nto offer amendments. And you did.\n  You and your staff somehow got in your craw here that because you \nwere not sitting around the table when it was drafted, that is \njustification for you to remain against this bill.\n  Let me state, it is not Bill Frist's problem that we do not have this \nbill. Has the Senator seen what happens to bills that have an open end \non amendments? I think the Senator has. The Senator is a very good \nSenator. They get nowhere because all kinds of amendments are \noffered. That is what will happen to this bill.\n\n  I say to the Senator and his staff, you can offer 25 amendments \naround to people so they can offer them. They are not very important, \nbut they can offer them. I say to the Senator, I did not mean you \nwould, but that can happen, and they would not be important. They would \nmake us vote on them, and we would get no bill.\n  Now, the minority leader has been urging we move ahead. I am very \nproud of him. He has been urging that you limit the amendments, and it \nis on deaf ears.\n  So I say to the Senator, I want to tell you, in all honesty, for you \nto come down here, having had your people research and blame the \nPresident of the United States for these problems--which is essentially \nwhat you have done--you have found everything that somebody thinks the \nPresident could do, and you listed them. I am going to go look at \nthem--because it is not the President's responsibility--and I am going \nto come down here and answer them.\n  I believe what we are going to find is that this country is \ndependent, and we will stay dependent if we do those 13 things you have \nlisted that do not require any legislative assistance.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Now, having said that, I would start with a chart, if I had one, \nsaying what the Senate can do, in cooperation with the House, instead \nof what the President can do. Then I would say, the Senate does not \nwant to do anything, and then I would say, some Senators want to do \nthings; and I would name them. Then I would say, but some do not; and I \ndo not know if I would name them, but you could conclude who does not \nwant to.\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\n  Now, I want to tell you, you can give all the speeches you want about \nthe crude oil dependency of the United States. That is what makes \ngasoline. I do not think anybody, sorry to say, including my good \nfriend from New Mexico, has a real solution to that problem.\n  We are 70-percent dependent, and it is growing. If anybody thinks \nthey have a solution to that problem--I understand some people say, \nwhy, the President, he ought to get these countries around the world to \nproduce more. Well, the President is not a miracle man. They do not \nwant to produce more, because if they produce less they make more \nmoney. What are you going to do about that?\n  The only one that maybe would is Iraq. If they get over this problem, \nmaybe they will say: Boy, we need a lot of money. We will put more \ncrude oil on the market. But I will bet you, if they do, somebody will \ncut production. What can the United States do about it? This is not \nAmerica doing it; it is some foreign country.\n  So we hear more and more people say we ought to stay out of \nforeigners' business; right? They are against anything that would be \ninvolved. I am not suggesting that we be involved in any fisticuffs-\ntype way, but I do not see how somebody, including the President, can \nfix that problem for the time being.\n  I am very hopeful some of the price spikes that have come with new \nregulations--and I am not saying it is the entire add-on, but it is \nsignificant--will kindly stabilize and will not be adding to it.\n  I do not have it with me today, but if I speak again I will put it \nin: How much of the cost increase is ours because of new additive \nrequirements to gasoline, especially in certain huge States? I am not \nopposed to that, if that is what they want. That is what we voted on. \nBut if that causes a 10- or 15-cent increase, then we ought to know \nabout it. It is big. It is not the whole thing.\n  Let me repeat, there is nobody who has come up with a solution--\nwhether we bring the Democrats into the hearing or whether we did not \nor we bring them in the way we have--we do not have any proposals of \nany significance that show us how to get more crude oil of any \nsubstance. That is why it is most important and almost ludicrous when \npeople write editorials about this Energy bill and they start off by \nsaying it does not do anything about gasoline.\n  Well, the only thing we can do about gasoline is, one, have less cars \nin America. Wouldn't that be nice? You try to do that. How many votes \nare you going to get? Ration cars in America; it is a new bill. It \nwould not get one vote.\n  The other way is to mandate that we use littler cars. We tried. I am \nnot saying I did. But we voted on it.\n  What am I supposed to do as chairman of the Energy Committee? The \nSenate does not want to do it. They say what we are doing now is moving \nin the right direction and we are not going to do anything else.\n  So the President says, well, at least get started with a hydrogen \nengine. We did that in this Energy bill. We put in a lot of \nauthorization money, and we are probably going to spend a bunch of it \ntelling the major car companies: Produce, produce hydrogen cars or the \nnext generation of cars, and we will be your partner. Now, that is not \nbad.\n  Having said that, let me say what I would like the Senate to be part \nof. What the Senator from New Mexico would like the Senate to be part \nof is to produce a bill that says to the American people: We got in \ntrouble once by depending more and more and more on crude oil, until \ntoday it is gone. We are never going to get this back down to the 50-\npercent figure that the occupant of the chair used to talk about. It is \ngone.\n  But do you know what? Our people are getting burdened by something \nelse called natural gas. If they do not use natural gas in their house \nand have seen the increase, let me tell you, it just so happens that \nnatural gas is a tremendous product. Do you know what I mean? It has \ntremendous uses. We are sitting around waiting for 13 new powerplants \nin America.\n  I see present on the floor a Senator who used to come down and talk \nin favor of coal and the coal miners. Well, any growth in that is gone, \nexcept if this Energy bill passes it is not gone because there are \ntremendous resources put into developing new technology so we can use \nsome of that.\n  But, in the meantime, every single powerplant is waiting around to \nguzzle up natural gas. What do you think that is going to do? Bring the \nprice down? Of course not.\n  That is electricity. What else do we use? Has anybody bought \nfertilizers? Are there any farmers in the Senate? There is one sitting \nhere to my right. What has happened to fertilizer prices?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Doubled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Doubled in 1 year. Is that right? Doubled.\n\n  Now, there is nobody asking for an antitrust evaluation, that \nsomebody gypped them. These companies just put out the reality. A big \nportion of fertilizer is natural gas or the products therefrom.\n  We can do something about natural gas. We do not have to sit around \nsaying the President ought to do it. We ought to do it. Shame on us. It \nis right there in this Energy bill.\n  One, do you know where a lot of natural gas is? It is ours. Alaska. \nThis is not ANWR. This not an anti-environmentalist issue. We ought to \nproduce it. But it does not do any good to produce it because you have \nto use it. So you have to bring it all the way from Alaska down here \nand use it.\n  What does the Energy bill say? It says we are going to help make that \nhappen. In fact, the contracts to start the drilling and start the \npipeline to bring it down here will start within a very short period of \ntime after we get an Energy bill.\n  What will that be? It will be that three major companies will begin \nthe exploration and development of natural gas, and a pipeline to bring \nit into America and right into Chicago, IL.\n  We sit here with each day passing and we cannot do that because we \ncannot pass an Energy bill. My friend says: Well, we want to let \neverybody vote. Everybody has had votes, it would seem to me, on \nsomething as important as this. We could ask the Senators, how many \nvotes do you have? Then at least we could tell our leader it is not \ngoing to take forever. We have a limited amount of time.\n  He doesn't want to bring it up and take 3 weeks on it. The minority \nleader has been telling this Senator we are going to get it done. He \nhas heard me be rather questionable, not of him but of the reality.\n  In addition, on natural gas, there sits off our coast a huge \nrepository of natural gas. It doesn't belong to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait. \nIt belongs to us. We know it is there. But it is super deep. It is not \nlike the other wells we have drilled on the coast. It is super deep. \nGuess what. It has a huge royalty on it they have to pay America when \nthey produce a barrel or whatever the unit is of natural gas.\n  This Energy bill says that is too much. What would they do if we cut \nit? Do you know what we would do? The energy companies say they would \nstart drilling because they would be rather assured that with the risks \nthat are there, they will come out pretty good.\n  We sit around and complain. There it is, sitting in the Energy bill, \nnobody does it. That is two.\n  A third one was alluded to by my friend Senator Bingaman, although I \nthink I would disagree as to the scope, but he says we ought to produce \nmore off our Federal lands. Let me tell you, the Federal lands belong \nto all our people. We go out there and find oil or natural gas, and \nguess what happens. Big complaints. We should not be touching America's \ngreat property. We should not touch that surface. It should be there \nforever because it has been there forever. They don't let us do it, so \nwe are stuck with pretty much the inventory we have had.\n  At least the bill expedites the drilling, expedites the permitting, \nexpedites the production. And why wouldn't we pass that? Because we \ndon't want an Energy bill. Because we have something stuck in our head \nsomebody didn't get a full opportunity to participate in it. Maybe we \nought to call another meeting of the Energy Committee and bring them \nall in and let them all participate and then report out the bill. Then \nthey at least wouldn't have that constant drumbeating which they even \ntake to their conference to tell everybody, the committee Democrats got \nshafted.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n  I have told you all more than one time that is not true. Besides, if \nwe had done what they say, which we didn't, I ask Senator Grassley, how \nmany times have bills been produced when Democrats were in power and \nRepublicans--where the conferees produced it unilaterally? Does the \nSenator know of any? Many times. Many times Republicans produced a bill \nand then called in the Democrats and there is an argument and maybe \nthey make a change or the Democrats when they were in control produced \na bill in conference.\n  Isn't that right?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Or they issue it. They go to the press and say, we are \nfinished. And sometimes nobody even knows what they did. That is not \nthe case with this bill. They knew what we did. If they didn't, they \nweren't paying attention. We told them where it was, and it was all on \nthe Internet. We tried something new. We put it on the Internet.\n  The third thing we ought to do is take a real look, although this \nSenator hates this, that we are going to end up dependent more and more \nupon foreign countries for natural gas. I tell my friend, we are now \ndependent on crude oil. We will be here, if we don't do \nsomething, saying we are now over 50 percent dependent upon natural \ngas. That is generally called LNG, liquefied natural gas. It is hard to \ndo. It causes accidents. It wouldn't be done unless the price is very \nhigh. But in recent months, imports of this have popped up into \nterminals in Eureka, CA; Harpswell, ME; La Jolla, Baja, CA, Mexico; \nMobile, AL; Vallejo, CA; Searsport, ME; Falls River, MA. Every single \none has been blocked by local opposition.\n\n  I think local participation is terrific. But I also think having \nenough energy to run the country is terrific. And I don't like the idea \nwe are going to have LNG, but we are going to have lots of it. How many \nnatural gas powerplants will be built, I ask my staff, when we finish \nthis bill? Almost every future one, whatever the number, will be built \nfrom natural gas. We have already built a number of them, so it is the \nnumber built and all the future ones. That is a monster gobbling up of \nnatural gas.\n  This bill says, we can't do much about that. We can't stop it. But we \ncan produce alternative sources of electricity, the source that runs \nelectrical powerplants. We can have a clean coal program that for the \nfirst time does it right, and clean coal can be used some places in our \ncountry that won't have to use natural gas.\n  Before we are finished, we might get to the point where under certain \ncircumstances we could try a nuclear powerplant to see if we are not \nready, after years of delay and years of ridiculous objections, to get \none.\n  There are many more things to say. But I want to say that to come \ndown here and have charts saying the President of the United States \nisn't acting and if he would, he is the one who ought to fix these \nproblems is belied by the fact we can't vote on an Energy bill in the \nSenate. If it isn't good, amend it. The problem is, most of the things \nin this bill people want. They want them sufficiently to have a \nmajority vote. I know that because I didn't put this bill together in a \nvacuum. We asked people.\n  I forgot to mention by coincidence a great big spectrum of the \nAmerican economy gets helped by this bill. There are probably 40 \nSenators who don't like it, 42; 58 love it. That is, the production of \nethanol from corn and related products. Here sits Senator Grassley, one \nof the leaders in that cause. He isn't leading that cause just because \nhe is selfish about corn growers. He is leading that because it is a \ngood policy to produce a substitute for imported crude oil. But we have \na farming industry we are constantly having to bail out. We do a bill, \nand if 3 years pass without two emergency bills in the billions, then I \nhaven't been here. I have been hiding under a seat.\n  If this happens, it would add a third leg to the production of these \nkinds of products and the stabilizing of the price. Why don't we do it? \nThere are plenty of votes. But we don't want to vote on this Energy \nbill. Why don't we want to vote on it? We hear the same old thing, \nDemocrats weren't in the markup on the conference, and they should not \nbe burdened with having to vote for it.\n  It has been on the floor. It has been voted on. It was put on the \nInternet. I don't know how much more we can do. That no longer ought to \nbe an excuse.\n  I want to beg, I want to beg Senators on the other side, I want to \nbeg Senator Daschle to get Democrats to agree, and Senator Bingaman, to \na reasonable number of amendments. A reasonable number of amendments \nwill get all the issues they want, that you want, if you want to offer \namendments, get all the issues you want. I don't think you have any. \nBut if you can't get it up, what good does it do; right?\n  We don't know if there are 20 amendments or 50, but we think a \nreasonable number will address the controversial issues in this bill. \nIn fact, you let me go out of here, tell me, Senator, bring back the \ncontroversial issues, and I will bet you we will come so close to what \nthey really will be it will shock you. We know where the concern is. We \nknow why people in their interests don't want this bill. That is the \nway it is. If you come from a part of the country this doesn't help \nenormously, you have been trying to do an amendment and you don't win. \nIs that new? How many times have you had that, Senator Grassley?\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Very frequently.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have a bill and you work on it, and Senators \nquickly run down and say, my gosh, this isn't going to help my State. \nBut you cannot fix them all. So you proceed. They lose most of the \ntime, but they never give up. On and on. That is all right. But it \nends.\n  I would like the bill to get called up. I would like us to vote on \nit. I would like the American people to know the contents of the bill. \nI have given you some today, and I hope what we will do each day this \nweek and next week will bring down six or eight of the major policies, \nbig ones.\n  In this country, you cannot build new electric lines in certain \nplaces. You end up with what is called gridlock. You come this far and \nyou run into a State on the other side that says you cannot get any \nright-of-way under any circumstance unless the people agree. They are \nnot agreeing. Why should they? They don't want a pipeline, but America \nneeds it--or an electric line.\n  You know what we did in this bill, what I did as chairman? I got the \nmajority, including Republicans, to agree you go about your business \ntrying to get that done. But after a period of time, if you cannot, and \nit is found to be in the best interest of America, FERC will condemn \nyou on it. We haven't gotten too much guff on it. A lot of people say, \ndon't get the Federal Government involved. Who is going to do that? If \nwe come up to that line, OK, if you want more electricity, where are \nyou going to get it? That is a lot of places. It is fixed in this bill. \nI cannot do any more. There are a lot more and they are pretty good. \nYes, some are not so good.\n  Senator Grassley has made a big push for wind energy. One would \nwonder why Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee of the \nSenate, would do that. But his State has made a push for it. This bill \nhas a major new emphasis on wind energy. It is terrific. It continues \nthe subsidy we have had that has brought this industry into motion. But \ndo you know what? It is going to stop because what is needed to keep it \ngoing is in this bill.\n  It is the same for geothermal and solar. I don't know what else to \ndo. I have left it alone for a couple of months, thinking maybe \nsomebody would do something. All I can do is, sooner or later, come \ndown and say it is just not right--not right for our country, not right \nto blame other people when it is right smack in our lap. So I think we \nought to get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending bill is S. 1637.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. May I inquire through \nthe Chair, is the Senator here to speak on the bill?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No. Right now I am not going to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be happy for him to proceed if he wishes.\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to wait a while, because I have spoken so \nmany times, I ought to give other Members an opportunity.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, has the Pastore rule run its course?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has.\n\n\n                        Springtime in Washington\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was not long ago--just a few short weeks, \nin fact--that Washington was cloaked in the somber palette of winter, a \nchiaroscuro of black, charcoal, burnt umber, and paler shades from snow \nwhite to icy slush.\n\n       In the bleak mid-winter\n       Frosty wind made moan,\n       Earth stood hard as iron,\n       Water like a stone;\n       Snow had fallen, snow on snow,\n       Snow on snow,\n       In the bleak mid-winter,\n       Long ago.\n\n  Thus wrote the nineteenth century poet Christina Rossetti.\n  Despite the threat of a last snowstorm here, and large snowstorms in \nthe Northeast, today presents a very different picture. It is as if an \nold black-and-white photograph has been gently tinted by a master's \nhand. A soft, green mist has crept over barren fields and dormant \nlawns. A rosy blush, tenderly applied, warms the tree tops with the \nbuds of new leaves. Spangles of color, royal crocus and cheerful \ndaffodil, sparkle among the decaying leaves. Iron-hard earth, now \npliable, exudes the lush scent of fertile earth, and water, released \nfrom its frozen prison, gushes merrily over the stones. The stark \ninfrastructure of life, the bare branches and simple undulations of the \nearth, are transformed each day by the miracle of the awakening season \nthat even a temporary return to colder temperatures cannot stay.\n  As Robert Burns wrote:\n\n       Again rejoicing Nature sees\n       Her robe assume its vernal hues,\n       Her leafy locks wave in the breeze,\n       All freshly steep'd in morning dews.\n\n  On this past Saturday, March 20, Spring began. I am always glad to \nwelcome it. Erma welcomed it, too. As the Earth fills with life, we can \neach share in that sense of renewal. Like the plants around us, we can \ntake in the energy of the Sun and transform it into energy and \nenthusiasm for life.\n  It feels so good to take a few minutes to take a walk with my little \ndog, Trouble, or Baby, as I have nicknamed her--to take a walk or just \nstand and bask in the warmth of a sunny window and feel miles away from \nthe pressures of work. To see a flock of robins busy on the lawn, \nkeenly listening for the subterranean noises of an earthworm, takes me \nback to boyhood dreams of sunny afternoons long ago spent rediscovering \nthe outdoors after a winter spent inside. The soft song of the \nwhippoorwill recalls those first nights sleeping with the windows \nopened wide, cool breezes fanning the curtains, and the smell of sheets \nthat had been dried on a line with clothes pins--remember the clothes \npins? I can smell the earth of a newly tilled garden on a hillside, a \nlovely scent in the early days before the weeds come on strong.\n  As Mary Howitt wrote:\n\n       Buttercups and daisies,\n       Oh, the pretty flowers;\n       Coming ere the spring time,\n       To tell of sunny hours\n       When the trees are leafless;\n       When the fields are bare;\n       Buttercups and daisies\n       Spring up here and there.\n\n  This year there is so much to distract us from the simple pleasures \nof a springtime afternoon. The omnipresent undercurrent of terror \nthreats, the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the \ndifficult budget and trade issues, and the building election battle--\nall of these vie for our attention, and all of these deserve our \nattention. But spring does put all of these great issues into a larger \ncontext, reminding us of the permanence and the adaptability of the \nEarth and the even-paced cadence of life. For all that men do to each \nother and to the Earth, the seasons continue to roll onward, \ninexorable.\n  We, too, would do well to take a longer view and spend our effort \nagainst the long term, like a gardener planting perennial flowers or \ncarefully siting a young tree, mindful that it will still be growing \nmany decades hence. We must not be deterred by short-term setbacks or \nbe daunted by the size of our problems. With discipline and consistent \neffort, we have beaten large deficits before. We have survived greater \nwars before. We must focus on our Nation like a good gardener focuses \non his plot, improving the soil, pruning the weeds and deadwood, \nadjusting our seeding as conditions change, always mindful that a good \neffort this year builds toward a good harvest and a better year next \nyear. The Nation we want our children and grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren to grow up in is like a well-tended garden--rich and \nproductive, vibrant with life and opportunity, a place of beauty for \nall to admire and emulate.\n\n       Who loves a garden\n       Finds within his soul\n       Life's whole;\n       He hears the anthem of the soil\n       While ingrates toil;\n       And sees beyond his little sphere\n       The waving fronds of heaven, clear.\n\n  Thus wrote Louise Seymour Jones. She captured well the closeness to \nthe Creator that being in nature brings. Even within the fortresses of \nstone, concrete, steel, and glass that surround us in Washington, \nspring finds ways to lighten our hearts. The pansies that smile at us \nfrom flower beds outside, the dandelions that invade even the smallest \ncracks in the pavement, bring nature's message home--take heart, spring \nis here at last. And to those facing the deep drifts of late season \nsnowstorms farther north, be patient. Spring is coming.\n\n       Surely as cometh the Winter I know\n       There are Spring violets under the snow.\n\n  So observed R.H. Newell. In the Northeast, then, there must be a sea \nof violets waiting for the melt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the Senator from West \nVirginia reminding us that spring is going to come, soon we hope. It is \nalways a pleasure to have his spring speech. It causes us to spring \nforward with enthusiasm.\n  The reason I rise today, however, is to address this issue of FSC, \nwhich is the tax bill that recently was not allowed to go forward \nbecause of failure to get cloture. Cloture, of course, is a weapon that \ncan be used by the minority in the Senate for the purposes of avoiding \nacting on legislation. It is a very legitimate tool, and it is \nsomething that has historically served the Senate well. But its purpose \nshould not be to stop legislation which is critical to American \nworkers.\n  The FSC bill, if it is not approved, will lead directly to the loss \nof jobs in the United States. We have, regrettably, found ourselves in \na situation where the World Trade Organization, to which we are a \nsignator and in which we participate, has ruled that we, as a nation, \nare in violation of the rules of international commerce.\n  We fought this case aggressively. We used our legal rights. We lost \nin a court of jurisdiction, which we acknowledge and which we respect.\n  As a result of losing that case, it is very clear the European \nCommunity, specifically, has the right to assess tariffs, duties, or \npenalties against our products as they move into Europe. The practical \neffect of those duties is that our products will be less competitive. \nThe practical effect of them being less competitive is fewer of them \nwill be sold. The effect of fewer of them being sold is that fewer \nAmericans will be employed to produce them. The bill before us today is \na jobs bill.\n  So why was the weapon of the filibuster used against it? Why would \nthe Democratic membership of this body, many Members who have come to \nthis floor on innumerable occasions, lament the state of the economy, \nlament the actions of this administration relative to the issue of the \ncreation of jobs, expressing at least formal concern, if not \nsubstantive concern, about the fact that the economic recovery that we \nare participating in has not created as many jobs as historic economic \nrecoveries usually create? Why would the Democratic Party in this \nCongress, in\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\nthis Senate, bar our ability to pass a bill which would correct a \nproblem which, if not corrected, will lead directly to the loss of \nAmerican jobs? It makes no sense at all.\n  The only reason they appear to have done it is because they wish to \nmake a political point on an issue which is tangential to and not \nrelated at all to the issue of the jobs which will be lost as a result \nof failure to pass this bill which corrects tax policies and gives \nrelief to the workers who will lose their jobs if this bill is not \npassed.\n  It is purely a political decision on their part to try and highlight \ntheir concern about a regulation which is being issued in the Labor \nDepartment, which has not yet been finalized but which they believe is \nan inappropriate action. This regulation deals with overtime pay and \nthe attempt by the Labor Department to straighten out what is a morass \nof regulations on the issue of overtime pay, which has led to a \nlitigation frenzy and has also created significant costs in overhead to \nthe community of entrepreneurs in this country who are trying to create \njobs for Americans.\n  Independent of that, this regulation has no bearing at all on the WTO \ncase, on the duty issue, and on the jobs which will be lost if this tax \nbill is not passed.\n  This regulation is not even in place yet, has not even been formally \nwritten yet. We do not even know what is in it in its final form. Yet \nthe Democratic membership of this Senate is willing to hold up this \nbill over a regulation which is not yet finalized, the language of \nwhich we have not yet seen, in order to try to make a political point, \nwhich political point is costing Americans jobs because we cannot \nrespond to the ruling of the WTO and create an atmosphere which will \nallow our people to sell overseas without being subject to a punitive \nduty.\n  I think this action is callous on the part of the minority in the \nSenate. This action of using the filibuster to stop this bill, which \nwould allow more jobs in America to be created, is callous because it \nis so politically motivated. Its only purpose appears to be to make a \npoint on a regulation which is not yet even finalized. So we find \nourselves in a position where for literally months Members of the other \nparty have claimed that this administration's economic policies have \nled to a jobless recovery. Some of them do not even admit that we are \nin a recovery, but to those who are honest enough to say we are at \nleast in a recovery, they say it is a jobless recovery, and they come \nto the floor and claim that this administration has no sensitivity to \nthe needs of American workers because of this jobless recovery. Yet at \nthe same time they filibuster a bill which, if it is not passed, will \nabsolutely lead to the loss of jobs in America, manufacturing jobs \nspecifically.\n\n  So one has to question whether all the presentations on this floor \nwhich have occurred before now, which have claimed concern that the \njobless recovery is affecting America and is inappropriate and that \nthis administration is not doing enough in the area of creating jobs--\none has to wonder if all of those claims were not crocodile tears \nbecause if they were legitimate, if they were real, if there was a real \nconcern about the creation of jobs on the other side of the aisle in \nthis Senate, this bill would not be blocked today.\n  It is incomprehensible that a bill that should have gone through this \nSenate with no opposition, a bill that should have passed almost \nperfunctorily to address the adverse decision of the WTO against us, \nbut in order to correct that problem so that the duties which are going \nto be levied against our manufacturers would not occur, that that type \nof bill would have been stopped and would have been stopped over such a \npolitical exercise. We have already voted on this issue relative to the \nLabor Department regulation once, and the regulation still is not \nfinal. Are we to continue to vote on it with all legislation that comes \nbefore the Senate or should we not take the proper approach, which is \nlet the Labor Department make their finding, let them issue their \nregulation, the final regulation, and then once we have had a chance to \nactually read the regulation--I know that might come as a shock that \nsome people would like to read the regulation once it comes forward--\nthen if the other side of the aisle still has concerns about it, there \nare a number of courses of action they can take, including an expedited \nprocedure to repeal the regulation which we have as a matter of process \nin this Senate.\n  To hold up this bill over a regulation which is not final, the \nlanguage of which this Senate has not had a chance to look at because \nit has not even been printed--this is a bill that will directly impact \nthe ability of Americans to hold and keep their jobs--is a callous and \ninappropriate action by the other side of the aisle, purely politics.\n  Yes, we are in a Presidential season and, yes, we all are \nsophisticated enough to understand that much of what happens on the \nSenate floor and the Congress for the next 8 months will have huge \npolitical overtures and tinges to it, but on this issue, where there is \nno legitimate difference of opinion as to the need to pass this bill, \nor there should not be, on this issue which is going to have an \nimmediate present impact on people whose jobs would be lost as a result \nof these duties being levied on this bill, we ought to set the politics \naside and pass the legislation.\n  The filibuster ought to be stopped. We ought to move forward. It is \ntime to move on with this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for the \nbill he has put forward, the JOBS bill. I want to take a few minutes to \ntalk to my colleagues about the impact of this bill, if we can get it \nthrough. I am very disappointed we were not successful on the cloture \nmotion.\n  In relation to the impact on jobs, particularly in rural areas, such \nas in some of the areas of my State of Kansas, the chairman has done a \nmasterful job of crafting a jobs bill that is a true jobs bill. It is \ngoing to create jobs.\n  Let me give you a couple examples that will have a direct impact in a \nState such as mine in the manufacturing sector. That is the area in \nwhich we are trying to create jobs. One of them is in the aircraft \nindustry. He extends the service rules on bonus depreciation for 1 \nyear. That is to say, if the product is put in service a year later, we \nare going to still be able to use the bonus depreciation.\n  You may say: Well, big deal that you can do that. In the business of \naircraft manufacturing you need some time. It takes some time to build \nthe aircraft. It takes time to order up all the subparts. My aircraft \nindustry people--which fan out from Wichita to several surrounding \nStates--say by putting in a bonus depreciation last year, they tripled \nthe level of sales they had prior to that. And by extending the bonus \ndepreciation time period of putting the airplane actually into service, \nwe are going to extend that life expectancy for us to get increasing \naircraft sales. They say this is a must thing for them to increase and \nto continue the trajectory back into job creation in aircraft \nmanufacturing.\n  The chairman put this in. There is a zero cost associated with it in \nthe bill. Absolutely, without this we lose manufacturing jobs in \nWichita and the surrounding communities that reach out to several \nsurrounding States. It is in the bill. We have to have this or we lose \njobs.\n  The other thing the chairman did that was magnificent that affects \nabout 12 States in particular--this is going to be a key job creator in \nan area of the country where it has been tough to create jobs--has to \ndo with counties that have been losing population. While the overall \ncountry has grown in population, and while my State of Kansas has grown \nin population, half of the counties in my State have lost population \nover the last 20 years.\n  As we have mechanized in agriculture, as agriculture has concentrated \nin larger farms, larger agribusiness enterprises, we have lost job \nopportunity, we have lost people in agriculture--the field I came up \nin, the field my parents and one of my brothers still farm in. But we \nhave lost jobs in half of the counties, lost population in half of the \ncounties in Kansas.\n  The chairman included in this JOBS amendment for the first time in \nrecent history, if not the first time ever, some opportunities to be \nable to create jobs and economic incentives for counties that have been \nlosing population. Key States that benefit are North Dakota,\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\nSouth Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Iowa, \nMissouri, Minnesota, Montana, States that sweep throughout the Middle \nWest. The Great Plains area has many counties that have lost \npopulation.\n  What did the chairman do? He kindly put in a provision we have \nstarted and put forward. We have a bipartisan bill called the New \nHomestead Act, creating economic incentives for people to move into \nareas that have been depopulated, and saying that a county, if it \nqualifies, gets this economic incentive.\n\n  To qualify, you had to have lost 10 percent of your population over \nthe last 20 years. The New Homestead Act is a bipartisan bill we have \nbeen pushing for some period of time.\n  The chairman included the initial provision of a rural investment tax \ncredit in the managers' amendment, as well as a qualified rural small \nbusiness investment credit.\n  What would this do? These sections provide a credit with a present \nvalue of 70 percent of qualified expenditures on newly constructed \nrural investment buildings, and a 30-percent tax credit for \nexpenditures on starting or expanding a business. These are in counties \nthat have lost 10 percent of their population over the last 20 years.\n  I can tell you, as I have traveled across Kansas, as I have gone into \nthose counties that have seen, year after year, population decline; \nthat have seen, year after year, declines in their K through 12 public \neducation schools; that have seen, year after year, younger people \nmoving out saying: I would love to live here but there are no jobs; \nthat have seen, year after year, people saying: Well, I guess that is \nthe trend we are in--when they look at these economic opportunities to \nlocate in a place that has been depopulating, they are saying now that \nis something that will work, that is something that is going to create \nsome opportunity, some hope, jobs, and, yes, people moving back into \nthese counties that have lost so much population throughout the High \nPlains.\n  This is a first step. It is not everything I wanted, but the chairman \nput it in the managers' amendment. This will create jobs and \nopportunities in some of the toughest areas in the country to create \nthose jobs and opportunities--places that have been losing population, \nin highly rural areas, far away from urban areas, in places where we \nhave not been able to put forward a decent set of proposals of \nsomething that is going to work.\n  We have for years put in place employees to try to create rural \nopportunities, to encourage people to move back to rural areas. We have \ntried to do a lot of different things. When I was secretary of \nagriculture in Kansas, I even worked with a group just to document and \nto list all of the rural development programs that are available to \npeople in Kansas. We had a book that was a half inch thick of State and \nFederal programs that are targeted at rural development and creating \nrural jobs. As we created all of those programs, we have still \ncontinued to see the population decline and the job opportunities \ndecline and communities decline. People say: What are we going to do?\n  What we put forward was a bipartisan bill to create economic \nincentives such as we used in urban areas. When we were seeing the \nurban cores of our country losing population, losing economic vitality, \nwe said, let's create economic opportunity. We did it in Washington, \nDC. We put forward a list: OK, we will have an enterprise zone, a tax \ncredit situation in Washington, DC. We put in a $5,000 tax credit for \nfirst-time home buyers to get people to move back into the area. We put \ntogether a series of economic incentives, and these have worked.\n\n  So for all those years we created these rural development programs, \nthe thing we were not listening to was: How did people locate in the \nHigh Plains in the first place? The Homestead Act. Why did they go \nthere? Economic opportunity. If I go out to this region, and I settle \non 160 acres, and I stay there for 5 years, it is mine. We had millions \nof people move out to do that.\n  The New Homestead Act is trying to model that same issue saying, what \nis the answer? It is not a Government recruitment program. It is \ncreating a series of economic incentives. And that has worked in our \nurban cores. It has worked in the rural areas before. It will work here \nagain.\n  The chairman has it in his mark. Unfortunately, we are not getting \nthis bill to the floor. We are not being able to vote on the JOBS bill. \nThis has the starting edge of the opportunity to create jobs and \neconomic vitality in a region of the country where we have had the most \ndifficulty doing this.\n  I applaud the chairman for putting this in the bill in the managers' \namendment. It is a start. We want more economic incentives in this \narea. It will create jobs and opportunities. We have to get this up to \nvote on it, to create these opportunities.\n  I am most disappointed we were not able to get cloture through so we \ncould get a chance to propel this issue forward. I say to my colleagues \nwho voted against cloture, at some point in time we are going to have \nto deal with this issue, with this tax bill. We are being hit by a \ntrade case--everybody knows about this--from Europe that we have lost. \nWe have to make these changes. At some point in time either the tariff \nagainst our goods is going to rise, rise, rise, and we are going to \nlose market, market, market in the process, or we are going to pass \nthis bill.\n  So we are going to have to pass this bill. Why not do it now when we \ncan create the incentives, we can create the jobs and the \nopportunities, do things such as a portion of the New Homestead Act \nthat helps create these opportunities in some of the most difficult \nareas to create jobs and economic vitality and do it now and early when \nwe can get some advantage out of moving this forward? I don't \nunderstand why we would want to hurt that.\n\n  I want to back up to an earlier point I made. I want to press this \nfurther. Going into 9/11, the aircraft production industry, the \nconstruction industry, the people who make aircraft--Cessna, \nBombardier, Learjet, Raytheon, Boeing, the large commercial airliners--\nthey were going into a soft marketplace because the recession was \nstarting in the country prior to 9/11. Their orders were tailing down \nat that point. They are frequently a leading economic indicator of what \nis happening. As corporate profits were going down, a lot of their \norders were going down. As the airline industry was not making money, \nthe aircraft purchases, the orders that were coming to Boeing were \ngoing down. Then we had 9/11, and it was a brick wall. It fell. \nBusiness in aircraft plummeted at that point in time.\n  What we saw in the aircraft manufacturing industry was a precipitous \nfall off of employment of 30 percent across the board. Not quite \neverybody, but virtually across the board had big layoffs. I was \nmeeting with the industry and asking what can we do. And they were \nsaying: We have to get the economy moving forward again. We need to \nmake sure these jobs don't move overseas because when we have a \ndifficult situation, there are always people around the world trying to \nget aircraft manufacturing jobs. They are the highest wage, highest \nskilled manufacturing jobs in the country. A lot of places want them.\n  They were saying: We need to work to make sure we have enough \nresearch dollars getting out the next wave of products so when the \nindustry turns back up, we will be there with the new products that are \nbetter, that fit the needs of our customers more. So we put more money \nin research. And we did that this past year. It was an important thing \nto do so we don't get somebody else technologically jumping ahead of us \nand taking the industry over.\n  This last year they said to me that an absolute thing we just have to \nhave now to get the industry to take off is bonus depreciation. With \nthat, we will be able to make airplanes sales. Without it, we will not. \nWe were able to get bonus depreciation on business equipment, which \nincluded aircraft used in business and business purposes. True to their \npoint--they have shown me the sales numbers--their sales numbers \ntripled from the point in time when we put in a bonus depreciation. As \npeople looked at the bottom line of the cost of the aircraft and they \nfigured in that bonus depreciation and it dropped the total expenditure \nthey were going to have to pay, sales soared. It kept them from laying \noff more people, and it gave some spunk to the industry. That is a \ngreat manufacturing industry. That was working and working well.\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\n  But then they started running into a problem that they were getting \nthe sales, but they had to put the aircraft into service by the end of \nthis year. By the time you place an order and are able to make the \naircraft and deliver it, they were hitting timelines they could not \nmake. This is a very complicated piece of machinery. It has to be done \nexactly right. It takes time. They would get the order, but their \nproduction schedule was such that they were not going to be able to get \nthis into service by the end of this year, December 31, 2004. They were \npleading with me and Members of this body saying: You have to extend \nthat date of service in a year so we can continue to get these orders \nin and then be able to manufacture them in time to be able to get them \nplaced and used.\n\n  They were saying: This is a killer. If you stop this, if you don't \nextend this bonus depreciation a year for putting the aircraft into \nservice, we are done. We can't take any more orders at this point in \ntime. We cannot get the craft made by the time it has to be in service \nto qualify for the bonus depreciation. We have to have it or else you \nare going to kill the recovery taking place in the aircraft \nmanufacturing industry.\n  I talked with the chairman a number of times. We got it in the \nmanagers' amendment. As I noted to my colleagues, it was scored at a \nzero for its fiscal impact on tax receipts, which is a great score. It \ndoesn't have an impact on our budgetary situation or on our budget \ndeficit. It only has a positive impact on employment. This is critical \nfor manufacturing jobs in America.\n  Let me give you one example of this creation of jobs. Consider the \nexample of Cessna, a great aircraft manufacturing company. It employs a \nsignificant number of Kansans in Wichita and the surrounding region. \nFor each plane that Cessna builds, they create 21 manufacturing jobs. \nUsing the Department of Labor aerospace workforce multiplier of three, \neach aerospace job creates three indirect supplier support jobs. That \nmeans for every aircraft that Cessna sells and builds, 63 jobs outside \nof Cessna are created on top of the 21 inside. This is all associated \ndirectly with bonus depreciation that is extended in this bill.\n  You have a series of direct high-wage, high-skilled manufacturing \njobs you are going to lose if we don't pass this bill. Extending this \nplaced-in-service date for bonus depreciation, which is what the \nsubstitute amendment does, means that equipment that has a longer \nplaced-in-service period will continue to thrive and help provide and \nmaintain jobs. We are just at springtime. We are just at the phase \nwhere this is starting to take off. And if you don't extend that period \nof time when it can be placed into service, you kill it before it can \nreally do the good it needs to.\n  Everybody in this body and in this country is concerned about jobs, \noutsourcing or, rather, overseas migration of jobs. Here is a classic \nmanufacturing job that overseas countries are seeking to take from us. \nAnd we have the direct opportunity to create and keep those jobs here, \nbut we have to pass this bill. We have to get it through. It will have \na direct impact on this. We have the numbers of what it has done. If we \ndon't pass the bill, it doesn't happen. We don't get these sales of \naircraft. We don't create these manufacturing jobs. They end up moving, \nif other places get established in this aircraft manufacturing business \nand they seek to do that, to Japan, Taiwan, China, Brazil. Other \ncompetitors seek to get these high-wage, high-skilled manufacturing \njobs out of America and into their countries.\n  We have the bill at hand to help us stop that at zero cost. We have \nto do this. It is ridiculous for us not to do it. And the sooner, the \nbetter, so that more of those sales can be made.\n  If you put this bill off 3 months, and we still have to operate--this \naircraft has to be placed into service by the end of this year, anybody \ntrying to sell a business aircraft has to go out to people and say: You \ncan order it and we will sell it to you now, and we hope bonus \ndepreciation will apply to you. But we can't guarantee that today \nbecause the Senate has not acted. If the Senate acts, yes, we can get \nthe aircraft manufactured. And you will have it in time with bonus \ndepreciation. But unless the Senate acts, we can't sell this based upon \nbonus depreciation because we can't get the craft made.\n  If you do this now and make this change in this tax provision, they \ncan start selling aircraft again. If you don't do it now, they have to \ngo out to people and say: We think we will get this done. We hope we \nwill get it done. But you can't bank on it. This aircraft, if you have \nbonus depreciation, it is at X price, but if you don't, it is much \nhigher. What is it going to do to sales? You are going to freeze a lot \nof sales. If you freeze sales, you freeze jobs. You have to make the \nsale to be able to manufacture this aircraft.\n  Bonus depreciation will allow companies to depreciate an additional \n50 percent of their new equipment in the first year of ownership. That \nwas a key economic jobs growth component of the Jobs and Growth Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of last year. However, to qualify for bonus \ndepreciation, the equipment must be purchased and placed in service \nbefore the end of this year. This is problematic for expensive \nequipment that takes a long time to manufacture, such as general \naviation aircraft.\n  We have to get this done. This is a direct jobs issue in my State, in \nthis region. Here is a classic example of what it does. I urge my \ncolleagues who voted against cloture, for whatever reason, to \nreconsider it based on what is happening in their States and also based \non these specific manufacturing jobs in the aircraft industry, or if \nthey are one of the 19 States that have a substantial area of their \nState that has lost population in the rural areas over the last 20 \nyears.\n  My State has lost 50 percent. Some States in the country have lost up \nto 80 to 90 percent of their counties. If you are a State in that area, \nyou would look at the provision that is the starting edge of this new \nHomestead Act--initial tax benefits--and try to attract capital, rural \ninvestment tax credit, into these declining population areas and say: I \nam going to have to pass this bill anyway because of the tariff issue \nwith the European Union. Here is a provision that helps my region--and \nthe sooner the better--on both the tariff issue dealing with Europe and \nthe rural development issue.\n  Let's do it now, get it passed. I know we are in a political season \nand people jockey politically. But we should not mess with this bill. \nIt meets the need everybody has been citing--the need for jobs and job \ncreation. We should not mess around with this bill. There are plenty of \nother bills that one could hold up, for whatever political issue, and \nthere are legitimate differences between the parties. This is not one \nthat we can afford to do it on. It has a penalty dealing with \nEuropeans, and it has a bonus dealing with us. We need to get this \nthrough now.\n  Mr. President, with that, I appreciate the opportunity to address \nthese items as it affects my State.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the day, there have been a number of \nstatements given about the importance of the bill upon which the Senate \nis now acting. I agree. We agree on this side that the bill that \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley worked to bring to the floor is \nvery important for our country. We think it is so important that we are \nwilling to basically say, on the overtime amendment, Senator Harkin \nwould take only 10 minutes. The majority can take 10 minutes, and we \nwill vote on it. There are a couple of other amendments, as we have \ndiscussed before. We did have 75 amendments. That list has been cut \ndown to approximately 10, and there will be short time agreements on \neach amendment.\n  We can complete this bill very quickly. It is, as has been said on a \nnumber of occasions by various Senators, a bill that is important. I \nacknowledge that. This overtime issue is also important. I refer to the \nWednesday--today--Congressional Quarterly. In this, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee indicates that he would prefer a vote. This is a \ndirect quote:\n\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\n\n       I prefer to vote things up or down and move on.\n\n  He said:\n\n       My feeling is that sometime we have got to face this issue. \n     So we might as well face it now.\n\n  Senator Grassley is absolutely right. This issue is not going to go \naway. It is an issue that affects 8 million Americans. It is whether or \nnot they are going to be paid overtime, whether or not the overtime is \ngoing to be taken away from them. We recognize the importance of this \nbill, but we recognize that we have an obligation to 8 million working \nmen and women in this country, and we are going to do everything we can \nto make sure that we have the ability to vote on it.\n  In September of last year, there was a vote on whether the President \nshould be able to move forward on this overtime proposal. The Senate \nsaid no. The House of Representatives voted, also by a large margin, \napproximately 225 votes, saying we agree with the Senate. They \ninstructed their conferees to follow the Senate's lead. This is a \nmatter stricken in the middle of the night without a single Democrat \npresent, and that is not the right way to legislate.\n  Senator Grassley is right. My feeling is that somehow we have to face \nthis issue, so we might as well face it now.\n  There have been statements on the floor today that this overtime \nissue is not important; how could this issue hold up what we are trying \nto do on this overall legislation? I said it last night and I say \nagain, if the majority thinks this is not a very important issue, then \nthey have made their case; we have made ours; let's vote on it. I am \nconvinced the vote would turn out just as it did last time. We would \nsend a message to the President that what he is doing on overtime is \nwrong.\n  Also, there have been a number of statements on the Senate floor that \nare simply not based on fact. I guess this is an effort to separate \nmyth from reality.\n  One myth that is floated here is that the Harkin overtime protection \namendment would prevent the Department of Labor from issuing any new \novertime regulations.\n  That is false. The facts are that the overtime protection amendment \nwould allow the Department of Labor to issue any new overtime \nregulation as long as it did not restrict the eligibility for overtime \npay. Overtime pay in this country has been the rule for more than half \na century. Why suddenly do we want to take it away? That would be \nwrong.\n  Another myth that has been propounded on the Senate floor over the \nlast few days is the amendment is not necessary because the \nadministration has no intention of taking away workers' overtime.\n  Reality: The administration has been fiercely opposing this amendment \nsince last summer, even pressuring the omnibus conferees to disregard \nthe rules of both the Senate and the House. If the proposed rules do \nnot cut overtime pay, why would the administration be opposing this \namendment so strongly?\n  Another myth: The administration's proposed rules do not cut \novertime.\n  That is false. The Department of Labor's economic analysis shows \nthese regulations do cut overtime. That is a fact. That is reality.\n  Another one of the myths floating around here that has been stated on \na number of occasions: The Department of Labor's plan would not cut \novertime for police officers.\n  That statement is false. In reality, the true facts are, if you talk \nto anyone outside the Department of Labor who has studied this issue, \nyou will find a consensus that these regulations will hit police \nofficers in their pockets. Police sergeants and low-level supervisors \nwill lose their overtime pay under these proposed rules. The fact that \na sergeant spends 90 percent of his time walking a beat will not matter \nif he performs any office or nonmanual work. This could mean \nsupervising officers or filling out a shift schedule causes you to lose \nyour overtime.\n  To confirm this, the International Union of Police Associations and \nthe National Organization of Police Organizations agree this proposal \nwill hurt their members. The Fraternal Order of Police submitted \ncomments to the Department of Labor last year arguing that many public \nsafety officers currently considered as nonexempt would be reclassified \nas exempt employees. This is under the proposed regulations. Secretary \nChao has assured the Fraternal Order of Police that the Department does \nnot intend to cut overtime pay for police officers. One thing we know \nfor sure, the Department of Labor will keep that promise if the Harkin \namendment is adopted.\n\n  Another myth: The Department of Labor has not proposed any changes \nthat would harm nurses or medical technicians.\n  This statement is categorically false. In reality, the fact is, \nregistered nurses and limited practical nurses who do not have 4-year \ncollege degrees cannot be denied overtime protection under a \nprofessional exemption. However, the Department of Labor has proposed \nchanges in the criteria for a professional exemption. The Department of \nLabor's own analysis said, and I quote directly from the Department of \nLabor:\n\n       The proposed rule allows work to be substituted for all or \n     part of the educational requirement for exemption of learned \n     professionals.\n\n  In other words, a nurse with a few years on the job would be \nreclassified as an exempt professional, in effect saying you do not \nhave a degree but we will consider you having a degree. The nurse--he \nor she--would lose their overtime pay.\n  Another myth: This administration is not trying to take away the \novertime of blue-collar workers.\n  That is false. In reality, the fact is, if a worker earns $65,000 a \nyear, that worker could be considered a highly compensated employee. In \nfact, $65,000 is still a lot of money, but today it is the mean annual \nincome of a white male worker in this country. So it is not really \nhighly compensated in the true sense of the word. It is the person who \nmakes an average living. Should not that person making an average \nliving be able to be compensated for his hard work? Should he not be \nable to be rewarded for hard work?\n  If that highly compensated employee has any say-so whatsoever in the \nemployment status of coworkers or has any supervisory duties, that \nworker could be exempt, that highly compensated employee who is also an \nadministrator or an executive. So it does not matter if you do not wear \na suit or pack your dinner in a lunch pail; if you earn the mean annual \nincome and have any kind of supervisory responsibilities, you lose your \novertime pay. That is a fact.\n  Another myth promulgated: The regulations would not affect \ncarpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, operating \nengineers, longshoremen, or construction workers because section 541 \n301(f) specifically protects them.\n  Wrong again. In reality, the fact is the proposed section 541 301(f) \nstates the obvious--that these occupations are not recognized \nprofessionals, but these workers could still be exempt as highly \ncompensated employees or an executive or an administrator.\n  The fact is, this regulation does apply to carpenters, electricians, \nmechanics, plumbers, iron workers, operating engineers, longshoremen, \nand construction workers.\n  Another myth: The Department of Labor has nothing to hide.\n  In fact, no public hearings were held on these proposed new \nregulations. When Members of Congress found out about them, we \nimmediately began fighting to block these regulations to protect the \nrights of 8 million workers to be fairly compensated for working \novertime.\n  If there is a reason this most important legislation that we, the \nminority, think should pass doesn't pass, it is all in the hands of \nthose people who, for reasons I do not understand fully--although \npartially--are unwilling to vote on overtime. They are unwilling to \nvote because they know the vote will show that the administration is \ndoing something that is harmful, hurtful, and really bad for 8 million \npeople who work in America. It is wrong. We need to send a message to \nthis White House that what they are doing is wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, we know the administration has said they do not want \nto cut anyone's overtime. If that is the case, then we should adopt the \nHarkin amendment because that certainly would put into law what the \nadministration is talking about doing.\n  As I said earlier, police are concerned about losing their right to \novertime, and we are told the Department of\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\nLabor, through Secretary Chao, has assured the Fraternal Order of \nPolice that the Department does not intend to cut overtime for police \nofficers. I repeat, the one thing we know for sure is the Department of \nLabor will keep that promise made by the Secretary of Labor if the \nHarkin amendment is adopted. I hope it is adopted. I hope we have an \nopportunity to vote on it.\n  If this bill is pulled down, it is not our fault. We have indicated \nthat this legislation could have been finished easily by today. We have \nwasted 3 days on this legislation. Three days have been wasted. We have \nvoted on one amendment, and that is all.\n  I hope reality, in the sense of what we need to accomplish, will be \nthe focus of the majority leader in the next 24 hours, and we can work \nsomething out and move forward on this most important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I admire my dear friend from Nevada, but I \nhave to take issue with him with regard to if this bill is pulled down \nit is not their fault. Let's be honest about it; the overtime \nregulations have been put out for comment. They are not in place. They \nare not regulations that are going to bind anybody.\n  They are put out for comment so people can write in and say what is \nwrong with them. I am sure every word that has been said by my friends \non the other side is going to be taken into consideration by not only \nthe Secretary of Labor but the whole Department of Labor.\n  Correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand some 81,000 comments \nhave already come in either for or against this proposed set of \nregulations. Now, what our friends on the other side want to do is \namend the FSC/ETI bill, which is a jobs bill, parts of which we have \nworked on for years in the Senate Finance Committee. I, in particular, \nhave worked on the international provisions for years. It is being \nworked on in the House, led by Chairman Thomas. We know if this \novertime provision is added to this bill there is no way the House is \ngoing to take it. The House will refuse to take it for very good \nreasons, the best being the rules are not even put in place at this \npoint. What they want to do is rigidify and tell the Department of \nLabor, which is the expert in this area, what rules to put in place and \nto do it all on a one-sided basis without taking into consideration \njobs, the economy, other people's jobs, and the unfairness of aspects \nof the system, all of which are being considered during this comment \nperiod.\n  So by trying to add this provision to this bill, they basically are \nkilling a bill that would, over the years, amount to hundreds of \nthousands, if not millions, of jobs. So it will be their fault if the \njobs bill fails, and anybody who does not understand that is in grave \nerror.\n  This is a cheap vote for those on that side because they do not care \nwhat the Department of Labor does as long as it is more and more \nregulatory in favor of the trade union movement. I do not want the \ntrade union movement hurt. There has to be a delicate balance, but they \nare consistently working to try to upset that balance. This is a \nperfect illustration of how that works. If this amendment is added to \nthis bill, assuming we pass this bill, the House will not take it. That \nmeans the House will pass its FSC/ETI bill and not take ours. If the \nHouse passes its FSC/ETI bill and they do not take our bill, then there \nis another game being played by the other side, and that is they are \nbeing very selective as to which bills they will allow conferees to be \nappointed by the Senate so they can work with conferees from the House \nand come up with a conference report on which both Houses can vote.\n  So if we want to talk about fault, it is easily laid at the feet of \nthose on the other side, and I think rightly laid there.\n  All this holy war on jobs that they have been raising, which is \nnothing but Presidential politics--and I think I can make that case in \njust a few seconds--they are basically undermining jobs in this country \nby not allowing this jobs bill that not only would save us $4 billion \nin unnecessary tariffs by the European Union--$4 billion that we can \nsave for our benefit, which would create jobs, by the way--but also is \npreventing a bill that would create jobs, especially manufacturing \njobs, which we are gradually losing because we are not competitive \nbecause we have not passed this bill.\n  Now they can make all the arguments they want about how important \novertime pay is. I think sometimes those are good arguments. I think \nsometimes we ought to give consideration to the good arguments that are \nmade, but we ought to do it after the regulatory process is completed \nand see what the Department of Labor does with the comments they are \nreceiving, which is the way the real system works. The other side \nunderstands that.\n\n  So this is a political game during a political year, scoring what I \nthink are ridiculous points on jobs, against a jobs bill that will make \na real difference. They know that if they put this provision on this \nbill, it is going nowhere, and over time it is going to cost the \nAmerican taxpayers at least 4 billion unnecessary dollars and a loss of \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jobs.\n  So do not give me this business that we must do something about these \novertime regulations right now because those regulations are not \npermanent or final, as far as I can see.\n  Right now we have one of the lowest unemployment rates that we have \nhad in many years. I remember during the Clinton administration when \nunemployment was 5.6 percent, which is what it is today. They on the \nother side controlled the floor of the Senate, and they knocked out \nunemployment compensation benefits. They took them away because they \nknew 5.6 percent is close to full employment because when we count \nthose who cannot work, those who will not work, and those who would not \ntake a job if you offered it to them, we have a lot of the American \npeople who make up the unemployment rolls.\n  Having said that, let me be fair to my friends on the other side. \nThere are pockets of high unemployment in this country where people are \nsuffering. There is no question about it. There are some of our bigger \nindustrial States where people are suffering, where there is a job \nproblem, where manufacturing jobs have been leaving. I would like to \nsuggest a few reasons why.\n  No. 1, we have not passed this bill because the other side keeps \nplaying around with it and would not even let it go to cloture today, \nfilibustering even the motion to recommit. We have learned this on \njudges. We have learned this on innumerable pieces of legislation. Once \nthey decide to go ahead and be obstructive, unless we can make some \nsort of deal with them, then they will try to add amendments to the \nbill they know the House will not take. They know if we want to go to \nconference because the House passes a different bill, then we cannot \nget Senate conferees appointed under the guise that they are not being \nconsulted when it comes to conferences.\n  They should have gone back to those years when there were 62 \nDemocrats and only 38 Republicans and we were never consulted unless we \nwere the liberal Republican Senators. Yes, then they would not ignore \nthe Jacob Javits of this world or some of the others who were extremely \nliberal, who were as liberal if not more so than they were, but \ndiscount any conservative being considered for any ideas or any \nconferences. It was run lock, stock, and barrel with an iron-handed \nrule. I was here. I lived through that.\n  We did not mouth off and whine and moan and groan every step of the \nway like we are getting on this particular important bill. Nor did we \nalways come up with phony amendments that basically should not be \nconsidered until the rule comes into being.\n  If there are, in fact, 81,000 comments about the rule, the Department \nof Labor is going to take those comments into consideration, modify the \nrule, and hopefully make it work for the benefit of mankind, for the \nbenefit of this country, and for the benefit of jobs.\n  So to stand here and say we will not give them a vote on this very \npremature amendment, which we know would kill this bill, is \ndisingenuous at best. I get tired of this. I have been here 28 years, \nand I have never seen it worse than it is right now. These are little \nstupid games that are being played. I have seen it played by both \nsides, and I think it is despicable. But\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\nthat is what is going on. Frankly, we have had nothing but that since \nwe have taken over. There is a feeling on the other side that President \nBush was not even legitimately elected, even though he was. I can make \nthe best case for why we need the electoral college and did make it \nback when others thought they were going to pass the so-called election \nreform constitutional amendment. It lost overwhelmingly because when \npeople understand the great nature of our system, they are not going to \ntake some of these two-bit solutions that would change our Constitution \nin ways that literally undermine everything for which it stands.\n  This JOBS Act is an essential component in the agenda to accelerate \njob creation. American exports are being jeopardized by European \ntariffs. I have mentioned that. In January of 2002, the World Trade \nOrganization authorized the European Union to impose tariffs on nearly \n100 types of U.S. exports if a tax provision known as FSC/ETI was not \nrepealed.\n  That is what this is all about. We have worked our guts out on the \nFinance Committee to repeal FSC/ETI so it is acceptable to the EU and \nto the WTO, so we don't suffer trade sanctions and all the jobs losses \nthat go with that. People wonder why we are losing our manufacturing \nestablishment. It is because of high taxes. It is because of more \nGovernment regulation. It is because of ridiculous arguments we hear \nfrom the other side on elements like this, where this amendment is so \npremature.\n  The punitive tariffs started at 5 percent on March 1 of this year, \nand they are scheduled to go up 1 percent each month until reaching 17 \npercent in March of 2005. The net effect of the new tariff would be to \nraise taxes on exports by 3.8 percent, jeopardizing $4 billion of U.S. \nexports and, I might add, job after job after job, which the other side \nclaims they are for--jobs, that is. They are undermining one of the \nmost important jobs bills in the last 15 years.\n  Among the U.S. sectors facing retaliation if we do not repeal the \noffensive FSC/ETI tax provisions are agriculture and food, wood and \npaper, textiles and apparel, glass and precious metals, iron and steel \nand manufacturing.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation says 89 percent of FSC benefits go to \nmanufacturing companies. You wonder why some of these bigger States are \nhaving problems? It is because of ridiculous approaches to legislation \nsuch as we are going through right now. That is what you have \ncommittees for, to work their guts out and try to get these problems \nsolved in a bipartisan way. The JOBS bill is a bipartisan solution. I \nknow; I helped to write the bill, as have, of course, the distinguished \nchairman and so many others, including the ranking member on the \ncommittee and others on the Finance Committee whose names deserve to be \nstated.\n  The remedy is Jumpstart Our Business Strength, or the JOBS Act. This \nact brings U.S. exports in line with the WTO, saving American \nbusinesses the European Union tariff of $4 billion over time. It \ncreates a new phased-in deduction that would allow corporations, \nprimarily those involved in manufacturing, to permanently deduct as \nmuch as 9 percent of their U.S. income from their taxable profits. That \nis equivalent to lowering their top tax rate from 35 percent to 32 \npercent. That will help keep our manufacturing jobs here.\n  It makes the deduction available to all businesses that manufacture \nin the United States, regardless of size or type. It targets tax \nshelters, and punishes the relocation of corporate headquarters to \nBermuda and other offshore tax havens--something we have heard a lot of \ndiscussion about in these last couple of months from people on the \nother side of the floor. This helps accomplish what they have said must \nbe accomplished. It imposes an excise tax on wealthy individuals who \nrenounce their U.S. citizenship. It is about time we did that. This \nbill does it.\n  I have heard nothing but mouthing off from the other side. Here they \nhave a chance of getting some of the things they would like to have. It \nis not in the wordage they want, which is more and more pro-union and \nless and less pro-jobs.\n  The JOBS bill is an important part of the jobs agenda, but Senate \nRepublicans are looking into creating more jobs with a number of tools. \nThe Senate Republicans' accomplishments are helping to put our people \nto work. I have to say in supporting this bill it is not just Senate \nRepublicans, it is also a number of Democrats, Senators from the other \nside, who have been willing to open up and do what is right here, led \nby the distinguished ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, who I hope will stand strong on this bill.\n\n  What we are trying to do is encourage entrepreneurship. We have done \nit by passing a strong small business administration bill. We are \ntrying to improve infrastructure and create jobs through the highway \nbill. We are introducing new worker training incentives with the \nworkforce investment bill. We have initiated a blueprint for \nresponsible spending by passing a budget in the Senate, the earliest \npassed budget in history. We have extended unemployment benefits for \nthe jobless and we have kept taxes low, created jobs, and we have grown \nsavings and investment by enacting the jobs and growth bill.\n  On the ``to do'' list we are working on, we are working to prevent \nfuture tax increases on the marriage penalty, the per-child tax \ndeduction, and the 10-percent low-income tax bracket. We want to stop \nthose increases that would occur if these provisions expire. We want to \ncreate and protect American jobs by passing an energy bill which has \nbeen stymied by filibuster--again, another one. We want to create jobs \nand defend against junk lawsuits by passing class action reform. We \nhave 62 votes for that, and we had 3 Democrats agree to support that \nbill--which means against all amendments, unless those who made the \ndeal agree otherwise. Now we are finding they are not living up to \nthat.\n  We have always had around 58 or 59. The last time we voted, we had 59 \nvotes in the Senate--again, another filibuster stopping a jobs bill.\n  One of the most important ones is class action reform. We want to \nprotect jobs, pensions, and shareholders, by passing an asbestos reform \nbill, but we have been told that will be filibustered as well because \nthe unions don't want it, even though they are going to be the major \nbeneficiaries of that bill the way it is outlined. We have written it \nthat way, giving their workers the benefit of the doubt.\n  We are trying to create jobs by passing the Homeland Investment Act \nto encourage foreign reinvestment in the United States, and we are \ntrying to create jobs by passing a strong economic development agency \nbill.\n  I can go on and on, but let me tell you, this filibuster of the JOBS \nbill is mind-boggling to me. We worked so hard. We worked in a \nbipartisan way. There is no reason any Democrat should say we haven't \nbeen fair to them. They may disagree with certain provisions, as some \nof them undoubtedly will, but overall it is a bipartisan bill.\n  I am very unhappy we were unable to get cloture today. When this bill \nfirst came to the floor it appeared to me the Senate leadership on both \nsides recognized the urgency and the importance of addressing this \nmatter as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we quickly became mired in \nunrelated and partisan amendments. As many of our colleagues know, the \nEuropean Union this month, as I said, began assessing 5-percent trade \nsanctions on certain U.S. exports because we have not yet been able to \nrepeal the Foreign Sales Corporation, or FSC, and Extraterritorial \nIncome Exclusion, or ETI, provisions that are in the Internal Revenue \nCode. So we are dealing with a matter of real urgency here.\n  This bill was reported by the Finance Committee last October. I \nbelieve it is important to note the strong bipartisan support this bill \nreceived in the Finance Committee. I congratulate Senator Grassley, the \nchairman of that committee, along with Senator Baucus, its ranking \nDemocrat, for their bold leadership in insisting this bill be \nbipartisan from its inception. This is a key attribute, because it is \nclear to me anything less than a bipartisan approach in the Senate will \nnot result in success in passing this bill during this election year.\n  This bill represents the solution to a very difficult situation in \nwhich the United States finds itself. By successfully challenging the \nU.S. in the World\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\nTrade Organization, first on the Foreign Sales Corporation provision, \nand subsequently winning another victory on its replacement, the \nExtraterritorial Income Exclusion, the European Union has put us in a \nvery tight spot. I think most, if not all, of us believe we must honor \nour obligations under the World Trade Organization. After all, we were \npresent at drafting of the WTO rules. WTO rules overwhelmingly manifest \nprinciples of commerce and trade we have advanced, and embody a system \nthat benefits us. As a result, most rulings in response to appeals \nbefore the WTO have been decided in our favor.\n  Yet few of us, if any, are eager to raise taxes on our exporting \ncompanies. Because any kind of solution that merely replicates the tax \nbenefits of the FSC and ETI provisions will be ruled as another \nimpermissible trade subsidy by the WTO, we are in the uncomfortable \nposition of having to create winners and losers among U.S. companies.\n  However, because of the trade sanctions that are already upon us, \nwhich are scheduled to increase by 1 percentage point each month that \nthese provisions remain in our Tax Code, we have little choice but to \nrepeal them. The choice we do have, I believe, is to choose to repeal \nthem in a way that leads to the greatest potential for future growth in \nour economy--future growth in jobs, if you will, which is what this \nbill is all about.\n  One might say that in this situation, the Europeans have handed the \nU.S. and its economy a bushel of lemons. However, I am pleased to say \nthat the bill before us does a pretty good job of turning those lemons \ninto lemonade.\n  It does so by taking this opportunity to put forward provisions that \nwould improve tax incentives for manufacturing activities in the United \nStates. And it does so by putting forth provisions to reform and \nimprove the tax rules that govern international trade.\n  Is this bill perfect? No. It isn't. Anytime you make lemonade, \nsomething has to get squeezed. In this case, there is unfortunately not \nenough revenue raised by repealing the FSC/ETI provisions to make \neveryone who loses those benefits whole. This is because we are forced \nto spread the benefits of the tax provisions we improve in this bill \nover a wider group of companies than those who have been benefitting \nfrom the export provisions.\n  There are several ways this difficult situation could have been \naddressed. The easiest way would have been to merely repeal the FSC and \nETI provisions and not tried to replace them. Of course, this would \nhave resulted in a $56 billion tax increase on our economy, and one \nspecifically targeted to American companies that are selling U.S.-made \ngoods overseas.\n  I don't think anybody in their right mind would want to do that but \nthat is what is going to happen if our friends keep playing games on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  Just as the tax cuts of 2001, 2002, and 2003 have been greatly \nbeneficial to our economic growth, this tax increase would have been \ngreatly detrimental to economic growth. I am happy to say that this bad \nidea was simply not an option considered in the Finance Committee.\n  Another approach might have been to repeal the export provisions and \nreplace them with an across-the-board corporate income tax rate cut. \nThis was an option brought up in the Finance Committee and we shall \nlikely be seeing a floor amendment to do the same, if we can ever get \nback to this bill. While this idea has some merit and enjoys the virtue \nof being simpler to compute and administer, I believe it diffuses the \ntax benefits over too many businesses.\n  Such an idea, in my view, would create an undue hardship for many of \nthe users of the export tax benefits in the current law. At a time when \nour U.S. manufacturers, who are, of course, our main exporters, are \njust recovering from a most difficult downturn, I do not think it is \nwise to hit them any harder than we have to with a net tax increase. \nTherefore, I will vote against any amendments to convert the tax \nbenefits of this bill into a net corporate tax rate cut.\n  The situation handed to us by the Europeans also presents us with a \nrare opportunity to reform, in a limited way, some of the worst of the \nbroken provisions that make up our international tax rules. These rules \nare badly outdated and are often harmful to U.S. companies engaged in \nan ever-increasingly global economy.\n  By enacting even a limited amount of reform, we can improve the rules \nand help all U.S. companies that face unfair tax competition with firms \nfrom other nations. Increasingly, even many small U.S. companies can \nand even must export their products. Therefore, many of the same \ncompanies that will be losing the FSC and ETI benefits under this bill \nwill be gaining an increased ability to better compete internationally \nunder the international tax reforms included in the bill.\n  I recognize that there are some Members of this body who do not \nreadily recognize the need for this bill to improve the international \ntax rules. I have even heard some people intimate that improving these \nrules could encourage companies to move jobs offshore. I believe this \nis a phony argument based on a lack of understanding of the business \nworld today.\n  In reality, business is done on a worldwide basis. Our firms are in \ncompetition with companies headquartered all around the world. We \ncannot close our eyes to this fact. To limit the ability of our U.S. \nbusinesses to compete fairly in the global marketplace might, at first \nglance, seem to some to add security for domestic jobs.\n  In the same sense, an ostrich sticking its head into sand might seem \nto think it has found security from danger. But, like that ostrich, a \nU.S. company that is effectively kept from competing in the global \nmarket will find itself far more vulnerable to danger, and could lose \neverything, including 100 percent of its jobs.\n  Our job is to do everything we can to help our U.S. companies \nsucceed. We cannot change the fact that more and more of them compete \nin a worldwide market. So we should recognize it and help them deal \nwith it. This means we must bring our tax rules up to date. Those who \nare unwilling to do so in the name of protecting U.S. jobs are just \nfooling themselves and failing to deal with the real world.\n  In conclusion, it is a tragedy that progress on this bill has been \nstopped. This is important legislation. It is too important for these \npolitical games that are being played on it. While there are many \nlegitimate amendments that could and should be brought forward, we \ncannot afford to bog this issue down and stop progress on it. This bill \nis important for U.S. jobs. This bill is important for eliminating \nthose trade sanctions that are even now pinching some U.S. industries \nand costing us sales and production. And, this bill is important for \nour long-term economic growth. I hope my colleagues on the other side \nwill re-think their obstructionism and let us go forward with this \nimportant bill.\n  Let us be understanding. If the Department of Labor issues \nregulations and allows for a period of comment, we ought to at least \nallow that period of comment to finish and allow them to make the \nnecessary changes the comments suggest--at least the good changes the \ncomments suggest. We should not be playing political games here on the \nfloor of the Senate on a bill we simply must pass because it will cost \njobs not to pass this bill. In the end, it would be detrimental to our \neconomy and our society at a time when we need help, at a time when we \nneed jobs, and at a time when we are losing manufacturing jobs. This \nparticular bill will help. It will help greatly, and it will help keep \nthe United States of America at the forefront as the premier nation in \nthe world on jobs and economic growth.\n  To have our colleagues refuse to even allow debate to end on the \nfloor by not invoking cloture just shows how far they will go to use \nthe filibuster rule as they have on countless bills and judges through \nthe years to stymie what really should be done in this very important \nbody.\n  I think we ought to get rid of political games and start working on \nthis bill in a way that will improve it, if we can, but not muff it so \nthe House won't take it; and then we have to worry about whether we are \ngoing to even be able to get to conference, assuming we have two \ndifferent bills from the House and the Senate.\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not do that \nin this case, but we have seen it done in other\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\ncases, and I suspect it could be done here, too, if the politics are \nright. I think that is what is driving an awful lot of the crap that \ngoes on in this body. I hate to use that kind of language, but I don't \nknow what else to call it other than crap.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment submitted \nby Senator Bingaman and me to address a tax problem that makes the \nUnited States a less attractive location for international companies to \nbuild new operations here in the United States and thereby hire \nAmerican workers.\n  As the U.S. economy emerges from a prolonged period of weak recovery, \nI believe it is important that the Congress seize the opportunity to \nenhance and improve the competitiveness of the United States as a \nlocation for new investment and job creation.\n  Investment in the U.S. from companies from Europe, Asia and Australia \nmake a vital contribution to the American economy. In Virginia, we have \ninvestment from Europe such as Siemens, Framatome, Holtzbrink \nPublishing, BluePrint Automation, Drake Extrusion, Stihl, Porcher BGF \nIndustries, Infilco Degremont, Maersk Container Services, DCS America, \nVolvo Trucks and BI Chemicals.\n  From Japan, we have investment in Virginia from Canon, Toray, Oji-\nYuka Synthetic Paper, Yokohama Tire, NWB, ``K'' Line, Yupo, Dynax, and \nSumitomo. From Canada, we have investment in Virginia from Maple Leaf \nBakeries. From Australia, we have investment in Virginia from RGC \nMinerals and Industrial Galvanizers.\n  According to the most recent government data, U.S. subsidiaries of \nforeign-parented companies provide jobs to 6.4 million Americans and \nsupport $350 billion in annual payroll. It is worth noting that 34 \npercent of these jobs are in the manufacturing sector--more than double \nthe proportion of manufacturing jobs at all U.S. companies. U.S. \nsubsidiaries pay significant taxes here--new IRS data shows that \nfederal tax receipts from these companies totaled $28 billion in 2000, \n14 percent of all corporate tax payments.\n  This international investment coming into the U.S has declined over \nthe last few years, as the net inflow of foreign direct investment into \nthe United States recently dropped from $322 billion in 2000 to $40 \nbillion in 2002.\n  Unfortunately, our U.S. tax code raises the costs of financing for \ninternational companies who want to expand existing operations in the \nU.S. or build new operations to serve the North American or western \nhemisphere markets. The United States competes against other nations \nfor locating such manufacturing operations. The cost of financing is \npart of the complex decision that these companies confront when \nconsidering where to locate a new operation. Our amendment would make \nbuilding or expanding U.S. operations more attractive, while still \nkeeping in place the strong safe-guards against potential abuses.\n  Section 163(j) of our U.S. Tax Code is intended to ensure that \ncompanies don't engage in the practice of ``earnings stripping'' when \nborrowing from a foreign related party, e.g. a parent and an affiliate. \nAnd yet the law also limits the ability to borrow from an unrelated \nthird party with regard to a loan that is guaranteed by the foreign \nparent company, even though there can be no ``earnings stripping'' if \nan unrelated third party receives the interest payment.\n  The Bingaman-Allen amendment addresses this barrier to job creation \nin two ways.\n  First, it removes borrowing from a U.S. taxpayer or public markets, \nsuch as commercial paper, from the calculation of disqualified interest \nand ensures that the borrowing relates to public debt or is truly with \nan unrelated third party who is subject to U.S. tax on such interest \nincome.\n  This provision has the added benefit of encouraging international \ncompanies to borrow from financial institutions that are subject to \nU.S. taxation or the commercial paper market strengthening the U.S. \nfinancial markets and bringing tax revenue into the U.S. Treasury.\n  Second, our amendment removes from the calculation of disqualified \ninterest guaranteed third-party borrowing to the extent the taxpayer \ncan demonstrate it could have borrowed without such guarantee. This \nimproved provision is sound tax policy because it requires companies to \nprove that they could have borrowed without the guarantee, while \npermitting them to access a lower interest rate by reason of a parent \ncompany guarantee. The revenue impact of this provision is potentially \nsmall given that when a company receives a lower interest rate, they \nalso have a smaller interest deduction.\n  Our amendment is necessary because current law on the ability to \ndeduct interest creates a disincentive for Virginia companies like \nInfineon Technologies, a global semiconductor manufacturer to make \nadditional investments in the United States. Without our amendment it \nwill be more difficult for Infineon to invest in its 300 millimeter \nwafer semiconductor fabrication plant near Richmond, Virginia. At full \nbuild out, this facility could create more than 1,000 good paying \ntechnology jobs in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Another Virginia company that is affected by the ability to deduct \ninterest is Alcatel, the U.S. subsidiary of Alcatel, SA, a global 500 \ncorporation organized in France. Alcatel manufactures communications \nequipment for business and carrier customers, and it currently employs \nover 4,500 Americans with manufacturing facilities in California, \nTexas, North Carolina, and Massachusetts and approximately 100 \nemployees in Virginia. The broadband network equipment manufactured by \nAlcatel is deployed in the networks of AT, SBC, BellSouth, Verizon, \nand Qwest, among others.\n  Alcatel has maintained a commitment to Northern Virginia's local \neconomy through its operations in Reston, VA. As a multinational leader \nin telecommunications and Internet technology, it is important that \nAlcatel maintain this point of presence at the seat of our Nation's \ncapital. Alcatel Virginia includes employees dedicated to providing \nadministrative support, sales, human resources services, and senior \npersonnel involved in Alcatel North America's Mobile Networks and Space \nSolutions Divisions.\n  Current laws on the ability to deduct interest could disallow the tax \ndeduction of over $50 million that Alcatel's U.S. subsidiary is \ncontractually obligated to pay to its foreign parent corporation each \nyear. Unless the current law is changed, we will dampen potential \ngrowth by Alcatel in Virginia and across the country by effectively \nincreasing the taxation of a corporation, which has chosen to create \njobs in the U.S. through investment.\n  I have three more examples of what this amendment will mean to \nVirginia:\n  Winchester, VA--M Plastics, a British company, plans to locate its \nfirst U.S. facility in Frederick County. The manufacturer of plastic \nbottles, caps and tubes for the personal care market will create 57 new \njobs through a $12 million capital investment. Virginia successfully \ncompeted with Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland and Canada for the \nproject.\n  Leesburg, VA--WaveLight Laser Technologie AG of Erlangen, Germany has \nselected Loudoun County for its U.S. headquarters. Through a $5 million \ninvestment, the company will create 30 new jobs. Virginia successfully \ncompeted with Illinois and Maryland for the project. WaveLight Laser \nTechnologie AG, listed on the Prime Standard since January 2003, \ndevelops, produces and markets laser systems in the fields of \nophthalmology, aesthetic surgery, urology and industrial applications. \nWaveLight's market success is based on its innovative laser systems \nthat are technology leaders in their areas of application.\n  Virginia Beach, VA--STIHL Inc. plans to expand its operations in \nVirginia Beach. Through an investment of $60.8 million, the company \nwill create 200 new jobs. STIHL's investment includes the construction \nof a 228,000-square foot addition to its U.S. headquarters in the \nOceana West Corporate Park. Virginia successfully competed with Brazil, \nChina, and Germany for the project. STIHL manufactures the world's \nlargest selling brand of chain saws and portable, hand-held, cut-off \nmachines, as well as a complete line of outdoor power equipment for \nhomeowners and professional users. STIHL Inc. is a subsidiary of \nGerman-based STIHL Holding AG & Co and one of seven manufacturing \nfacilities in the STIHL Group.\n  Without the passage of the amendment sponsored by Senator Bingaman\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nand me, it will be much more difficult for any of these three job \ncreation opportunities in Virginia to occur. The bottom line is that we \nneed to remove barriers to international investment in our United \nStates. This Bingaman-Allen amendment will surely help achieve this \ngoal. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Bingaman and me in \nsupporting this common sense provision that will increase investment \nand jobs in Virginia and throughout our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of my Homestead \nPreservation Act that I have filed as an amendment to the underlying \nlegislation to repeal the FSC/ETI tax regime. I do support this JOBS \nbill, which should be focused on helping U.S. manufacturers compete or \nincrease American jobs.\n  This amendment would provide displaced workers access to short-term, \nlow-interest loans to help meet monthly home mortgage payments while \ntraining for or seeking new employment.\n  This is commonsense, compassionate legislation designed to help \nworking families, who through no fault of their own, are adversely \naffected by international competition.\n  Unfortunately, our economy has witnessed the loss of far too many \nmanufacturing jobs over the last five years. It is important to note \nthat these are the jobs that traditionally allowed working Americans to \nprovide for their families, own a home, send their children to college \nand plan for retirement. All regions of our country have been touched \nin many manufacturing sectors. I share the concern my colleagues have \nexpressed and share their commitment to stem this negative trend.\n  And while these are uneasy times for everyone, regions such as the \nsoutheast, midwest, northeast, and in southside and southwest Virginia, \nwith heavy concentrations in manufacturing--especially the textile and \napparel industries--have been especially hard hit. The textile and \napparel industries have experienced a decrease in employment of 160,000 \nand 400,000 jobs respectively over the last decade.\n  While a portion of these losses can be attributed to expected \ncontraction of the industry, experts have attributed much of the trend \nto increased international competition.\n  Fair and free trade is necessary if American businesses are to have \nthe opportunity to promote their goods and services and continue to \nexpand through growth abroad--NAFTA and recent trade agreements have \ncreated a net increase in U.S. employment.\n  But while trade is helping our economy as a whole, there are many \ngood, hard working families, who have been adversely affected by \ninternational competition--especially in the textile and apparel \nindustries, furniture and other manufacturing industries.\n  Anytime a factory closes, it is a devastating blow to all of the \nfamilies and businesses in the community and region. While I was proud \nof the outstanding way the close-knit southside and southwest \ncommunities in Virginia came together to help those who lost their \njobs, when companies like Pluma, Tultex and Pillowtex close their \ndoors, the families of these communities should not be forced to go \nthrough these times alone.\n  I was so pleased to learn that after the Tultex plant closed in \nMartinsville in early December of 1999, people donated toys to the \nSalvation Army to make sure that Christmas came to the homes of the \nthousands of laid off workers.\n  With this amendment I am proposing that the Federal Government do its \npart to help Americans through these tough times.\n  Understanding no government program or assistance can substitute for \na secure, well-paying job, I believe the U.S. government can reasonably \nassist families as they transition from one career to another. \nPresently, there are useful assistance programs that aid American \nworkers seeking new employment, but unfortunately, there is nothing \ncurrently in place to protect what is usually a family's most valuable \nfinancial and emotional asset their home.\n  Two of the programs in place, the Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, \nprogram and the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance, NAFTA-TAA, \nprogram help workers get additional job skills training and employment \nassistance and provide extended unemployment benefits during job \ntraining.\n  In fact, once the doors were closed at the Pillowtex plant, the \ncommunity and local government acted quickly to secure these benefits. \nThankfully, Secretary Chao and the Department of Labor promptly \nresponded to this request. Such quick action was much appreciated by \nthese Virginians and North and South Carolinians, as it provided health \ninsurance for their families, as well as resources for education and \nretraining to assist in finding a new job.\n  These programs are the result of the commonsense, logical conclusion \nthat good, working people can lose their jobs because of trade--not \nbecause they did anything wrong or because they don't want to work. We \nought to find a way to ease the stress and turmoil for people whose \nlives are unexpectedly thrown into transition after years of steady \nemployment with a company that suddenly disappears.\n  While these hard-working folks are searching for appropriate \nemployment, they should not fear losing their homes. For most people \nand families, their home is the largest investment they make in life. \nMany have considerable equity built up in their homes.\n  Government agencies already have low-interest loan programs in place \nto help families who have met with unexpected natural disaster like a \nhurricane, a flood or a tornado. When a factory closes, it is an \neconomic disaster to these families and their communities. The effects \nare just as far reaching and certainly as economically devastating.\n  Like a natural disaster, families displaced by international \ncompetition are not responsible for the events leading to the factory \nclosings. In fact, after natural disasters families and communities \nrebuild with the assistance of the federal government. The economic \ndisasters of plant closings do not share hope and revitalization.\n  The point is the Federal Government ought to make the same disaster \nloan assistance programs available to our temporarily displaced \nworkers. This is my rationale for introducing the Homestead \nPreservation Act.\n  This legislation will provide temporary mortgage assistance to \ndisplaced workers, helping them make ends meet during their search for \na new job. Specifically, the Homestead Preservation Act: authorizes the \nDepartment of Labor to administer a low-interest loan program--4 \npercent--for workers displaced due to international competition; the \nloan is for up to the amount of 12 monthly home mortgage payments; the \nprogram is authorized at $10 million, per year, for 5 years; and \ndistributes the loan through an account, providing monthly allocations \nto cover the amount of the worker's home mortgage payment.\n  The loans would be paid off or repaid over a period of 5 years. No \npayments would be required until 6 months after the borrower has \nreturned to work full-time.\n  Additionally, the loan is available only for the cost of a monthly \nhome mortgage payment and covers only those workers displaced due to \ninternational competition and who would qualify for benefits under the \nNAFTA-TAAP and TAA benefits programs, and participate in these \nprograms.\n  Finally, my amendment would require that individuals seeking to avail \nthemselves of the loan program be enrolled in a job training or job \nassistance program.\n  Like the NAFTA-TAAP and TAA benefits programs, the Homestead \nPreservation Act recognizes that some temporary assistance is needed as \nworkers take the time to become retrained and further their education, \nexpand upon their skills and search for new employment.\n  The current economic situation of our country has made it even more \nvital that the Federal Government do what is right by our workers in \nthe manufacturing industries suffering high rates of job losses due to \ninternational competition. When these workers are displaced, meager \nsavings and temporary unemployment benefits are frequently not enough \nto cover expenses that had previously fit within the family budget.\n  Without immediate help, these families, at the minimum, risk ruining \ntheir credit ratings and, in the worst-case scenario, could lose their \nhome or their car, or both.\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\n  The Homestead Preservation Act would provide families a vital \ntemporary financial assistance that would enable them to keep their \nhomes and protect their credit ratings as they work toward \nstrengthening and updating their skills and continue their search for a \nnew job.\n  Hard-working Americans, facing such a harrowing and uncertain \nsituation, ought to have a remedy available to help them. People need \ntransitional help now.\n  The Homestead Preservation Act provides the temporary financial tools \nnecessary for displaced workers to get back on their feet and succeed--\nit is a logical and responsible response.\n  This measure garnered strong bipartisan support the last time it was \nconsidered by the Senate. I respectfully urge my colleagues to \nrecognize the value Americans place on owning a home and support this \ncaring and needed initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3092-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, for some time now, the U.S. Congress has \nexpressed its frustration over the European Union's intransigence on \ninternational trade issues that are vitally important to the U.S. \neconomy. From overreaching attempts to regulate e-commerce, to trade \nbarriers against American beef and other agricultural products, the EU \nhas relentlessly pursued protectionist policies that disproportionately \nharm American businesses and workers. I now fear that the United States \nand EU are heading toward a new trade war--and that the Commission's \nruling against Microsoft is the first shot.\n  For the most part, economic growth across the European Union has been \nmeager during this decade. No doubt this is a by-product of the global \neconomic slow down that began in the last year of the Clinton \nPresidency. But as the U.S. economy achieves record-setting levels of \neconomic growth, Europe remains stagnant. Why? Because European \neconomies are buried by public sector debt; European economies are \ndrained of their vitality by excessive taxation; and European economies \nare strangled by excessive regulation from bureaucrats sitting in \nBrussels. Now, as if destroying Europe's economy were not enough, the \nEuropean Commission has taken aim at Microsoft, a company whose \nproducts and technology have been engines of global economic growth.\n  The Commission's ruling imposes the largest fine ever levied by the \nCommission against a company--over $610 million. This fine was imposed \ndespite the Commission's tacit admission that European law in this area \nis unclear, and even though Microsoft is already subject to legal \nobligations, under the U.S. settlement, for essentially the same \nconduct that was at issue in the EU proceedings. As a result, money \nthat rightfully belongs to Microsoft shareholders will instead be \nfilling the coffers administered by Commission bureaucrats.\n  The Commission's ruling also requires Microsoft to sell a version of \nWindows without multimedia functionality--i.e., one that cannot play \naudio or video. Thus, the ruling forces Microsoft to spend its energies \nnot on developing new, innovative products, but on designing a degraded \nversion of Windows--in short, a product that no one wants or needs. \nThis preposterous demand, by a foreign government, will hurt one of \nAmerica's most successful companies and harm the hundreds of American \nIT companies that rely on the multimedia functionality in Windows to \noffer their own innovative products and services--companies that are \nresponsible for thousands of high-paying American jobs. As the New York \nTimes noted in an editorial last Saturday (March 20), the Commission's \ndemands ``would threaten Microsoft's business model and, more \nimportant, harm consumers. The very definition of a computer operating \nsystem would essentially be frozen where it is today.''\n  In imposing this anti-consumer, anti-innovation penalty, the \nCommission has blatantly undercut the settlement that was so carefully \nand painstakingly crafted with Microsoft by the U.S. Department of \nJustice and several State antitrust authorities. There can be no \nquestion that the U.S. Government was entitled to take the lead in this \nmatter--Microsoft is a U.S. company, many if not all of the complaining \ncompanies in the EU case are American, and all of the relevant design \ndecisions took place here. Had the Commission been cognizant of \nAmerica's legitimate interests in this matter, it would have acted in a \nmanner that complemented the U.S. settlement. Needless to say, the \nCommission instead selected a path that places its resolution of this \ncase in direct conflict with ours--and threatens the vitality of \nAmerica's IT industry in the process.\n  The Commission's complete indifference to the negative impact of its \nruling on American jobs, American consumers, and the U.S. economy--and \nits total disregard of the Department of Justice--are intolerable.\n  The European Commission has, of course, on many occasions paid lip \nservice to the importance of international coordination in the area of \ncompetition, and on the need for other countries to be sensitive to \nextraterritorial effects of their antitrust rulings. But actions speak \nlouder than words, and with the Microsoft ruling the Commission appears \nintent on saying that it considers the Department of Justice, the U.S. \ncourts, and principles of open and fair international trade largely \nirrelevant.\n  It is critical that the Departments of State and Justice stand up not \nonly for an important American company, but also for U.S. industry, \nU.S. shareholders, and American workers. If the U.S. Government does \nnot make a clear and strong statement objecting to the EU actions, we \nwill lose influence and credibility for years to come to the detriment \nof the U.S. economy and U.S. consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3092-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3092-S3093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GARDNERVILLE, NEVADA, 125TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to wish the town of \nGardnerville, NV, a happy 125th birthday.\n  Gardnerville was founded by Lawrence Gilman in 1879. Mr. Gilman had \nfound a nice 7-acre tract of land on the East Fork of the Carson River, \nand he thought it would make a beautiful location for a town. So he \ndecided to move his hotel, then named the Kent House, from Genoa, NV, \nto the new spot. John M. Gardner sold the 7 acres to Mr. Gil man for \n$1,250. In gratitude, Mr. Gilman named the town after Mr. Gardner.\n  The Kent House was later named the Gardnerville Hotel and became a \nsymbol for the town of Gardnerville--a new endeavor in an ever-changing \nworld. Although the hotel no longer stands, you can still visit the \nhumble beginnings of Gardnerville near the J & T Bar.\n  Mr. Gilman recognized that if he wanted to create a real town around \nhis hotel, he needed to offer business amenities and leisure activities \nthat would attract the ranchers in the area. So he added a blacksmith \nshop and saloon to his hotel. It wasn't long before local ranchers \nstarted coming into town, relaxing and visiting in the saloon while \ntheir horses were shod next door. Thus did Gardnerville begin its \nvoyage down the path to prosperity.\n  By 1899, Gardnerville had blossomed into a thriving city. Almost \neverything a person might need could be found right on Main Street--two \nlivery stables, a boarding house, three general merchandising stores, \nfour saloons, one meat market, and two hotels, including the original \nGardnerville Hotel that had started it all.\n  Gardnerville's emergence as an important social and commercial center \nwas aided by the formation of the Valhalla Society in 1885. The purpose \nof the Valhalla Society was to provide information to immigrants, \nmainly those of Dutch descent. Gardnerville also\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\nserved as a feed stop for the 24-horse freight teams that regularly \ntraveled between Carson City and Bodie--in other words, it was the 19th \ncentury equivalent of a filling station.\n  Today Gardnerville remains an active town. With five parks, three \nschools and an enviable location just minutes from Lake Tahoe, \nGardnerville offers a wonderful quality of life. It has kept pace with \nprogress, but it maintains the feel of a one-stop town, where a person \nfeels at home even if they are just passing through.\n  As the people of Gardnerville prepare to celebrate their town's 125th \nbirthday, in between baking cakes, decorating Main Street and \norganizing the numerous events that are planned, I hope they pause for \na moment to remember that their beautiful city was started on just 7 \nacres of land. Today Gardnerville has outgrown that original tract, and \nit continues to fulfill Mr. Gilman's dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3093-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SARAH WINNEMUCCA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate a remarkable woman \nand the exceptional life she led.\n  The great Nevadan I wish to honor is Sarah Winnemucca. Born in 1844 \nas the granddaughter of the great Chief Truckee and the daughter of \nChief Winnemucca, Sarah lived during a time of enormous change for the \nUnited States, the American West, and especially for the Paiute Nation.\n  Originally known as Thocmetony, meaning ``shell flower,'' Sarah lived \nher life as an advocate for the Paiute people. She was also a committed \neducator. Today one of the most important artifacts we have of Sarah's \nlife is her autobiography, ``Life Among the Piutes.'' The first book \npublished by a Native American woman, Sarah's writings convey a \npowerful account of life in the West from the perspective of Native \nAmericans.\n  For many years Sarah lived with her tribe and witnessed the \ndisplacement that was forced on the Nevada Paiute. While some were \nconfined to the Pyramid Lake Reservation in western Nevada, others were \nmoved to the Malheur Reservation in Oregon, and still others were \nexiled to a reservation near Yakima, WA.\n  Seeking redress for the many hardships that her people suffered, in \n1880 Sarah made the long trip to Washington, DC, where she was given an \naudience with Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz and President \nRutherford B. Hayes.\n  While that meeting and subsequent negotiations brought no substantive \nimprovements for the Paiutes, Sarah remained committed to her work. \nOver the next decade she gave more than 300 public speeches to \nhighlight the plight of the Paiute Nation. Sarah eventually returned to \nNevada where she established a school for Native Americans near \nLovelock.\n  Through all the challenges she faced, Sarah Winnemucca remained \nstubbornly committed to the promotion of equality for all Americans. \nShe demanded respect for Native Americans in a time when that idea was \nnothing short of revolutionary.\n  For these reasons, I am honored to announce that in 2005 the State of \nNevada will dedicate a statue of Sarah Winnemucca here in the U.S. \nCapitol. More than 100 years after her passing, Sarah Winnemucca will \njoin 99 other great Americans whose likenesses stand proudly in the Old \nChamber of the House of Representatives, or as we call it today, \nStatuary Hall.\n  As a pioneer and a tremendous leader in her own right, it is fitting \nthat Sarah Winnemucca take her place next to the likes of George \nWashington, Dwight Eisenhower, John Winthrop, Sacajawea and Nevada \nSenator Patrick McCarran.\n  In addition to commemorating the life of Sarah Winnemucca, I would \nlike to acknowledge Sara Jones, the administrator of the Nevada State \nLibrary and Archives, for her enthusiasm and commitment to this effort. \nAdditionally, I extend my sincere thanks to former assemblywoman Marcia \nde Braga, Nevada First Lady Dema Guinn, Carrie Townley Porter, Debbie \nAllen, Richard Hooker, Mary Lee Fulkerson, Steven High, Mary Anne \nConvis, and Sally Zanjani, who all have worked hard to bring this \nproject to fruition.

(The program was last reauthorized in 1998.) \n     Authorizations for the program expired at the end of fiscal \n     year 2002 for activities not supported by user fees. The act \n     would authorize the appropriation of such sums as necessary \n     through fiscal year 2005. Assuming the appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing S. 1879 \n     would have no effect on costs in 2004 and would cost $17 \n     million over the 2005-2009 period. The act would not affect \n     direct spending or receipts.\n       S. 1879 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1879 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs fall within budget function 550 (health).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2004   2005   2006   2007   2008   2009\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nMQSA Spending Under Current\n Law:\n  Estimated Authorization          16      0      0      0      0      0\n   Level \\1\\..................\n  Estimated Outlays...........     16      7      2      1      *      0\nProposed Changes:\n  Estimated Authorization           0     17      0      0      0      0\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays...........      0     10      5      1      *      *\nMQSA Spending Under S. 1879:\n  Estimated Authorization          16     17      0      0      0      0\n   Level 1....................\n  Estimated Outlays...........     16     17      7      2      1      *\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2004 level is the amount appropriated in that year for\n  activities under the Mammography Quality Standards Act but not\n  supported by user fees.\n* = Less than $500,000.\n\n       Basis of Estimate: For the estimate, CBO assumes that the \n     act will be enacted in fiscal year 2004, that the necessary \n     appropriations will be provided near the start of fiscal year \n     2005, and that outlays will follow historical spending \n     patterns for the MQSA program.\n       S. 1879 would authorize the appropriation of such sums as \n     necessary through 2005 for the Food and Drug Administration \n     to carry out MQSA activities that are not supported by user \n     fees. Those activities include: establishing and enforcing \n     standards for mammography facilities, accreditation bodies, \n     equipment, personnel, and quality assurance; inspecting \n     facilities run by governmental entities; and providing \n     consumer education. The act also would allow the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to issue a temporary renewal \n     certificate and a limited provisional certificate to \n     facilities seeking reaccreditation under certain \n     circumstances. CBO estimates that these activities could be \n     carrier out with the 2004 appropriation levels adjusted for \n     inflation. We estimate that these activities would have no \n     effect on costs in 2004 and would cost $11 million over the \n     2005-2009 period.\n       In addition, S. 1879 would reauthorize the breast cancer \n     screening surveillance research grant program, administered \n     by the National Cancer Institute. The act would authorize \n     such sums as necessary for that program, at an estimated cost \n     of $6 million over the 2005-2009 period.\n       The program funds research to determine the effectiveness \n     of screening programs in reducing breast cancer mortality. \n     CBO's estimate assumes continued funding at the 2004 level \n     adjusted for inflation.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1879 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector impact as \n     defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Julia Christenson \n     (226-9010); Impact on State,\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\n     Local, and Tribal Governments: Leo Lex (225-3220); and Impact \n     on the Private Sector: Meena Fernandes (225-2593).\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H.

The act would authorize the appropriation \n     of $60 million in fiscal year 2004 and such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 for that \n     purpose. The act also would reauthorize a CDC training \n     program for health professionals to treat obesity and eating \n     disorders and would permit the agency to make extramural \n     training grants. The act would authorize the appropriation of \n     such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 \n     for that purpose.\n       S. 1172 also would allow the Department of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) to give special consideration to obesity-\n     related conditions in an existing grant program for health \n     profession students and require the department to submit \n     reports to the Congress about children and obesity. Other \n     provisions of the act would permit CDC's National Center for \n     Health Statistics to collect and analyze data on children's \n     fitness levels and specify that allotments under CDC's \n     Preventive Health Services Block Grant may be used for \n     activities and education programs to prevent obesity and \n     eating disorders and promote healthy eating behaviors.\n       CBO estimates that implementing the physical activity and \n     nutrition grant provision of S. 1172 would cost $3 million in \n     2004 and a total of $199 million from 2004 through 2009, if \n     inflation adjustments are included and assuming \n     appropriations of authorized amounts. CBO estimates that the \n     report-writing requirements would require $1 million to \n     implement in 2005, assuming appropriations of the necessary \n     amount. CBO estimates that other provision of the bill would \n     not have a significant effect on spending. Enacting S. 1172 \n     would not affect direct spending or receipts.\n       S. 1172 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). State, local, and tribal governments may benefit from \n     the grant provisions of the bill, and none of the bill's \n     provisions wold compel them to take any action.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     cost to implement S. 1172 is shown in the following table and \n     assumes entactment of the bill by July 1, 2003. The costs of \n     this legislation fall within budget function 550 (health).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2004   2005   2006   2007   2008   2009\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending Under Current Law;\n  Estimated Authorization          45     46      0      0      0      0\n   Level \\1\\..................\n  Estimated Outlays...........     14     34     28     10      3      1\nProposed Changes for Grant\n Program:\n  Estimated Authorization          15     15     62     63     64      0\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays \\2\\.......      3     13     30     51     60     42\nProposed Changes for Other\n Activities:\n  Estimated Authorization           0      1      0      0      0      0\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays \\2\\.......      0      1      0      0      0      0\nSpending Under S. 1172:\n  Estimated Authorization          60     62     62     63     64      0\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays...........     17     48     58     61     63     43\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2004 level is the amount appropriated for that year for Centers\n  for Disease Control and Prevention for activities related to\n  prevention and treatment of obesity and promotion of physical activity\n  and nutrition. The 2005 amount reflects adjustments for anticipated\n  inflation.\n\\2\\ Including adjustments for anticipated inflation, the estimated\n  outlay changes would total $200 million over the 2004-2008 period.\n  Without such adjustmentss, the five-year totla would be $190 million.\n\n       Basis for estimate: The PHSA currently authorizes such sums \n     as may be necessary through 2005 for CDC to administer grant \n     programs to promote childhood nutrition and physical activity \n     and to educate and train health professionals in dealing with \n     obesity or eating disorders. CDC also conducts prevention \n     research and collects data on obesity and levels of physical \n     activity. In 2004, $45 million was appropriated for those \n     activities, an increase of $11 million over the 2003 level. \n     Almost all of the funding is directed toward the childhood \n     nutrition and physical activity grant program, which \n     currently is limited to state and local governments. Under \n     current law, CBO estimates that spending from the authorized \n     funding for 2004 and 2005 for obesity-related activities at \n     CDC will be $91 million over the 2004-2009 period.\n       S. 1172 would authorize the appropriation of $60 million in \n     fiscal year 2004 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \n     years 2005 through 2008 for CDC to administer grant programs \n     for the promotion of nutrition and fitness for children, and \n     for the expansion of the types of entities eligible to \n     receive grants. Under the act, entities such as community-\n     based organizations, educational institutions, and other \n     groups deemed appropriate by the Secretary also would be \n     eligible to receive grants. As specified in the act, grant \n     funds could be used for a range of activities, such as \n     increasing opportunities for biking, promotion of healthy \n     eating in the workplace, and establishing incentives for \n     groceries to offer nutritional foods. Based on historical \n     spending patterns for similar activities at CDC and assuming \n     enactment by July 1, 2003, CBO estimates that implementing \n     the act would cost $17 million in 2004 and $290 million over \n     the 2004-2009 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     authorized amounts. The proposed changes would add $199 \n     million (relative to authorized spending under current law) \n     over the 2004-2009 period.\n       Requirements for HHS to submit reports to Congress would \n     require about $1 million in additional resources to implement \n     in 2005, CBO estimates.\n       The act also would reauthorize a CDC training program for \n     health professionals to treat obesity and would authorize \n     such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2006-2007 for \n     that purpose. Based on discussions with the agency about the \n     cost of training activities in this area, CBO estimates that \n     this provision would not have a significant budgetary effect.\n       The other provisions of S. 1172 would allow HHS to give \n     special consideration to obesity-related conditions in \n     certain grants and research and would not require additional \n     resources. CBO estimates that those provisions would not have \n     a budgetary effect.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1172 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA. State, local, and tribal governments may \n     benefit from the grant provisions of the bill, and none of \n     the bill's provisions would compel them to take any action.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost: Jeanne De Sa (226-\n     9010); Impact on State and Local Governments: Leo Lex (225-\n     3220); and Impact on the Private Sector: Samuel Kina (226-\n     2666).\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Oceans and Human Health \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms provides \n     society with an essential biomedical resource, a promising \n     source of novel compounds with therapeutic potential, and a \n     potentially important contribution to the national economy.\n       (2) The diversity of ocean life and research on the health \n     of marine organisms, including marine mammals and other \n     sentinel species, helps scientists in their efforts to \n     investigate and understand human physiology and biochemical \n     processes, as well as providing a means for monitoring the \n     health of marine ecosystems.\n       (3) The oceans drive climate and weather factors causing \n     severe weather events and shifts in temperature and rainfall \n     patterns that affect the density and distribution of disease-\n     causing organisms and the ability of public health systems to \n     address them.\n       (4) The oceans act as a route of exposure for human disease \n     and illnesses through ingestion of contaminated seafood and \n     direct contact with seawater containing toxins and disease-\n     causing organisms.\n       (5) During the past two decades, the incidence of harmful \n     blooms of algae and hypoxia has increased in United States \n     coastal waters, including the Great Lakes, and around the \n     world, contaminating shellfish, causing widespread fish \n     kills, threatening marine environmental quality and resulting \n     in substantial economic losses to coastal communities.\n       (6) Existing Federal programs and resources support \n     research in a number of these areas, but gaps in funding, \n     coordination, and outreach have impeded national progress in \n     addressing ocean health issues.\n       (7) National investment in a coordinated program of \n     research and monitoring would improve understanding of marine \n     ecosystems, allow prediction and prevention of marine public \n     health problems and assist in realizing the potential of the \n     oceans to contribute to the development of effective new \n     treatments of human diseases and a greater understanding of \n     human biology.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       (1) Presidential support and coordination of interagency \n     ocean science programs; and\n       (2) development and coordination of a comprehensive and \n     integrated United States ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \n     research and monitoring program that will assist this Nation \n     and the world to understand, use and respond to the role of \n     the oceans in human health.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BUDGET PROCESS REFORM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress and the \n     President should work together to enact budget process reform \n     legislation that would include mechanisms to restrain \n     Government spending. Such legislation may include--\n       (1) deficit targets that, when exceeded, would result in \n     across-the-board reductions in Federal spending except Social \n     Security, Medicare, and Veterans' benefits;\n       (2) revision of the content of budget resolutions to \n     increase their focus on aggregate levels, and to include \n     easily understood enforcement tools such as--\n       (A) discretionary spending limits;\n       (B) pay-as-you-go; and\n       (C) explicit committee allocations;\n       (3) emergency spending procedures which budget for \n     emergency needs;\n       (4) pay-as-you-go limitations which apply to non-budget \n     expenditures;\n       (5) limitations on unauthorized appropriations; and\n       (6) enhanced rescission or constitutional line-item veto \n     authority for the President.\n\n     SEC. 502. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BUDGET PROCESS REFORM WITH \n                   REGARD TO THE CREATION OF BIPARTISAN \n                   COMMISSIONS TO COMBAT WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE \n                   AND TO PROMOTE SPENDING EFFICIENCY.\n\n       (a) Waste, Fraud, and Abuse.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that legislation should be enacted that would create a \n     bipartisan commission for the purpose of--\n       (1) submitting recommendations on ways to eliminate waste, \n     fraud, and abuse; and\n       (2) to provide recommendations on ways in which to achieve \n     cost savings through enhancing program efficiencies in all \n     discretionary and entitlement programs.\n\n     The findings of the commission should be made on an annual \n     basis, and should be presented in conjunction with the \n     submission of the President's budget request to Congress.\n       (b) Efficiency.--It is the sense of the Senate that a \n     bipartisan commission should be established to--\n       (1) audit Federal domestic agencies, and programs within \n     such agencies, with the express purpose of providing Congress \n     with recommendations, and legislation;\n       (2) implement those recommendations; and\n       (3) realign or eliminate government agencies and programs \n     that are duplicative, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or \n     have failed to accomplish their intended purpose.\n\n     The findings of the commission should be made on an annual \n     basis, and should be presented in conjunction with the \n     submission of the President's budget request to Congress.\n\n     SEC. 503. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN \n                   ANNUAL DEFICIT SPENDING AND INCREASES IN DEBT \n                   SERVICE COSTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Congressional Budget \n     Office shall consult with the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate in order to prepare a report containing a discussion \n     of--\n       (1) the relationship between annual deficit spending and \n     increases in debt service costs;\n       (2) the relationship between incremental increases in \n     discretionary spending and debt service costs; and\n       (3) the feasibility of providing estimates of debt service \n     costs in the cost estimates prepared pursuant to section 308 \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n     SEC. 504. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE COSTS OF THE \n                   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on Finance \n     of the Senate should report a bill that consists of changes \n     in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to ensure that \n     spending within part D of the Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Benefit program in fiscal years 2005 through 2013 does not \n     exceed the total of $409,000,000,000 as estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n\n     SEC. 505. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PAY PARITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) compensation for civilian and military employees of the \n     United States, without whom we cannot successfully serve and \n     protect our citizens and taxpayers, must be sufficient to \n     support our critical efforts to recruit, retain, and reward \n     quality people effectively and responsibly; and\n       (2) to achieve this objective, the rate of increase in the \n     compensation of civilian employees should be equal to that \n     proposed for the military in the President's Fiscal Year 2005 \n     Budget.\n\n     SEC. 506. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON RETURNING STABILITY TO \n                   PAYMENTS UNDER MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the fees Medicare pays physicians and other health \n     professionals were reduced by 5.4 percent across-the-board in \n     2002.\n       (2) action by Congress in early 2003 narrowly averted a \n     4.4-percent across-the-board reduction in such fees that \n     year;\n       (3) in the fall of 2003, congressional action was once \n     again needed to prevent an across-the-board reduction of 4.5 \n     percent in such fees for 2004, as well as an anticipated \n     further reduction in 2005;\n       (4) based on current projections, estimates suggest that, \n     absent any action, fees will be significantly reduced across-\n     the-board in 2006 and each year thereafter until at least \n     2010;\n       (5) the prospect of continued payment reductions under the \n     Medicare physician fee schedule for the foreseeable future \n     threatens to destabilize an important element of the program, \n     namely physician participation and willingness to accept \n     Medicare patients;\n       (6) there are major flaws in the formula Medicare uses to \n     reimburse physicians which result in steep cuts that \n     adversely impact Medicare beneficiaries' access to care; and\n       (7) CMS should use its authority to exclude Medicare-\n     covered drugs and biologics from the physician formula and \n     accurately reflect in the formula the direct and indirect \n     cost of increases due to coverage decisions, administrative \n     actions, and rules and regulations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, while recent actions by Congress have helped address \n     the immediate reductions in reimbursement, further action by \n     Congress is urgently needed to put in place a new formula or \n     mechanism for updating Medicare physician fees in 2006 and \n     thereafter, in order to ensure--\n       (1) the long-term stability of the Medicare payment system \n     for physicians and other health care professionals, such that \n     payment rates keep pace with practice cost increases; and\n       (2) future access to physicians' services for Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n\n     SEC. 507. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE USE OF FEDERAL \n                   FUNDS TO SUPPORT AMERICAN COMPANIES AND \n                   AMERICAN WORKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States has lost more than 2,200,000 \n     manufacturing jobs since 2000;\n       (2) the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 239,454 \n     workers in a variety of sectors of the United States economy \n     lost their jobs as a result of mass layoffs in January 2004;\n       (3) there are millions of long-term unemployed Americans \n     who have been unable to find work; and\n       (4) the Buy American Act requires the Federal Government to \n     support American companies and American workers by buying \n     American-made goods.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Federal departments and agencies will, to the maximum \n     extent possible, purchase goods and services from American \n     companies; and\n       (2) Federal departments and agencies will ensure that, to \n     the maximum extent possible, the work required by Federal \n     contracts for goods and services will be performed in the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 508. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CLOSING THE ``TAX \n                   GAP''.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Service estimates that the gross \n     tax gap (the difference between the amount of taxes owed by \n     taxpayers and the amount actually collected) is now estimated \n     to be in excess of $300,000,000,000 annually;\n       (2) the Internal Revenue Service reports that the rate of \n     voluntary and timely compliance from taxpayers in paying what \n     they owe is approximately 85 percent;\n       (3) this overwhelming majority of honest and hardworking \n     taxpayers are forced to make up the shortfall that results \n     from taxpayers who fail to pay what they owe voluntarily;\n       (4) a former Commissioner of Internal Revenue has estimated \n     that honest taxpayers are paying ``15 percent more'' than \n     necessary if the tax gap were closed;\n       (5) the current Commissioner of Internal Revenue is \n     concerned that increasing numbers of taxpayers believe that \n     people are less likely to report their income taxes \n     accurately and more inclined to take a chance that they will \n     not be audited; and\n       (6) that an increase in enforcement efforts on taxes \n     already due and owing can generate significant additional \n     revenues without raising taxes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Internal Revenue Service should be provided the \n     resources necessary to increase enforcement activities that \n     would be concentrated on efforts to reduce the tax gap \n     substantially by the end of fiscal year 2009.\n\n     SEC. 509. SENSE OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT ON DRUG \n                   COMPARATIVENESS STUDIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the overall \n     discretionary levels set in this resolution assume \n     $75,000,000 in new budget authority in fiscal year 2005 and \n     new outlays that flow from this budget authority in fiscal \n     year 2005 and subsequent years, to fund new research and \n     ongoing literature surveys in the Agency for Health Care \n     Research and Quality. These activities will be designed to \n     improve scientific evidence related to the comparative \n     effectiveness and safety of prescription drugs and other \n     treatments and to disseminate the findings and underlying \n     data from such research to health care practitioners, \n     consumers, and health care purchasers.\n\n     SEC. 510. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR PORT \n                   SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the United States, the system of maritime commerce, \n     including seaports and other ports, is a critical element of \n     the United States economic, social, and environmental \n     infrastructure.\n       (2) In 2001, ports in the United States handled \n     approximately 5,400 ships, the majority of which were owned \n     by foreign persons and crewed by nationals of foreign \n     countries, that made a total of more than 60,000 calls at \n     such ports.\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\n       (3) In a typical year, more than 17,000,000 cargo \n     containers are handled at ports in the United States.\n       (4) Maritime commerce is the primary mode of transportation \n     for international trade, with ships carrying more than 80 \n     percent of such trade, by volume.\n       (5) Disruption of trade flowing through United States ports \n     could have a catastrophic impact on both the United States \n     and the world economies.\n       (6) In addition to the economic importance of United States \n     ports, such ports form a critical link in the United States \n     national security structure, and are necessary to ensure that \n     United States military material can be effectively and \n     quickly shipped to any location where such material is \n     needed.\n       (7) Terrorist groups, including extremist groups such as al \n     Qaeda, are likely to consider, formulate, and execute plans \n     to conduct a terrorist strike against one or more of the \n     ports in the United States.\n       (8) Terrorists have conducted attacks against maritime \n     commerce in the past, including the October 2002 attack on \n     the French oil tanker LIMBERG and the October 2000 attack on \n     the USS COLE in Yemen.\n       (9) It is critical that port security be enhanced and \n     improved through the adoption of better formulated security \n     procedures, the adoption of new regulations and law, and \n     investment in long-term capital improvements to the structure \n     of the United States most critical ports.\n       (10) Effective funding to provide adequate security at \n     United States ports requires a commitment to provide Federal \n     funds over multiple years to fund long-term capital \n     improvement projects.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the budget of the United States should provide adequate \n     funding for port security projects and not less than the \n     amount of such funding that is adequate to implement an \n     effective port security plan;\n       (2) the implementation of the budget of the United States \n     should permit the provision of Federal funds over multiple \n     years to fund long-term security improvement projects at \n     ports in the United States; and\n       (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security should, as soon as \n     practicable, develop a funding plan for port security that \n     permits funding over multiple years for such projects.\n\n     SEC. 511. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES AND \n                   UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) American Indians from 250 federally recognized tribes \n     nationwide attend tribal colleges and universities, a \n     majority of whom are first-generation college students.\n       (2) Tribal colleges and universities are located in some of \n     the most isolated and impoverished areas in the Nation, yet \n     they are the Nation's most poorly funded institutions of \n     higher education. While the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Assistance Act, or ``Tribal College Act'' provides \n     funding based solely on Indian students, the colleges have \n     open enrollment policies providing access to postsecondary \n     education opportunities to all interested students, about 20 \n     percent of whom are non-Indian. With rare exception, tribal \n     colleges and universities do not receive operating funds from \n     the States for these non-Indian State resident students. Yet, \n     if these same students attended any other public institutions \n     in their States, the State would provide basic operating \n     funds to the institution.\n       (3) While Congress has been increasing annual \n     appropriations for tribal colleges in recent years, the \n     President's fiscal year 2005 budget recommends a $5,500,000 \n     decrease in institutional operating funds. This represents \n     the third consecutive year that the President's budget \n     proposed decreases that Congress must restore.\n       (4) Because of congressional budget restorations, the \n     tribal colleges funded through titles I and II of the \n     Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act are \n     within $19,000,000 of full funding at their authorized level.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced \n     by tribal colleges and universities and assumes that priority \n     consideration will be provided to them through funding of the \n     Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, the \n     Equity in Educational Land Grant Status Act, title III of the \n     Higher Education Act, and the National Science Foundation \n     Tribal College Program; and\n       (2) such priority consideration reflects the intent of \n     Congress to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding \n     authorization goals for tribal colleges and universities.\n\n     SEC. 512. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States is in the grip of pervasively higher \n     home energy prices;\n       (2) high natural gas, heating oil, and propane prices are, \n     in general, having an effect that is rippling through the \n     United States economy and are, in particular, impacting home \n     energy bills;\n       (3) while persons in many sectors can adapt to natural gas, \n     heating oil, and propane price increases, persons in some \n     sectors simply cannot;\n       (4) elderly and disabled citizens who are living on fixed \n     incomes, the working poor, and other low-income individuals \n     face hardships wrought by high home energy prices;\n       (5) the energy burden for persons among the working poor \n     often exceeds 20 percent of those persons' incomes under \n     normal conditions;\n       (6) under current circumstances, home energy prices are \n     unnaturally high, and these are not normal circumstances;\n       (7) while critically important and encouraged, State energy \n     assistance and charitable assistance funds have been \n     overwhelmed by the crisis caused by the high home energy \n     prices;\n       (8) the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (referred to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') and the companion \n     weatherization assistance program (referred to in this \n     section as ``WAP''), are the Federal Government's primary \n     means to assist eligible low-income individuals in the United \n     States to shoulder the burdens caused by their home cooling \n     and heating needs;\n       (9) in 2003, LIHEAP reached only 15 percent of the persons \n     in the United States who were eligible for assistance under \n     the program;\n       (10) since LIHEAP's inception, its inflation-adjusted \n     buying power has eroded by 58 percent; and\n       (11) current Federal funding for LIHEAP is not sufficient \n     to meet the cooling and heating needs of low-income families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) an adequate increase in funding for each of fiscal \n     years 2005 and 2006 to carry out the LIHEAP program;\n       (2) an adequate increase in funding for fiscal year 2005 \n     and an adequate increase in funding for fiscal year 2006 to \n     carry out the WAP program;\n       (3) appropriations, for these programs, of sufficient \n     additional funds to realistically address the cooling and \n     heating needs of low-income families; and\n       (4) advance appropriations of the necessary funds to ensure \n     the smooth operation of the programs during times of peak \n     demand.\n\n     SEC. 513. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING FUNDING RESTORATION \n                   FOR AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) funding for 33 programs administered by the Cooperative \n     State Research, Education, and Extension Service of the \n     Department of Agriculture were each reduced by 10 percent in \n     the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \n     Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 \n     (118 Stat. 9);\n       (2) those cuts are already hurting a wide range of proven \n     programs that help people, communities, and businesses;\n       (3) the cuts have put at risk important advances made in \n     all 50 States and United States territories, including--\n       (A) combating obesity through programs such as the Expanded \n     Food and Nutrition Education Program;\n       (B) expanding environmentally-minded pest management \n     programs;\n       (C) ensuring food safety; and\n       (D) educating farmers and ranchers about new sustainable \n     agricultural practices;\n       (4) the National Research Initiative is the flagship \n     competitive grants program funded through the Cooperative \n     State Research, Education, and Extension Service;\n       (5) because of limited funding the Service is able to fund \n     only a small fraction of the meritorious research proposals \n     that the Service receives under the National Research \n     Initiative program; and\n       (6) base funding at the Service that supports the research \n     infrastructure has fallen steadily over the past decade.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that levels in this concurrent resolution assume that in \n     making appropriations and revenue decisions, the Senate \n     supports--\n       (1) the restoration of the 33 accounts of the Cooperative \n     State Research, Education, and Extension Service;\n       (2) the fiscal year 2005 funding of the National Research \n     Initiative; and\n       (3) the fiscal year 2005 funding of competitive research \n     programs of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and \n     Extension Service in an amount that is adequate to--\n       (A) fight obesity and stave off chronic diseases;\n       (B) combat insects and animal and plant diseases;\n       (C) establish new crops, improved livestock, and economic \n     opportunities for producers; and\n       (D) keep pathogens and other dangers out of the air, water, \n     soil, plants, and animals.\n\n     SEC. 514. RESERVE FUND FOR HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM, \n                   ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTER GRANTS, AND PORT \n                   SECURITY GRANTS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations \n     to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, \n     discretionary spending limits, and other appropriate levels \n     and limits in this resolution by up to $1,545,000,000 in \n     budget authority for fiscal year 2005, and by the amount of \n     outlays flowing therefrom in 2005 and subsequent years, for a \n     bill, amendment, motion, or conference report that provides \n     additional fiscal year 2005 discretionary appropriations, in \n     excess of the levels provided in this resolution, for the \n     programs at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\n     SEC. 515. STATE HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, of the funds for the \n     Department of Homeland Security, $800,000,000 shall be \n     allocated for the State Homeland Security Grant program; \n     $250,000,000 for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \n     program; and $275,000,000 for Port Security Grants. It is \n     further the sense of the Senate that the State Homeland \n     Security Grant Program shall be increased by $220,000,000 in \n     order to provide for a more equitable formula for \n     distributing funds.\n\n     SEC. 516. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the increased funding \n     for the Homeland Security Department programs shall come from \n     the cancellation of planned future deliveries of oil to the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n     SEC. 517. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING A NATIONAL ANIMAL \n                   IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) animal identification is important for operational \n     management, herd health, and increased trade opportunities;\n       (2) animal identification is a critical component of the \n     animal health infrastructure of the United States;\n       (3) it is vital to the well-being of all people in the \n     United States to protect animal agriculture in the United \n     States by safeguarding animal health;\n       (4) the ability to collect information in a timely manner \n     is critical to an effective response to an imminent threat to \n     animal health or food safety.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume that in \n     making appropriations and revenue decisions, the Senate \n     supports--\n       (1) the development and implementation of a national animal \n     identification program recognizing the need for resources to \n     carry out the implementation of the plan;\n       (2) the provision by the Secretary of Agriculture of a \n     time-line for the development and implementation of the \n     program as soon as practicable after the date of approval of \n     this concurrent resolution;\n       (3) the provision by the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure \n     the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, State animal \n     health agencies, and agricultural producers are provided \n     funds necessary to implement a national animal identification \n     program; and\n       (4) the establishment of a program that is not overly \n     burdensome to agricultural producers and ensures the privacy \n     of information of agricultural producers.\n\n     SEC. 518. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE \n                   GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND \n                   MALARIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States--\n       (A) helped establish The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Fund'');\n       (B) provided its first donation; and\n       (C) provides leadership to the Fund under Fund Board \n     Chairman Tommy Thompson, Secretary of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services;\n       (2) as a complement to the President's historic 15-country \n     AIDS initiative, the Fund provides resources to fight AIDS, \n     tuberculosis, malaria, and related diseases around the world;\n       (3) section 202 of the United States Leadership Against \n     HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. \n     7622) authorizes contributions to the Fund to the extent that \n     United States contributions do not exceed 33 percent of all \n     contributions to the Fund, allowing the United States to \n     contribute $1 for every $2 contributed by other sources.\n       (4) during fiscal years 2001 through 2003, the United \n     States provided $623,000,000 of the total contributions of \n     $1,900,000,000 to the Fund, which represents approximately \n     \\1/3\\ of total contributions to the Fund;\n       (5) Congress has appropriated $547,000,000 to the Fund for \n     fiscal year 2004, which has been matched by confirmed pledges \n     of $994,000,000, and is slightly more than \\1/3\\ of total \n     pledges, with additional pledges expected;\n       (6) over the life of the Fund, Congress has appropriated \n     sufficient amounts to match contributions from other sources \n     to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \n     on a 1-to-2 basis; and\n       (7) transparency and accountability are critical to fund \n     grant-making and the United States should work with foreign \n     governments and international organizations to support the \n     Fund's efforts to use its contributions most effectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this concurrent resolution and subsequent appropriations \n     Acts should provide sufficient funds to continue matching \n     contributions from other sources to The Global Fund to Fight \n     AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria on a 1-to-2 basis.\n\n     SEC. 519. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CHILD NUTRITION \n                   FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal child nutrition programs have long played a \n     critical role in providing children in the United States with \n     quality nutrition from birth through secondary school;\n       (2) recognizing the value of these benefits to children in \n     the United States, Congress has an enduring tradition of \n     bipartisan support for these programs;\n       (3) children in the United States are increasingly at \n     nutritional risk due to poor dietary habits, lack of access \n     to nutritious foods, and obesity and diet-related diseases \n     associated with poor dietary intake;\n       (4) many children in the United States who would benefit \n     from Federal child nutrition programs do not receive benefits \n     due to financial or administrative barriers; and\n       (5) Federal child nutrition programs are expected to be \n     reauthorized in the One Hundred Eighth Congress.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume that in \n     making appropriations and revenue decisions, the Senate \n     supports the retention in the conference report for this \n     concurrent resolution of the additional funds provided in \n     this concurrent resolution for the reauthorization of Federal \n     child nutrition programs.\n\n     SEC. 520. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPENSATION FOR \n                   EXPOSURE TO TOXIC SUBSTANCES AT THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (referred to in \n     this section as the ``EEOICPA'') is intended to ensure the \n     timely payment of uniform and adequate compensation to \n     covered employees suffering from occupational illnesses \n     incurred during their work for the Department of Energy.\n       (2) The Department of Labor is responsible for implementing \n     the provisions under subtitle B of the EEOICPA, relating to \n     claims for radiation related cancers, beryllium disease, and \n     silicosis. The Department of Labor has, within its area of \n     responsibility, processed over 95 percent of the 52,000 \n     claims it has received, and is processing these claims in an \n     average of 73 days.\n       (3) As of the date of enactment of this resolution, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services has not promulgated \n     the regulations required under section 3626 of the EEOICPA \n     for allowing claimants to petition to be members of the \n     Special Exposure Cohort. Special Exposure Cohorts provide a \n     presumption in favor of the claimant for radiation related \n     cancers if--\n       (A) it is not feasible to estimate radiation dose with \n     sufficient accuracy; and\n       (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that the health of the \n     class of workers may have been endangered.\n       (4) The Department of Energy, which is responsible for \n     implementing subtitle D of the EEOICPA, relating to \n     occupational illness caused by exposure to toxic substances \n     at Department of Energy facilities, finalized its regulations \n     on August 14, 2002. The Department of Energy has processed 1 \n     percent of the 22,000 claims received through the Department \n     of Energy physicians panels since its regulations were made \n     final.\n       (5) The Department of Energy has no willing payor for up to \n     50 percent of the claims that its physicians panels determine \n     to be related to exposure to a toxic substance at the \n     Department of Energy. As a consequence, many claimants with a \n     positive determination from the physicians panel will be \n     denied benefits. Many States, including Alaska, Colorado, \n     Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, New Mexico, Idaho, and \n     Nevada, may not have a willing payor.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) claims for occupational illness, which are determined \n     to be caused by exposure to toxic substances at Department of \n     Energy facilities under subtitle D of the EEOICPA, should be \n     promptly, equitably, and efficiently compensated;\n       (2) administrative and technical changes should be made to \n     the EEOICPA to--\n       (A) improve claims processing and review by physicians \n     panels to ensure cost-effective and efficient consideration \n     and determination of workers' claims;\n       (B) provide for membership in additional special exposure \n     cohorts; and\n       (C) address eligibility issues at facilities with residual \n     radiation; and\n       (3) the President and Congress should work together at the \n     earliest opportunity to develop a plan that effectively \n     resolves the issue of a lack of a willing payor for many \n     claims that are determined under subtitle D of the EEOICPA to \n     be related to exposure to a toxic substance at Department of \n     Energy facilities.\n\n     SEC. 521. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX INCENTIVES FOR \n                   CERTAIN RURAL COMMUNITIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that if tax relief measures \n     are passed in accordance with the assumptions in this \n     resolution in this session of Congress, such legislation \n     should include--\n       (1) tax and other financial incentives, similar to those \n     included in the New Homestead Act (S. 602), to help rural \n     communities fight the economic decimation caused by chronic \n     out-migration by giving such communities the tools they need \n     to attract individuals to live and work, or to start and grow \n     a business, in such rural areas, and\n       (2) revenue provisions which fully offset the cost of such \n     tax and other financial incentives.\n\n     SEC. 522. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING SUMMER FOOD PILOT \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n        It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     concurrent resolution assume that in making appropriations \n     and revenue decisions in Function 600 (Income Security), the \n     Senate supports the provision, to the Food and Nutrition \n     Service and other appropriate agencies within the Department \n     of Agriculture, of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and \n     $127,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2005\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\n     through 2009, to enable those agencies to expand the summer \n     food pilot projects established under section 18(f) of the \n     Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1769(f)) to all States of the United States and to all \n     service institutions (including service institutions \n     described in section 13(a)(7) of that Act).\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

DOROTHY HEIGHT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before we close tonight, I wanted to make a \ncouple of comments. One has to do with a wonderful ceremony that we had \ntoday in the Rotunda where the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony \nhonoring Dr. Dorothy Height was conducted.\n  These ceremonies are a wonderful time in the sense that it allows \neach of us to go back as individuals and really celebrate, whether it \nis points in history, great leaders, icons, or pioneers, and indeed \ntoday in recognizing Dr. Dorothy Height we had all of those--a true \nicon, a pioneer, a leader, a hero, a woman who has had an indelible \nimpact on not only one generation but multiple generations. In \naddition, today was her 92nd birthday.\n  It had a special meaning for me in that just about a month ago I had \nthe opportunity to lead a delegation of 10 Senators, including the \ndistinguished Senator who occupies the chair at this juncture, on a \ncivil rights pilgrimage through Alabama, and it continued on up into \nTennessee.\n  Over that period of several days, we had the opportunity to walk in \nthe steps of true giants. I had the opportunity to spend some time \ntoday with, indeed, one of those giants of an era of which we are true \nbeneficiaries, and that was Dr. Dorothy Height. She was the only woman \namong the big six who planned and led the civil rights movement, an \nextraordinary American, a woman who was truly fearless in a time of \nfear, a woman who was an optimist when the future was bleak, a woman \nwho brought people together when others were fighting to keep society \napart.\n  As we sat in that wonderful Rotunda today, thinking about the great \nhistory and great patriots who are portrayed in the Rotunda, with the \nlarge dome above, you could not help but think how appropriate it was \nfor her to join those patriots in the struggle she led, in large part \nthe struggle for equality and that endowment of that right of life and \nliberty and pursuit of happiness.\n  It was wonderful to be able to participate in that ceremony. I \nwanted, as we wait to close here shortly, to once again honor Dr. \nDorothy Height for her tremendous leadership over many years.\n  She said, right before the end of that ceremony, in her closing \nremarks, until the Good Lord is done with her, she has a lot more to do \nand people can expect her to continue to do a lot along the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3110-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3110-S3115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OCEANS AND HUMAN HEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1218, the Oceans \nand Human Health Act, legislation being considered by the Senate today. \nThis bill, which Senator Stevens and I introduced last year, was \nreported unanimously from the Commerce Committee, will spur the \ndevelopment of an exciting new field of research, one that explores the \nrole of the oceans in human health. Senators Inouye, Breaux, Kerry, \nCantwell, Bill Nelson, Lautenberg, DeWine, Levin, and Kennedy have all \nlent their considerable support to the bill as cosponsors. I am also \npleased to have worked closely with the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nHELP, Committee, Senators Judd Gregg and Ted Kennedy, in crafting the \nfinal manager's amendment to the bill.\n  The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, established pursuant to the \nOceans Act of 2000, is poised to issue its draft report with \nrecommendations for a new national ocean policy. The draft report is \nlikely to recommend increased Federal support for integrated and \ninnovative ocean research initiatives such as in oceans and human \nhealth in order to focus attention on the increasingly complex \ninteraction between humans and the sea. The Cceans and Human Health Act \nwould establish a national interagency program that will coordinate \nresearch into oceans and human health and ensure the availability of an \nadequate Federal investment in this critical area. It also would \nauthorize such a program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, to strengthen its work in this important field of \nstudy.\n  Throughout history, society has turned to the oceans for food, \ntransport, commerce and recreation. This\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\ntremendous resource has enriched and sustained our existence. It is no \ncoincidence that today, over 50 percent of the U.S. population lives in \nthe coastal zone, and this number is increasing. In addition, over 95 \npercent of U.S. overseas trade moves through our Nation's ports and \nthis volume is expected to more than double by 2020. Our oceans are \ninextricably linked to our personal and economic well-being.\n  In recent years, the rich biodiversity of the world's seas has \ngenerated considerable interest. Scientists believe the oceans \nrepresent a promising source of novel compounds with therapeutic and/or \ndisease-fighting capabilities. A 1999 National Research Council report, \n``From Monsoons to Microbes,'' noted that nature has been the \ntraditional source of new pharmaceuticals and found that over half of \nmarketed drugs are extracted or produced from natural sources. Our \noceans account for over 80 percent of the planet's biological \nproductivity, yet little of it has been catalogued or studied. At \npresent, there are only three marine compounds in clinical use--and \nthese were developed in the 1950s. While there are some new compounds \nin the pipeline, we need to speed research efforts to ensure we get \nmore products approved.\n  I am encouraged by research suggesting that sea sponges contain \ncompounds which show promise in treating pancreatic cancer. And \nrecently, a scientist analyzing a water sample from the Sargasso Sea, \noff Bermuda, discovered at least 1,800 new microbial species and more \nthan 1.2 million genes in that sample. Imagine what new drug \ndiscoveries await researchers and the medical community.\n\n  Pioneering scientists are also needed to tackle marine environmental \nissues that affect human and marine life alike, such as ocean pollution \nand marine pathogens. Our marine resources are under growing \nenvironmental stresses. Signs of these stresses include ``dead zones,'' \nloss of coastal wetlands, changes in ocean salinity, contamination of \nfish and marine life, and increases in extreme weather events \nassociated with global climate change. Over the past 2 weeks, over 60 \ndolphin carcasses have been found along Florida's panhandle beaches and \nbays. Preliminary test results point to one or more biotoxins that are \nassociated with red tides. Certain biotoxins have been known to produce \neye and respiratory irritation in humans. Dolphins are an important \nindicator species of environmental pollution and their unusually high \nmortality rates in Florida raise the issue of potential risks to human \nhealth.\n  Because oceans act as a route of exposure for human disease through \ningestion of contaminated seafood or direct contact with saltwater \ncontaining toxins and disease-causing organisms, it is vital that we \nlearn more about how public health is affected by the marine \nenvironment. We must ensure that the sea maintains its capacity to \nsustain itself without becoming a ``dead zone.'' We must find ways to \nmonitor and reduce the occurrence of ocean toxins that kill marine \nmammals and taint seafood. As with cancer, our goal must be \nunderstanding and prevention, rather than relying exclusively on \ntreatment.\n  Many research programs and laboratories perform research and related \nactivities that could contribute significantly to a national research \neffort, but such efforts have not always realized their potential. To \nbe successful, research into oceans and human health must integrate \ndisciplines, bringing together oceanographers and biomedical \nresearchers to better understand marine processes, reduce public health \nrisks and enhance our biomedical capabilities.\n  The Oceans and Human Health initiative recently established at NOAA, \nand a joint program between the National Science Foundation, NSF, and \nthe National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, \nalready show tremendous promise, and this legislation provides further \nsupport for a coordinated Federal effort. The NIEHS and NSF initiative \nprovides $6 million annually to establish centers of excellence \nfocusing on harmful algal blooms, water and vectorborne diseases, and \nmarine pharmaceuticls and probes. In addition, we provided NOAA with \nappropriations of $8 million in Fiscal Year 2003 and $10 million in \nFiscal Year 2004 for an oceans and human health initiative focused on \nstrengthening important oceans and human health research within NOAA's \nareas of focus, including health coasts and marine life.\n  Within NOAA, an interdisciplinary and medically oriented approach to \nocean research can be found at two marine laboratories in Charleston, \nSC. The NOAA labs have partnered with the National Institute for \nStandards and Technology, the State of South Carolina, the Medical \nUniversity of South Carolina, and the College of Charleston and are on \nthe front lines of discovery and prevention, particularly in the \nemerging field of marine genomics. They are hard at work on todays' \nimportant public and marine environmental health issues. For instance, \nthey are conducting research into dolphin health that will for the \nfirst time utilize a traditional medical approach to help us learn more \nabout the health of dolphins in the wild.\n  This NOAA research collaboration epitomizes the variety of important \ndisciplines that must work side by side if we are to make progress in \nunderstanding the connections between oceans and human health. It is \nhome to cutting-edge research involving algal toxins, natural products \nwith potential pharmaceutical applications, and viral and bacterial \npathogens that cause disease in marine animals, with potential links to \nhuman illness, disease processes and natural product chemistry. The \nscientists use unique medical tools such as nuclear magnetic resonators \nto help map the cellular and genetic structure of marine organisms and \nhave developed methods for detecting pesticides in water, sediments, \nfish, and marine mammals that may potentially affect both the health of \nthe marine environment and human health. The scientists are also \ndeveloping exposure, toxicology and disease models to assess \npollution's effects on a variety of marine organisms. Their work will \nbetter define ocean health and bridge the gap with existing human \nhealth models.\n  Taken together, the NIEHS-NSF and NOAA research initiatives offer an \nexcellent basis for building a comprehensive national program. In \naddition, a number of other Federal agencies are poised to make \nsignificant contributions.\n  The Oceans and Human Health Act provides the legislative framework \nfor coordinated, national investment to improve understanding of marine \necosystems, address marine public health problems and tap into the \nocean's potential contribution to new biomedical treatments and \nadvances. At the heart of this legislation--and key to its success--is \nour commitment to building new partnerships among Federal health, \nscience and ocean agencies, diverse scientific disciplines, and \nacademic researchers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a more detailed \nsummary of the legislation printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Section by Section Analysis of Oceans and Human Health Act\n\n       The Oceans and Human Health Act would authorize the \n     establishment of a coordinated Federal research program to \n     aid in understanding and responding to the role of oceans in \n     human health. The bill would establish a Federal interagency \n     Oceans and Human Health initiative coordinated through the \n     National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) as well as \n     establish an Oceans and Human Health initiative at the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The \n     bill also directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a \n     coordinated public information and outreach program with the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA), the Centers for Disease Control \n     (CDC) and the States to provide information on potential \n     ocean-related human health risks.\n     Section 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nincluded in the package of amendments offered by the managers of H.R. \n2584, a bill to provide for the conveyance to the Utrok Atoll local \ngovernment of a decommissioned National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration ship, and for other purposes.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, by virtue of its \njurisdiction for the U.S. territories, has a long history in dealing \nwith the islands of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. \nUtrok Atoll is one such group of islands located in the northern \nMarshall Islands, about 2500 miles southwest of Hawaii. One distinction \nof these islands is that they were affected by fallout from our \nNation's first thermonuclear bomb test--the ``Bravo'' test held at \nBikini Atoll in 1954. Since that time, the U.S. Government has been \nmonitoring the health of the individuals affected, providing \nhealthcare, and monitoring the radiation levels on the islands. All \nAmericans should recognize the impact that the development of our \nnation's nuclear deterrent had on Utrok and the other affected \ncommunities at Enewetak, Bikini, and Rongelap. We have a continuing \ninterest in their welfare.\n  This legislation, H.R. 2584, serves that continuing interest by \nauthorizing the transfer of a decommissioned NOAA vessel to the Utrok \nlocal government to assist the community by improving transportation to \nthe capital at Majuro. One reason to visit Majuro is to use the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's whole-body counting facility located there. \nMembers of the affected communities can get whole-body counts and \nreassure themselves about the efficacy of their radiation clean-up and \nremediation efforts.\n  One concern regarding the transfer of this vessel, however, is \nwhether the community has properly planned for its use and operation. \nOver the years, the Energy Committee has been involved in several \nvessel transfers. Two common problems with these projects are that the \nvessels are found to be ill-suited to the needs of the community or the \ncommunity lacks the resources to operate and maintain them.\n  I commend the managers of this bill for including an amendment that \nwould require the Utrok government to submit a plan for the use of the \nvessel, including the identification of sources of funding for \noperations and maintenance. I understand that NOAA had an annual \noperating budget for this vessel of $2.9 million. While there would be \neconomies available to reduce these costs, such as hiring a non-U.S. \ncitizen crew, operation and maintenance costs will certainly be beyond \nthe capacity of the Utrok local government. It is my hope that the \nUtrok local government will work with the Marshall Islands government \nand with other communities in the area to find the resources needed to \nmake this project a success. If, in the end, the resources are not \nfound, it may be necessary, as it has been in other cases, to sell the \nvessel in order to purchase a more suitable one, or to use the proceeds \nto meet the community's needs in other ways.\n  I thank the managers of this bill for including this amendment, and I \nlook forward to reviewing with them, and with the Utrok community, the \nplan for this vessel's use.\n  The bill (H.R. 2584), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3116-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, tomorrow, following morning business as \njust outlined, the Senate will begin consideration of the Unborn \nVictims of Violence bill. We had previously worked out a unanimous \nconsent agreement and under that agreement there will only be two \namendments in order, one by Senator Feinstein and one by Senator \nMurray. In addition, there will be a total of 6\\1/2\\ hours of debate on \nthe amendments and underlying bill. Senators should expect several \nrollcall votes during tomorrow's session as the Senate completes action \non the Unborn Victims of Violence bill.\n  Mr. President, I will turn to the assistant leader if he has any \ncomments to make.\n  Before we close, I do want to say I was disappointed in the earlier \ncloture vote today. As has been outlined, the sanctions have begun. \nThey began on March 1 and will continue with each passing day, just \nunderscoring the urgency that we must address this JOBS bill, the FSC/\nETI bill, the bill we know now will jumpstart jobs.\n  I did enter a motion to reconsider that vote. I hope Members will all \nrethink their desire to offer unrelated amendments and bring unrelated \nissues to the floor which have stalled the measure. If we are unable to \ncome to some resolution, we will do what we are doing now and proceed \nto other Senate business with the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. If we \nare able to refocus--and I pledge to work with the Democratic \nleadership over the ensuing hours and days--our attention on the \nunderlying measure, then we will return to that bill and finish it as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished majority leader will \nyield for a brief comment, we recognize, as has been stated by this \nSenator and other Senators on this side of the aisle, this is a bill \nwhich we have been on for 3 days. As the distinguished majority leader \nhas stated, he wants Members to reconsider having cast their vote \nagainst cloture. We would also ask that\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nthe majority through the distinguished majority leader reconsider \nallowing us to have a vote on the overtime matter. As I have stated, we \ncan dispose of that with 10 minutes of debate on our side. There are \nsome other amendments. We had 75. But we have told managers of the bill \nif we can work that down significantly, we would do that with each \namendment; we could have a short time agreement. And we think we can \ndispose of this bill very quickly, which I hope through the \nintercession of the distinguished majority leader we can do.\n  I would simply refer to the chairman of the committee, Senator \nGrassley. This is a quote from him where he said:\n\n       I prefer to vote on things up or down and move on. My \n     feeling is sometime we have to face this issue. So we might \n     as well face it now.\n\n  Added Grassley:\n\n       If Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist had his druthers, it \n     might be to give Democrats a straight vote on the amendment \n     to allow the corporate tax bill to proceed.\n\n  I think Senator Grassley, who is the sage farmer of the Senate, \nspeaks as always with a lot of wisdom. I think those two sentences \nspeak volumes. We need to vote on overtime and move on to this most \nimportant tax bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me very briefly respond.\n  The implication is one amendment is holding this bill up. It is not. \nReference has been made to overtime over the course of the day. As I \nsaid in yesterday's opening statement and closing statement, we are \nwilling to consider other amendments on the bill that are really \ngermane to the bill. It is not just one amendment. These are message \namendments, and we have voted on overtime in the past. There are other \namendments which the other side of the aisle wants to bring to make \nmessages and to score political points. I notice it did start at 75, \nand maybe it is down to 15 or 12 or 10. It is not down to just one \namendment.\n  I pledge to keep working both sides of the aisle to get it down to a \nmanageable number. Nobody is locked down on what we will do or what we \nwill not do. I want to be able to complete this bill by staying on the \nbill itself. There is going to be a lot of legislation coming through.\n  I believe we have a good agreement for tomorrow to proceed and finish \nthat bill. I think next week we may be going to the welfare bill, if we \ncan't come back to the JOBS bill.\n  There is going to be plenty of opportunity to offer these messages, \npolitically driven amendments. This FSC/ETI Jumpstart JOBS bill is not \nthe bill to do it on. It is an important bill. We need to finish it \nexpeditiously. We have Members on record today who want to finish this \nbill as written. It came out of committee 19 to 2 under the excellent \nleadership of Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, who wants to \ncontinue to offer a whole number of message amendments--not just one, \nand not just two, and not just overtime.\n  I say all of that so there is no misunderstanding. I will continue to \nfight to get this bill through. I am disappointed by the vote today and \nby actions which have held that up. As majority leader, I need to keep \nthe body moving along.\n  We are going to address, beginning tomorrow morning, a fresh issue on \nthe floor of the Senate. I think we will have a very good debate, and \nwe will complete action on that bill. If we can work through this, \nhopefully we can come back and address the JOBS bill in an orderly way. \nThen we can really have the end in sight and try to get it down to a \nmanageable number of amendments that relate to the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/24/senate-section/article/S3117-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
