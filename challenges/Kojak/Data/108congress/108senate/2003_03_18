Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 264\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the first amendment \nto the budget resolution pending before us. I believe this is a \ncritically important amendment as our Nation is on the brink of war.\n  After the President's speech of last night, I don't know what could \nbe more clear than we are on the eve of conflict. The budget before us, \nsubmitted by the President, the budget that came out of the Budget \nCommittee, contains no provision for that conflict. There is no money \nfor conflict. There is no money for reconstruction. There is no money \nfor occupation. There is no money.\n  Some have said, well, they have looked at the history and found that \nin the past wars were not budgeted for until operations have begun. I \nsuggest operations have begun. We have nearly a quarter of a million \ntroops poised on the border with Iraq. We have hundreds of thousands of \nreservists who have been called up. We have five carrier battle groups \nin the area. Operations have begun. We have special forces in Iraq at \nthis moment. We are conducting air operations over Iraq at this moment. \nWho can assert that operations have not begun?\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\n  In the past, the Second World War, the First World War, Uncle Sam \ndelivered a message to the American people: It takes taxes and bonds. \nAnd the message was that it takes common sacrifice to defend this \nNation. But that is not what this budget says. This budget says, let's \nhave a $1.5 trillion tax cut that goes primarily to the wealthiest \namong us before there has been any assessment of war cost or occupation \ncost or reconstruction cost or humanitarian aid cost. That strikes many \nof us as unwise. Many of us believe we ought to take a moment and do a \ncalculation of what this war is likely to cost before we engage in new \nspending initiatives or before we launch a whole other round of \nsignificant tax cuts, given the fact we are already in deep and record \ndeficit.\n  The deficit under the chairman's mark for this year, excluding Social \nSecurity, will be over $500 billion in a $2.2 trillion budget. That is \na massive budget deficit by any calculation. As I have indicated, it \nincludes no money for potential war cost, none.\n  The amendment I am offering says this: The Senate may not consider \nlegislation that would increase the deficit until the President submits \nto Congress a detailed report on the overall estimated costs of the \nwar. This measure would be enforced with a 60-vote point of order. In \nother words, if there were more than 60 votes in the Senate to add to \nthe deficit, we would be able to do that.\n  There are two exceptions. We could add the spending for legislation \nrelating to national or homeland security. That just represents common \nsense. We certainly don't want to limit our ability to respond to any \nthreat. So we would have an exception from the 60-vote point of order \nin adding to the deficit for expenditures for national defense or \nhomeland security.\n  The second exception would be an economic recovery and job creation \npackage which does not increase the deficit over the time period 2005 \nto 2013.\n  In other words, we would be saying the following: We are going to \nhave a 60-vote point of order against any measure that increases the \ndeficit with the exception of additional spending for national defense \nor homeland security and with the additional exception of a stimulus \npackage for this economy that does not add to the deficit in the years \n2005 to 2013. The stimulus package could add to the deficit in 2003 and \n2004 but not beyond.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will think carefully about what this amendment \nwill do and what is in the budget before us.\n  In the Senate Republican plan, there is no money for any part of the \nconflict. We learn from news reports that there will be a supplemental \nsent up to us by the White House for between $60 and $95 billion. That \nmeans the deficit in 2003 will approach $600 billion when we exclude \nSocial Security, truly a massive deficit.\n  It has been asserted that we don't know the cost of conflict. That is \ntrue. That is understandable. The one thing we know, though, is that \nthe cost of conflict is not zero. That is the number that is in this \nbudget. That is what the President has sent us as a budget, that there \nis no cost. That defies common sense. We know there is cost.\n  We know there are substantial costs. Here are some of them. We are \nreading in the press that the defense supplemental, the war \nsupplemental the President may send us will be in the range of $60 to \n$95 billion. I read in the paper this morning that it may be $80 \nbillion.\n  Humanitarian aid, we know we are going to be responsible for \nrefugees, perhaps millions of people requiring feeding, requiring \nshelter, dispossessed by the conflict. Those estimates, on a \nconservative side, are $1 billion.\n  Reconstruction of Iraq, not included in the budget, there is a \nvarious range of estimates; $30 billion over 10 years, a conservative \nestimate.\n  The occupation of Iraq, there is no provision in the budget. \nEstimates run from $17 to $46 billion a year.\n  Aid to allies--Israel, Jordan, Egypt--not provided for in the budget, \nestimates of the cost run from $6 to $17 billion. We have not listed \nTurkey here. We negotiated an agreement with Turkey for some $6 \nbillion. There are discussions with Russia, multiple billions of \ndollars in terms of a package for them.\n  And the war on terrorism in 2004, no additional provision--estimates \nthat that could cost $19 billion. None of it is included in this \nbudget.\n  Does that make any sense when we all know that the conflict is about \nto start and that we have already experienced substantial costs just \nmoving our forces into position to launch this attack? Many of us don't \nthink so.\n  Congress Daily reported on March 14 the following:\n\n       Vice President Cheney met with Senate Majority Leader Frist \n     Thursday to discuss, among other things, the timing of a \n     spending request on military action in Iraq. It is not \n     expected that such a request would come until after the House \n     and Senate complete floor action on the budget resolution, a \n     key aide said.\n\n  That report went on to say:\n\n       Having a supplemental that could total somewhere between \n     $65 billion and $95 billion come up while the tax cuts in the \n     budget resolution are being debated could threaten the \n     Republicans' economic agenda. House leaders have also said \n     they want the supplemental war request delayed as long as \n     possible to provide breathing room between the tax cuts and \n     war spending.\n\n  I hope this is not true. I hope very much that we are not engaged in \na cynical attempt to hide costs from people so that we make the tax \ncuts more palatable. If that is true, that is very disturbing. We ought \nto have all the cards on the table. We ought to be telling the American \npeople the truth as completely and as fully as we can know it. And the \ntruth is, this war is going to cost a lot of money. It ought to be \nincluded in our calculations to the best of our information.\n  We know from previous conflicts that initial war cost estimates are \noften low. Go back to the Civil War. The estimates were it was going to \ncost $200 million. The actual cost was $3.2 billion, a 1,500-percent \nincrease over initial estimates.\n  World War II: Initial estimates were that it would cost about $112 \nbillion. It wound up costing over $195 billion, a 75-percent increase. \nVietnam: Initial estimates were $12.3 billion. It wound up costing $111 \nbillion, an 800-percent increase over the initial estimates.\n  We can all hope that will not be the case here, and I do not in any \nway suggest we ought to budget for those kinds of dramatic increases \nover what the initial estimates are. But at the very least we ought to \nbe budgeting for what the estimates are.\n  The President spoke last night. He spoke clearly. He spoke directly. \nHe gave Saddam Hussein and his cadre 48 hours to get out of Iraq. The \nreports are this morning that Saddam Hussein and his group are not \ngoing to leave Iraq. There are already indications the President may \naddress the Nation tomorrow. We are discussing and debating the budget \nresolution now. We ought to include our best estimates for this \nconflict in what we are doing now.\n  I go back to the amendment I am offering. It says we should have a \n60-vote point of order against anything that adds to the deficit with \ntwo exceptions: one, additional costs associated with national defense \nand homeland security, and, two, additional tax cuts as part of a \nstimulus package that would be effective this year and next. Those \nwould be the two exceptions--commonsense exceptions. Other than that, \nwe should create a hurdle to additional new spending or additional tax \ncuts when we do not know the cost of this conflict.\n  When we look back at previous conflicts, this is what we see. This \nhas been the response of Congress and the administration in every \nconflict America has experienced. The Revolutionary War: Excise and \nproperty taxes were enacted to pay for it; War of 1812: Excise and \nsales taxes were enacted to pay for it; Mexican-American War: There \nwere no Federal taxes during this period; the Civil War: Excise, \ninheritance and income taxes were enacted to pay for it; the Spanish-\nAmerican War: Excise and inheritance taxes were raised and war bonds \nwere sold to pay for it; World War I: Income, estate, and corporate \ntaxes were raised to pay for it; World War II: A major expansion of \ncorporate, excise, and income taxes, and war bonds were sold to pay for \nit; Korea: Income taxes were raised to pay for the war; Vietnam: \nBusiness and income taxes were cut in the early stages, and in the \nmidstages they were increased to pay for the war; in the Persian Gulf, \nthe 1990 income tax increase was passed; and in this war, instead of \npaying for it, the President is saying: Let's have a $1.9 trillion tax \ncut. That is the cost of the tax cut and\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\nthe associated interest costs, even though we are already in deep \ndeficit--in fact, in record deficit.\n\n  We are asking our troops to perhaps make the ultimate sacrifice. We \nare asking them to be prepared to risk their lives. It seems to me we \nought to be asking the rest of the American people to sacrifice as well \nfor this conflict. We certainly at the least should not be having a \nmassive tax cut when we are already in deep deficit and have no idea \nwhat the war costs are. We may need every dollar to do what is needed \nto prevail in this conflict and respond to the terrorist threat that is \nexpanded by it.\n  This morning we awoke to a recommendation from Mr. Ridge, the head of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, to move up the threat level as a \nresult of potential war with Iraq. Intelligence services are telling us \nit is a virtual certainty that there will be a terrorist attack against \nthe United States in this timeframe. We ought not to be adding to the \ndeficit except for national defense, homeland security, and a stimulus \npackage. Anything beyond that is risky at a time when we are on the \nbrink of war.\n  I hope my colleagues will think about this amendment. It requires a \n60-vote point of order. That means if there is some other contingency \nother than national defense, other than homeland security, other than a \nneed for a stimulus package, we could do it, but it would take a \nsupermajority to add to the deficit when we do not know the cost of the \nwar.\n  I hope colleagues will think very carefully about this amendment \nbefore we vote on it. My amendment is at the desk, and I call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 264.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prevent further deficit increases, except for national and \n  homeland security and short-term effects of measures providing for \n economic recovery, until the President submits to Congress a detailed \n          estimate of the full cost of the conflict with Iraq)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title II, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. ______. PROTECTING RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY.\n\n       ``(a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the \n     Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, \n     amendment, or conference report that would increase the \n     deficit in any fiscal year, other than one economic growth \n     and jobs creation measure providing significant economic \n     stimulus in 2003 and 2004 which does not increase the deficit \n     over the time period of fiscal years 2005 through 2013 and \n     spending measures related to national or homeland security, \n     until the President submits to the Congress a detailed report \n     on:\n       ``(1) the costs of the initial phase of the conflict, \n     maintaining troops in the region, and reconstruction and \n     rebuilding of Iraq; and\n       ``(2) how all of these costs fit within the budget plan as \n     a whole.\n       ``(b) Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members or the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment. I \ncommend the Senator for bringing this matter to the attention of the \nSenate and I hope the country because I think the vote on this \namendment is going to say a great deal about what this country is \nabout.\n  I was listening very carefully to the Senator's comments that we \nshould not provide, outside of meeting our responsibilities at home and \nour defense responsibilities and a temporary stimulus, a tax cut until \nwe are going to pay for the war in Iraq, pay for the occupation in \nIraq, and also pay for the return of the troops from Iraq.\n  I was with the Senator over these past weeks when we had a series of \nbriefings. We were told in those briefings that we could not make an \nestimate to the Budget Committee because we did not know exactly how \nmany other countries were going to be joining with us, what the extent \nof their armed forces would be, who those countries might be, and what \nthe size of their military would be.\n  So because it was going to be difficult to make assumptions, on the \nbasis of that fact, they were not going to make a submission to the \nBudget Committee. I think the Senator from North Dakota has reminded \nus, and the President certainly reminded us last night, that we are in \neffect going it alone. It is going to be the United States that is \ngoing to be assuming most of the costs. As I understand the Senator, it \nis not only a question of the finances, but it is also the message that \nwe are sending to these American servicemen and women, who over the \nperiod of the next 36 to 48 hours will be risking their lives for their \ncountry, all at the same time that the Senate of the United States is \ngoing to be acting to give a tax break for wealthy individuals in this \ncountry.\n  If we think that is a message of fairness, if we think that is \nbacking up our troops in Iraq, I miss it completely. On the one hand, \nAmericans are losing their lives and at the very same moment this \nSenate is giving a tax break to wealthy individuals. What is it about \nthis Senate that they would consider this?\n  I commend the Senator from North Dakota for reminding us of the \nhistory of this Nation. Never in the history of the Nation, have we had \na tax cut for wealthy individuals, or for any individuals during \nwartime. As the Senator pointed out, we have a shared responsibility to \ncome together as a Nation and engage in some form of sacrifice. I still \nremember the selling of bonds that took place during World War II. We \nwere trying to get all Americans to contribute by buying the bonds for \nAmerica, with everyone doing their bit. But, oh, no, not in this \nbudget. We are, on the one hand, sending our servicemen and women \noverseas to risk their lives, and at the same time we are prepared to \ngive one of the largest tax breaks in the history of this country.\n  We should not commit the country to large new permanent tax breaks \nuntil the full cost of the Iraq conflict is known.\n  We all know that the long term costs of the war in Iraq and its \naftermath will be substantial. Independent estimates show the cost of \nthe war between $50 and $150 billion. The Senator has outlined some of \nthe areas of concern in terms of cost already. As I understand it, it \ncosts about $9 to $13 billion to send the military over there. I hope \nthe Senator will correct me with these figures if I am wrong. We know \nit is going to cost about $5 or $7 billion to bring them back. The best \nestimate is about $17 billion for every 75,000 troops. We had General \nShinseki say our presence in the region might have to be several \nhundred thousand troops. Most of the military leaders, including \nGeneral Nash who served in the gulf during the previous war, thought \nthe same number of troops were needed to pacify a country as they go in \nat the same time of the invasion, at least for the first several \nmonths. If we are talking about $17 billion for 70,000, and we have \nGeneral Shinseki talking about several hundred thousand, say 200,000, \nthat is three times that amount. We are already up to almost $60 \nbillion.\n  We have seen the estimates of rebuilding the oil industry at $5 to $7 \nbillion, if it is not destroyed. We have seen that bringing \ncommunications infrastructure up to 100 percent, would be another $15 \nbillion. We have seen the cost of bringing the electricity to 100 \npercent estimated at $15 billion. We are talking about tens of billions \nof dollars, and this is not even getting into the payments to the \nvarious civil servants we are going to have to make once the current \nIraqi Government is gone, to get them to continue performing their \nfunctions after the war.\n\n  We assume all of these responsibilities under the Geneva Convention \nthe day troops go across the border. Yet we do not have any kind of \neffort by this administration to work with the Budget Committee to try \nto work out a process of paying for these matters. I say to the \nchairman of the committee, we now have 175,000 guardsman and reservists \nwho are serving. In many of these situations, the private insurance \nthat they have for their families is not retained when they are \nactivated. We\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\nought to be making sure that at the very least, we are going to meet \nthe health insurance costs for families of the 175,000 reservists and \nNational Guard who are being called up and are serving.\n  Yet do we have that kind of coverage included in this budget? Has the \nadministration said we ought to care for our service men and women in \nthis budget who are facing this threat? They have not. I do not \nunderstand, and the American people don't understand why we are in this \nrush to pass this budget that is constructed to give major kinds of tax \nreductions for wealthy individuals without allocating the necessary \nresources to go to war. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. We are \ntalking about tens of billions of dollars. Not one dollar has been set \naside in the budget which Senate Republicans have brought to the floor \nfor what everyone knows will be an expense in the tens or hundreds of \nbillions of dollars.\n  The American people ought to be informed about this. We have had a \ngreat many hearings around this body about the war, but those are \nclassified and those are secret. Why can we not come out in the open \nand let the American people know exactly what this is going to mean in \nterms of the costs of the conflict? Why not include them in on this? \nWhy exclude them from any of the information in terms of the costs of \nthis conflict? We know the President has refused to submit a cost \nestimate to Congress because the overall cost will be so enormous and \nhe is obviously afraid of ``sticker shock'' when he discloses the facts \nto the American people. The President does not want to tell Congress \nwhat this war will cost until his proposal for $1.3 trillion in new tax \ncuts for the very wealthy is locked in. He is afraid that if Congress \nknew the real costs of a war in Iraq, that Congress might do something \nsensible--such as reducing the size of the tax cut to help pay for the \nwar.\n  The way to have it done would have been to have worked with the \nBudget Committee and outlined what would be responsible recommendations \nand what would have been a responsible position to balance the costs we \nare going to face in the future, and defer any kind of tax reductions \nor breaks until we were able to get the job done.\n  Finally, as we are sending our servicemen and women overseas to \nengage in battle, I share the belief that we should be building a \nbetter America here at home for when they return. They deserve, when \nthey come home, to have a nation that has a sound economy. Our economy \nis flat now. We have a responsibility to take the steps now to make \nsure that when these service men and women come home, after they have \nbeen risking their lives, they are going to have a sound economy for \ntheir future. They ought to be able to come home and know that their \nyounger brothers and sisters are going to go to good schools, get a \ngood education, have an opportunity to continue their education in \ncollege, and not face an education system that has been virtually \nabandoned in this country.\n  When they come home, they ought to know there is going to be the \nchance of being able to have affordable health insurance policies and \nnot see that their parents are increasingly being put at financial risk \nbecause of the increasing costs of health insurance or the increasing \ncosts of prescription drugs.\n  We need a budget that will strengthen America. This is not that \nbudget.\n  The idea that we are not going to use our resources to educate future \ngenerations, we are not going to help families out with spiraling \nhealth insurance premiums, we are not going to help them out with \nprescription drugs; no, no, we are not going to do that. Instead, we \nare going to give a tax break for the wealthiest individuals at a time \nwhen our brave men and women in uniform are risking their lives in \nIraq. This budget is not the right budget during a time of such high \nnational purpose for America.\n  The American people understand fairness. In the face of all the \nanxieties they have been facing here at home, they understand fairness. \nThey understand, that when the sons and daughters of working families \nare going to risk their lives that it is absolutely unfair at that very \nmoment to provide tax breaks for the most wealthy individuals in this \ncountry and fail to invest in America.\n  While Senator Conrad is here, we will introduce a little later in the \nday, legislation regarding health insurance coverage for our Reservists \nand National Guardsmen and women, but I would like to have a chance to \nreview with the Senator and other Members what the particular challenge \nis for these servicemen and servicewomen. If you think it is worthy of \nyour support I ask that you support the legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his strong leadership on \nthis budget resolution and for presenting this amendment before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I join the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts in congratulating our leader on the Budget Committee, the \nSenator from North Dakota, for his ongoing leadership and the \npriorities he set forth. They are so important. He made them so clear \non behalf of the American people. I cannot think of a more important \namendment than the amendment of Senator Conrad at this time and on this \nday. I hope we will unanimously support this amendment. I hope we would \nnot have to have a vote, that we could do this by voice vote today.\n  This amendment says exactly what we ought to be doing at this moment \nin time in our history. The amendment says, other than funding defense \nand homeland security and stimulating jobs and the economy, we are \ngoing to stop; we are going to wait on the rest of the budget; we are \ngoing to wait on additional spending. Certainly there are critical \nareas we care about. We are going to wait on any kind of a tax cut \nuntil we can pay for this war, until we know what the bill is. We know, \nif we do not do that, exactly how we are going to pay for it. We are \ngoing to pay for it by continuing to go into massive debt, depleting \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds. That is how we are going \nto pay for it if we do not agree to this amendment.\n  This is absolutely critical. I think certainly the people in Michigan \nlook at us in wonderment that we would be bringing up the budget \nresolution for the coming year, in which are the values and priorities \nof the American people, and we would not have any money set aside for a \nwar in which we are about to engage.\n  How would an American family do that? If you were putting together \nyour budget and you had a huge expense coming up in a couple of days, \nyou wouldn't just ignore it. You wouldn't ignore it unless you just \nplanned on putting it on a credit card, maybe. That is essentially what \nwe are doing, is paying for the war through a taxpayers' credit card. \nThat is not good enough and it is also not necessary. It is not \nnecessary to do this outside the budget. This should be brought \nforward. We should at least put aside a reserve fund. We know at this \npoint we cannot say exactly what it will cost. We certainly do not know \nwhat the reconstruction will cost. We do not know how long after the \nwar we will be involved with Iraq, rebuilding Iraq. But we do know it \nis more than zero. We know that. We know it is more than zero.\n\n  We have a pretty good idea you could start somewhere in the $80 \nbillion to $100 billion range and not be too high. So this says: Let's \nwait on other things. Let's wait and let's make sure we are covering \nthe costs of a war that our President last night indicated most likely \nwe are about to begin.\n  We also believe part of that is making sure we have dollars for those \nwho are fighting on the front lines here at home. We all care deeply \nand stand united supporting our troops overseas. We know in this \nresolution we clearly indicate defense should be our top priority at \nthis time, to make sure both our reservists and National Guard and \ntheir families are receiving what they need in terms of health care, \nand certainly recognizing their sacrifice, leaving their fulltime jobs \nand going to serve all of us at this time of conflict.\n  We have another group and that is the group that is serving us on the \nfront lines at home. That is the group that answers the 9-1-1 call, the \nemergency medical personnel, the sheriff, the fire department. These \nare the people who have to respond. We, in fact, know the likelihood. \nCertainly there is increased risk right now they will have to respond.\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\n  So part of what we are saying is defense abroad but also defense in \nour hometowns needs to be the top priority. We need to pay for that, \ntoo. We are not yet doing that. We are seeing promises to other \ncountries for their help in this effort, yet no willingness to provide \nassistance for those who are helping us on the front lines in our own \nhometowns.\n  Again, it just doesn't make any common sense. What we are saying \nthrough this amendment is we need to stop until we make it clear what \nthe costs are for the war. We will focus on defense, homeland defense, \nand making sure we are stimulating jobs in the economy so in fact we \nare having a strong economy for our families and those fighting for us \nwho will be coming home, so they will have that strong economy and \njobs. But it is not the priority now to say that, among all the things \nwe could be doing, we are going to give another round of tax cuts to \nthose who make millions of dollars a year.\n  We look at shared sacrifice and we are being told we all have to \nsacrifice. I read an article not long ago about our Senate Republican \nleader going in front of a group of veterans. But while he certainly \nindicated supporting the veterans, he said: Veterans are going to have \nto sacrifice.\n  I would suggest veterans have already sacrificed and, in fact, we are \ncreating war veterans whom we will be asking to sacrifice. But where is \nthe sacrifice? Where is the sacrifice for those here at home who make \nmillions of dollars a year, who already have one home, two homes, three \nhomes, several cars, and are doing well? We welcome that. We would like \nthat for every American. We certainly want an economy where every \nAmerican can work hard and do well and move up the income scale.\n  But what happens when we say to people, those making $13,000 a year, \nserving us in the Army versus somebody at home whose life is not on the \nline or someone who is not a police officer or a firefighter or EMT \nworker, what do we say when we are saying we cannot fund homeland \nsecurity, we cannot make sure you have health care that you need to \nprotect your families if you are in the National Guard or Reserves? We \nare not going to budget for this war, but we are going to say that if \nyou are blessed and doing well and are at the very top of the income \nearnings of America, earning millions of dollars a year, then we are \ngoing to put you ahead of everybody else; and we are going to say that \nyou ought to be able to get a tax cut, even though it means we cannot \npay for the war, that we have to go back into debt, even though it \nmeans we have massive debt that is eventually going to raise interest \nrates and make it harder for people to buy houses and cars and send \ntheir kids to college; even though it puts us in a situation where we \ncannot provide prescription drug help for our seniors, we cannot fully \npay our share of the public school bill through the Leave No Child \nBehind; even though we have to leave veterans standing in line for \nmonths to see a doctor at the VA; even though there are all kinds of \nother issues where we are saying to people that you have to sacrifice \nright now. Children have to sacrifice, seniors have to sacrifice, \nveterans have to sacrifice, our families and small businesses that are \nnot getting help with their health care bills have to sacrifice; but a \nfew folks at the top do not. And they are not asking for that, either.\n  When I talk to folks who are doing very well at home, they say, we \ncan wait. It is alright. We are not asking for this. We want to make \nsure our kids are safe at home, that hometown security is taken care \nof, the school systems are strong, and our troops have what they need \noverseas. They want to make sure that, in fact, those things are in \nplace, which relate to our safety and security, and the economy, and \nthe other issues that are very important for Americans, very important \nto keep us strong.\n  This amendment is incredibly important. It basically says stop. Our \nPresident says in less than 48 hours we are going to be at war, \nassuming Saddam Hussein does not leave the country. We believe we have \nan obligation and a responsibility to pay for that war, to make sure \nour troops have what they need, to make sure people on the front lines \nin our communities at home have what they need so we are safe first. We \nneed to do that first. Then we can talk about tax cuts and how to \nstructure it so the majority of Americans benefit.\n  We can talk about the important issues of health care and education \nand the environment and other critical needs in the country; but we \nneed to stop now and focus first on the safety and security issues of \nour country and making sure our economy is strong with a stimulus so \nthere are jobs. We need to start there, as any other family when you \nhave to set priorities. Let's start with the bottom line priorities, \ngiven where we are now. Let's make sure we can pay for it, not be \nadding to the debt, and then we can debate other important issues that \nwe all care about.\n  Again, I commend Senator Conrad for his leadership and for this very \nimportant amendment. I hope all of us can come together and show unity \non this floor and send a message across the country that at this time \nwe are going to put our safety and security first, and we are going to \nmake sure we are not putting it on a credit card--we are paying for \nit--and that we are going to make sure our troops and front line people \nat home have what they need before other decisions are made about this \nbudget.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for her \nremarks and for her leadership on the Budget Committee. She has been \nsomebody who is dedicated to fiscal responsibility, and also addressing \nthe priorities of the American people. Whether it is improved education \nfor our children, or expanded health care, she has been a champion of \nall of that.\n  I say to my colleagues, last night we had a discussion about a number \nof the issues facing us in this budget. As we discuss our current \nfiscal circumstance, I wish to remind people where we are, compared to \nwhere we thought we were going to be. This is critically important to \nunderstanding the choices before us.\n  Two years ago we were told by the administration that we would have \n$5.6 trillion in surpluses over the next decade. The Congressional \nBudget Office produced this chart that showed the possible range of \noutcomes from a worst-case scenario to the best-case scenario with \nrespect to budget deficits and possible budget surpluses. The center \npoint of that range was the $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the next \ndecade. In other words, they said you can have a wide variance of \noutcomes. You could actually have deficits, or you could have even \nlarger surpluses than the $5.6 trillion that was the most likely \noutcome that they projected, as did the administration.\n  At the time, the President was proposing a very large tax cut and he \nsaid we can have it all. He said we can have a large tax cut, major \ndefense buildup, more money for education, more money for health care. \nHe said we could have a maximum paydown of the debt and protect Social \nSecurity--the Social Security trust fund surpluses. We could stop the \nraid.\n  Well, after the Congressional Budget Office showed us this range of \npossible outcomes, I tried to alert our colleagues that betting that we \ncould have it all was probably a risky bet, and it would perhaps be a \nwiser course not to count on any 10-year forecast coming true, and that \nwe had to take account of the possible downside risk as well as the \nupside potential.\n  The will of this body was to charge ahead and bet that all those \nsurpluses would come true. Now we know that was a bad bet; it was a \nrisky bet. When we go back and actually do a line that shows where we \nactually are compared to the projections, we see we are below the \nbottom. Not only are we not at the midpoint of the possible range of \noutcomes with respect to the surplus, we are below the bottom. The \nresult of that, of course, is deficits are exploding.\n  Under the chairman's mark, we are going to have a deficit this year--\nnot counting Social Security. If we treat Social Security like a trust \nfund, as the law requires, we will have a deficit this year of $503 \nbillion. That is before any war costs. There are no war costs in that \ncalculation. If the war cost is $100 billion, as many estimate in the \nfirst year, the deficit this year will be $600 billion.\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\n  We have never had a deficit of more than $290 billion in our entire \nnational history; $600 billion in 1 year would be staggering.\n  It is a fundamental reason I am offering the amendment before us. The \namendment says you cannot add to the deficit unless you can get a \nsupermajority vote in the Senate. You have to get 60 votes or more to \nadd to the deficit, with two exceptions. We would not have that \nrequirement for additional expenditures for national defense or \nhomeland security. We would not have that supermajority requirement for \na stimulus package to give lift to the economy this year and next when \nwe are forecasting economic weakness.\n\n  If this does not concern our colleagues about the direction of the \nfiscal condition of our country, I don't know what it will take to make \nthem concerned. Not only do we see enormous deficits now, but we see it \nthroughout the rest of the entire decade. Again, that is without any \nwar costs. That is without any fix to the alternative minimum tax which \nnow affects 2 million Americans and will affect 35 million Americans by \nthe end of this decade.\n  On top of that, under the chairman's mark, under his budget proposal, \nwe see they will be taking $2.7 trillion of Social Security surpluses \nover the next decade and using those to pay for the tax cut and other \nexpenditures. This is incredibly unwise. The baby boom generation is \nabout to retire. The leading end starts to retire in 2008. When that \nhappens, the cost to the Federal Government of Medicare and Social \nSecurity will increase dramatically because the number of people who \nare eligible increases dramatically.\n  Instead of using this money for tax cuts and other expenditures, we \nshould be using it to pay down the debt or to prepay the liability we \nall know is to come. Instead, the money is being spent. It is being \nused to fund tax cuts. It is being used to fund other expenditures. \nThese taking of Social Security surplus funds and using it for other \npurposes will create an extraordinarily difficult set of choices for a \nfuture Congress and a future President.\n  In many ways what I have already said understates the problem. In \ntalking about deficits, we do not talk about the debt. Yesterday, I \ntalked about the publicly held debt. That is the debt held by the \npublic in this country. The President told us 2 years ago we would be \nvirtually debt free by 2008 if his plan were adopted. We now know \ninstead of being debt free, we will have over $5 trillion of debt by \n2008. That is the tip of the iceberg because that is the publicly held \ndebt. That does not count the debt to the trust funds because we are \ntaking the Social Security surpluses, using them for other purposes. \nThat is also debt. That is also debt that has to be paid back.\n  If we look at that debt under the chairman's mark, we can see it will \nequal $12 trillion by the end of this budget period by 2013. In 2002, \nthe gross debt was just over $6 trillion. In that period of time, we \nwill be doubling the debt, doubling the debt right on the brink of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation.\n  That is why in the President's own review of his budget, he provided \nthis chart. It is the long-term outlook for the country. What it shows \nis we are in the sweet spot now. Even though we are running record \ndeficits, a deficit that may approach $600 billion this year, these are \nthe good times, according to the President. This is what happens, he \nsays, if we adopt his spending and tax cut proposals. It is just like \nfalling off a cliff into an ocean of red ink. That is what will happen.\n  Right at the time the costs of Government explodes with the cost of \nthe baby boom generation, the cost of the President's tax cut explodes. \nWhat it does is create deficits that are totally unsustainable. It will \nmean massive debt, massive tax increases, massive benefit cuts. That \nwill be the only way out of this ocean of red ink.\n\n  This chart should alert everyone as to where we are headed. It shows \nthe size of the Medicare trust fund surpluses in blue that ultimately \nbecome deficits, the size of the Social Security trust fund surpluses \nare in green, and it shows the size of the President's tax cuts in red. \nRight now there is a fairly rough balance between the surpluses of \nSocial Security and Medicare and the size of the President's tax cuts, \nboth those enacted and those proposed.\n  But look what happens when the trust funds go cash negative in 2016 \nand 2017. At the very time they go cash negative, the cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts explode, driving us into deep deficits, deep debt, \ndeficits that will reach over $1 trillion a year. No one is going to \nloan us that kind of money. That is not going to work. These are \ndeficits that are absolutely unsustainable.\n  The head of the Congressional Budget Office, who was put in place by \nour friends on the other side of the aisle, told us last year if we go \nin this direction, it will mean massive debt; it will mean \nunprecedented tax increases, tax increases of 50 percent; and it will \nmean massive benefit cuts. I hope someone is listening. It is as though \ndeficits are not a concern anymore. They better be because it is going \nto have real effects on real people, and they are going to be dramatic \neffects. They are going to be harshly negative. We are not paying \nattention to what we all know is coming. This is not a projection. \nThose baby boomers have been born. They are alive today. They are \neligible for Social Security and Medicare. Those costs are going to \nexplode as they retire.\n  Unlike the 1980s, some of my colleagues say: Gee, in the 1980s we had \nbig deficits and it all worked out--we had time to get well, then. We \nhad time between those massive deficits and the retirement of the baby \nboom generation. This time, there is no time to get well. The baby \nboomers are going to retire.\n  That is why the amendment I am offering is important. It says you \nhave to have at least 60 votes to increase the deficit, except for \nexpenditures for national defense and homeland security and except for \ntax cuts that are part of a package to stimulate the economy to get it \ngrowing again in 2003 and 2004. Other than that, you have to have a \nsupermajority to add to the deficit.\n  This is a consequential debate. At some time, the history of the \nfiscal affairs of our country will be written and looked back at this \ntime and people will be held accountable for the choices they made. I \nhope they are wise choices.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa is present, and I understand he has \nremarks. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield time \nto the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nyielding. I will speak on the situation in Iraq. I find it almost \nsurreal that we are here debating the budget--it is important, \nobviously, for what will happen to the future of our country--but I \nnote that at least the British House of Commons just today committed a \nwhole day of debate on Iraq. Then they will vote on a resolution. It \nlooks as though Prime Minister Blair will win the resolution in the \nHouse of Commons, but at least they are having a debate. We would think \nthat would be happening here in the Senate, that we would have at least \n1 day of debate about whether or not our President is doing the right \nthing.\n\n  I watched the President last night, and it looks as if his mind is \nmade up. In fact, I think it has been made up for a long time. I was \ndisheartened to learn that the United Nations is withdrawing its \ninspectors. They have been making some progress, but they are now being \npulled out.\n  Last October, I was one of 77 Senators who supported the \ncongressional resolution on Iraq. The resolution, in the version that \nwe passed, supported diplomatic efforts to enforce the Security Council \nresolutions. And if all peaceful means failed, it authorized the use of \nforce so we could defend the national security of the U.S. and enforce \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n  At the time, I said that going to war should be the last resort. It \nwas clear then--and it is clear now--that Saddam Hussein is a brutal \ndictator, and that weapons of mass destruction in his hands are a grave \ndanger to the international community. But I said then--and say now--\nthere is a right way and a wrong way to confront him and disarm him.\n  In voting for the resolution, I say to my fellow Iowans and to my \nfellow\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\nSenators, I was clear I was not voting for immediate war with Iraq. I \nwanted to provide maximum leverage for the President to persuade the \nSecurity Council to approve a tough, new resolution for inspections and \ndisarmament.\n  Since October, this approach has had some success. The Security \nCouncil passed a strong resolution, and inspectors went back into Iraq \nfor the first time since 1998. Faced with a united world, Iraq has \ngenerally let the inspections take place. After some resistance, Iraq \nhas begun to allow some overflights and interviews with scientists. And \nthey are destroying their al-Samoud missiles, as the U.N. demanded.\n  Now clearly, there are huge gaps in Iraq's cooperation. They have \nstonewalled in providing required information on their former chemical \nand biological weapons. And, as Secretary Powell described to the \nSecurity Council, they appear to have tried to deceive U.N. inspectors. \nBut as far as we know, the disarmament of Iraq had begun. It certainly \nhas not been completed and verified. But the process was underway and \nshould have been allowed adequate time to bear fruit. Yet now war is \ngoing to start.\n  Back in October, the President, perhaps reluctantly, agreed to work \nthrough the United Nations in seeking disarmament of Iraq through \npeaceful means. I now have to wonder if President Bush really meant it. \nAlmost from the day inspections began, the administration has been \nproclaiming their end.\n  Back in January, the President gave ``a matter of weeks, not \nmonths.'' But from the start, the inspectors themselves have said it \nwould take months or years for them to complete their work.\n  And I regret to say that we have not been helping the inspectors \nadequately. As I said after Secretary Powell's presentation to the \nU.N., rather than complaining about truck convoys weeks after the fact, \nwe should help the U.N. stop and inspect them with real-time \nintelligence. But according to a CBS News report from February 21, U.N. \ninspectors said our intelligence--U.S. intelligence--has just led them \n``to one dead end after another.'' These U.N. inspectors called the \nintelligence we gave them ``garbage after garbage after garbage.''\n  The administration has not even been clear on what we want from Iraq. \nThe resolution I voted for referred to enforcing Security Council \nresolutions. Now, while there are a lot of those, the key one demanded \ndisarmament of Iraq's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \nprograms, and of their long-range missiles.\n\n  After hundreds of inspections, the U.N. has found no evidence of \nongoing programs for weapons of mass destruction. They did find that \nsome missiles go a few miles over the limit. Iraq declared those, and \nis now destroying them. Nobody is saying that Saddam Hussein's \nobsessive pursuit of these weapons is suddenly over, but we sure do not \nhave much evidence there to justify an invasion and full scale war.\n  So the administration tries to bring in September 11 and the fear \nthat Hussein will give his weapons of mass destruction--assuming he has \nsome--to terrorist groups. But no one has ever shown that Iraq had any \ninvolvement in the September 11 attacks. And even U.S. and British \nintelligence officials describe evidence of Hussein's links to al-Qaida \nas weak.\n  A recent Washington Post graphic showed 20 key terrorist organizers. \nThey were from Saudi Arabia and Egypt and several other countries, but \nnot one was from Iraq.\n  So now the administration talks about fostering democracy throughout \nthe Middle East. That is a noble goal. But it is hard to grow democracy \nout of the barrel of a gun. It seems more likely that a U.S. invasion \nand occupation of Iraq will lead to more extremism and terrorism in \nthat region.\n  In any case, our goal was supposed to be enforcing U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions and defending U.S. national security. The \nresolutions are about disarmament in Iraq, not about rebuilding \ngovernments in that region.\n  Further, the administration has been throwing out allegations about \nIraq without bothering to back them up. First, they claimed Iraq has \nbeen trying to buy uranium, based on documents that turned out to be \nforgeries. They pointed to a British intelligence dossier that turned \nout to be copied from academic papers several years old. They talked \nabout close ties to al-Qaida based on an alleged facility in an area of \nIraq that Hussein does not control and on one visit to an Iraqi \nhospital.\n  The Vice President, on Sunday, claimed that Iraq has ``reconstituted \nnuclear weapons,'' a bizarre claim, but the U.N. has found no evidence \nthat Iraq ever had nuclear weapons to reconstitute or that they now \nhave an active program to make them. But after the Vice President said \nthat, he turned around and then said something else. I am reading here \nfrom the Washington Post of this morning, Tuesday: ``Bush Clings To \nDubious Allegations About Iraq.''\n\n       In his appearance Sunday, on NBC's ``Meet The Press,'' the \n     vice president argued that ``we believe he has, in fact, \n     reconstituted nuclear weapons.'' But Cheney contradicted that \n     assertion moments later, saying it was ``only a matter of \n     time before he acquires nuclear weapons.'' Both assertions \n     were contradicted earlier by Mohamed ElBaradei, director \n     general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who \n     reported that ``there is no indication of resumed nuclear \n     activities.''\n       Earlier this month, ElBaradei said information about Iraqi \n     efforts to buy uranium were based on fabricated documents. \n     Further investigation has found that top CIA officials had \n     significant doubts about the veracity of the evidence, \n     linking Iraq to efforts to purchase uranium for nuclear \n     weapons from Niger, but the information ended up as fact in \n     Bush's State of the Union address.\n\n  Well, on and on and on it goes.\n  After I listened to the President last night, and after going through \nall the false assertions that they have made--what the Vice President \nsaid on national television on Sunday, without a shred of evidence--\nreminds me of two ships called the Maddox and the Turner Joy, that \nsupposedly in the late summer of 1964 were attacked in the Gulf of \nTonkin.\n\n  I ask Senators, go back and read the Senate debate on the Gulf of \nTonkin resolution in August 1964--our two ships attacked in the open \nocean, attacked by vessels from North Vietnam. That led to a drumbeat \nto pass the Tonkin Gulf resolution, which gave the President the \nauthority to engage in full scale war in Vietnam.\n  What did we learn later? We learned later that there never was such \nan incident. Neither the Maddox nor the Turner Joy was ever attacked. \nThis was all fabrication, all total fabrication.\n  But I ask, what elected official, what appointed official in the \nJohnson administration or later in the Nixon administration was ever \nheld to account for that? Yet 50,000 lives later, we recognize what led \nus into Vietnam.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Can I ask for another 5 or 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Another 5, if that is OK. We have another speaker who is \nscheduled in that slot.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could interrupt the Senator and ask \nthe time be charged to the resolution, and the other time that has been \nallotted to the Senator from Iowa be charged to the resolution rather \nthan the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that option.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, Mr. President, we almost have before us another \nMaddox and Turner Joy: a claim that Iraq has reconstituted nuclear \nweapons, but the evidence is not there.\n  The President himself said, last October:\n\n       Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of \n     hundreds of miles--far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, \n     Turkey and other nations--in a region where more than 135,000 \n     American civilians and service members live and work.\n\n  Those are the President's words.\n  But:\n\n       Inspectors have found that the al-Samoud 2 missiles can \n     travel much less than 200 miles--not far enough to hit the \n     targets Bush named.\n\n  The constant beating on the drums of war, along with the shifting \ngoals--last night for the first time I heard that it is not just \nHussein who has to leave but also his sons; the goal was regime change, \nthen it was disarmament, and now it is regime change and a family \nthing, to get the family out--the dubious allegations, the lack of \nsupport for inspections, make it look as though\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\nthis administration has been set on war from the beginning and has just \nbeen casting about looking for support for their war all along.\n  Is war justified? I have absolute confidence in the men and women of \nour Armed Forces. Faced with war, they will win, and will do so with \ncourage, discipline, and skill. But even with our overwhelming \nstrength, even assured of victory, war is a terrible prospect. \nThousands of innocent people will die. Iraq will be left in chaos. We \nwill be left to occupy a country most likely for years, left with the \nresponsibility on our taxpayers of rebuilding it.\n  America has always been reluctant to engage in war. And this will be \nthe first war ever in which we have invaded where there has not been an \nimminent threat.\n  I believe there are at least four tests that must be met before we go \nto war. First, we must face an imminent threat. That has not been \nshown. Could Saddam be a threat down the line sometime? Perhaps. But we \ncould contain him with inspections, and not just a handful but 500 or \n1,000 inspectors--there is no limit on how many inspectors we could \nhave; we could put in 1,000 inspectors. Would that cost more money? \nSure. A lot less than a war.\n  So we must face an imminent threat, and that has not been shown.\n  Secondly, war should be the last resort, not the first. Even if a \nthreat is demonstrated, we should launch a war only after we have \nexhausted all reasonable alternatives, as we required in the resolution \nlast fall. In this case, we clearly have not.\n  Third, we must have substantial support among our allies and work \nwith the United Nations. The agreements Saddam Hussein has violated are \nwith the U.N. He didn't make those agreements with the United States, \nhe made them with the United Nations. So since it is not a bilateral \nproblem, it is a multilateral problem, we should be working through the \nUnited Nations. There is no doubt we can win a war against Iraq on our \nown--no doubt about that--but we are going to need the other nations to \nhelp rebuild Iraq after the war.\n  Finally, before we go to war, the fourth thing we need is a full \ndebate in the Congress. Thus, I applaud Senator Byrd and Senator \nKennedy for their resolutions to move the debate forward. But now the \nclock has run out. I can't for the life of me understand, why the \nBritish House of Commons can have a full day of debate today on whether \nor not to pass a resolution to go to war, but the U.S. Congress can't.\n  I think back to our own Revolution which gave us the power. It is in \nthe Constitution of the United States that only Congress has the power \nto declare war. And there can be no mistake about it. This is not an \nintervention. This is not military police activity. This is not \ndefending ourselves against an imminent threat. This is an invasion and \na full-scale war against a country.\n  I believe the Congress, and only the Congress, has the right to do \nthat, and we have not even had the debate. It is time we have the \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator from New York seek time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, I ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for offering this \namendment which is timely and important.\n  What is this budget? Why do we have a Budget Act? Why do we have a \nbudget resolution? It is to set priorities. If we didn't have to set \npriorities, we could have as many tax cuts as we wanted and as much \nspending as we wanted and as big a deficit as we wanted, and the \ncountry would be in chaos.\n  The Budget Act is a disciplining process that says: Everyone wants a \nwhole lot of good things in America, but we have to set priorities. And \nwe say this as we are in the shadow of war.\n  I have spoken on this and issued a statement last night, and I will \nbe speaking more later. I pray for our soldiers and hope and pray that \nSaddam sees the light and abdicates. But if he doesn't, we will back \nour soldiers and do everything we can. That is a priority that we have \nto set and will set. But we have other priorities.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has wisely said, before we set those \nother priorities, we ought to figure out what the war and the ensuing \npeace will cost. I, for one, believe tax cuts are appropriate to \nstimulate the economy. The amendment wisely allows that. But it says \nbefore we go into a long train of large tax cuts--it doesn't say don't \ndo them--let's figure out as best we can what the costs of the war are. \nAre the costs of the war going to crowd out funding for Medicare and \nSocial Security? Are the costs of the war going to crowd out money for \neducation or money for transportation? They may. We just ought to know \nit before we do it. Then, if we do have a crowding out, do people \nprefer, say, Medicare or tax cuts? Do they prefer education or tax \ncuts? Do they prefer transportation money or tax cuts? That is what a \nbudget resolution is all about.\n  To proceed with a budget resolution that is going to offer massive \ntax cuts without knowing the cost of the war would drive any accountant \ncrazy. Last year we were all saying, accountants have to get a whole \nlot better. Any accountant in his first year of taking an accounting \ncourse in college would say: If you have a huge cost coming up--a cost \nwe all support, the cost of the war--don't do other types of things, \nwhether it be spending or cuts, before you know what that cost is.\n  My colleague has put together a great amendment. In fact, if you are \na fiscal conservative, above all you should support the amendment. I \ndon't care what your ideology is, this is a fiscally conservative \namendment. It says, get your ducks in order; figure out what your costs \nare before you engage in a massive program of tax expenditure.\n  It leaves room for a stimulus which we all need and will support. But \nit simply says, figure out your priorities because if we don't and we \ndo a budget resolution and we don't know what the costs of the war are \ngoing to be, one of two things will happen: We will have a deficit that \ngoes way beyond what anyone imagined and it will wreck our economy, or \nother kinds of spending needs will be crowded out--spending for \neducation, spending for transportation, spending for Medicare and \nSocial Security. All we are saying is: Figure out the priorities.\n  It is virtually reckless to do a budget resolution until we know what \nthe costs are. I say this as somebody who is not opposed to spending \nmoney on a war. But at the same time we have war, to have massive tax \ncuts and not know what the other consequences will be for our deficit \nand spending, as I said before, would drive any student in the first \nyear of Accounting 101 absolutely crazy.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota for putting together a \nfiscally conservative and responsible amendment, for restoring some \norder to make sure that the Budget Act, which says, let's not be kids \nin a candy store and just pick everything without knowing the \nconsequences--that is what the Budget Act says--to make sure it has \nsome real teeth and real meaning.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota for offering the amendment. I \nhope we will have bipartisan support for it because it is only fair and \nright.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New York for \nhis eloquence and his comments. Also, I commend the distinguished \nranking member on the Budget Committee for the leadership he has shown \nin offering this amendment today. I am very grateful to him for the \nwork he has invested into this amendment. I am very hopeful our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will see its wisdom.\n  Our Nation is living through some grave and difficult days. We face \nthe continuing threat of terror and the developing danger of nuclear \nproliferation from both North Korea and Iran. At the same time, the \nAmerican economy is stagnating, the Federal deficit is exploding. More \nand more Americans\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\nare losing hope that they will ever find a job.\n  Overshadowing all of this, we stand on the cusp of war with Iraq. We \nneed to be awake to this moment in history. In generations past, our \ncountry stared straight into the eyes of every threat and did what it \ntook to overcome danger. The hallmark of American history has been the \nwillingness of our leaders and our citizens to sacrifice today for the \nliberty, security, and prosperity of our children and our children's \nchildren tomorrow.\n  President Bush said in his State of the Union Address:\n\n       We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass \n     along our problems to other Congresses, to other Presidents, \n     to other generations.\n\n  We could not agree more.\n  Now is not a time to pass reckless tax breaks that will saddle our \nNation with debilitating debt for generations to come, while doing \nnothing to energize our economy today. Our Nation needs to be united in \nthe face of the many threats before us. But I fear the President's tax \nbreak plan not only divides us against one another today, it pits the \npolitical whims of the moment against the economic security and \nprosperity of the future.\n  Therefore, I am asking Democrats and Republicans to come together to \nsupport this amendment, which has been called the ``patriotic pause,'' \nbecause it states clearly that, except for national security, except \nfor defense, except for a genuine and very small fiscally responsible \neconomic stimulus plan, this Congress will approve no new tax breaks or \nnew spending until the cost of war in Iraq and the rebuilding effort \nthat will follow are determined.\n  Under this amendment, we will provide every necessary resource to \nsupport our troops and protect our homeland. We will also do what it \ntakes to re-ignite our economy. But this amendment acknowledges that we \nhave an obligation to keep our commitments to America's children, \nfamilies, and seniors. If we enact the Republican budget plan with the \n$1.5 trillion in new tax breaks, primarily for those at the very top, \nwe would see deficits and debt for as far as the eye can see. And the \ncost of these new tax breaks explodes in the future, sucking up \nresources needed to keep our commitments to Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  This past weekend, I met with a group of seniors to discuss the \nissues most important to them. Concerned about the uncertain future of \nSocial Security and Medicare, one gentlemen said to me:\n\n       Five years ago, I was part of the ``greatest generation.'' \n     Now someone is trying to declare war on me.\n\n  This Congress must honor the patriotism of our parents and \ngrandparents by living up to our obligations to them. We must \ndemonstrate our own love of country by living up to the highest \ntraditions of our history.\n  The ``patriotic pause'' gives us that chance. It will demonstrate to \nour citizens and to history itself that we are awake to the demands of \nthis moment, and it will preserve the resources and trust necessary to \nmeet whatever challenges our shared future holds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I see my colleague from North Dakota is seeking time. How \nmuch time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. On this amendment, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Conrad has offered an amendment that is simple, \ndevastatingly simple, and right.\n  I talk often about going to a very small school, probably not the \nsmallest school that anyone in the Senate attended, but it must be \nclose. My entire high school, four grades, was 40 kids, and the senior \nclass in my high school was 9. I kid that I was in the top 5 somewhere \nin a high school class of 9. We did not have Ph.D.s teaching math. I \ndidn't need a Ph.D. to tell me how to add 1 and 1; 1 and 1 always \nequals 2--except in Washington, DC, during a budget debate.\n  Let me talk about what is happening with respect to fiscal policy in \nthis country. This is a chart that shows what is happening with respect \nto Federal surpluses and deficits. We were in the go-go 1990s, \nturbocharged 1990s; our economy was building, creating new jobs and \nproducing tax revenues, and we began to have surpluses.\n  We had people say: We have surpluses as far as the eye can see; let's \nprovide very large tax cuts. President Bush was the leader of that $1.7 \ntrillion effort. Some said we ought to be a little more conservative, \nif something happens. But the President got his way, we had a very \nlarge tax cut, and guess what. We then had a recession.\n  The attacks of September 11, the war on terrorism, the largest \ncorporate scandals in history, the bursting of the tech bubble, \npancaking of the stock market, and guess what happened. We went from \nblack ink to red ink quickly, with a devastating decline into huge, \ncrippling Federal budget deficits. That is where we are. That is where \nwe are headed.\n  What is the answer? The President says, let's have more tax cuts. In \nmy hometown, as they say, when you were in the hole, you did not order \nmore shovels, you just stopped digging. This is a circumstance where we \nhave to sober up as a country and evaluate how do we deal with these \nhemorrhaging Federal budget deficits in the long term. We do it, as the \nSenator from my home State says with this amendment, by deciding to \nwait for additional tax cuts and additional spending: Let's have a \npause at the moment, put a lid on it all; no big tax cuts, no big \nspending increases. He allows in his amendment the opportunity and the \nneed to deal with defense and homeland security, he allows the need in \nthe first 2 years to deal with a stimulus plan, if necessary, but he \nsays, beyond that, let's have a pause.\n  On the eve of potential military action in Iraq, we hope and pray it \nis quick and decisive with minimum loss of lives, but we know as it \nhappens, it will cost a great deal of money, and we are going to be \nprepared to respond to that. We will provide the resources necessary to \nsupport the brave men and women who fight for this country. But we \nought to ask the question on the eve of military action, should we pass \na budget resolution that says, by the way, what we propose at the \nmoment, as is the case with President Bush's budget and the budget that \ncame out of the Budget Committee, let's have very large tax cuts, let's \nhave the huge costs of war and reconstruction and the consequence of \nthat, and let's attach to that additional tax cuts?\n  Maybe it is only in this town that there is some sort of escape from \nreality, but in my little hometown if you talk about budgets and \nresponsibility and, yes, patriotism, it seems to me we have to add up \nwhat our needs are, what we have to do as a country, how much revenue \nwe have to do it with, and try to come to some reconciliation of that. \nBut that is not the case in Washington, DC.\n\n  Let me say this about tax cuts. Tax cuts represent the easiest \npolitical lifting in American politics; no question about it. If you \nwant the easiest lift in the Senate, boast about all the tax cuts you \nsupport. I would love to say I support all the tax cuts and I believe \nwe all ought to have a zero tax rate, but that is not the fact. The \nfact is we build roads, we educate our kids, we provide for our common \ndefense, we do all of these things together, and someone has to pay for \nthat. I would love to say let's have giant tax cuts that go on forever. \nBut it is not the responsible thing to do, especially on the eve of a \nwar.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Conrad, is simple. He \nsays let's take a pause for a moment. The budget resolution that comes \nto the floor out of the Budget Committee says: Let's decide to have \nvery large tax cuts, make the previous tax cuts permanent, and on top \nof that, have additional large tax cuts. And, oh, by the way, we will \nincrease defense, increase homeland security, and shrink domestic \ndiscretionary spending, including education, health care, and all the \nother issues.\n  It seems to me things that go around come around, and we already have \na construct of this. David Stockman wrote a book about it. That was in \n1981. They said, we can double defense spending and have very large tax \ncuts and it will add up. It didn't. Someone\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nasked President Reagan about his plan, and there was a parody about \nthat. He said: Well, what this new economic plan is, you take an apple, \nand you cut it in half, and then you have three glasses, put half an \napple in one glass, half an apple in the second glass, and half an \napple in the third glass. They said: How do you get three halves from \none apple? And he said: See, you don't understand our theory.\n  I think I do understand the theory. There are only two halves of the \napple, but this budget resolution provides the kind of theory and \ngimmickry that will head us down a road to hemorrhaging deficits that \nwill cripple this country. It will devastate our ability to restart \nthis economic engine of ours.\n\n  The people who watch us here in the Congress, watch what we do, they \nneed to see we are serious about trying to put this fiscal house in \norder.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 3 additional minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Those who watch this process need to understand we are \nserious about what we are doing here, that what we do will lead to some \nkind of economic stability in the future. They count on it, that we are \nnot going to spend money we don't have. We are not going to burden our \nkids with debt. We are going to try to have some means to pay for that \nwhich we do and, yes, that includes paying for the costs of military \naction and supporting our troops.\n  I support this Conrad amendment because I think it puts national \nsecurity and economic security first. I support this amendment because \nI support the troops, and I support this amendment because I support \nefforts to increase homeland security in this country. I support this \namendment because I believe our economy needs a boost. All of those, in \nmy judgment, will be the fruits of this amendment.\n  I regret that we have the budget resolution on the floor that came \nfrom the Budget Committee. It has completely taken a vacation from \nreality. There is no way it adds up. You can explain it until you are \nblue in the face, it doesn't add up, and it is not going to lead to a \nbetter and brighter economic future.\n  I want a fiscal policy, as does my colleague, I believe, a fiscal \npolicy that expands this country's economy. First, we need to jump-\nstart it and then we need to try to find ways to give people confidence \nto expand it.\n  Our economy is all about confidence. When people are confident in the \nfuture, they do things that manifest that confidence: buy a house, buy \na car, take a trip. They do the things that expand the economy. When \nthey are not confident about the future, they do exactly the opposite \nand the economy contracts. They defer the purchase, don't take the \ntrip. The economy contracts.\n  I want people to take a look at what the Senate does, what my \ncolleague has done with this amendment, and say this gives us some \nconfidence about the future. There are people who are serious about \nmaking sure this adds up, about making the right investments, \nestablishing the right priorities for this country. That is what this \namendment does.\n  In my judgment, if you decide you are with the Budget Committee \nresolution that came to the floor of the Senate, what you are saying is \nwe believe we should have long-term, growing, inescapable Federal \ndeficits and we don't care much about it.\n  I will tell you what, if you don't care much about it in the Senate, \nthere are many who will. They will pay for it with their jobs. They \nwill pay for it with lost opportunity. They will pay for it with weaker \nschools. They will pay for it with less homeland security. That is a \nguarantee.\n  On the positive side, let me say this amendment is a giant step in \nthe right direction and I hope my colleagues will support it. I commend \nSenator Conrad for the amendment that he calls The Patriotic Pause \namendment. It says: Let's stop. Let's take a look. Let's listen to what \nis happening around here and let's make a sound judgment about where \nthis country ought to head and what its priorities are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask that I be yielded time under consideration of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as Senators begin debate on the budget, I \nwant to briefly discuss why, at this time, I cannot in good conscience \nvote in favor of tax cuts, irrespective of their size or to which \nsegment of the population they are targeted, nor can I support any \nsubstantial spending increases that are not related to improving our \nNation's defense from the obvious and serious threats facing us today.\n  Let me stress, however, that I am, like my colleagues, concerned with \nthe weakened state of our economy, and I do not dismiss lightly \narguments in support of stimulating our economy with tax cuts. I know \nthe negligible growth in our economy today has left many Americans \nwithout work, their investments and saving diminished, with lower \nstandards of living, and that their elected representatives are \nexpected to do something to help alleviate their suffering. I may have \nconcerns that some parts of the administration's proposed tax cuts \nwould not provide the near term stimulus necessary to strengthen our \nobviously anemic economic recovery. However, I am certainly willing--\neven inclined--to consider tax cuts that would provide a more immediate \nstimulus, such as, for instance, a reduction in payroll taxes. But not \nat this time.\n  The United States is currently engaged in a global war against \nterrorism, and will, in all likelihood, soon commence a necessary war \nto disarm Iraq by destroying the regime of Saddam Hussein. The costs of \nthese enterprises are not known with any degree of certainty at this \ntime. Nor are the costs we will incur after what I believe, what I \nfervently hope, will be a brief, successful war in Iraq, as we week to \nestablish the foundations for a peaceful, stable and democratizing \nIraq. The administration has not provided the Congress with a realistic \nestimate of how much this worthwhile endeavor will cost the U.S. \nTreasury. I don't fault them for that. The costs are simply not \nknowable at this time.\n  I believe the war in Iraq can be concluded successfully in a \nrelatively brief time. But it is surely possible that the conflict \nwon't meet our best estimates for its probable duration. It might take \nlonger than we hope or it may exceed our hopes. As any responsible war \nplanner will tell you, it is always wise to expect the unexpected in \nwar. Few battle plans have realized in their execution the planners' \nevery assumption.\n  Moreover, we do not know at this time how great will be the costs of \nmeeting our responsibilities in a post war Iraq or with how many other \ncountries that burden will be shared. The answer to those questions \nwill depend, more than anything else, on how quickly and how thoroughly \nthis military action succeeds.\n  Also, if terrorist organizations use our action in Iraq as the \noccasion and the excuse to initiate new attacks against Americans, at \nhome and abroad, that too will put new pressures on our treasury. What \nis already clear to me is that we will need to spend substantially more \non our national defense--in the long term--that is currently \nenvisioned, according to recent reports, in the budgets being marked up \nby the House and Senate budget committees. How much more will depend, \nof course, on the war's costs. But it will also depend on challenges \nfrom the continued threat from al-Qaida and other associated terrorist \ngroups, and from the aggressive actions by states hostile to the United \nStates and our allies, which are intent on acquiring weapons of mass \ndestruction, such as North Korea.\n  In addition, the costs of our security at home are great, and certain \nto increase over the next few years. Our war against al-Qaida has been \nsignificantly successful. The President and his administration deserve \ngreat credit for that. But the enemy in our global war against \nterrorism is not yet vanquished. Speaking as a border state senator, \nwith the challenges to better protect our borders so evident to \nArizonans, I am acutely aware of how much more needs to be done to \nsecure our homeland.\n  Even without assuming the costs of these various contingencies, \nparticularly the war in Iraq and the responsibilities we will have in \nthat country following the cessation of hostilities,\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\nthe increase in the Federal budget deficit envisioned over the next 10 \nyears ought to concern greatly every member of Congress. In the first 5 \nmonths of fiscal year 2003, the United States Government has already \nrun up a $195 billion deficit. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that even without the President's tax cuts and without \nfurther increases in spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, the \ntotal budget deficit for 2003 will reach $246 billion. If we add the \nprojected costs this year of the President's tax cuts the deficit would \nreach $287 billion. Most alarming, are the deficit projections for the \nnext 10 years, incorporating the President's proposed tax cuts, \nreleased by CBO last week: $1.8 trillion. That's a pretty staggering \nsum, and it does not include any of the costs of our imminent actions \nin Iraq.\n  We should be concerned about deficits. They limit economic expansion \nby reducing the amount of national savings available for investment. \nThis raises both interest rates and interest payments on the national \ndebt. Deficits constrain our ability to respond effectively to \nunanticipated fiscal events. If we do not reduce them, projected long \nterm deficits will reach dangerous levels, lowering the national income \nand standards of living for future American generations.\n  That said, I would still be open, at some point, to proposals to \nstimulate the economy with tax cuts. But not now. We should take a \npause in our efforts to increase spending on nondefense needs and to \nreduce taxes.\n  However, I will not support the amendment by me friend from North \nDakota to create a 60-vote budget point of order against any \nlegislation that contains tax cuts or spending increases that would \nincrease the deficit until the President submits to Congress a detailed \nreport on the costs of our operations in Iraq. The way to address \nlegitimate concerns with this budget resolution is not by creating new, \ncomplicated points of order, containing numerous exceptions and subject \nto very discretionary judgments about what is significant economic \nstimulus, and what is an adequately detailed report on the costs of war \nand reconstruction in Iraq. The Senate should speak directly to these \nconcerns now, and vote for or against tax cuts and nondefense spending \nincreases in this budget resolution. Should continued negligible \neconomic growth require the stimulus offered by tax cuts later in this \nCongress, after, for lack of a better metaphor, the dust has settled \nsomewhat in our operations in Iraq, and Congress and the administration \nhave a better understanding of the costs of war and peace incurred by \nthe United States, Senators can consider changes to fiscal policy at \nthat time.\n  However, while I don't foreclose future consideration of a tax cut to \nstimulate the economy, no one can be expected to make an informed \ndecision on fiscal policy at this time with so many uncertain \ncontingencies possibly on the horizon, and with the near, mid- and \nlong-term costs of defending this country unknown and presently \nunknowable. Let us wait until we have succeeded in Iraq, and until we \nhave some idea of what percentage of the costs of the aftermath of \nthose hostilities we will have to bear. The best thing that can be done \nfor the economy today is to win the war in Iraq quickly, completely, \nand to attract the coalition of partners necessary to help us meet our \npostwar objectives in that country. That is a far more necessary, and \nresponsible stimulus to our economy at this time. And it is far sounder \nstatesmanship than cutting taxes in the dark, or running up spending, \nwithout due regard to our primary responsibility to the American \npeople: their physical security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am wondering----\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Miguel Estrada\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just a few moments we will be voting \non Mr. Estrada's nomination for the district court. I wish to take a \nfew moments of the Senate's time to talk about a very important matter, \nand a matter which is really the basis of the dispute in the Senate. \nThat is about the materials that have been requested by members of the \nJudiciary Committee which have been denied to the members of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Thanks in large part to the majority leader's suggestion of a serious \nconstitutional debate, we have all learned some important history \nlessons.\n  We have learned in detail about the deliberate decision of the \nFounders to give the Senate a major and independent role in the \nselection of Federal judges at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, \nand to prevent the judiciary from becoming a pawn of the President.\n  We have been reminded that the founders made a very specific decision \nto create the Senate as a constraining force on the President, to \nresist sudden or drastic changes in the direction of the Nation and to \nprevent Presidential overreaching.\n  We have all reread the key provision of the Constitution in which the \nFounders instructed that the Senate exercise its specific powers in \naccordance with rules of its own making. We have learned that until \n1949, the first 162 years of our country, those rules provided no way \nat all to end Senate debate on a nomination by the President. In 1949, \nour rules established the possibility of a cutoff of our prized freedom \nof speech on the Senate floor--but only when a two-thirds majority \nconsensus supported imposing that restraint on the minority.\n  Despite the hypocritical cries of ``majority rule governs'' from \nthose who would have us abdicate our central constitutional role, we \nall recognize that the President who has caused this controversy over \njudicial nominations would not be our President today if majority rule \napplied to the Presidential elections.\n  It is clear that the administration has not met its burden of \ndemonstrating the suitability of this nominee. The nomination process \nis not a game of hide and seek, in which the White House selects only \nthe positive information about a nominee to give the Senate and \nwithholds the rest, in the hope that the Senate will not find it. The \nprocess is not complete until the administration shares with the Senate \nall of the available information, so that the Senate can exercise its \nadvice and consent power deciding for itself, under its own rules, what \nis relevant and what is not, what is dispositive and what is not.\n  The members of the President's party do not serve him well, nor do \nthey serve their own interests well, nor do they fulfill their \nobligations to the Senate, if they allow the White House to short-\ncircuit the process by selectively withholding information. And the \nfact that some of that information may be confidential, or sensitive, \nor classified, or embarrassing does not end the matter. It merely \nstarts a process within the administration of deciding whether the \nnomination of a particular person for a particular position at a \nparticular time is important enough to the President to justify the \nrelease of that information.\n  In some cases it may be possible to block out particular items in \ndocuments without destroying their utility. In some cases it may be \nappropriate to allow receipt and discussion of particular documents in \nclosed committee session without immediate release to the public. In \nsome cases, it may be necessary to provide classified documents to \ncommittees with the facilities to handle it properly and with staff who \nare cleared to review it. Once the Senate has the information on any of \nthese grounds, we can decide whether the information is relevant, what \nweight to place on it, and whether further investigation or questioning \nis required.\n  The argument for withholding documents in close cases is not a very \nstrong one--it does not rise to the level of proprietary business \ninformation or intelligence methods, for example. And as many of us on \nthe committee have pointed out to the White House, there are many \ninstances in recent history where the Justice Department has provided \nsuch materials to us.\n  One of the best examples of such a case was the Richard Kleindienst \nconfirmation proceeding. In that case, as\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nhere, members of the Committee requested extensive litigation materials \nfrom the Justice Department. Unlike the present case, the Chairman, \nalthough he disagreed with those Senators on the merits of the \nnomination, agreed that they were entitled to make their requests, and \ncertified the requests as Committee requests to which the Department \nwould have to respond. The Department in fact provided the Judiciary \nCommittee with extremely sensitive deliberative litigation documents \nfrom various offices at Justice. They revealed the Department's \nstrategies and thought processes on the appeal and settlement of a \nmajor set of antitrust cases.\n  Moreover, the Solicitor General himself, the eminent former Dean of \nHarvard Law School, Erwin Griswold, appeared before the committee and \nanswered questions of Senators on both sides of the aisle on the \ncontent of the recommendations made to him by attorneys in the \nDepartment and by him to the Acting Attorney General and Antitrust \ndivision, including his own and others' opinions on the strengths and \nweaknesses of various litigating positions. Like every Solicitor \nGeneral, he asserted the right of the Department to withhold \ndeliberative documents. But at the same time he and the Department in \nfact disclosed and discussed those deliberations in the Senate, \nsometimes in unrestricted form and sometimes under restrictions.\n  Why did they do so? In the Department's own words, they could release \nany such information whenever they determined that there was a \n``compelling public interest'' in doing so. And for some reason they \nconcluded that there was such a public interest in getting Mr. \nKleindienst--already confirmed as the Deputy Attorney General--\nconfirmed to fill the vacancy in the position of Attorney General for \nthe one year left in Richard Nixon's first term. I note that Justice \ndid refuse to provide certain materials which the nominee offered to \navow under oath would have no relevance to the facts at issue. After \nextensive additional hearings, the nominee was confirmed, but later \nresigned when documents eventually released in the Watergate and other \nproceedings showed that he had not been truthful in his testimony to \nthe committee. He pleaded guilty to a subsequent criminal charge of \n``failing to testify fully and accurately'' to the Senate.\n  That case demonstrates that the Department could and did as a matter \nof discretion release extremely sensitive litigation documents and \ninformation from the Solicitor General's office, including the \ntestimony of the Solicitor General himself, merely to accomplish the \nconfirmation of a cabinet member for a short-term appointment to a post \nwhich did not really need to be filled. Clearly then the Department has \nfull power to release sensitive documents when they are requested in \nthe context of a nomination for a lifetime appointment to the nation's \n``second highest court.''\n  In this case a substantial portion of the committee have concluded \nthat the White House has not met its burden of going forward. The \nnominee's record does not contain the usual body of judicial decisions \nor legal publications which demonstrate the way he addresses important \nlegal questions. On the contrary, as the hearing record demonstrates, \nmembers had serious questions about the nominee's suitability, \nquestions for which the nominee's answers ranged from evasive to \ninconsistent. But the committee did not have the full record. It did \nnot have what may be the best evidence of the nominee's approach to \ncurrent legal issues of great import, the writings of the nominee \nhimself, writings composed by the nominee in the Solicitor General's \noffice in circumstances which even his supporters concede were likely \nto show him at his most candid.\n  It is perfectly reasonable and logical for Senators to conclude that \nthe Executive's refusal to provide that complete record is based on \neither or both of two rationales: Either the White House fears that \nSenate access to the documents--even without automatic public access--\nwould confirm the unsuitability of the nominee, or the White House does \nnot think there is a ``compelling public interest'' in completing Mr. \nEstrada's nomination process.\n  In either event, the ball is in the executive branch's court: If they \nthink there is a compelling public interest in moving ahead with this \nnomination, they can and should turn over the materials. If they do not \nthink there is a compelling public interest in proceeding with this \nnomination, they can continue to refuse to provide the materials. But \nif that is their decision, then they should cease their imposition on \nour time and especially our Republican colleagues' patience, forgo the \nRovian hopes of short-term political gain from ``Groundhog Day'' \nrepetitions of useless cloture votes, and just pull the nomination.\n  Mr. President, this nominee has been sent to the Senate of the United \nStates. We had a very good debate the other day about the shared \nresponsibility between the President and the Senate in naming \nindividuals to the courts with lifetime appointments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I have 1 minute more?\n  I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  We had a very good debate on that issue. The fact is, this \nadministration has seen all of those papers. On that basis, they have \nnominated him. But they have refused to let us see them and expect us \nto be a rubberstamp. It is wrong. I hope we will continue to reserve \nour judgment on this nominee until we get that information.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is my understanding we have a vote at \nnoon; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the floor leader, the chairman of our \ncommittee, is not in the Chamber at the moment, so I will not propound \na unanimous consent request. But I would ask for his staff to consider \nthat we permit another amendment.\n  I see the Senator is in the Chamber now.\n  I say to the chairman, I was just saying that we have this vote. Then \nit would be my hope that, at some point soon thereafter, we could have \na vote on my amendment. I am told we need a window until 3 o'clock for \nvotes. Maybe we could have an opportunity to offer additional \namendments in that interim period and stack votes at 3 o'clock, if we \nare limited in our ability to vote until then.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be happy to work with my \ncolleague. Because I have been running back and forth to a lot of \nmeetings, I have not had a chance yet to even address the Senator's \namendment that is pending, so I wish to do that.\n  Are we still working through the lunch break?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. The intention was to do that. We would have the vote \nat noon. If the vote is done at around 12:30, that is why I am raising \nthe question now of being able to offer another amendment, so we could \nuse that time productively.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3826-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3826-S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT COURT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of noon having arrived, the Senate \nwill go into executive session and resume consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as you all know, we are going to vote on \nthe Estrada nomination one more time with regard to cloture. The fact \nof the matter is, I am very concerned about this because I think the \nSenate is placing itself into a serious procedural set of problems that \nliterally could come back to haunt the Senate for many years to come. \nYou see, this is the first filibuster in history of a circuit court of \nappeals nomination.\n  It is a shame that there has to be a filibuster against one of the \nleading Hispanic legal thinkers in America--especially since I don't \nbelieve there has been a glove laid on Miguel Estrada from the \nbeginning of this debate right up until today.\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\n  Everybody knows this man is highly qualified, having received the \nhighest rating from the American Bar Association of unanimously well-\nqualified. Very few judgeship nominees receive that type of unanimously \nwell-qualified rating from the American Bar Association.\n  Miguel Estrada has lived an American dream life. He came here from \nHonduras at age 17. He hardly understood English, and taught himself \nEnglish. He graduated from high school and went on to Columbia \nUniversity where he graduated magna cum laude. He then went on to \nHarvard Law School and graduated magna cum laude. He was editor of the \nLaw Review at Harvard. Miguel Estrada became a law clerk to Judge \nAmalya Kearse on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most \ncoveted spots for young law graduates who are of exceptional ability, \nand then he became a law clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Certainly, one of the most coveted jobs any young law \ngraduate can have is to clerk for a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Miguel Estrada became a prosecutor in the Manhattan office and tried \nappeals there for the prosecutor's office. He went on to become a \nmember of the Solicitor General's Office as Assistant Solicitor \nGeneral. He worked there for 5 years--4 years for the Clinton \nadministration, 1 year for the Bush administration--where, according to \nperformance reviews, he was given the highest ratings one could \npossibly receive from his superiors and where he argued cases before \nthe Supreme Court. This man has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, winning 10 of them. Most attorneys never have an opportunity to \nargue before the Supreme Court, let alone have the experience Miguel \nEstrada had.\n  He went through one of the most detailed hearings on record before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee last September, conducted by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer. My friends on the \nother side have said this hearing was conducted fairly; it was a decent \nhearing. They had every opportunity to ask any questions they wanted. \nIf they wanted to go longer, they could have gone longer. They did not. \nAfterwards everyone had the opportunity to file written questions. Only \ntwo Democrats filed written questions: Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts \nand Senator Durbin of Illinois.\n  Now we find ourselves, because the Republicans have taken control of \nthe Senate, with a nominee before the Senate who probably would never \nhave gotten here had it been left up to my colleagues on the other side \nand whose nomination now hangs in the balance because of a first-time \nfilibuster in history against a circuit court of appeals nominee. In \nfact, we have only had one successful filibuster in the history of this \ncountry against a judicial nominee, and that was Abe Fortas back in \n1968 when it was a bipartisan filibuster; both Republicans and \nDemocrats filibustered Fortas. I did not agree with that filibuster \nthen. I do not think it was right then, and I certainly do not agree \nwith the filibuster now. I think it is very dangerous.\n  More importantly, if we continue to filibuster this nominee, it will \nshow once and for all that the Senate is broken with regard to \nExecutive Calendar nominees and, in particular, judicial nominees. If \nwe are going to filibuster nominees we do not care for on either side \nof this august room, if the Democrats received a Democrat President and \nwe filibuster his nominee because our nominee has been filibustered, \nthen I think this system will be totally broken, will break down, and \nbe very hard to repair.\n\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will think through what they \nare doing. I hope there are a number of clear-thinking people on the \nother side who will realize that this is a dangerous procedure to do. \nIt flies in the face of the Constitution because the President has the \nnomination power, and he has the appointment power, and we have the \nadvise and consent power. But advise and consent means an up-or-down \nvote. It means once a person comes to the floor, there comes a time \nwhen debate has to end and there should be an up-or-down vote. In this \ncase, that vote has been prohibited by our colleagues on the other side \nthrough this mechanism of a filibuster for the first time in history.\n  I believe what they are doing is blatantly unconstitutional because \nby requiring 60 votes to have an Executive Calendar nominee pass \nthrough the Senate, we are diminishing the executive branch of \nGovernment and the judicial branch of Government vis-a-vis the \nlegislative branch of Government. All three are supposed to be coequal \nbranches of Government.\n  This practice is dangerous. In my view, it is unconstitutional. We \nhave to face this one way or the other, and all because my colleagues \non the other side claim they do not know enough about Miguel Estrada, \nafter all of these experiences, all of this knowledge we have about \nhim, after one of the longest hearings on record in the history of \ncircuit court of appeals nominations. In addition they are hiding \nbehind a red herring, a false demand to go on a fishing expedition \nthrough all of the appeals certiorari and amicus curiae recommendations \nthat Miguel Estrada worked on while at the Solicitor General's Office \nfor 5 years. That has never been allowed before, it should never be \nallowed, and, frankly, I do not believe any self-respecting \nadministration will ever allow that type of a fishing expedition into \nthe most confidential, privileged papers in the Justice Department \nitself.\n  Seven former living Solicitors General, four of whom are Democrats, \nthree of whom worked with Miguel Estrada as Democrat Solicitors General \nin the Clinton administration, have said it is highly inadvisable to \nallow this type of a demand by the Democrats to be approved by anybody \nbecause it would certainly damage the information on which so many of \nour Solicitors General have come to rely.\n  Yet this day people are saying they just do not know enough about \nthis man. There has hardly been a nominee to any circuit court of \nappeals in this country in history who is more well known than Miguel \nEstrada.\n  The problem really comes down to this: He is conservative, and I \nthink my colleagues on the other side believe he is pro-life. I \npersonally do not know what he is with regard to the abortion issue, \nbut I can tell you this, Mr. President: I do believe he is basically a \ngood, strong conservative but a conservative who worked in the Clinton \nJustice Department for 4 solid years with the highest recommendations \nof his supervisors while he was at the Clinton Justice Department in \nthe Solicitor General's Office. So this phony red herring issue is \nexactly that.\n  If we continue to filibuster this man, I believe we will have a \nSenate that is broken, a system that is broken, and we are going to \nhave to do whatever we have to do to see that Executive Calendar \nnominees get up-or-down votes when they come before the Senate. \nPresidents of the United States deserve that consideration and they \nshould have it.\n  If one reads the advise and consent clause in article II of the \nConstitution, just a few lines above it, it was made clear that you can \nhave supermajority votes, and I think there are seven mentioned in the \nConstitution. But just a few lines above the advise and consent clause \nis a requisite two-thirds vote for ratification of treaties. If the \nFounding Fathers wanted to allow or require supermajority votes with \nregard to the advise and consent clause, they would have said so. They \ndid not. The natural conclusion from any constitutional scholar would \nbe that we are entitled to an up-or-down vote as the exemplification of \nthe advise and consent clause.\n  The fact is, that is not being allowed because of a filibuster on the \nother side with the phoniest of excuses that they do not know enough \nabout this very well-known young Hispanic man of high quality, high \nability, with the highest recommendation possible, not only from the \nAmerican Bar Association but from Democrat attorneys as well, such as \nSeth Waxman, for whom I have great affection and respect, a former \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  I hope our colleagues will think it through and we vote for cloture \nso we can have an up-or-down vote on Mr. Estrada, and if they do not, \nwe will have to see what happens in the future.\n  With this third cloture vote, we will have reached the most cloture \nvotes ever given or ever required in the history of the Senate for an \nexecutive calendar nominee. Should cloture not be invoked, we will \nstill go to further cloture votes, as we should. We need to\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nfight for this nominee because he deserves the right to sit on the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with respect to this issue of Mr. Estrada, \nif those who come to the floor to make speeches about Mr. Estrada are \ntrying to put together a puzzle for us, they are missing about six or \neight key pieces. Let me use some information and some time to describe \nwhat those pieces are.\n  I do not want anyone to tell me that we have folks in this Chamber \nwho do not support the President and the process by which we nominate \nand confirm judges. I think we have voted on 111 Federal judges in the \nSenate and I believe I voted for 110 of them. Now, I am a little weary \nof people coming to the floor and misstating the facts. They say, this \nis the first filibuster we have ever had. Not true. That is just not \nthe case. Mr. Paez waited 4 years in the Senate, under the leadership \nof those who are now concerned about moving Mr. Estrada through this \nChamber, and in order to get Mr. Paez through this Chamber there had to \nbe a cloture vote. So I am a little weary of these stories about \ncloture.\n  We had a cloture vote on Mr. Paez. Why? Because that was required in \norder to move his nomination, which waited 4 years.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator on his time, if that \nis all right with the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. Is the Senator aware that there has never been a \ncloture vote to prevent somebody from having an up-or-down vote for the \ncircuit court of appeals or the district court in this country, and \nfurther, no one has ever been stopped by a cloture vote in this country \nprior to this other than Abe Fortas?\n  Further, let me ask the Senator this additional question: If the \nSenator is referring to me as misstating the facts, I was the one who \nput Paez through. I was the one who put Berzon through. I was the one \nwho put through a whole raft of them who were criticized on our side. I \nhope the Senator is not referring to me on this matter.\n  Does the Senator know of anyone, other than Abe Fortas, who was \nstopped by a filibuster who did not, once they got to the floor, have \nan up-or-down vote?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator asks an interesting and a good \nquestion. He talks about people who got to the floor of the Senate. I \ncould bring out a chart that shows candidate after candidate for the \ncircuit court who never got a hearing in the committee, not one hearing \non the committee, let alone a vote in the committee or a vote on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me continue my statement. Let me say this with \nrespect to cloture votes and a filibuster: Mr. Paez waited 4 years. The \nonly way he got to the floor for a vote was with a cloture vote. That \nis called a filibuster, a cloture vote to break a filibuster.\n  Let me say this about Mr. Estrada: Having voted for every Federal \njudge but one who has been nominated by President Bush, I am prepared \nto have a vote on Mr. Estrada as soon as Mr. Estrada and all of those \nwho support him say to this administration and to this candidate for a \nlifetime appointment, answer the questions. I would say to the Senator \nfrom Utah--on the day he had Mr. Estrada's hearing, he also had a \nhearing for another candidate for a judgeship. His name is Judge \nHovland. He is in the Western District of North Dakota, a Republican, \nsomeone I supported strongly. I came that day and spoke for him. I say \nto the Senator from Utah, on the same day Mr. Hovland appeared before \nthe committee, Mr. Estrada appeared before the committee. Does the \nSenator know that Mr. Hovland answered the very questions Mr. Estrada \nwould not? Does the Senator know that Mr. Estrada refused to answer the \nquestions Mr. Hovland answered?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the question of the Senator: Why is that the case? \nAnd I would simply say this: As soon as Mr. Estrada answers the \nquestions and provides the information, I believe there ought to be 100 \nvotes for cloture and we ought to have an up-or-down vote on Mr. \nEstrada. Until that time, no one who aspires to a lifetime on the \nFederal bench ought to be able to say to this Senate we are going to \nwithhold information that has been requested.\n  I do not think the Senator from Utah should want that. I do not want \nit, and at least speaking as one Senator, I will not allow it. I will \nnot vote for cloture until Mr. Estrada provides the information that \nhas been requested of him.\n  I am happy to yield on the time of the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator has a splendid record with regard to \nvoting for Federal judges, and I personally appreciate that.\n  Is the Senator aware that no true filibuster has ever succeeded \nagainst any Federal court nominee, other than Abe Fortas, in the \nhistory--\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I say--\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask my full question--of this country?\n  Secondly, is the Senator aware that Mr. Estrada, and the White House, \nhave not only offered to come up and speak personally and answer every \nquestion of any Senator, they have offered to answer any questions in \nwriting. He has answered all of those questions in writing for this \nbody. And is the Senator aware that we have also offered to even have \nanother day of hearing, as long as we get an up-or-down vote, where any \nSenator who wants to can ask any question he wants to on the committee?\n  I would even go broader than that. I invite any Senator on the \nDemocrat side who wants to ask any question to come to the committee \nand ask him. But we would want a vote certain in order to do that. No \ncandidate nominated in the history of this country has ever made that \noffer, and I am just saying I think he has answered the questions and I \nthink the Senator just is not aware of it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator on his time. The \nSenator from Utah has had a generous amount of time on the floor of the \nSenate to make his case on many occasions, and he makes his case in a \nvery persuasive way for those on his side of the aisle, perhaps. But \nhaving voted for all but one of the nominees sent by this President, I \nam a little weary of hearing anybody stand up and say those of us who \nvote against cloture are somehow obstructing at this point because the \nSenator knows full well why cloture has not been achieved. The answer \nis very simple. We have asked for only two things of this nominee: One, \nanswer the questions that were put to him in that hearing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Which he has done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, that is not the case. That has not been done. But \nNo. 2, release the information that is available with respect to his \nservice at the Justice Department for the Solicitor General's Office.\n  The fact is, when those conditions are met, I will be on the floor \nsaying, let us have a final vote on Mr. Estrada. If those conditions \nare not met, neither the Senator nor anyone else in the Senate ought to \ndemand that we give up our rights and opportunities to ask questions \nfor those who seek a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield one more time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say this, I am a little weary of the campaign that is \ngoing on around the country, letters to the editor, and talk shows, and \nall the rest that forget about two, three, or four key pieces to the \npuzzle, and the key pieces to the puzzle are this: This President has a \nright to nominate candidates to Federal judgeships. He has done two in \nNorth Dakota, both Republicans, both wonderful people. I supported them \nstrongly. They are both now on the Federal bench. Our country is better \nbecause of it. I have voted for other Federal judges whose philosophy I \ndisagree with because I think by and large they were qualified to serve \non the Federal bench, and I have voted for all but one of those \nnominees sent by President Bush.\n  Let me come back to this point. On the very day the Senator from Utah \npresided over a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, Judge Hovland from \nNorth Dakota answered questions that Mr. Estrada did not answer. I do \nnot understand why a committee chairman is not the first one on the \nfloor of the\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\nSenate to say we ought not move this until we get all the information \nwe requested.\n  I am not someone who will stand in the way of a final vote on Mr. \nEstrada because of philosophical or other concerns. I will not do that. \nBut as long as I am in the Senate with Republican or Democratic \ncandidates for the Federal bench, I will demand they answer the \nquestions put to them. In this case, Mr. Estrada has not done that.\n  One last time I will yield on your time.\n  Mr. HATCH. He has answered the questions in writing as well as orally \nin a very lengthy hearing. Is the Senator aware at any time in \nhistory--I am sure he is not--where a fishing expedition has been \nallowed into the Solicitor General's confidential privileged memoranda, \non all appeals, certiorari, and amicus curiae recommendations? That has \nnever happened in the history of this country.\n  I have offered to the side of the distinguished Senator to make \navailable, if there are specific questions, I would go to the White \nHouse and see what I can do. But never has there ever been allowed a \nfishing expedition into all of these very privileged documents without \nsome reason for authorizing it, and there is no reason offered by my \ncolleagues on your side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, a fishing expedition is not at all \nwhat this is about. The Senator from Utah knows that. I have listened \nto him at great length and voted with him on almost all judgeships. The \nSenator from Utah ought to demand what I demand and others demand: \nCandidates who aspire to a lifetime appointment to the bench ought to \nrespond to the request for information from this Congress. That has not \nhappened in the case. You can assert it until you are blue in the face. \nIt is not the case that the information has been made available. Other \ncandidates made it available. Mr. Estrada has not. When he does, I \nbelieve he ought to get his vote. Until he does, he should not get that \nvote.\n  I am weary that those who support this President's nominees almost \nuniversally are told we are somehow obstructing. That is not the case. \nEspecially in circumstances where there were a good many fine people in \nthis country who were nominated for the Federal judgeships, including \ncircuit courts, who never got a hearing before the committee, I didn't \nhear anyone on the floor of the Senate, especially from that side, \ntalking about it at great length. These are good men and women. They \nnever got a hearing. This is not payback as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. Estrada should get his vote as soon as he complies with the \nrequest for information from the Senate, which he has not done. He can \ndo it this afternoon, and we can have a vote tomorrow, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts earlier made \ncomments as to the Solicitor General memoranda requested for Miguel \nEstrada that are not well informed and have been refuted by a letter \nfrom the Department of Justice, sent to me, dated today, March 18, \n2003. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I write to correct a significant and \n     recurring misstatement of fact regarding the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada, which has been repeated several times on the \n     Senate floor in the past several weeks. As noted below, \n     several Democrat Senators have asserted or implied their \n     belief that the White House and the Department of Justice \n     reviewed Mr. Estrada's appeal, certiorari and amicus \n     recommendations authored during his tenure in the Bush and \n     Clinton Solicitor General's Offices before deciding whether \n     to nominate him to the D.C. Circuit, and that the decision \n     not to disclose these memoranda is based on the \n     Administration's knowledge of their contents. Nothing could \n     be further from the truth. Despite the fact that counsel to \n     the President Alberto Gonzales explained in a February 24th \n     letter to Senator Schumer that ``[n]o one in the Executive \n     Branch has reviewed these memoranda since President Bush took \n     office in January 2001,'' Senators continue to repeat this \n     allegation, which warrants this additional response. An \n     identical letter will be sent to Minority Leader Daschle.\n       Because the professional opinions of attorneys in the \n     Solicitor General's office are--and always have been--\n     confidential, no one in the White House, the Department of \n     Justice or anywhere else in the Executive Branch reviewed \n     these privileged documents--not before Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination on May 9, 2001, and not since then. Unfortunately, \n     the mistaken notion that the Administration has reviewed Mr. \n     Estrada's memoranda has grown rapidly from speculation to \n     rumor to purported fact. In order that your colleagues might \n     have the most accurate information available during your \n     deliberations on Mr. Estrada's nomination, we wish to point \n     out specific misstatements and erroneous assumptions on this \n     issue and to set the record straight.\n       In a February 12, 2003, floor speech, Senator Leahy \n     speculated that the Administration knows what is in Mr. \n     Estrada's confidential memoranda: ``Regarding the document \n     request related to Mr. Estrada's nomination, he has told both \n     Senator Hatch and myself, as well as several Members of the \n     Senate, that he is perfectly willing to show us his writings \n     and respond to them and answer questions about them, but he \n     has been told by the administration that he cannot; the \n     administration, however, would review those writings. They \n     are the only ones who know whether this direct evidence of \n     his views, the interpretation of law, is accurate or \n     misleading--they are the only ones who have access to it \n     and they say, basically: Trust us.'' Congressional Record, \n     Feb. 12, 2003, at S2251. Senator Durbin elevated the \n     speculation to a conclusion on February 26: ``Mr. Gonzales \n     in the White House said, no, we will not consider \n     producing anything. It leads members to conclude on this \n     side of the aisle that there is something very damaging in \n     these materials that they do not want disclosed. It is the \n     only conclusion you can draw .  .  . this White House, \n     tentative and concerned about whether or not Miguel \n     Estrada has said some things that could jeopardize his \n     nomination, refuses to disclose.'' Congressional Record, \n     Feb. 26, 2003, at S2756.\n       Several days later, Senator Schumer repeated the mistaken \n     assumption that the Administration has reviewed Mr. Estrada's \n     memoranda: ``Why won't Mr. Estrada or the administration--\n     which is his sponsor, his mentor--in this particular \n     situation why won't he give up these documents? I will tell \n     you what most people think when they hear about it. And I \n     have talked to my constituents, the few who ask me about \n     this. They say he is hiding something. Do I know he is hiding \n     something. Do I know he is hiding something? Absolutely not. \n     I have not seen the documents. But I tell you one thing: The \n     great lengths that the administration and my colleagues on \n     the other side have gone to not give up these documents makes \n     one suspect there is something there they do not want people \n     to see. So the documents are crucial.'' Congressional Record, \n     Mar. 4, 2003, at S3064.\n       Senator Kennedy extended the error when he suggested that \n     the Administration reviewed Mr. Estrada's memoranda in the \n     selection and vetting process prior to nomination: ``We \n     certainly have the obligation to do so when the Executive \n     Branch prevents us from exercising our assigned \n     constitutional powers of advice and consent by depriving us \n     of any access to the only documents which might tell us what \n     kind of a judge a nominee will be--the very documents which \n     the President's lawyers used to select and vet the nominee.'' \n     Congressional Record, Mar. 11, 2003, at S 3434.\n       In a March 13, 2003, floor speech, Senator Leahy completes \n     the cycle of misstatements when he asserted that the \n     Administration reviewed Mr. Estrada's memoranda in deciding \n     whether to nominate Mr. Estrada.\n       ``The real double standard in the matter of the Estrada \n     nomination is that the President selected Mr. Estrada in \n     large part based upon his 4\\1/2\\ years of work in the \n     Solicitor General's Office, as well as for his ideological \n     views. The administration undoubtedly knows what those views \n     are and have seen those work papers. They know what he did. \n     They picked him based on that, but they said even though we \n     picked him based on that, we do not want the Senate to now \n     what it was. We in the Senate cannot read his work, the work \n     papers that would shed the most light on why this 41-year old \n     should have a lifetime seat on the Nation's second highest \n     court.\n       ``We are to a point where the White House simply says, \n     trust us, we know what he wrote and how he thinks and will \n     make decisions, but we do not want you to know what he wrote, \n     just rubberstamp him.\n       ``. . . There seems to be a perversion to require the \n     Senate to stumble in the dark about Mr. Estrada's views when \n     he shared these views quite freely with others, and when the \n     administration selected him for his high office based on \n     these views.'' Congressional Record, Mar. 13, 2003, at S3671.\n       These assertions are simply wrong. First, each statement is \n     based on the fundamentally erroneous premise that officials \n     in this Administration have seen Mr. Estrada's memoranda. Let \n     me assure you unequivocally--and permanently put to rest any \n     misunderstanding--that at no time has this Department of \n     Justice or the White House ever reviewed the memoranda that \n     Miguel Estrada wrote during his tenure in the Solicitor \n     General's office.\n       Second, the statements above mistakenly suggest that the \n     Department of Justice has declined to release Mr. Estrada's \n     memoranda\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\n     because of concerns over their content. In reality, as we \n     have explained, the Department has chosen to keep these \n     documents confidential for the reason articulated by all \n     seven living former Solicitors General--including four \n     Democrats: ``Any attempt to intrude into the Office's highly \n     priveliged deliberations would come at the cost of the \n     Solicitor General's ability to defend vigorously the United \n     States' litigation interests.''\n       Thank you for allowing me to set the record straight on \n     this important point. I appreciate the opportunity to assure \n     you and your colleagues that we in the Administration have \n     never examined Miguel Estrada's confidential memoranda. I \n     hope that by clearing up this misunderstanding, we will have \n     taken an important step toward ending the filibuster of Mr. \n     Estrada--the first filibuster of a lower-court nominee in \n     American history--and allow the bipartisan majority of \n     Senators who support Mr. Estrada to vote on his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jamie E. Brown,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today's third cloture vote on Miguel \nEstrada's confirmation breaks through a new barrier--not the barrier \nthat some may have hoped for with this exceptional nominee.\n  It is unprecedented that a circuit court nominee be subjected to a \nthird cloture vote. A no vote today remains unfair to this nominee who \nhas been pending over 700 days, it is unfair to the bipartisan majority \nthat wants to end this debate and have a vote, and it is unfair to the \nPresident, who deserves better from this Senate.\n  Eighteen times the majority has requested unanimous consent to vote \non the Estrada confirmation. Eighteen requests have been denied, even \nthough Senators have debated this confirmation for over 100 hours. \nTwice before today, a bipartisan majority has likewise requested to end \ndebate by voting for cloture.\n  Others, too, have expressed their desire that we end this debate. \nOver 113 editorials in 31 States have called for an end to this \nfilibuster and expressed their support for this nominee. Only 11 have \nexpressed the opposite.\n  The filibuster to this nomination continues despite the unprecedented \naccommodations that have been offered:\n  Repeatedly, the White House has offered the nominee up to answer more \nwritten questions; only one Senator took them up on it.\n  Repeatedly, the White House has offered the nominee up to meet \nprivately to answer more questions; only one Senator took them up on \nit.\n  I have offered the nominee up for a second hearing. The offer was \nrejected.\n  Now that the minority has stopped saying that Mr. Estrada is \nunresponsive they now focus on their unlimited request for confidential \nand privileged memoranda. They do this even though all living past \nSolicitors General, including four Democrats, have opined that this \nrequest is improper.\n  We will not give up. This nominee will be confirmed and we will keep \non voting if necessary. The minority's position on this is \nunreasonable. I hope they will be as accommodating as we have been.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is disturbing to me that much of the \ndebate regarding the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit has focused on previous nominations \nconsidered by this Senate. In particular, the nominations of Judge \nRichard Paez and Judge Marsh Berzon, who now sit on the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, have been raised over and over again by Senators \nopposed to Mr. Estrada.\n  The discussion of previous nominations is troubling for a number of \nreasons. First, Judge Paez and Judge Berzon were confirmed by the \nSenate. They were not subjected to a filibuster as is the case for \nMiguel Estrada. Second, on a personal level, it is disappointing to me \nthat these two judges should be used as examples of alleged Republican \nobstructionism, when I worked hard for their confirmation, argued \nagainst delay, and supported their nominations.\n  To continue to inject prior nominations into the Estrada debate \nindicates to me that the opposition is more interested in some sort of \nretribution for misperceived wrongs rather than fulfilling the Senate's \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent. I have heard it stated on \nthe Senate floor, referencing the so-called filibuster of Judge Paez, \n``what goes around comes around.'' I certainly hope that it is not the \ncase that the refusal to give a vote to Miguel Estrada is some sort of \npayback.\n  The distinguished Minority Leader described the Senate's \nresponsibility very well nearly three years ago as we were concluding \ndebate on the nominations of Judge Paez and Judge Berzon. He stated on \nMarch 9, 2000, `` . . . [T]here is a time and a place for us to \nconsider any nominee and, once having done so, we need to get on with \nit.''\n  I agree with the Democratic leader. We have considered the nomination \nof Mr. Estrada and now we need to get on with the vote--up or down, as \nSenators choose to cast their vote.\n  Senator Daschle continued, ``I do not know who is going to be \nPresident next. I do not know who is going to be in the majority in the \nnext Congress. But let's just assume that the roles are reversed . . . \nand we have a Republican President--which I do not think is going to \nhappen. Do we want to pay back our colleagues for having made these \npeople wait as long as they have? . . . I do not want to hear about \nthat in this body. There is going to be no payback. . . . Will we have \nvotes and vote against nominees on the basis of whatever we choose? \nAbsolutely.''\n  So again, as the Democratic leader stated, Senators are free to vote \nagainst the nominee on the basis of whatever they choose, but let us \nhave a vote.\n  Now, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I worked hard for the \nultimate confirmation of Judge Paez and Judge Berzon. Nevertheless, \nthere were some significant difficulties with their nominations which \ntook time to resolve. I agree that they took too much time. However, \nthese nominees did receive a vote, they were confirmed, and they now \nsit on the Ninth Circuit. These two nominees were not filibustered as \nMr. Estrada is now being filibustered. It is true that cloture motions \nwere filed on the nominations. Let me emphasize that it was the \nRepublican Leader who filed a cloture petition, so there would be \nlimited debate and a vote up or down. Furthermore, those cloture \nmotions passed by wide margins, 86-13 in the case of Judge Berzon, and \n85-14 in the case of Judge Paez. The record is clear that a true \nfilibuster did not occur with regard to these nominations.\n  Following the cloture votes, the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, made \nthe following comments: ``As you know, cloture was just invoked on two \nNinth Circuit judges. I still hope we have not set a precedent. I don't \nbelieve we have because it was such an overwhelming vote to invoke \ncloture and stop the filibuster. We should not be having filibusters on \njudicial nominations and having to move to cloture. But we had to, and \nit was an overwhelming vote.''\n  Senator Leahy's response to the Majority Leader's statement is \nnoteworthy. He said: ``I was struck by the comments of the \ndistinguished leader in saying we should not have the precedents of \nfilibusters and requiring cloture. I commend him for supporting the \ncloture motion and moving this forward so we would not have that \nprecedent.''\n  As I have said, the confirmations of Judge Paez and Judge Berzon were \nnot without delay. There was considerable opposition to their \nnominations. But that delay did not amount to anything sort of a \nfilibuster of these nominees.\n  The debate on both Judge Paez and Judge Berszon took place on March \n7, 8 and 9 under time agreements. The final day of debate, when they \nwere confirmed, was 4\\1/2\\ hours total. The Republican leadership did \nfile cloture to get time agreements and to ensure a final vote on these \ntwo nominees of President Clinton. I have asked for similar treatment \nfor Miguel Estrada--a time agreement and an up or down vote but this \nhas been denied repeatedly.\n\n  So the record is clear that this was not a true filibuster. There was \nlimited debate with time agreements. Cloture was filed as a floor \nmanagement tool and was overwhelmingly approved. The nominees did \nreceive an up or down vote both were confirmed. Let's give Miguel \nEstrada that same courtesy.\n  Now with regard to the nominations of Judge Paez and Judge Berzon, I \ndo not want to rehash the debate on these nominees, but I do want to \nput their confirmation into some perspective, since my Democratic \ncolleagues keep bringing them up.\n  Judge Paez's opponents were very concerned about statements he made \nin\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\n1995, while a sitting federal district judge, regarding two California \nballot initiatives--Proposition 187 to limit public assistance to \nillegal immigrants, and Proposition 209 to end racial and gender \npreferences in California. Legitimate questions were raised concerning \nwhether his comments were consistent with the Judicial Canon governing \njudges' extra-judicial activities. There was genuine concern about \nthese remarks on matters that would likely be the subject of \nlitigation. Many of my colleagues viewed this as evidence of his \ninability to render fair decisions on these issues.\n  A second area of concern regarding Judge Paez involved what some saw \nas his activist views of the judiciary. Judge Paez had stated, ``I \nappreciate the need for courts to act when they must when the issue has \nbeen generated as a result of the failure of the political process to \nresolve a certain political question. There is no choice but for the \ncourts to resolve a question that perhaps ideally and preferably should \nbe resolved through the legislative process.'' Now, this statement did \nraise concerns that Judge Paez would use his position to legislate from \nthe bench.\n  A third issue regarding Judge Paez was his rulings in certain cases. \nIn particular, there was legitimate concern over the judge's role in \ntwo cases related to illegal fundraising during the 1996 presidential \ncampaign--those of John Huang and Maria Hsia. You may recall Ms. Hsia \nwas associated with fundraising and money laundering through Buddhist \nnuns, while Mr. Huang was associated with illegal campaign fundraising, \nmostly from foreign sources. Judge Paez was assigned to both of these \ncases.\n  In the case of John Huang, Judge Paez accepted a very lenient plea \nagreement. Mr. Huang pled guilty to a felony charge of conspiracy to \nviolate Federal election law and was sentenced to no jail time. He was \nordered to pay a $10,000 fine and was required to serve 500 hours of \ncommunity service.\n  Many of my colleagues found it suspicious that Judge Paez would be \nassigned to both of these cases. There was criticism about the handling \nof these cases. At a minimum, there was concern about the propriety of \nhis involvement in these cases, which pointed back to the Clinton-Gore \ncampaign.\n  Despite all the concerns regarding the involvement of Judge Paez in \nthese cases, my own view was there was no reasonable basis to further \ndelay the vote on Judge Paez. I was vigorous in my call for an \nindependent prosecutor to investigate all alleged illegalities in the \n1996 campaign. However, I also did not believe Judge Paez was \nimplicated and I pressed forward with his nomination. I am asking the \nsame treatment for Miguel Estrada--give him a vote.\n  There were also questions over Judge Paez's ruling on a Los Angeles \ncity ordinance prohibiting aggressive panhandling at specified public \nplaces and passed in response to the death of a young man who refused \nto give a panhandler 25 cents. Judge Paez found the ordinance \nunconstitutional under the California constitution because the law \nconstituted ``content-based discrimination.'' The Supreme Court of \nCalifornia, asked by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to rule on the \nholding, held that the Los Angeles ordinance was constitutional and \nvalid.\n  Another troubling case was a decision issued by Judge Paez in 1997, \nJohn Doe I v. Unocal, in which he ruled that American companies can be \nheld liable for human rights abuses committed by foreign governments or \noverseas companies owned by the foreign governments with which they do \nbusiness. These cases, and others, persuaded many of my colleagues that \nJudge Paez was well out of the mainstream.\n  With regard to Judge Berzon, I voted for her confirmation, finding \nher to have the intellect, integrity, and impartiality to serve as a \nFederal judge.\n  Those opposed to Judge Berzon pointed out that her entire legal \nexperience was in one narrow field--labor law. Her opponents also \npointed out that she had been very vocal in the expression of her \npolitical views, with membership and leadership in several \norganizations that many considered activist.\n  The fact remains that, regardless of the opposition and careful \nscrutiny of these nominees, both Judge Berzon and Judge Paez each were \ngiven an up or down vote. In the case of Judge Paez, he was confirmed \nby a vote of 59-39. Judge Berzon was confirmed by a vote of 64-34. \nMiguel Estrada deserves the same courtesy. If Senators are opposed, let \nthem vote no. But to refuse a vote is unfair to the nominee, harmful to \nthe Senate, and destructive to the notion of an independent judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is not a day, in my view, when the \nSenate majority should be pressing forward on this divisive matter. Nor \nhas anything changed since last Thursday or since March 6 when the \nRepublican majority scheduled two earlier cloture votes on this \nnomination. The administration's obstinacy continues to impede progress \nto resolve this standoff. The administration remains intent on packing \nthe federal circuit courts and on insisting that the Senate rubber \nstamp its nominees without fulfilling the Senate's constitutional \nadvise and consent role in this most important process. The White House \ncould have long ago helped solve the impasse on the Estrada nomination \nby honoring the Senate's role in the appointment process and providing \nthe Senate with access to Mr. Estrada's legal work. Past \nadministrations have provided such legal memoranda in connection with \nthe nominations of Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad Reynolds, \nStephen Trott and Ben Civiletti, and even this Administration did so \nwith a nominee to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  We have the statement of Attorney General Robert H. Jackson, who \nlater became one of our finest Supreme Court Justices, when he wrote an \nAttorney General Opinion in 1941 acknowledging that among the occasions \nwhen exceptions should be made and executive Department files would be \nproduced to the Congress would be confirmations. As Attorney General \nJackson noted:\n\n       Of course, where the public interest has seemed to justify \n     it, information as to particular situations has been supplied \n     to congressional committees by me and by former Attorneys \n     General. For example, I have taken the position that \n     committees called upon to pass on the confirmation of persons \n     recommended for appointment by the Attorney General would be \n     afforded confidential access to any information that we \n     have--because no candidate's name is submitted without his \n     knowledge and the Department does not intend to submit the \n     name of any person whose entire history will not stand light.\n\n  Senator Durbin noted last week that the administration has poorly \nserved this nominee and given Mr. Estrada very bad advice. I agree.\n  The Bush administration claimed that no administration had ever \nprovided materials like Mr. Estrada's work papers in connection with a \nnomination. We have now demonstrated over and over that precedents \nexist going back over the last 20 years.\n  Today, I would like to mention additional examples of similar \nmaterials that were provided to Congress. On February 1, 1982, the \nSenate Finance Committee held a hearing to consider legislation to deny \nFederal tax-exempt status to private schools practicing racial \ndiscrimination, after the Reagan administration decided to reverse a \nlong-standing policy and grant exemptions to segregationist schools. A \nnumber of Justice Department memoranda, as well as communications \nbetween high-level officials, were turned over by the Reagan \nadministration to the Senate Finance Committee in connection with the \nhearing, just months after the documents were first written.\n  The issues at that hearing reveal that some of the documents turned \nover were much more sensitive than those requested of Mr. Estrada, but \nthey were still provided to Congress by the Reagan administration. \nAfter a long and intense debate in the Reagan Justice Department and \namong high-level Justice and Treasury Department officials and White \nHouse counsel, on January 8, 1982, the Reagan Justice Department \nannounced that it would discontinue the IRS's long-standing policy of \ndenying tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools. \nThe Justice Department also changed its position in the Bob Jones case \nbefore the Supreme Court, abandoning its defense of the policy that \nprohibited tax exemptions for discriminatory schools. One of President \nBush's current circuit court nominees, Carolyn Kuhl, was an aide to \nAttorney General William French Smith at the time and participated in \nurging reversal of the policy.\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n  After the Justice Department decision was announced, more than 200 \nlawyers and others in the Justice Department's civil rights division \nsent a letter to William Bradford Reynolds, who then headed the civil \nrights division, expressing ``serious concerns'' about the Reagan \nadministration's decision that racially discriminatory private schools \nare entitled to tax exemptions. And they questioned the division's \ncommitment to vigorously enforce the Nation's civil rights laws.\n  In response to such protests, President Reagan proposed legislation \nto make it illegal to grant tax exemptions to schools that discriminate \non racial grounds. The Senate Committee on Finance, and the House \nCommittee on Ways and Means, scheduled public hearings on the Federal \nGovernment's policy regarding the effect of racial discrimination on \nthe tax-exempt status of private schools.\n  The Senate Finance Committee held its hearing on February 1, 1982. In \nconnection with this hearing, the committee requested high-level \nJustice Department memoranda, correspondence, deliberations, and other \ndocuments related to the reversal of the administration's position. The \ndocuments turned over to the Senate Finance Committee included:\n  Letters from Representative Trent Lott to Secretary Regan, IRS \nCommissioner Egger, and Solicitor General Lee, urging change in the \nadministration's position on Bob Jones;\n  memorandum from Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Fein to \nDeputy Attorney General Edward Schmults, advising Schmults on private \nschools;\n  memorandum from Carolyn Kuhl, Special Assistant to the Attorney \nGeneral, to Ken Starr, noting Reagan/Bush campaign statements on \nprivate schools;\n  memorandum from Peter Wallison, Treasury General Counsel, to \nSecretary Regan briefing him on meeting with Representative Lott;\n  memorandum from Treasury General Counsel Wallison to Deputy Secretary \nMcNamar and Secretary Regan on Government's position in Bob Jones case;\n  memorandum from Civil Rights Division Head, William Bradford \nReynolds, to Attorney General Smith justifying changes in \nAdministration's position on Bob Jones;\n  memorandum from Treasury Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, Ann \nMcLaughlin, to Deputy Secretary McNamar on ``press strategy'' for \nreleasing Bob Jones decision;\n  memorandum from IRS Chief Counsel Gideon to Treasury Deputy General \nCounsel Government's statement in Bob Jones;\n  letter from IRS Chief Counsel Gideon to Civil Rights Division Head \nReynolds on formulation of Government's statement in Bob Jones; and\n  memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Theodore Olson from the \nOffice of Legal Counsel to Attorney General Smith and Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Schmults responding to the analysis in Reynolds' memo on Bob \nJones.\n  Clearly, in 1982, the Republican administration at that time released \nto the Senate documents that included internal memoranda among high-\nlevel Justice Department officials, inter-agency communications, and \ndocuments relating to the government's position in an important Supreme \nCourt case. They also included letters to the Solicitor General.\n  Moreover, the Reagan administration turned over these documents \nwithin months after being written, and no harm was done to the workings \nof the Justice Department or the administration. The Bush \nadministration is claiming that it is unprecedented to turn over such \ndocuments--and that the release of documents written by Mr. Estrada 6 \nto 10 years earlier would irreparably harm the government. I urge the \nadministration and Republican Senators to consider this additional \nprecedent. Certainly legislation is different from a nomination. While \nboth are matters for the Senate, legislation is different in that it \ncan be amended or revised. A nomination is a lifetime appointment.\n  In 2001, this White House agreed to give access to memoranda written \nby Jeffrey Holmstead, nominated to be an Assistant Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The Senate Committee on Environment \nand Public Works requested memoranda from Holmstead's years of service \nin the White House counsel's office under former President Bush. In \nparticular, the committee was interested in materials related to \nHolmstead's handling of an amendment to the Clean Air Act and other \nenvironmental issues. In the summer of 2001, the Bush administration \nresolved an impasse with the committee over the nomination by \npermitting committee staffers to review memoranda that Holmstead wrote \nwhile in the White House counsel's office. In sum, the administration \nallowed access to documents from the White House counsel's office--a \nmore sensitive post than the one Mr. Estrada held when he was in the \nDepartment of Justice.\n\n  In another situation, in 2001, this White House allowed Senator \nLieberman and the Senate Government Affairs Committee access to \ndocuments regarding environmental rulemaking, although I would note \nthat such access was allowed only after Senator Lieberman threatened to \nsubpoena the information. Faced with this threat, the Bush \nAdministration worked to reach an accommodation, and allowed access to \ndocuments, including documents that the administration characterized as \n``high-level deliberative documents,'' as part of an oversight \ninvestigation of the Bush administration's regulatory rollbacks.\n  So, despite this administration's continued insistence on \nconfidentiality, it has turned over, allowed access or worked to reach \nan accommodation on access to documents similar to those requested in \nconnection with the Estrada nomination in other cases and for other \ncommittees. And, again, in the instance of the Estrada nomination, the \nmatter before the Senate concerns a lifetime appointment to the second-\nhighest court in the land.\n  Last Thursday, the former Republican leader accepted ``part of the \nblame'' for how the Senate has come to consider judicial nominations. I \nappreciate that because it is one of the few times a Republican Senator \nhas accepted responsibility for what happened during the years in which \nthe Republican majority in the Senate blocked and delayed so many of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees. The Senator from Mississippi \nalso acknowledged that ``you filibuster a lot of different ways.'' I \nthank the Senator from Mississippi for trying to be constructive and \nfor suggesting that ``something can be worked out'' on the request for \nMr. Estrada's work papers from the Department of Justice.\n  In yesterday's edition of The Weekly Standard, a report suggests that \nother Senate Republicans, ``several veteran GOP Senate staffers'' and \n``a top GOP leadership aide'' asked the White House to show some \nflexibility and to share the legal memoranda with the Senate to resolve \nthis matter, but they were rebuffed. It is regrettable that the White \nHouse will not listen to reason from Senate Democrats or Senate \nRepublicans. If they had, there would be no need for this cloture vote. \nThe White House is less interested in making progress on the Estrada \nnomination than in trying to score political points and to divide the \nHispanic community.\n  The real ``double standard'' here is that the President selected Mr. \nEstrada based in large part on his work for 4\\1/2\\ years in the \nSolicitor General's Office as well as for his ideological views, but \nthe administration says that the Senate may not examine his written \nwork from the office that would shed the most light on his views. The \nWhite House says that the Senate should not consider the very ideology \nthe White House took into account in selecting a 41-year-old for a \nlifetime seat on the country's second-highest court. Another double \nstandard at work here is that this is a nominee who is well known for \nhaving very passionate views about judicial decisions and legal policy \nand is well known for being outspoken, and yet he has refused to share \nhis views with the very people charged with evaluating his nomination.\n  It seems to be a perversion of the constitutional process to require \nthe Senate to stumble in the dark about his views, when he shares his \nviews quite freely with others and when this Administration has \nselected him for the privilege of this high office, and for life, based \non those views.\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\n  One of the most disconcerting aspects of the manner in which the \nSenate is approaching these divisive judicial nominations is what \nappears to be the Republican majority's willingness to sacrifice the \nconstitutional authority of the Senate as a check on the power of the \nPresident in the area of lifetime appointments to our federal courts. \nIt should concern all of us and the American people that the Republican \nmajority's efforts to re-write Senate history in order to rubber stamp \nthis White House's Federal judicial nominees will cause long-term \ndamage to this institution, to our courts, to our constitutional form \nof government, to the rights and protections of the American people and \nto generations to come.\n  The White House is using ideology to select its judicial nominees but \nis trying to prevent the Senate from knowing the ideology of these \nnominees when it evaluates them. It was not so long ago when then-\nSenator Ashcroft was chairing a series of Judiciary Committee hearings \nat which Edwin Meese III testified:\n\n       I think that very extensive investigations of each \n     nominee--and I don't worry about the delay that this might \n     cause because, remember, those judges are going to be on the \n     bench for their professional lifetime, so they have got \n     plenty of time ahead once they are confirmed, and there is \n     very little opportunity to pull them out of those benches \n     once they have been confirmed--I think a careful \n     investigation of the background of each judge, including \n     their writings, if they have previously been judges or in \n     public positions, the actions that they have taken, the \n     decisions that they have written, so that we can to the \n     extent possible eliminate people eliminate persons who would \n     turn out to be activist judges from being confirmed.\n\n  Timothy E. Flanigan, an official from the administration of the \nPresident's father, and who more recently served as Deputy White House \nCounsel, helping the current President select his judicial nominees, \ntestified strongly in favor of ``the need for the Judiciary Committee \nand the full Senate to be extraordinarily diligent in examining the \njudicial philosophy of potential nominees.'' He continued:\n\n       In evaluating judicial nominees, the Senate has often been \n     stymied by its inability to obtain evidence of a nominee's \n     judicial philosophy. In the absence of such evidence, the \n     Senate has often confirmed a nominee on the theory that it \n     could find no fault with the nominee. I would reverse the \n     presumption and place the burden squarely on the shoulders \n     of the judicial nominee to prove that he or she has a \n     well-thought-out judicial philosophy, one that recognizes \n     the limited role for Federal judges. Such a burden is \n     appropriately borne by one seeking life tenure to wield \n     the awesome judicial power of the United States.\n\n  Now that the occupant of the White House no longer is a popularly \nelected Democrat but a Republican, these principles seem no longer to \nhave any support within the White House or the Senate Republican \nmajority. Fortunately, our constitutional principles and our Senate \ntraditions, practices and governing rules do not change with the \npolitical party that occupies the White House or with a shift in \nmajority in the Senate.\n  The White House, in conjunction with the new Republican majority in \nthe Senate, is purposeful in choosing these battles over judicial \nnominations. Dividing rather than uniting has become their modus \noperandi. The decision by the Republican Senate majority to focus on \ncontroversial nominations says much about their mistaken priorities. \nThe Republican majority sets the agenda and they schedule the debate, \njust as they have again here today.\n  I have served in the Senate for 29 years, and until recently I have \nnever seen such stridency on the part of an administration or such \nwillingness on the part of a Senate majority to cast aside tradition \nand upset the balances embedded in our Constitution, in order to expand \npresidential power. What I find unprecedented are the excesses that the \nRepublican majority and this White House are willing to indulge to \noverride the constitutional division of power over appointments and \nlongstanding Senate practices and history. It strikes me that some \nRepublicans seem to think that they are writing on a blank slate and \nthat they have been given a blank check to pack the courts.\n  They show a disturbing penchant for reading the Constitution to suit \ntheir purposes of the moment rather than as it has functioned for more \nthan 200 years to protect all Americans through its checks and \nbalances.\n  The Democratic leader pointed the way out of this impasse again in \nhis letter to the President on February 11. It is regrettable that the \nPresident did not respond to that reasonable effort to resolve this \nmatter. Indeed, the letter he sent last week to Senator Frist was not a \nresponse to Senator Daschle's reasonable and realistic approach, but a \nfurther effort to minimize the Senate's role in this process by \nproposing radical changes in Senate rules and practices to the great \nbenefit of this administration.\n  A distinguished senior Republican Senator saw the reasonableness of \nthe suggestions that the Democratic leader and assistant leader have \nconsistently made during this debate when he agreed on February 14 that \nthey pointed the way out of the impasse. Regrettably, his efforts and \njudgment were also rejected by the administration.\n  The Supreme Court, in an opinion authored last year by none other \nthan Justice Scalia, one of this President's judicial role models, \ninstructs that judicial ethics do not prevent candidates for judicial \noffice or judicial nominees from sharing their judicial philosophy and \nviews.\n  With respect to ``precedent,'' Republicans not only joined in the \nfilibuster of the nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court, they joined in the filibuster of Stephen \nBreyer to the First Circuit, Judge Rosemary Barkett to the Eleventh \nCircuit, Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the Third Circuit, and Judge Richard \nPaez and Judge Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit. The truth is that \nfilibusters on nominations and legislative matters and extended debate \non judicial nominations, including circuit court nominations, have \nbecome more and more common through Republicans' own actions.\n  Of course, when they are in the majority Republicans have more \nsuccessfully defeated nominees by refusing to proceed on them and have \nnot publicly explained their actions, preferring to act in secret under \nthe cloak of anonymity. From 1995 through 2001, when Republicans \npreviously controlled the Senate majority, Republican efforts to defeat \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees most often took place through \ninaction and anonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be \nheld accountable. In effect, these were anonymous filibusters.\n  Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who were not acted \nupon during the Congress in which President Clinton first nominated \nthem, and they eventually defeated more than 50 judicial nominees \nwithout a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing to proceed \nwith hearings and committee votes.\n  Beyond judicial nominees, Republicans also filibustered the \nnomination of executive branch nominees. They successfully filibustered \nthe nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the \nUnited States in spite of two cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David \nSatcher's subsequent nomination to be Surgeon General also required \ncloture but he was successfully confirmed.\n  Other executive branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans \ninclude Walter Dellinger's nomination to be Assistant Attorney General, \nand two cloture motions were required to be filed and both were \nrejected by Republicans. In this case we were able finally to obtain a \nconfirmation vote after elaborate effort, and Mr. Dellinger was \nconfirmed to that position with 34 votes against him. He was never \nconfirmed to his position as Solicitor General because Republicans had \nmade clear their opposition to him. In addition, in 1993, Republicans \nobjected to a number of State Department nominations and even the \nnomination of Janet Napolitano to serve as the U.S. Attorney for \nArizona, resulting in cloture motions.\n  In 1994, Republicans successfully filibustered the nomination of Sam \nBrown to be an Ambassador. After three cloture motions were filed, his \nnomination was returned to President Clinton without Senate action. \nAlso in 1994, two cloture petitions were required to get a vote on the \nnomination of Derek Shearer to be an Ambassador. And it likewise took \ntwo cloture motions to get a vote on the nomination of Ricki Tigert to \nchair the FDIC. So when Republican Senators now talk about the\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nSenate Executive Calendar and Presidential nominees, they must be \nreminded that they recently filibustered many, many qualified nominees.\n\n  Nonetheless, in spite of all the intransigence of the White House and \nall of the doublespeak by some of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, I can report that the Senate has moved forward to confirm \n111 of President Bush's judicial nominations since July 2001. That \ntotal includes 11 judges confirmed so far this year, and of those, \nseven were confirmed last week. The Senate last Thursday moved forward \non the controversial nomination of Jay S. Bybee to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Those observing these matters might contrast this progress with the \nstart of the last Congress in which the Republican majority in the \nSenate was delaying consideration of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. In 1999, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was not \nuntil mid-June. The Senate did not reach 11 confirmations until the end \nof July of that year. Accordingly, the facts show that Democratic \nSenators are being extraordinarily cooperative with a Senate majority \nand a White House that refuses to cooperate with us. We have made \nprogress in spite of that lack of comity and cooperation.\n  We worked hard to reduce Federal judicial vacancies to under 55, \nwhich includes the 20 judgeships the Democratic-led Senate authorized \nin the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct last year. That is an extremely low vacancy number based on recent \nhistory and well below the 67 vacancies that Senator Hatch termed \n``full employment'' on the Federal bench during the Clinton \nAdministration.\n  It is unfortunate that the White House and some Republicans have \ninsisted on this confrontation rather than working with us to provide \nthe needed information so that we could proceed to an up-or-down vote. \nSome on the Republican side seem to prefer political game playing, \nseeking to pack our courts with ideologues and leveling baseless \ncharges of bigotry, rather than to work with us to resolve the impasse \nover this nomination by providing information and proceeding to a fair \nvote.\n  I was disappointed that Senator Bennett's straightforward colloquy \nwith Senator Reid and me on February 14, which pointed to a solution, \nwas never allowed by hard-liners on the other side to yield results. I \nam disappointed that all my efforts and those of Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid have been rejected by the White House. The letter that \nSenator Daschle sent to the President on February 11 pointed the way to \nresolving this matter reasonably and fairly. Republicans would \napparently rather engage in politics.\n  I urge the White House and Senate Republicans to end the political \nwarfare and join with us in good faith to make sure the information \nthat is needed to review this nomination is provided so that the Senate \nmay conclude its consideration of this nomination. I urge the White \nHouse, as I have for more than 2 years, to work with us and, quoting \nfrom a recent column by Thomas Mann of The Brookings Institute, to \nsubmit ``a more balanced ticket of judicial nominees and engag[e] in \ngenuine negotiations and compromise with both parties in Congress.''\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our nation and, in \nthis case, he has even managed to divide Hispanics across the country. \nThe nomination and confirmation process begins with the President, and \nI urge him to work with us to find a way forward to unite the Nation on \nthese issues, instead of to divide the Nation.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last night the President addressed the \nNation on the approaching consequences of 12 years of deceit and \nbrutality by the regime of Saddam Hussein. The stark choice presented \nto Saddam's regime is fully justified: leave or be removed.\n  Saddam has failed to disarm. He has violated 17 U.N. resolutions, \nattacked his neighbors, threatened regional stability and sought and \nused weapons of mass destruction. He has assaulted his own people and \nruled them by terror. This 12-year saga of deceit and denial now enters \nits final chapter.\n  For those who suffer daily terror under the oppression of Saddam's \nregime, for those who have survived torture and imprisonment, for those \nwho watched as family members suffered and died in the agony of \nchemical weapons attacks, their moment of liberation is near. For those \nwho will defend this dying regime, the moment of reckoning is imminent.\n  The President has shown great patience and given diplomacy every \nchance to work, but as he stated last night the time to act has \narrived.\n  In recent days we have heard intemperate and ill-chosen words of \ncriticism directed at the President from some elected to serve in this \ngreat body. Such statements are, simply put, disappointing.\n  We have reached this moment of possible conflict with Iraq, not by \nour choosing but by Saddam Hussein's. We do not prepare for war because \nwe want to. We do so because we must. The failure of diplomacy to deter \nSaddam Hussein does not date back to the past 4\\1/2\\ months or to the \nbeginning of this President's term.\n  The failure of diplomacy traces back through 12 years of defiance by \nSaddam Hussein, 12 years of deceit by his regime, 12 years of slowly \neroding international resolve even among our allies while all the time \nthe threat to this country has grown closer and closer and closer.\n  Since that dark day in September of 2001, many in this great Nation \nhave lived with the fear of the grave and growing threat of terrorism. \nInstinctively, the American people understand that we cannot permit a \nruthless dictator, aggressor and supporter of terror such as Saddam \nHussein to pursue and possess the world's most deadly weapons. This is \na threat that must be addressed, now.\n  Last night, in committing to meet this threat, the President stated \nwhat we have all come to expect and to respect, in him. He said:\n\n       That duty falls to me as commander in chief by the oath I \n     have sworn, by the oath I will keep.\n\n  The President has committed the Nation to action. We will not wait \nwhile the threat gathers with a destructive force that is \nincomprehensible. We will live in freedom of fear.\n\n  I thank the Lord that at this moment of testing, this great Nation is \nled by this great leader.\n  It has been suggested by some here on the Senate floor that the \nPresident acts without justification, without a legal basis, and \nwithout the consent of Congress. This is flat out wrong.\n  Mr. President, each and every Senator is entitled to their own \nopinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts.\n  On August 2, 1990, Iraq--without provocation--invaded and occupied \nthe territory of Kuwait. Through 5\\1/2\\ months of diplomacy, Iraq \nignored demands that it withdraw from Kuwait. And on January 16, 1991, \na U.S.-led coalition of nations launched Operation Desert Storm. After \nthe liberation of Kuwait, former President George Bush announced a \ncease-fire, unilaterally halting offensive military operations on \nFebruary 28, 1991.\n  On March 3, 1991, General Norman Schwarzkopf and the commander of \nIraqi forces concluded a cease-fire agreement, temporarily suspending \ngulf war hostilities. The cease-fire agreement obligated Iraq to accept \nunconditionally the voluntary destruction, removal, and rendering \nharmless--under international supervision--of all nuclear, chemical, \nand biological weapons, and all stocks of agents, and all related \nsubsystems and components, and all research, development, support, and \nmanufacturing facilities.\n  The cease-fire agreement was ratified and approved on April 3, 1991, \nby the U.N. Security Council in Resolution 687. That resolution, which \nis still in force, reaffirms all 13 of the Security Council's earlier \nresolutions on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.\n  In a letter delivered to the Security Council on April 6, 1991, \nSaddam Hussein's regime formally accepted the terms of the cease-fire \nwithout conditions. Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein has consistently and \nrepeatedly refused to abide by his obligations to disarm under \ninternational supervision as required in the 1991 gulf war cease-fire \nand succeeding United Nations resolutions, and has attacked U.S. and \nBritish aircraft lawfully enforcing these obligations almost \ncontinuously since 1991.\n  On November 8, 2002, the United Nations Security Council unanimously \nadopted Resolution 1441. This resolution gave Saddam Hussein's regime \n``a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations,'' \nwhich preserved and cited the authorities to act contained in \nResolution 687, and placed the burden of proving compliance squarely on \nthe Iraqi dictator.\n  In the intervening 12 years, Saddam Hussein has blatantly and \ncynically persisted in his illegal refusal to comply with his \nobligations under the 1991 cease-fire agreement that suspended \nhostilities in the gulf war, and with Resolution 1441.\n  Mr. President, international obligations such as those which Saddam \nHussein has ignored for more than a decade are meaningless unless they \nare backed by an unflinching resolve and international commitment to \nenforce them.\n  Given Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs, his \ndemonstrated willingness to use these weapons, and possible \nintersections between his regime, al-Qaida, and other international \nterrorist organizations, the absence of such resolve could have \ndevastating consequences for world peace in general and to the United \nStates in particular.\n  If it is necessary to act, if Saddam fails to heed the ultimatum, any \nsubsequent military action against Saddam Hussein's regime will be \nlawful and fully authorized, pursuant to a series of resolutions passed \nby the Congress, pursuant to the President's Commander in Chief \nauthority under the Constitution, pursuant to the venerable \ninternational legal principle confirming the inherent right of a state \nto defend itself, pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, \nand pursuant to a long series of United Nations Security Council \nresolutions.\n  In the event of hostilities, the U.S. service men and women on the \nfront lines will have this Congress' full support and the backing of \nthe American people. We will do what it takes to give them the \nresources they need to complete their mission. Our thoughts and our \nprayers are with them, and with their families and loved ones here at \nhome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished majority \nleader for his very heartfelt remarks. We were together last night at \nthe meeting with the President. It was a somber meeting. But, clearly, \nthe President is a man at peace with himself and has inner confidence. \nHe has carefully gone about the decisionmaking to arrive at the \ndecision he made last night and such decisions as he may make here in \nthe ensuing hours and days to come.\n  But most especially, in the minds of all of us last night were the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces and their families. The distinguished \nleader has spoken most eloquently about them. Because, in the end, \ntogether with a large group of civilians who are employed in the \nvarious agencies and Departments of our Government, they must bear the \nrisk, the brunt of such force as may be used against them. So I am \nprivileged to stand here with my distinguished leader today.\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\n  I, too, am concerned about the remarks of some of our colleagues. I \nfound some of those remarks to be, in my judgment, a disbelief. I could \nnot believe they were said.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Medical Litigation Crisis\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the medical \nliability and litigation crisis in our country.\n  This is a crisis that is preventing patients from accessing high-\nquality health care--or, in some cases, any care at all--because \ndoctors are being driven out of practice. It is a crisis that is \nneedlessly increasing the cost of health care for every American.\n  This is not the first time we have addressed this issue. As many of \nyou will recall, we debated, and passed, medical litigation relief in \nthe Commonsense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act back in 1995. \nUnfortunately, the language we passed was stripped from that bill in \nconference.\n  I am sorely disappointed that--in the ensuing eight years--we have \nnot addressed this problem. As a result, the situation has become \nworse, not better; the problem has expanded, not shrunk. We must act \nnow if we are to fix the crisis in health care delivery this has caused \nin many parts of our country.\n  I was pleased last summer when President Bush announced his desire to \naddress this issue. I am even more pleased that the President has \ncontinued to emphasize the importance of the problem and the need for \nreform in speeches around the country, and in his State of the Union \nAddress. We in the Senate welcome the President's support in this \neffort.\n  Make no mistake. We have a health care crisis in this country, one \nthat is due in large part to litigation that is out of control. But not \nall Americans may be aware of just how serious are the ramifications of \nthis crisis.\n  This map, with data supplied by the American Medical Association, \nshows the states that currently are experiencing a medical liability \ncrisis and those that are showing signs of developing a crisis. The 18 \nred states are in crisis. The 27 yellow states are showing problem \nsigns. Only five states are currently ``ok''. On a map with last year's \ndata, only 12 states were in crisis. The problem is growing and it \nreaches from coast to coast.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a July 18, \n2002, Associated Press article, ``Soaring Malpractice Insurance \nSqueezes out Doctors, Clinics,'' that highlights some of the problems \nfaced by patients and doctors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, July 18, 2002]\n\n      Soaring Malpractice Insurance Squeezes Out Doctors, Clinics\n\n                          (By Theresa Agovino)\n\n       The shock from Jim Lawson's July 4 death in a Nevada auto \n     accident was felt well beyond his family and friends.\n       The two-car crash on a busy street leading to Las Vegas \n     airport came just one day after the nearest trauma clinic, at \n     the University Medical Center, closed down. The 58 orthopedic \n     surgeons who rotate through the hospital had insisted on \n     relief from the soaring cost of medical malpractice \n     insurance.\n       No one can be sure his death, confirmed at an emergency \n     room an hour away, could have been avoided. Trauma centers \n     generally offer more effective attention for accident \n     victims.\n       But it prompted a quick July 13 reopening of the university \n     center. Some 10 to 15 of the doctors agreed to become \n     temporary employees of the county hospital, limiting their \n     liability to $50,000, while the governor tries to enact \n     legislation that would restrict medical malpractice awards.\n       On a much broader level, it brought new attention to a \n     national problem that doctors say is obliging many of them to \n     flee certain states or give up certain specialties--or the \n     entire profession--because of skyrocketing insurance premiums \n     linked to soaring jury awards.\n       The impact of the trauma center's closure in Las Vegas was \n     summed up by its director, Dr. John Fildes: ``The standard of \n     care in our community was set back 25 years.''\n       The number of communities suffering similar problems is \n     mushrooming.\n       This summer, two Pennsylvania hospitals, one Arizona \n     hospital and a clinic in Oregon closed their obstetrics \n     units.\n       Several counties in upstate New York have no obstetricians \n     covering night shifts.\n       Soon, two counties in Pennsylvania won't have a \n     neurosurgeon. Seven hospitals on the Mississippi coast share \n     3 neurosurgeons, one of whom, Terry Smith in Biloxi, is \n     likely to leave next month because he can't find insurance.\n       Thirteen insurance companies have refused to cover Dr. \n     Smith, who currently pays $65,000 in annual premiums. One \n     company may agree to cover him, but it is likely to cost \n     $100,000, an amount he says he can't afford.\n       Smith said he often puts in seven-day weeks now to meet the \n     community's needs.\n       ``This is an area with lots of poor and minority people, so \n     you as a doctor feel you're doing something important,'' \n     Smith said. ``I feel guilty about leaving but I just don't \n     have a choice.\n       ``The two guys I'm leaving behind are friends of mine and \n     they'll be working even harder,'' he said.\n       Mississippi is one of 12 states where rising premiums, tied \n     to awards by state juries in malpractice cases, are creating \n     a crisis, according to the American Medical Association. The \n     others are New York, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, \n     Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon and West \n     Virginia.\n       Because of risks associated with certain medical conditions \n     and forms of treatment, some specialties pay especially high \n     rates, and those rates are compounded by being charged in \n     states where laws place fewer limits on jury awards.\n       For example, while premium increases this year average \n     about 15 percent nationwide for all practices, rates for \n     obstetricians and gynecologists in Pennsylvania are set to \n     balloon by anywhere from 40 percent to even 81 percent, \n     according to Medical Liability Monitor, a trade publication. \n     In West Virginia, they are catapulting anywhere from 29 \n     percent to 36 percent.\n       The average jury award for medical malpractice doubled to \n     $1 million in the six years ending in 2000, according to Jury \n     Verdict Research, a private database used by lawyers, \n     insurers and doctors. Lawyers who handle malpractice cases \n     are critical of the database, pointing out that it is not \n     comprehensive and contending that its findings are inflated.\n       In any event, verdicts of more than $1 million are common \n     in states like Mississippi and Nevada. in the first six \n     months of this year, there were five jury awards in in \n     Mississippi and the average verdict was $5.6 million, \n     according to the state's medical association.\n       ``I think juries are just frustrated with managed care and \n     health care in general, so they take it out on doctors,'' \n     said Dr. Michael Daubs, an orthopedic surgeon who said he may \n     leave Las Vegas if his rates keep rising.\n       He says he has never been sued but his insurance jumped \n     $20,000 to $60,000 a year. He has applied for medical \n     licenses in three other states.\n       Some insurance companies are leaving the medical liability \n     business. St. Paul Cos, the second largest provider of \n     medical malpractice insurance, announced last December it \n     would stop writing policies, leaving 42,000 doctors searching \n     for coverage. St. Paul said it lost close to $1 billion on \n     its medical malpractice line last year.\n       Smaller insurers are also cutting back or leaving the \n     business. Pennsylvania's second-largest medical malpractice \n     insurer, Phico Insurance Co., failed earlier this year and \n     was liquidated by the state.\n       Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would \n     limit the pain and suffering portion of malpractice awards to \n     $250,000. The bill, intended to override state laws,\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\n     would also curtail lawyers' fees and allow juries to hear \n     about the plaintiffs' other sources of income.\n       ``We absolutely need tort reform,'' said Dr. Donald \n     Palmisano, president elect of the AMA. ``The situation has \n     spiraled out of control.\n       The AMA lists six states as having their malpractice \n     situations under control: California, Colorado, New Mexico, \n     Wisconsin, Indiana and Louisiana. In Wisconsin, where there \n     is a limit on awards, St. Paul did not suffer a loss.\n       Trial lawyers are opposed to the caps. They cite surveys \n     showing juries rule in favor of doctors in two thirds of all \n     malpractice lawsuits. They say doctors and hospitals should \n     focus on reducing mistakes, not jury awards.\n       ``If you run over someone over by accident, no one is \n     putting a cap on what you will have to pay them. Why do we \n     want to elevate one group in society above another?'' said \n     Leo Boyle, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of \n     America.\n       Boyle blames insurance companies for keeping rates \n     artificially low in the 1990s to win business as they \n     expanded wildly, a practice made possible by blooming returns \n     in the stock market. ``Insurance companies were reckless in \n     their pricing and now patients are supposed to pay for it?'' \n     he said.\n       Joseph Roethel, who follows the medical insurance industry \n     as assistant vice president at A.M. Best Co., an insurance \n     rating agency, parcels out the blame equally: Insurance \n     companies kept rates too low in the 1990s and jury awards \n     have gone too high.\n       Now, he said, ``Insurance companies don't have the reserves \n     for these types of jury awards.''\n       Some doctors are resorting to working without insurance, \n     using a credit line or their own money to cover malpractice \n     expenses. The practice isn't common but is done, especially \n     in Florida. Most hospitals won't allow that practice.\n       Two hospitals in West Virginia have begun directly \n     employing more doctors and paying their insurance to \n     alleviate the doctor shortage. Many hospitals consider such \n     an option too expensive.\n       At Bluefield Regional Medical Center in West Virginia, \n     doctors are more careful now in delivering medicine, \n     according to hospital president Eugene Palowski. But they are \n     also much less willing to care for high-risk patients with \n     multiple conditions, leaving them to find physicians in \n     surrounding states.\n       Many patients are confused, or just plain angry.\n       Marine Hawkins, 20, of Boyle, Miss., was shocked to hear \n     from her obstetrician that he was closing his practice--just \n     two weeks before her due date of July 21.\n       The nearest doctor is 30 minutes away. She doesn't have a \n     car, and will have to rely on relatives to get there.\n       ``This isn't what I needed now,'' she said.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The article points to the ``national problem that doctors \nsay is obliging many of them to flee certain states or give up certain \nspecialties--or the entire profession--because of skyrocketing \ninsurance premiums linked to soaring jury awards.''\n  The article notes, as I am sure my colleagues from Nevada are acutely \naware, that the University Medical Center trauma clinic in Las Vegas--\nthe only Level one trauma center in Nevada--closed on July 3 last year.\n  The 58 doctors who were associated with the trauma center had \nrequested, but had not received, much-needed relief from soaring \nmedical liability insurance costs.\n  Let me give you just one example of the havoc this wreaked. On the \n4th of July, the day after the center closed, Jim Lawson could not \naccess the Level one trauma care that he needed. Mr. Lawson was the \nvictim of a serious traffic accident, and on that day, the closest \nLevel one trauma center was more than an hour away by air!\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Lawson did not survive. The trauma center was \nhurriedly reopened on July 13, but with only 10-15 doctors working on a \ntemporary basis, with limited liability. Commenting on the trauma \ncenter's closure, its director, Dr. John Fildes, stated, ``The standard \nof care in our community was set back 25 years.''\n  Mr. Lawson's family spoke at a press conference here in the Senate \nlast week. His death was a tragedy to his family and to his community. \nNo one knows whether Mr. Lawson could have been saved had he been \ntreated at the nearby trauma center. But would any of us want that to \nhappen to one of our loved ones? To be forced to bypass the nearest \ntrauma center, and travel an hour to receive emergency care?\n  I certainly would not. And, the Senate should take the necessary \nsteps to ensure that it does not happen to anyone else. But this crisis \nis not limited to emergency services. Ensuring the availability of \nadequate obstetric care is also an increasing problem.\n  According to the same Associated Press article, one Arizona hospital, \na clinic in Oregon, and two Pennsylvania hospitals closed their \nobstetrics units recently. Several counties in upstate New York have no \nobstetricians covering night shifts.\n  What does that say to the expectant mother whose child comes into the \nworld at night . . . ``There's no room at the inn''?\n  The crisis is particularly acute in the farming and ranching \ncommunities of rural America. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record a Washington Post article from February 3, 2003, \ntitled ``Insurance Crisis Hits Hard on Prairie; Denied Coverage, \nObstetrician for 3 Wyoming Counties Ends Practice.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 3, 2003]\n\n Insurance Crisis Hits Hard on Prairie; Denied Coverage, Obstetrician \n                  for 3 Wyoming Counties Ends Practice\n\n                             (By T.R. Reid)\n\n       When the Wheatland High Bulldogs hosted arch-rival Douglas \n     for a basketball game the other night, the gym was jammed \n     with fans roaring support for the home team. But one \n     prominent Wheatland citizen watched the game with mixed \n     loyalties. Willard Woods, the local obstetrician, had \n     delivered just about every player on both the Wheatland and \n     Douglas teams.\n       As the only ``baby doctor'' serving a three-county swath of \n     the khaki-brown Wyoming prairie for the past quarter-century, \n     Woods has delivered about 2,500 infants, including almost all \n     the high school athletes in Wheatland, Douglas, Chugwater and \n     other rural communities. But this winter, Woods ended his \n     obstetrical practice.\n       ``I love delivering babies,'' the intense physician, 56, \n     said. ``I really love delivering the babies of women I \n     delivered a couple decades ago. And I know this community \n     needs an obstetrician.\n       ``But you can't practice without [malpractice] insurance. \n     And I can't get coverage for deliveries any more.''\n       The national malpractice insurance crisis that President \n     Bush spoke of in his State of the Union address last week hit \n     home for Wheatland this winter when Woods' insurance company \n     joined a number of national malpractice carriers in declaring \n     bankruptcy.\n       That left only two firms selling malpractice insurance in \n     Wyoming, and neither one was willing to take on a new \n     obstetrical coverage. Woods did get insurance for his \n     gynecological practice--a branch of medicine that spawns far \n     fewer lawsuits than delivering babies--but the annual premium \n     costs him $116,000, three times what he paid a year ago.\n       In this wheat-growing region of eastern Wyoming, where \n     medical services are sparse and scattered--Platte County, \n     with a population of less than 9,000, has five doctors, equal \n     to the number of veterinarians--the impact has been acute.\n       Women with normal pregnancies can still have their babies \n     delivered in the hospital; Woods's two partners, both general \n     practitioners, share the delivery duties.\n       ``But if you have any kind of problem, like I did,'' said \n     Wheatland mother Kori Wilhelm, who has a genetic blood \n     mutation that makes pregnancy dangerous, ``you have to go to \n     Cheyenne now--and it's a three-hour round trip--to get the \n     specialized treatment we used to get right down the street at \n     Dr. Woods's clinic.''\n       Woods' problem has turned into a financial problem for \n     Platte County Memorial Hospital, a 43-bed facility that is \n     Wheatland's biggest building. ``The economics of a rural \n     hospital are always tight,'' noted hospital director Mike \n     Matthews. ``If I don't have all my physicians providing \n     services here, I'm losing revenue. And if I have to cut \n     back--well, this hospital is the third-biggest employer in \n     the county.''\n       The two family practitioners who share Woods's practice \n     have found their lives complicated by the insurance problems. \n     Their malpractice premiums have gone up sharply, though \n     neither one has ever been sued. Even worse has been the \n     impact on their daily schedules.\n       ``We're now the only docs delivering babies in the whole \n     area,'' said Steve Peasley, a Douglas native who returned to \n     the prairie after finishing Georgetown Medical School. ``So \n     each one of us has to be on call every other day. That means \n     you can't leave town. You can't have a beer at the barbecue. \n     And after a full day of regular practice, you get a call from \n     the hospital at 3 a.m. saying somebody's in labor.''\n       Wheatland's medical problem is replicated in communities \n     large and small across the country as more and more doctors \n     find malpractice insurance out of reach. Some doctors in New \n     Jersey plan to demonstrate today to protest the high cost of \n     insurance, while doctors have already staged protests in West \n     Virginia, Nevada and Florida. Bush's proposed solution to the \n     growing crisis is to put a limit on the amount of damages \n     an injured patient can win. That would reduce the number \n     of multimillion-dollar jury verdicts, cutting the risk for \n     doctors and their insurance companies. In Woods's view, \n     the president has it just right.\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\n       ``We love that plan,'' he said. ``It will save medicine in \n     Wyoming.'' In the neighboring state of Colorado, he notes, \n     which has a limit on pain-and-suffering awards, malpractice \n     premiums tend to be a fraction of the Wyoming rates.\n       Wyoming's state constitution prohibits any limit on damage \n     claims against a corporation--a ban that goes back to the \n     1880's, when the Union Pacific Railroad was the most \n     powerful, and most hated, institution in the state. But a \n     federal law capping damages would presumably override the \n     state constitution.\n       Still, there are doubts here about the Bush plan. ``The cap \n     on damages sounds like a simple solution, but it isn't one,'' \n     said Dave Freudenthal, a lawyer and Wyoming's newly elected \n     Democratic governor. ``We just had hearings in the \n     legislature on this issue. The insurance companies said a cap \n     on damages would not reduce rates, and would not induce any \n     more companies to sell [malpractice insurance] in Wyoming.''\n       The governor said he hopes to appoint a blue-ribbon panel \n     to study ``new approaches that would work in a rural, \n     sparsely populated state like this.'' Wyoming covers a land \n     area bigger than Maryland and Virginia combined but has fewer \n     residents, and fewer doctors, than the District.\n       While the study is underway, Wheatland has to get by \n     without an obstetrician.\n       ``I can't practice OB anymore, and nobody else will do it, \n     either,'' Woods said with a grimace. ``My daughter wants to \n     be a doctor, and she asked me what kind of medicine she can \n     do so she doesn't have to worry about insurance. And I said, \n     `Well, you sure don't want to deliver babies.' ''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the article describes the plight of the \npeople of Platte County, WY, population 9000, where the only \nobstetrician has been forced to give up delivering babies because \nobstetrics liability insurance is unavailable.\n  The article states:\n\n       As the only ``baby doctor'' serving a three-county swath of \n     the . . . Wyoming prairie for the past quarter-century, (Dr.) \n     Woods has delivered about 2,500 infants, including almost all \n     the high school athletes in Wheatland, Douglas, Chugwater and \n     other rural communities. But this winter, Woods ended his \n     obstetrical practice. ``I love delivering babies,'' the \n     intense (56-year-old) physician said. ``I really love \n     delivering the babies of women I delivered a couple of \n     decades ago. And I know this community needs an obstetrician. \n     But you can't practice without (malpractice) insurance. And I \n     can't get coverage for deliveries any more.''\n\n  This is not news to the rural West. There is an increasing shortage \nin my home state of Utah as well. Studies by both the Utah Medical \nAssociation and the Utah Chapter of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists underscore the problem in my state. \nAccording to the Utah Medical Association:\n\n       50.5 percent of Family Practitioners in Utah have already \n     given up obstetrical services or never practiced obstetrics. \n     Of the remaining 49.5 percent who still deliver babies, 32.7 \n     percent say they plan to stop providing OB services within \n     the next decade. Most plan to stop within the next five \n     years.\n\n  The Utah Medical Association study also relates:\n\n       Professional liability concerns [were] given as the chief \n     contributing factor in the decision to discontinue \n     obstetrical services. Such concerns include the cost of \n     liability insurance premiums, the hassles and costs involved \n     in defending against obstetrical lawsuits and a general fear \n     of being sued in today's litigious environment.\n\n  Mr. President, ensuring the availability of high-quality prenatal and \ndelivery care for pregnant women and their babies, the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society, is imperative. But these are not the only \nmembers of society who have difficulty in accessing healthcare.\n  According to the July 2002 Department of Health and Human Services \nreport, ``Confronting the New Health Care Crisis: Improving Health Care \nQuality and Lowering Cost by Fixing our Medical Liability System,'' the \nindigent are finding it increasingly difficult to access care also.\n  The HHS report states that ``[m]any doctors cannot volunteer their \nservices for a patient who cannot pay, and the proportion of the \nphysicians who provide charity care at all has declined, because \ndoctors cannot afford the required liability coverage.''\n  The July, 2002 report and the Department's report released this \nmonth, ``Addressing the New Health Care Crisis: Reforming the Medical \nLitigation System to Improve the Quality of Health Care,'' describe the \neconomic consequences of rising insurance costs also.\n  While many Americans have experienced problems accessing healthcare \ndue to excessive litigation, all Americans are paying for it. This is a \nnational problem and one that requires a national solution.\n  In my letter of March 12 to Budget Committee Chairman Nickles and \nranking Democrat Conrad, I emphasized the important implications of \nmedical liability litigation on the Federal budget.\n  In that letter, I wrote:\n\n       The Federal Government pays directly for health care for \n     members of the armed forces, veterans, and patients served in \n     the Indian Health Service. The Federal Government provides \n     reimbursements for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \n     According to the Department of Health and Human Services \n     March 3, 2003, report . . . the Federal Government spends \n     $33.7 billion-$56.2 billion per year for malpractice coverage \n     and the costs of defensive medicine. That report states, \n     ``reasonable limits on non-economic damages would reduce the \n     amount of taxpayers' money the Federal Government spends by \n     $28.1 billion-$50.6 billion per year.''\n\n  I continued to write:\n\n       In my view, federal legislation that would decrease costly \n     frivolous medical liability lawsuits and limit awards for \n     non-economic damages is necessary, not only to ensure patient \n     access to health care, but to curb increasing Federal health \n     care costs. Because of the substantial and important \n     budgetary implications, particularly to the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs, we request that the budget resolution \n     include language calling for medical liability legislation \n     reform.\n\n  I am pleased to report that the budget resolution we are considering \ntoday recognizes the tremendous impact of medical liability costs. In \nfact, the budget resolution as reported includes $11.3 billion in \nsavings over 10 years as a result of medical liability reform, based on \nCBO calculations. The Medicare program alone will save $7.9 billion, \nwhile Medicaid will save $2.9 billion. The remaining savings will occur \nin the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program and the Department of \nDefense.\n  Medical liability litigation directly and dramatically increases \nhealth care costs for all Americans. But, skyrocketing medical \nlitigation costs also increase health care costs indirectly by changing \nthe way doctors practice medicine. In an effort to avoid frivolous \nsuits, doctors often feel compelled to perform diagnostic tests that \nare costly and unnecessary.\n\n  This defensive medicine is wasteful, but for doctors it has \nunfortunately become necessary. According to a recent Harris poll, fear \nof being sued has led 79 percent of doctors to order more tests than \nare medically needed, 74 percent to refer patients to specialists more \noften than necessary, 51 percent to recommend invasive procedures that \nthey thought were unnecessary, and 41 percent to prescribe more \nmedications, including antibiotics, that they did not think were \nnecessary.\n  Defensive medicine increases health care costs, but the real risk of \nthe current medical liability system and the resulting practice of \ndefensive medicine is that it also puts Americans at risk. Every test \nand every treatment poses a risk to the patient. Every unnecessary \ntest, procedure, and treatment potentially puts a patient in harm's \nway. According to the Harris poll, 76 percent of the physicians are \nconcerned that malpractice litigation has hurt their ability to provide \nquality care to patients.\n  And so, that brings us to the big question: What can we do to address \nthis crisis? The answer is plenty. There are excellent examples of what \nworks. The March, 2003 Department of Health and Human Services report \ndescribes how reasonable reforms in some states have reduced health \ncare costs and improved access to quality health care. According to the \nreport, over the last two years, in states with limits of $250,000 to \n$350,000 on non-economic damages, premiums have increased at an average \nof 18 percent compared to 45 percent in States without such limits.\n  California enacted the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, also \nknown as MICRA, over 25 years ago in 1975. MICRA slowed the rate of \nincrease in medical liability premiums dramatically without affecting \nnegatively the quality of health care received by the State's \nresidents. As a result, doctors are not leaving California. \nFurthermore, between 1976 and 2000, premiums increased by 167 percent \nin California. But, believe it or not, they increased three times as \nmuch, an incredible 505 percent, in the rest of the country. \nConsequently, Californians were saved billions of dollars in health \ncare costs\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\nand Federal taxpayers were saved billions of dollars in the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs.\n  The March, 2003 report goes on to state:\n\n       A leading study estimates that reasonable limits on non-\n     economic damages such as California has had in effect for 25 \n     years, can reduce health care costs by 5-9 percent without \n     ``substantial effects on mortality or medical \n     complications.'' With national health care expenditures \n     currently estimated to be $1.4 trillion, if this reform were \n     adopted nationally, it would save $70-126 billion in health \n     care costs per year.\n\n  I would guess that no one in this body--with perhaps the exception of \nour colleague from Tennessee, Dr. Bill Frist, our majority leader--is \nmore keenly aware of the defects in this system than I. Before coming \nto Congress, I litigated several medical liability cases as a defense \nlawyer. I have seen heart-wrenching cases in which mistakes were made. \nBut, more often, I have seen heart-wrenching cases in which mistakes \nwere not made and doctors were forced to expend valuable time and \nresources defending themselves against frivolous lawsuits.\n  It has been estimated that 66 percent of all medical liability \nlawsuits brought are frivolous. They are brought by plaintiff's \nattorneys who seek to obtain the costs of defense, costs that approach \n$100,000 per case.\n  Let me take a moment to address the unfortunate incident that \noccurred recently in North Carolina. As the country is so painfully \naware, Jesica Santillan, a young girl who needed a heart and lung \ntransplant, received organs of the wrong blood type. Her death was a \ntragedy and our hearts go out to everyone involved.\n  Some are seizing on Jesica's most unfortunate death to argue that we \nshould not proceed with medical liability reform legislation. I would \nargue just the opposite: Jesica's death shows the need for reform of \nthe current system. Let me make clear that we do not know all of the \nfacts surrounding Jesica's case. We are not the doctors, the family, \nthe Duke personnel or their lawyers. But we do know that the current \nmedical liability system did not prevent Jesica's death. In fact, many \nexperts believe that the current system, by discouraging communication \nbetween doctors, nurses, and hospitals, increases the likelihood that \nmedical errors will occur.\n  The recent Institute of Medicine report, ``To Err is Human'' \ndescribed the impact of preventable medical errors in America's health \ncare system. One of the report's main conclusions was that:\n\n       The majority of medical errors do not result from \n     individual recklessness or the actions of a particular group \n     this is not a ``bad apple'' problem. More commonly, errors \n     are caused by faulty systems, processes, and conditions that \n     lead people to make mistakes or fail to prevent them.\n\n  We do not know all of the facts of Jesica's case. But, we do know \nthat more lawsuits cannot prevent medical errors from occurring. Her \ndeath should not be used by those who oppose medical litigation reform \nto prevent other patients from receiving access to the care they \ndeserve. No, Jesica's death does not indicate that medical liability \nreform is unnecessary. If anything, cases such as this support the need \nfor reform.\n  We need reform to identify better and more efficiently when \nmalpractice has occurred and which patients should be compensated. We \nneed reform to identify better when malpractice has not occurred. The \nreform that I envision would address litigation abuses in order to \nprovide swift and appropriate compensation for malpractice victims, \nredress for serious problems, and ensure that medical liability costs \ndo not prevent patients from accessing the care they need.\n  Jesica's death was a tragedy. But it would be a greater tragedy if we \nlet her death prevent other little boys and girls from receiving access \nto the life-saving care they need. That is what is happening in many \nparts of America today. And that is what will continue to happen if we \ndo not address this crisis in this Congress.\n  And so, we need to move ahead with legislation to improve patient \nsafety and reduce medical errors. I agree that we need to find an \nappropriate way to address egregious cases. No one believes more than I \nthat victims of malpractice should be compensated swiftly and \nappropriately for their losses. But that is not what is happening in \nour current medical legal system. Patients are forced to meander \nthrough a complicated legal system and often are awarded damages only \nafter years of legal bickering. Juries are awarding astounding and \nunreasonable sums for pain and suffering. A sizable portion of those \nawards goes to the attorney rather than the patient. The result: \nDoctors cannot get insurance and patients cannot get the care they \nneed.\n  As Chairmen of the HELP and Judiciary Committees, Senator Gregg and I \nheld a joint hearing earlier this month in an attempt to identify the \nroot causes of the crisis. We heard from a patient who experienced an \nadverse outcome due to a medical error. But, we also heard from a \npatient and a patient's wife who were victims of the current crisis, \nunable to find the medical care they or their loved ones desperately \nneeded because medical liability insurance costs had driven doctors out \nof practice.\n  We heard from a lawyer who believes that insurance reform is the \nanswer. But, in addition, we heard from the Texas State Insurance \nCommissioner and also from the president of Physician Insurance \nAssociation of America, representing provider-owned or operated \ninsurance companies that provide insurance for the majority of American \ndoctors. These gentlemen face this crisis and its consequences every \nday. Their data and their studies as well as those from the Department \nof Health and Human Services show that increasingly frequent frivolous \nlawsuits and skyrocketing awards are responsible for rapidly rising \npremiums.\n  Has the recent downturn in the economy and the stock market affected \nmedical liability premiums? Possibly, but this does not appear to be a \nmajor cause of the current crisis. Insurance companies invest \nconservatively, primarily in bonds and State insurance commissioners \nmonitor and regulate insurance business practices closely. Moreover, \ninsurance companies are precluded from increasing premiums to make up \nfor past losses.\n  As a matter of fact, they have to cover these losses. The country's \nlargest medical liability insurance company, St. Paul, no longer \nprovides this insurance. Now doctors are forming their own nonprofit \ncorporations to handle these matters and one can imagine that they are \ndoing their best to reduce costs.\n  It seems to me that the insurance reform discussed at the hearing not \nonly misses the mark badly; it would do nothing to address the cause of \nthe crisis and it would prevent State Insurance Commissioners from \nperforming the job they were appointed to do. I have to say that I came \naway from our hearing convinced that out-of-control medical litigation \nis the major cause of the crisis and that we must do something to stop \nit.\n  The current medical litigation system resembles a lottery more than \nit does a justice system. This system harms patients in many ways and \nraids every American's wallet. All Americans deserve the access to \ncare, the cost savings and the legal protections that States like \nCalifornia provide their residents. This problem has reached crisis \nproportions and it is high time that we act. The task before us is to \ndesign a system that protects both the patient and the provider. It is \nimportant that we take steps to benefit both patients and health care \nproviders, not the trial lawyers. Or else, we are in danger of losing \naccess to necessary healthcare.\n  Let's put some sense into the system by passing medical litigation \nimprovement legislation this year that gives patients access to their \ndoctors and enables doctors to provide high quality cost-effective \nmedical care. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the Senator from North Dakota, the manager of \nthe amendment, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                        Support for The Military\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as America braces for war, my thoughts \nare with our troops. Our men and women in uniform have my steadfast \nsupport. Though there is disagreement about the best way to disarm \nSaddam, there is something we all agree upon,\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\nand that is that America must be united in support for our troops. We \nmust defend our defenders and stand up for the brave men and women of \nour military.\n  Each and every member of our military is part of an American family. \nThey are about to make tremendous sacrifices and undertake great risks. \nThey need to know that the United States of America is with them, and \nthat we owe them a debt of gratitude. But the military does not need \njust our words; they need our help. We must support them not only with \nwords but with deeds. That means to ensure our troops have the best \ntraining and the best equipment we can provide.\n  We also need to stand up for American families, for the military \nfamilies who are facing long separations and terrible worries about the \nsafety of their loved ones. While they worry about their spouses \noverseas, they do not need to be facing financial worries at home. \nAmerica needs to make sure these families do not face financial \nhardship.\n  With our U.S. military overseas, their spouses should not be worried \nabout counting pennies. Their spouses should not have to worry about \ngoing on food stamps. Their spouses should not have to, as the Guard \nand Reserve is being called up, worry about if they are going to have \nto go through their savings and their family's college accounts. So \nwhile we are talking about tax cuts for Joe Billionaire, let us make \nsure we do not forget GI Joe and GI Jane. We need to remember them not \nonly with parades, but we need to remember them in the Federal \ncheckbook and we need to remember them in the Federal Tax Code. We need \nto get behind those troops and use this budget and other actions we \nwill be taking up to support our troops.\n\n  Let's not forget why we are at this point. The fault lies squarely \nwith Saddam Hussein. For the last 12 years, he has ignored U.N. \nresolutions and embargoes while rebuilding his illegal chemical and \nbiological weapons. U.N. Resolution 1441 gave Saddam a final \nopportunity to come clean and destroy his prohibited weapons and to \nfully report to the U.N. He continues to ignore that. He is dangerous \nand duplicitous. He needs to be disarmed.\n  Americans have differing views on how best to do this. Saddam is a \ndanger to the world; therefore, the world should share the burden of \ndefanging him. The risks and consequences of acting alone are much \ngreater than they would be from multilateral action. The risks to our \ntroops are greater, and the challenge in postconflict Iraq will be \ngreater if other nations do not share the burden.\n  That is why, during the debate, I voted against unilateral action but \nvoted for Senator Levin's amendment to demand that Iraq disarm and to \nauthorize the use of multinational force if Iraq refused to comply, and \nto do this through the United Nations. Once we gave unilateral \nauthority to the President, I believe it let the international \ncommunity off the hook. Why would members of the U.N. Security Council \nmake any tough decisions? They did not have to. They knew we would go \nit alone. Why would they stand up and make tough decisions and take \ntough actions? They did not have to. They knew we would go it alone. I \nbelieve by authorizing unilateral action, the Senate actually weakened \nthe negotiating position of our President and the Secretary of State at \nthe U.N. Why would other countries send their troops in harm's way if \nAmerica was ready to do it without them? Unfortunately, this is what \nhas happened.\n  The U.N. refused to act, and the United States is now poised to act \nalone with a modest coalition of the willing. We cannot let this be the \nend of diplomacy. The President must continue to work with other \nnations to expand that coalition of the willing so that the dangers of \nwar are shared along with the cost. He needs to go back to the U.N. to \nshare the responsibility and the economic cost of rebuilding Iraq. I \nknow we will face a significant humanitarian crisis, and we already are \nfacing significant humanitarian need in the United States of America. \nWhile we are going to talk about rebuilding Baghdad, we cannot end up \npaying the whole bill ourselves. Because while we rebuild Baghdad, I \nhave to worry about rebuilding Baltimore, and Salisbury, and other \ncommunities.\n  I face a budget, as an appropriator, that is skimpy, spartan, and \ntakes it out on public housing residents and shrinks opportunity at the \nvery time we want to be able to go it alone.\n  The President has made his choice. We are going to support the \ndecision of the United States of America. We are going to support our \ntroops. Let's support our troops in the budget. When we take a look at \nthe budget, let's take a patriotic pause, and make sure we can afford \nnot only to be a world power and stand up for America but make sure we \nhave a budget where we stand up for what America stands for: \nEmpowerment, hope, and opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from \nMaryland for her statement and for the values expressed in that \nstatement.\n  I think we have reached a critical moment. We have 250,000 troops \npoised on the border with Iraq. There are a number of additional troops \nfrom the U.K. Other nations may be involved, as well. There is no \nprovision for the cost of this conflict in the budget.\n  It does strike me as the better part of wisdom to say we ought to \nlimit any additional measures that add to the deficit by either \nspending or tax cuts, with the two exceptions I have noted before. On \nthe spending side, certainly we would exempt national defense and \nhomeland security. On the tax side, we would be wise to exempt the \nfunds for a stimulus package in 2003 and 2004. Beyond that, we would \nrequire a supermajority vote that adds to deficits when we are on the \nbrink of conflict, the cost of which has not been quantified.\n  That is what my amendment is about. I hope as we move closer to the \ntime toward a vote on that amendment, our colleagues will give \nthoughtful consideration to what I have offered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment of \nthe Senator from North Dakota. Though cloaked in the arcane language of \na Budget Act point of order, the goal of the amendment is clear and \nimportant. The amendment says that this Congress should not pass new \nspending or new tax cuts until we have adequately budgeted for the war.\n  The Conrad amendment contains exceptions for spending on national \nsecurity, homeland security, or stimulative tax cuts with no budgetary \neffect after 2005. But beyond those essential measures, Congress could \nnot pass any of our new policy initiatives--not Democratic or \nRepublican initiatives--not new entitlement programs or new tax cuts--\nuntil we are sure we have the resources to fund the war we will almost \ncertainly begin this week.\n  It is amazing that we even have to have this debate. It will be even \nmore unbelievable if this amendment fails. The budget is our spending \nblueprint for the next fiscal year. It lays out our spending and tax \npriorities. Yet nowhere in the budget are there funds allocated for \nmilitary action in Iraq, for recovery after the war, for the foreign \naid promised to our allies, for increased protection domestically from \nretaliatory terrorist attacks. Not a dime.\n  Is that because the supporters of this budget don't want to pay for \nthe costs of fighting the war in Iraq? Of course not. I am confident \nthat every member of Congress fully supports our troops as they deploy \noverseas. The President will send us a bill for the war and the \nresulting increases in homeland security, and Congress will pay it--\npromptly and fully.\n  So why is it not in the budget? One simple reason. The authors of \nthis budget want an enormous tax cut: $1.4 billion in tax cuts--most of \nwhich will benefit upper income tax payers--over the next 10 years. \nHalf of those cuts are even given our special, fast track treatment \nthrough the reconciliation process. The authors also want to show a \nbalanced budget within the next decade. And they do that by cutting \ndomestic spending, including defense. The largest cuts come in the last \n5 years of the budget.\n  But if we figure in the costs of the war, the after-war Iraq \nrestoration, and increased homeland security, there's no way our budget \nwill balance in 10, or even 20, years. There is no way we can afford \nthe war we are all already committed to fund and an enormous tax cut. \nNo way.\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\n  It is irresponsible to commit to unnecessary, enormous tax giveaways \nat a time our scarce resources might be needed to fight a war. In the \nname of responsible budgeting--in the name of sane budgeting--shouldn't \nwe at least delay the tax cuts until we have a better idea of what the \nwar will cost?\n  The American people are willing to sacrifice for war--especially \nthose who are leaving their families and homes to fight in a foreign \nland. Shouldn't we be willing to sacrifice as well? Shouldn't we give \nup these ridiculous budget games and do our jobs. In my mind, that \nmeans making sure our troops have adequate funds to successfully win \nthe war in Iraq, that our country is safe from terrorist attacks, and \nthat our debt doesn't grow so large that it strangles growth and \nopportunity for future generations.\n  The Conrad amendment will help us write a budget that is \nresponsible--to our troops overseas, to our families at home, and to \nthe future generations who count on us to leave their country better \noff than we inherited it. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I have worked with the two managers of the bill and the two \nleaders, and it appears that we will be able to have two back-to-back \nvotes around 5 p.m. today. The staff is in the process of preparing a \nwritten announcement. There very likely will be two votes on two \nseparate amendments at or about 5 o'clock today.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following a \npoint of order against the Conrad amendment No. 264, Senator Conrad be \nrecognized in order to make a motion to waive relative to his amendment \nand that the amendment and the motion then be temporarily set aside; \nprovided further that Senator Conrad be recognized in order to offer an \namendment, the text of which is at the desk, and that the time until 5 \no'clock be equally divided in relation to the amendment; further, I ask \nthat at 5 o'clock the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nmotion to waive with respect to amendment No. 264, and regardless of \nthe outcome, the Senate then immediately proceed to a vote in relation \nto the second Conrad amendment. Also, no second-degree amendments be in \norder prior to the above amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the pending amendment, No. 264, \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, proposes to \ncreate a new point of order prohibiting the consideration of certain \nspending and tax measures until the President sends information \nregarding the costs of the war. The language is not germane to the \nmeasure now before the Senate; therefore, I raise an objection under \nsection 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the two managers of the bill allow 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the second vote?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the agreement be modified to \nthat effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 266\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 266.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To redirect $1.214 trillion in revenues that would have been \n   lost by implementing the President's entire tax cut

Mr. President, I know the Senator from Texas has been \nwaiting patiently. I will recognize the Senator from Texas for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee on which I had the honor of serving for his work on \nthis budget resolution and for his leadership on the Budget Committee. \nMy compliments as well to the ranking member, Senator Conrad, for the \ncivil but spirited way in which the committee debated the markup of \nthis budget resolution.\n  I believe the budget resolution we have before us represents the \npriorities of the Federal Government and, more importantly, of the \nAmerican people. I rise today to discuss some fundamental questions \nwhich I believe are important to this debate, and to address arguments \nthat have been made in support of spending more of the taxpayers' money \nin the name of fiscal restraint, as odd as that may sound, and at the \nsame time to talk about cutting deficits.\n  As many of my colleagues on the committee and here on the floor, I \nsupport this budget resolution, including the President's jobs and \ngrowth package. I believe it can make a real difference, not only to my \nState of Texas but to the Nation. I believe, if we hold to our \nprinciples and our priorities, we can assure that the needs of the \nNation are met and help our economy grow.\n  If we are successful, we can help prevent future generations from \nbeing saddled with the bill for excessive spending that some in this \nbody seem determined to create. Over what remains of the 50 hours \nallotted under the Congressional Budget Act under this debate, many \namendments will be offered and have already been offered that reduce \nthe amount of the President's growth package. If that were not enough, \nmany of those who want to cut tax relief want to turn around and spend \nwhat would have been tax relief on bigger government. Rather than allow \nAmerican taxpayers to choose how they want to spend their hard-earned \nmoney, those who would seek to cut tax relief and increase spending \nwant to choose for the American people how that money should be spent \nand grow Government ever larger.\n  The fundamental question in this debate is simple: Should we support \nhigher taxes, more Federal spending, and bigger government or should we \nfacilitate economic opportunity and jobs? For me, that is what this \ndebate is all about. Who should spend that money: politicians and \nbureaucrats or taxpayers? Families or the Government? Small business \nowners on investment and job creation or the Federal Government? Senior \ncitizens on enhancing their retirement security or the Federal \nGovernment?\n  This debate is really about who we should trust to get done the job \nof growing our economy and creating greater economic opportunity for \nall Americans. Should we help people keep more of their money so they \ncan spend it, invest it, or save it as they wish or should we simply \nadd more taxes to an already beleaguered American taxpayer, giving up \non economic growth and increasing the deficit?\n  I urge my colleagues, don't be fooled. This debate is not about \nshrinking deficits. It is about growing spending.\n  The first chart to which I would like to direct my colleagues is one \nthat demonstrates a rather dramatic fact; that is, over the last couple \nof years we have seen spending soar, while Government revenues have \nshrunk. In fact, revenues have fallen by nearly 9 percent over the last \n2 years. At the same time, though, Congress has seemed not to have even \nnoticed because spending has increased by 12 percent over that same \nperiod.\n\n  We all agree on the need to control deficits. Our friends on the \nother side of the aisle contend that allowing more people to keep what \nthey themselves earned would, in fact, balloon the deficit. I disagree. \nIt is not spending by taxpayers that balloons deficits; it is spending \nby Congress, as this chart dramatically represents.\n  If you listen to this debate closely, you will notice that opponents \nof the President's growth package and this budget resolution do not \npropose that we pay down the debt instead of tax relief. They, in fact, \npropose spending hundreds of billions of dollars instead of tax relief \nand this growth package. They want to spend every penny of what would \nbe relief to taxpayers and an investment in economic growth on \nsomething else altogether.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle, and on the other side of this \nissue, seem to be concerned about deficits when there is a proposal to \nprovide relief to the beleaguered American taxpayer. They spend hours \non the Senate floor and in committee rooms warning\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\nthat taxpayers keeping more of what they earned is a risky proposition.\n  We have heard all that before and it still does not wash. Notice \ncarefully that they are not shy about spending more of the taxpayers' \nmoney, even if that spending causes the very same deficits they \ncomplain about here on the floor. In fact, despite the deficit, despite \na sluggish economy, despite the costs of waging war and rebuilding our \nmilitary, many of our colleagues want to increase discretionary \nspending but not just on the Department of Defense and on homeland \nsecurity. That funding is already provided for in this budget \nresolution. The money that should flow back to the taxpayers will, if \nour colleagues who oppose this resolution are successful, flow instead \nto more and more Government spending.\n\n  The next chart I show to my colleagues is a list of Budget Committee \namendments to what was ultimately voted out as the budget resolution. \nEach of these amendments failed. But as you can see, this chart, I \nbelieve, is an indicator of what those who oppose this budget \nresolution propose instead.\n  For example, here is one amendment for an additional $2.2 billion. \nYou can see the figure of $200 billion more for Medicare, an additional \n$1.8 billion for function 700 for veterans, another for increased \nspending on natural resources--all of which are provided for, to some \nextent, in the budget resolution that was voted out of committee. But \nyou can see from the chart the total of these amendments would have \nadded, if they were not defeated, approximately $440 billion in new \nspending.\n  That is why I say those who complain so loudly about budget deficits \nbut at the same time propose huge increases of hundreds of billions of \ndollars in new Federal spending really do not have their story \nstraight. Because, of course, if we do not cut spending, and if we do \nnot see the economy grow, that means less hope and less opportunity for \nAmerican workers. And that means more taxes for the beleaguered \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  My question is simply this: Why shouldn't the Government be required \nto do what American families have to do during lean times? Why \nshouldn't the Government have to tighten its belt in lean times?\n  Indeed, the growth of Government continues, but the economic recovery \nwill not under these tax-and-spend proposals. Shared sacrifice, which \nis what is called for during lean times, is not shared, at least by the \nAmerican taxpayers, if they continue to see nondiscretionary increases \nin spending with no end in sight.\n  I support the President's growth package as recommended in this \nresolution because I believe individuals and families in my State and \nacross America, the people who pay the taxes and earn the money, can \nbetter save, spend, and invest their money as they see fit--far better \nthan can the Federal Government. I believe Texans know better what they \nneed than the spenders in the Halls of Congress.\n  According to the latest Scripps Howard Texas poll, the people of my \nState are worried about not having enough money for their retirement, \nabout skyrocketing energy prices, and about college tuition for our \nchildren. They are worried about the issues that affect their lives \ndirectly.\n  The President's jobs-and-growth plan addresses these concerns by \nproviding a short-term economic stimulus that will encourage investment \nand job growth, as well as strengthening our long-term economic growth. \nThe President's plan will create more wealth, provide higher wages and \nmore jobs, thereby leaving more money for families, while increasing \ntheir standard of living.\n  As for the argument that this proposal would cause greater deficits, \nI disagree. If we were to hold the line on new spending, if we were \nresponsible with the taxpayers' money--the money they send to \nWashington every year--and if we make the most out of the revenues we \nhave by following the limits set out in this budget resolution, then we \nwill prevent growing deficits and extinguish this deficit entirely in \nthe foreseeable future.\n  It is only by spending beyond our means that we create deficits. Last \nyear's failure to pass a budget resolution is a clear example of the \nfailure to act, the failure to set important guidelines for the Federal \nbudget. The failure of last year's Senate leadership to accomplish what \nwe are now doing on the Senate floor meant the Senate had few \nguidelines to follow, few limits on spending, and no responsibility, at \nleast within the constraints of a budget resolution, to control \nboundless spending by the Government.\n\n  Let's recall a little bit of history that revisionist historians both \nin this body and outside seem to forget.\n  The chart I have in the chamber shows, of course, what we all \nremember; that is, at the time President Bush came into office, we saw \na tremendous trend downward in terms of the growth of our gross \ndomestic product. And, of course, we have seen a tremendous decline in \nthe stock market. It has really only been by virtue of the tax cuts \nthat were passed in 2001--which would be made permanent--that we see \nincreased money in consumers' pockets, money they have been able to use \nto buy a car, to buy a house, in conjunction with lower interest rates. \nThat is what has kept the meager recovery we have seen as good as it \nhas been.\n  Of course, the economic recovery was staggered by the events of 9/11 \nand, of course, the continuing war against terrorism and, obviously, \nthe uncertainty associated with the geopolitical situation in the \nMiddle East.\n  As a result, our economy has been sluggish and investor confidence \nremains low. GDP has grown at an anemic rate, while the labor market \nhas remained soft, with an unemployment rate in February of 5.8 \npercent.\n  To address the economic challenges that confront our Nation and \nconfront America's families, the President proposed, and I support, and \nthis budget resolution reflects, a jobs-and-growth package. This \npackage will spur near-term and long-term economic growth. It will \nprovide an opportunity for more robust business investment and, yes, it \nwill encourage new job growth.\n  His proposal, which this budget resolution includes, would first \naccelerate to January 2003 portions of the tax bill that was passed by \nthis body in 2001 that are currently scheduled to be phased in, \nincluding a reduction in marginal income tax rates, additional relief \nfrom the marriage penalty, a larger tax credit for children, and \nincreasing the size of the 10-percent income tax bracket. The net \neffect of these proposals is allowing taxpayers to keep more of what \nthey earn, so they can spend it as they see fit.\n  Who benefits? Well, obviously, the individual taxpayer. But just as \nimportantly, small business owners, including sole proprietors and \npartnerships, most of whom report and pay taxes on their personal \nincome tax returns.\n  This plan will increase the incentives for small business owners to \ninvest in technology, machinery, and other equipment to help them \nexpand and create jobs, and reduce the cost of capital needed to help \nsmall businesses grow. And, of course, as a result, people who are \nlooking for work, who want to work but cannot find a job, will benefit, \ntoo.\n  As the President has stated:\n\n       [M]ore than two-thirds of taxpayers who pay the highest \n     marginal tax rates are small business owners who include \n     their profits when they file their individual tax returns \n     with the IRS.\n       All together, the tax relief I propose will give 23 million \n     small business owners an average tax cut of $2,042 this year. \n     And I'm asking Congress to make those reductions permanent, \n     so that America's entrepreneurs can plan for the future, add \n     more employees, and invest in our economy.\n\n  Those were the words of the President of the United States when he \nmade this proposal. Again, it translates into a single word, and that \nword is ``jobs.''\n  Under this proposal, this budget resolution, a married couple with \ntwo children and an income of $40,000 will see their income tax reduced \nby $1,133, a 96-percent decline; an older couple with an income of \n$40,000 will see their taxes reduced by 41 percent; a married couple \nwith one child and an income of $40,000 will see their taxes decline by \n33 percent; a married couple with two children and an income of $60,000 \nwill see their taxes decline by 24 percent; and a married couple with \ntwo children who earn $75,000 between them will see their taxes reduced \nby 19 percent.\n  I also want to address briefly that portion of the budget resolution \nthat eliminates the double taxation of corporate income such that \ndividend income will no longer be taxed at the individual level.\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\n  As the chairman of the Budget Committee has pointed out earlier, \nAmerican taxpayers pay some of the highest taxes in the world--second \nonly to Japan, I believe, on corporate dividends. Under current law, \ndividends can be taxed once at the corporate level and up to the \nhighest tax bracket for individual taxpayers, once those dividends are \npaid by a corporation to its shareholders. That is more than any nation \nin Western Europe.\n  Under the President's proposal--which is only fair--those dividends \nwill be taxed once and not twice. There are numerous economic benefits \nto the economy, and I really believe this is one of the most important \naspects of this growth package. The first effect will be to lower the \ncost of capital. This will make new investments in technology and \nequipment more attractive to firms while providing investors with \nlarger after-tax returns. For individual taxpayers and families, this \nmeans more money to spend, save, or further invest. For companies, as \nindividuals invest more, increasing the amount of capital available in \nthe capital markets, worker productivity will increase, real wages will \nrise, and more jobs will be created.\n  This proposal will also--not incidentally--remove the current bias \ntoward debt financing.\n  As Alan Greenspan said in testimony before the House Financial \nServices Committee in February:\n\n       In my judgment, the elimination of double taxation will be \n     helpful to everybody. . . . There is no question that this \n     particular program will be, net, a benefit to virtually \n     everyone in the economy over the long run, and that's one of \n     the reasons I strongly support it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 20 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the chairman for 2 or 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield an additional 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My thanks to Senator Nickles.\n  Finally, I want to point out that 45 percent of those who earn \n$50,000 a year or less--many of whom are seniors--will benefit from \nthis ability to enhance and secure their retirement years. It will also \nboost the stock market and the value of hundreds of thousands of \nretirement plans, as corporations that don't currently pay dividends \nchoose to do so because of the elimination of the bias against payment \nof corporate dividends in our Tax Code, and grow the stock market value \nin all likelihood, and, as I say, help secure the retirement of \nAmerican workers.\n\n  Finally, this budget resolution increases to $75,000 the amount small \nbusinesses may expense from taxable income in the year that investment \noccurs. This incentive to further investment by small businesses--which \ncreate the vast majority of jobs in our country--will help lower the \ntax-adjusted cost of capital for small business, the ``job factory of \nAmerica,'' as the President has called it. This increases the ability \nof small businesses to make new purchases, invest in new equipment, \nhire new workers, or retain current ones. That is more jobs and more \ngrowth.\n  In conclusion, while the Congressional Budget Office has scored this \nproposal by the President, this growth package, in a static way, both \nsides of the aisle recognize--indeed, one of the Democratic \nalternatives to the President's proposal embraces the concept--a \nstimulus effect and growth effect by tax cuts.\n  PriceWaterhouseCoopers, for example, has reported that the \nPresident's growth package would increase the number of jobs by an \naverage of 1.2 million a year during the first 5 years and an average \nof 900,000 per year over 10 years, and that the proposal would add $738 \nbillion in new income to the economy during the first 5 years and about \n$1.5 trillion over 10 years, and other private sector estimates are \neven higher.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the jobs \nand growth plan will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about growing jobs, about putting \nthis economy back on track, and if we are serious about the need to \nrestrain massive Government spending, then we must get serious about \nsetting these priorities in our budget blueprint. Let's not just talk \nabout preventing deficits while at the same time calling for more \nspending. Let's not decry a plan that benefits the economy by \nbenefiting taxpayers and call for that money instead to be spent by \nGovernment. Let's, instead, set limits and stick by them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Daschle, Senator Feingold, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Corzine \nappear as cosponsors of my amendment which is currently pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes to \nrespond to my able colleague, the Senator from Texas, who is a member \nof the Budget Committee. He has suggested that on our side we are just \nout here spending money as much as they have proposed in tax cuts; so \nit is either take the Democrats' spending or the Republicans' tax cuts, \nand here come the deficits, and don't worry about the future of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. I could not disagree more strongly.\n  Facts are stubborn. The facts show that the assertion by the Senator \nfrom Texas simply is without merit. Democrats are not proposing \nadditional spending at the size of the tax cuts proposed on the other \nside--nothing close to it.\n  The Senator presented a chart that showed a series of amendments \noffered in the Budget Committee by our side, totaling $440 billion--\nadditional money for prescription drugs, for education, and for \nhomeland security. Yes, we offered amendments to reprioritize, but we \npaid for each of those by reducing the tax cut, and every time we went \nfurther to reduce the budget deficits.\n  Remember, their tax cuts are $1.4 trillion; with the interest cost, \n$1.7 trillion. So even if our amendments to change the priorities--more \nin line with the American people--had been adopted, we would still have \nbeen more than a trillion dollars better off in terms of the deficits \nand debt of this country. That is a fact.\n  The other side is proposing to borrow the money to give these tax \ncuts and to finance the spending initiatives that are in their plans. \nThey are going to be borrowing money as far as the eye can see--and \nright on the eve of the retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Many of us on our side, and I also acknowledge a number on their \nside, believe that is a mistake. Senator McCain talked this morning \nabout the fact that he thought adding spending or tax cuts at this \npoint is ill-advised. I must say, I agree with the Senator from \nArizona.\n  More than that, our colleague is suggesting that somehow their plan \nreduces deficits. No, it does not. It explodes deficits. We are going \nto have a debate out here. Let's be truthful with each other and \ntruthful with the American people. Their plan does not reduce deficits; \ntheir plan explodes deficits.\n  Two years ago, we had projected surpluses of $5.6 trillion. If we now \nadopt the President's spending and tax cut plans, instead we will have \n$2.1 trillion of deficits. Those are not my numbers. Those are the \nnumbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  Where did the money go, because that is money over a 10-year period? \nThirty-eight percent is going to tax cuts under the President's plan, \nthose already passed and those proposed. That is where the money is \ngoing. Twenty-seven percent has gone to spending. Where is that \nspending? Almost exclusively in increases for defense and homeland \nsecurity which the President asked for, quite rightly, and which we \nsupported, again, quite rightly. Twenty-six percent is technical \nchanges which simply means overestimations of revenue apart from the \ntax cuts. The models are not giving the correct answers in terms of \nactual revenue generated for various levels of economic activity. About \n9 percent is the economic downturn.\n  When our colleagues suggest they have a plan that is going to \neliminate deficits, that the President's plan somehow does, it does \nnot. We are required by law to exclude Social Security from the \ncalculation of deficits. When we do that, the deficit in 2004 under the \nPresident's plan is going to be $512 billion, and those deficits never\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\nget below $400 billion every year for the next 10 years. What are they \ntalking about they have a plan that is going to eliminate deficits? \nThere is no elimination of deficits; there is no end to deficits under \nthis plan that the President has put before us.\n  This is from his own budget document. You do not have to take my word \nfor it, take his word for it. This is right out of his budget document, \npage 43, ``Analytical Perspectives.'' This is what happens, according \nto the President, looking long term, and what it shows is we are in the \n``sweet'' spot now. We are in the good times because this is when the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds are producing hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of surpluses. This year alone, the Social Security \nsurplus will be $160 billion. They are taking it all, every penny. And \nunder the President's plan, they are going to do that the entire next \ndecade. Every penny of Social Security surplus will go to pay for tax \ncuts and other spending.\n  Some of us think that is a disaster for this country. Why? Because \nvery soon the baby boomers are going to start to retire, and then what \nare we going to do? We should be taking that money and paying down debt \nor prepaying the liability but not using it to pay other bills, not \nusing it to pay for tax cuts.\n  If there was a private sector firm in America that tried to take the \nexpenses, they would be headed for a Federal institution, but it would \nnot be the Congress of the United States, and it would not be the White \nHouse. They would be headed for a Federal facility all right. It would \nbe a Federal prison because that is fraud.\n\n  Let's just get down and get honest about the fiscal circumstances of \nthe country. The President's budget says we never get out of deficit \nunder his plan, and, in fact, if we adopt his spending plan, if we \nadopt his tax plan, the deficits explode right at the time we see an \nexplosion of expense to the Federal Government because of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, the cost of the President's tax \ncuts explode, and we have a sea of red ink and deficits and debt that \nare utterly unsustainable.\n  The head of the Congressional Budget Office told us last year that if \nwe proceed down this path, we will have massive debt, massive tax \nincreases, tax increases of as much as 50 percent, massive cuts in \nbenefits in Social Security and Medicare. Let me predict today, if the \nPresident's plan is adopted or anything close to it, very soon our \ncolleagues on the other side will be coming to us with massive cuts in \nMedicare and Social Security, and if anyone doubts it, just look at the \nHouse budget offered this year. They have already started it. They have \nover $470 billion of cuts to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, \nand over $200 billion of cuts to domestic discretionary spending, law \nenforcement, and all the rest.\n  The jig is going to be up because this does not add up, and this plan \ndrives this country deep into deficits and debt, and that is a fact. \nThat is according to the President's own calculations, his own budget \ndocuments. This is not a question that is even a close call as to \nwhether the plan before us increases deficits or reduces them. It \ndramatically increases them, and it is going to get much worse when the \nbaby boomers start to retire.\n  I was glad to see our colleague put up a chart that showed total \noutlays and total revenues. It is the relationship between outlays and \nrevenues that determines deficits. Our friends on the other side, or at \nleast some of them, seem to think the only thing that creates a deficit \nis spending. No, no, no. It is the relationship between revenue and \nspending that determines whether you have a deficit or a surplus. It is \nwhen spending exceeds revenue that one runs a deficit. That is a very \nsimple concept, but somehow it has been lost. That is what creates a \ndeficit.\n  This chart shows the long-term pattern of spending and revenue over \nthe last 20 years. This goes back to 1981. The blue line is the revenue \nline. The red line is the spending line. You can see we had a big gap \nback in 1981, 1982. These were the Reagan years. In fact, I will put up \nwhat the history of deficits has been under these various \nadministrations.\n  Here it is: When President Reagan came into office, deficits were \nrunning about $80 billion. He then pursued the economic policy that is \nbeing repeated today, and deficits exploded to over $200 billion a \nyear. They improved marginally before the first President Bush took \noffice, and then they got much worse. In fact, we had the past record \ndeficit under the previous President Bush, $290 billion. President \nClinton came in, and we passed a plan in 1993 that every single \nRepublican opposed--everyone in the House, everyone in the Senate. They \nsaid it would crater the economy. We can go back and look now. It is \nvery easy to determine who had it right and who had it wrong.\n  Our Republican friends said in 1993: If you pass this plan, it will \ncrater the economy. It will increase deficits. It will increase debt. \nIt will increase unemployment. Let's check the record.\n  We passed the plan in 1993. Every single year of that 5-year plan the \ndeficits were decreased. During this period, we kicked off the longest \neconomic expansion in our Nation's history, the lowest unemployment in \n30 years, the lowest inflation in 30 years, and the highest level of \nbusiness investment in our Nation's history.\n  In 1997, we then passed a bipartisan plan in which we joined together \nand finished the job and pulled this Nation completely out of deficit \nand actually stopped the raid on the Social Security trust fund.\n  We stopped taking Social Security trust funds and using them for \nother purposes, and that was the combined effect of the 1993 plan and \nthe 1997 plan. Actually, the 1993 plan did about 80 percent of the \nheavy lifting. Then President Bush came into office proposing massive \ntax cuts and saying we could have it all. He said we could pass the tax \ncuts and we did not need to worry about deficits, that he had enough \nmargin to be assured that, even if the economy weakened, deficits would \nnot return.\n  Well, he was proved to be wrong, not just because of the tax cuts. \nLet's be fair. Let's be direct. It is a combination that led us back \ninto the swamp of deficits. In the short term, the biggest effects were \nthe economic slowdown and the attack on this country which required us \nto increase defense spending and homeland security spending. But over \nthe longer term, over the 10 years of the Bush plan, the biggest \nreason, as I have indicated, was the size of the tax cuts. It is the \nbiggest single reason for our fiscal deterioration, not in the short \nterm, not in 2003, not in 2002. The biggest reasons in the short term \nwere the economic slowdown and the attack on the country, without \nquestion, but over the 10 years of his plan, the biggest culprit is the \ntax cuts, driving us deep into deficit.\n  These numbers do not even tell the full story because, in truth, the \nfull story is much more serious than these numbers reveal. The truth \nis, this does not show the effect of taking Social Security trust fund \nmoney every year for the next 10 years, in total more than $2.7 \ntrillion of Social Security money taken.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to see a former colleague, Senator \nMack, join us on the floor. He was an outstanding colleague, who we \nenjoyed serving with very much, truly a gentleman and somebody who we \nmiss in this Chamber. Nobody did more to add an air of civility to this \nChamber than our colleague Senator Mack, and we are delighted to see \nhim back.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think he was wanting to speak on the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No doubt he would if he still were a Member of the \nChamber.\n  Let me now turn my attention to the presentation of the amendment \nthat is the next one for consideration because it goes to the central \nquestion that we have been talking about. What are we going to do about \nthese deficits?\n  Let me say to my Republican colleagues, it is important to focus on \nspending, but we cannot just focus on spending. We have to focus on the \nrevenue side as well. And my colleagues cannot say they care about \ndeficits when they are adopting a budget that is going to cost $1.7 \ntrillion in tax cuts and the associated interest costs that are going \nto drive us deeper into deficit and make believe they care about \ndeficits. That dog will not hunt.\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\n  Now, we are going to give our colleagues another opportunity to face \nup to these long-term obligations that we face as a country because the \namendment I am offering now takes $1.2 trillion in the tax cuts and \nredirects them to a reserve fund to strengthen Social Security. Instead \nof raiding $2.7 trillion, we are going to reduce it. We are going to \nreduce the tax cut by $1.2 trillion, and we are going to apply it, not \nfor spending but to strengthen Social Security.\n\n  This is a vote for history. This is a vote for the ages. This is a \nvote that people are going to look back on, years ahead, and say, who \nstood up to protect Social Security and who wanted to take the money \nraised with payroll tax dollars and use it for a tax cut that goes \nprimarily to the wealthiest among us? That is the question before us.\n  I hope every Member of this Chamber will say we ought to reduce the \ntax cut and use that money to strengthen Social Security. That still \nleaves almost $200 billion available in tax cuts--actually, something \nless than that. With that amount of money, we could provide a short-\nterm stimulus along the lines offered by Senator Daschle, a plan that \nprovides important tax relief for working families and small \nbusinesses, or we could choose to accelerate the marriage penalty \nrelief and the increase in the child tax credit that were scheduled to \nbe phased in over a period of years when they were enacted in 2001, or \nwe could accelerate the across-the-board tax rate cuts now scheduled to \noccur in 2004 and 2006. We concluded that was the best way to stimulate \nthe economy. Or we could provide protection for individuals from the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  My amendment would not prevent us from providing a significant \nincrease in the amount of investment small businesses could immediately \ndeduct rather than depreciating over a number of years.\n  The bottom line is that the amount provided for stimulus in our \namendment would allow for considerable flexibility in responding both \nto the needs of our economy and of our taxpayers. My amendment does not \ndictate how these resources ought to be used to strengthen the Social \nSecurity Program over the long term. Rather, our amendment simply \nreserves budget resources so that when Congress does act to strengthen \nSocial Security, resources will be available to do it.\n  Nearly every Social Security reform plan that has been proposed \nrequires additional resources. In fact, the plans recommended by the \nPresident's own commission to strengthen Social Security requires over \na trillion dollars of resources from the general fund.\n  There are a variety of ways that these resources could be used to \nstrengthen the Social Security Program. Some of our colleagues might \nprefer to use these resources to pre-fund the Social Security benefit \nthrough individual accounts or collective investments. Others might \nsupport using these resources to transfer revenues to the Social \nSecurity trust funds or to pay down debt and free up future resources \nto meet benefit commitments. Until Congress and the President act to \nstrengthen this important program, the resources in this reserve fund \nwould be dedicated to deficit reduction.\n  Why is this amendment important? Today, we are at an important fiscal \ncrossroads. I think we all know where we are headed. We are in record \ndeficit, and according to the President's own documents, these are the \ngood times. This is the budget sweet spot. We are ready for a leap off \nthe cliff if the proposal before us by the President is adopted.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a close look at this amendment. We \nknow that Social Security goes cash negative, the trust funds, in 2018. \nWe know that Medicare goes cash negative in 2013 and becomes insolvent \nby 2026. We know these challenges are real. They are not projections. \nThe baby boom generation has been born. They are alive today. They are \neligible for Social Security and Medicare.\n  If we put up the chart that shows the future of Social Security, we \nsee that the trust fund now is running substantial surpluses, but they \nturn to massive deficits after 2018. This is going to happen, and we \ncan either prepare for it or fail to do so. The choice is ours, and the \nmost fundamental choice is going to be made very soon. It is going to \nbe made when we determine the outlines of this budget resolution.\n  It is not just Social Security; it is Medicare as well. The Medicare \ntrust fund is running surpluses now but will turn to massive cash \ndeficits starting in 2013.\n  The question before us is, How do we respond? The CBO Director, Dan \nCrippen, said to us:\n\n       Put more starkly, Mr. Chairman, the extremes of what will \n     be required to address our retirement are these: We will have \n     to increase borrowing by very large, likely unsustainable \n     amounts; raise taxes to 30 percent of GDP, obviously \n     unprecedented in our history; or eliminate most of the rest \n     of Government as we know it. That is the dilemma that faces \n     us in the long run, Mr. Chairman, and these next 10 years \n     will only be the beginning.\n\n  Unfortunately, he has it right. What the President has proposed is \ntruly stunning in terms of the long-term costs of the tax cuts he has \nproposed.\n  This chart shows the Social Security shortfall, according to the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, some $4 trillion in the 75-year \nperiod; medicare shortfall, $5 trillion. The tax cuts the President \nproposed and which have already been enacted are $12 trillion.\n  We can take a bad situation and make it much worse or we can begin \nthe process of being serious about our fiscal challenges. That means \nyes, being tough on spending. It also means being tough on the size of \nfuture tax cuts.\n  I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent my colleague, Senator Corzine, be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I note the last comment about discipline with respect to \nspending. It is the case that the amendment the Senator offered not \nonly has a pause with respect to tax cuts but also on the spending \nside, is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the amendment I offered earlier that we will be \nvoting on at 5 o'clock. We are now on my second amendment, an amendment \nthat takes $1.2 trillion of the proposed tax cut and uses it to \nstrengthen Social Security. It is absolutely correct that the other \namendment I have offered would create a requirement to a supermajority \nvote to have new spending initiatives, as well as new tax cuts, other \nthan spending for national defense and homeland security and other than \nfor tax cuts that would provide for an immediate lift to the economy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, I was not aware you \nhad gone to the second amendment.\n  The first amendment, which I intend to support, has a pause with \nrespect both to spending and a tax cut in the name of fiscal sanity to \ntry to resolve massive deficits in the outyears.\n  The Senator makes the same point, in many ways, with respect to the \nSocial Security amendment as we get into the period of time when the \nwar babies, the largest baby class in American history, begin to \nretire. The explosion of costs in Social Security to meet those demands \nwill cause us to have serious shortfalls unless we plan for it now. It \nis precisely the reason we have a so-called ``surplus'' in Social \nSecurity each year. It is not truly surplus. It is to be put away in a \ntrust fund and used for that period of time when we need it when we \nhave maximum strength on the Social Security.\n  If I may make an additional comment. The charts make the compelling \ncase that this fiscal policy is completely out of whack. It reminds me \nof the joke about the guy caught stealing who said to the policeman, \nAre you going to believe me or your own eyes?\n  The presentation is so clear that we are headed towards a cliff. We \nbetter stop this one way or the other and find a way to have a pause, \nfind a way to restore some stability and solvency to the Social \nSecurity system.\n  I intend to support both amendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator from North Dakota would reflect on a \nquestion. I think the numbers are we have 37 million seniors 65 and \nolder, and we are on our way to something approaching 75 million in the \nnext 15 years. Do\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nI understand that this amendment you are proposing is designed to make \nsure we begin to prepare for that inevitability, the charges against \nSocial Security, which reduce the poverty rate of seniors in America \nfrom when it was conceived from about 50 percent of all seniors to \nright at 10 percent? Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly correct. We are going to a \ncircumstance in which we will have 77 million senior citizens, more \nthan double what we currently have. This is unprecedented in our \nhistory and perhaps it is one reason we have a hard time coping. It is \nnot something we have ever seen before. Perhaps that is one reason we \nhave a hard time understanding the dimensions of this change.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator from North Dakota would clarify another \nelement of how budget practices work. Presumably payroll taxes, which \neach individual who is working pays into the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds, are designed so that people invest in receiving \nguaranteed benefits--in the case of Social Security--relative to what \nthey expect will be there.\n\n  Is it true, or am I analyzing this properly, that we are now \npotentially, given the kind of framework of the budget outlay before us \ntoday, using payroll taxes that people were expecting to be used to \nbuild up the Social Security trust fund and Medicare trust fund, to be \nmade available to cut taxes, maybe even dividend taxes for those who \nmay be doing well already in society? We are using payroll taxes to \nindirectly fund the tax cuts being proposed or allowed in the budget \nresolution?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Certainly that is the conclusion I come to. We are taking \nthis year alone $160 billion of Social Security trust fund surpluses \nand using it for other purposes. We are not paying down debt with it. \nWe are not prepaying the liability with it. We are not investing it. We \nare taking it to use to fund operating expenses, including other tax \ncuts.\n  Looking ahead under the President's plan over the next 10 years, we \nwill take every penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus. We \nwill not pay down debt with it, we will not prepay the liability, we \nwill not invest it. We will use it to help finance these tax cuts. So \nwe are taking payroll taxes, in part, and using them to fund an income \ntax cut that will go predominantly to the wealthiest among us.\n  Some say to make that comment is class warfare. I don't think it is \nclass warfare. I think it is a fact. You are taking payroll taxes from \npeople and using it to fund income tax cuts for higher income people. \nWhat is most troubling is we are borrowing it all. That is leading us \ninto a very deep deficit-and-debt ditch.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Speaking in the context of what true fiscal responsibility is about, \none needs to make sure the fundamental programs that are accepted by \nthe American people, such as Social Security and Medicare benefits, are \nproperly funded. It certainly strikes me that using the very taxes that \nare supposed to be supportive of those programs to fund tax cuts that \nare going to create deficits for as far as the eye can see is a very \nhard swallow when three out of four Americans pay more in payroll taxes \nthan they actually pay in income taxes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. My colleague from New Jersey is one of the most \nsophisticated investors, one of the most sophisticated financial \nmanagers in America, with a track record that is clear for all to see. \nHe headed one of the most prominent, most successful financial \nmanagement houses in the world, and enjoyed an extraordinary reputation \nthere. When the Senator speaks on the question of the effects of fiscal \npolicy on our economy and the future strength of our economy, I think \npeople would be wise to listen.\n  Is the Senator seeking time?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I would like to make a few comments with regard to the \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support this amendment \nbecause I believe it is so important we understand that fiscal \nresponsibility is really what is at stake. This amendment, more than \nalmost anything that I see, actually addresses the issue of making sure \nwe start to reserve for this great need, Social Security, that the able \nSenator from North Dakota has pointed out we will have to address in \nsubsequent years. It does it by paying down debt now. It really \naddresses this issue of not using our payroll taxes to fund tax cuts \nfor those who are already doing well in society.\n  We are making a very large mistake, as the analysis of the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee showed, with respect to using those \nresources in a way that is going to leave us with budget deficits over \nthe next 10, 12, 13 years. I think that is hard to understand, \nparticularly in the context of Social Security, which has been such a \nsuccessful program in America, one that has reduced the poverty rates \nfor seniors from well over 50 percent to down about 10 percent as we go \nforward.\n  This is one that is very difficult to understand, particularly in the \ncontext of trying to allow room for a dividend exclusion tax for which \nI have difficulty finding support based on the idea that it is going to \nbe stimulus for job growth or, on any objective analytical basis, be \npromotive of the well-being of our economy.\n  One of the places we just turned--everybody has their favorite \neconomist. We just happen to have 10 Nobel Prize-winning economists who \nspoke out on the tax cut plan proposed by President Bush, saying:\n\n       It is not the answer to our problems. Regardless of how one \n     views the specifics of the plan, there is wide agreement on \n     permanent change in the tax structure and not the creation of \n     jobs and growth in the near term.\n\n  I cannot find people who say this proposal is going to do anything to \nturn around the current state of the economy. And what we are doing is \nfinancing it with one of those taxes that is the most heavy burden on \nthose who have the least ability to pay.\n  It strikes me, again--I mentioned three out of four working Americans \npay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes, than they \ncertainly receive with respect to any kind of dividend taxation.\n  This is a very hard swallow--not particularly for the seniors today; \nwe have the resources to fulfill our promises with respect to \nguaranteed benefits for seniors today. But if we do not address this \nproblem with regard to Social Security over the long run, future \ngenerations are not going to have the same guaranteed benefits that \nhave been promised, as they are being committed to as they pay into the \nSocial Security trust fund today. It is a breach of faith. One of the \nthings we need to do is make sure we address it today.\n  Frankly, the President's tax cut over the period of time that we are \nlooking at the solvency of Social Security, on its lowest, it is about \n$12 trillion. That is over 57 years. That will help people evaluate the \nsolvency of Social Security. Right now, it will be able to meet the \nguaranteed benefits out to about 2042, about halfway. Twelve trillion \ndollars, we are eroding the revenues of the Federal Government. Again, \nwe are eroding it by using payroll taxes to fund tax cuts for the very \nbest off in our society. And the obligation of fixing this Social \nSecurity problem is only $3.5 trillion. It sounds like not so much \nmoney, but when you compare it to what we are putting into this tax cut \nthat the President is laying on the table and has allowed for in this \nbudget resolution, it is about three times the size.\n\n  That is what this amendment is about. It is asking us to make those \nsteps where we can begin to extend that solvency and protect Social \nSecurity. By the way, we are paying down the debt at the same time. At \nleast we are limiting the growth of the debt relative to where it would \nbe, which has all the other positive ingredients. The Federal \nGovernment is not in the capital markets of the country competing with \nthe private sector to take capital that they will be borrowing to pay \nfor these tax cuts and other expenditures we make for the overall \nlevels of government involvement in the economy. It is called crowding \nout. It has been a problem at other times in our history. We are \ncreating a format where this will absolutely be the case in the future, \nand that is why this amendment\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\nis such an important one to support by protecting Social Security and \nputting in place a framework for fiscal responsibility for the long \nterm. I support the amendment and hope my colleagues will as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to speak in opposition to both \namendments. To remind our colleagues, we expect a vote on both of the \namendments offered by our friend and colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, at 5 o'clock. Both of these amendment also are very \nimportant.\n  Let me just address the first Conrad amendment, the first one we will \nvote on. In my opinion, it is fatally flawed for a couple of reasons. \nOne, it creates a new 60-vote point of order against the spending and \ntax legislation until the President sends Congress a report on the cost \nof the war and reconstruction of Iraq. I think it is a serious mistake \nfor Congress to ever limit itself depending on what another branch of \nGovernment does, whether it is the executive or the judicial branch. I \nthink that is a serious mistake. Certainly if you think of balance of \npowers, does that really make sense? I don't think so. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support a budget point of order against it.\n  I guess that will be a motion to waive the point of order. But I hope \nmy colleagues will think for a moment what we are doing. We are saying \nwe are not going to act until the executive branch does something. \nThere are a lot of different ways of getting the executive branch's \nattention other than saying we are not going to deal with the budget or \nissues before Congress. I think it is very constraining and \nshortsighted.\n  It is shortsighted from the standpoint it makes an exemption or an \nexception. It says we can't do it to consider legislation that deals \nwith spending--except for defense. I agree with that; homeland \nsecurity, and I agree with that. Then it says: Except for a growth \npackage. Then it kind of defines out the Democrat leader's growth \npackage.\n  I heard our colleagues on the Democrat side say it has a pause in \nspending. It doesn't have a pause in spending. I look at the Senate \nDemocrats' stimulus plan. It has $85 billion in new spending in 2003 \nand $26 billion in new spending in 2004. It has a tax cut in 2003 but a \ntax increase in 2004, and a tax increase in 2005.\n  In other words, we are going to have a resolution that says you have \nto have 60 votes to do anything other than our package. You can't do \nyour package, can't do somebody else's package, but it is OK to do the \nDemocrats' package. I find that to be fatally flawed.\n  Then I find it repeated in the second amendment. The second amendment \nis the largest tax increase we have had offered before the Senate in a \nlong time. This amendment is mind-boggling.\n  First let me state, in the President's initial budget he requested \nabout $1.5 trillion in revenue reductions over the 10-year period of \ntime. Keep in mind, we are talking about over a base of $26 trillion or \n$27 trillion. We reduced that to $1.3 trillion in the budget resolution \nwe have before us.\n  Senator Conrad's second amendment would reduce that 1.3--I keep \nhearing 1.4, but actually it is 1.314 trillion in our resolution. He \nwould reduce that to $121 billion. I believe that would allow for $87 \nbillion in the first year.\n  Maybe it is a coincidence, but the Democrats' Economic Recovery Act, \nintroduced by Senator Daschle, has spending of $85.6 billion in the \nfirst year.\n  So both amendments basically say, we want to have no tax cuts or we \nwant to have no tax cuts whatsoever except that we want to be able to \ndo our stimulus plan, and even though the amendment may not define it, \nthe stimulus plan as introduced in S. 414, Senator Daschle's plan, on \nwhich Joint Tax and CBO score its spending at $85.6 billion in the \nfirst year and $26.2 billion the second year--that is additional, \nincremental spending.\n  The budget resolution we have before us, just to put it in \nperspective, has about $10 billion in new nondefense spending. So this \nwould be an increase of about 8.5 times the amount of incremental, new \nspending we have in our bill.\n  That is a big spending increase. That is a humongous spending \nincrease, not to mention its impact on future taxes.\n  The budget resolution we have before us assumes that present law, the \n2001 tax bill--which is scheduled to sunset in the year 2010--would be \nextended. It assumes that it would be extended to the years 2011, 2012, \nand 2013. That is about a $600 billion package.\n  Senator Conrad's second amendment assumes that is not the case. In \nother words, that would not be the case. In other words, there would be \na tax increase. It means the people who are paying at the 10-percent \nincome tax level would go to the 15-percent level.\n  It means for the people who would be paying at the 25-percent level, \ntheir rate will go back up to 28 percent. It means that people who \nwould be paying at the 35-percent level will be paying 39.6 percent.\n  It means that couples who have children, who would have a $1,000 tax \ncredit per child, will go back to $500. It means that couples who saw \ntheir marriage penalty greatly reduced will see it greatly reenacted.\n  It means that married couples who have net effective tax rates or \ntaxable income of $56,000 today, who pay a 15-percent rate on all \nincome up to that level, will find a great percentage of that income \ntaxed at 28 percent.\n  It is a humongous tax increase. So I urge our colleagues to vote no.\n  I will again make a couple comments.\n  I heard, in statements of support, that: Well, this would stop those \ntax cuts for the wealthy. Well, wait a minute. What is wealthy about a \ncouple making $56,000? What is wealthy about a $1,000 tax credit per \nchild? What is wealthy about trying to get rid of the marriage penalty \nfor married couples who make $56,000? What is so wealthy about that?\n  Why should individuals be paying at rates in excess of what General \nMotors pays? People who are sole proprietors, people who own their own \nbusiness, why should they pay income tax rates in excess of the largest \ncorporations in America?\n  Why don't we just try to pass--I guess this amendment is just that--\nyou try to pass a big tax increase and see if that really helps the \neconomy. I don't believe it will. I think it would hurt the economy. I \nthink it would cost thousands and thousands of jobs.\n  I heard our colleague from New Jersey say he had a couple of \neconomists that do not support the elimination of double taxation. I \nhave a whole list of economists who say getting rid of double taxation \non dividends would be very positive and have a very stimulative impact \non the market. And that would help anybody, not just people who \ncurrently own taxable stock or dividends that might be taxable. It \nwould help anybody who happens to have investments in their retirement \naccounts that are tracking the market, which would include probably \nevery teacher, every public employee, every union member, all of whom \nhave savings plans, retirement plans which are dependent on a vibrant \nstock market. The President has a plan that would grow that. Our \ncolleagues do not.\n\n  Then let me make a couple other comments on Social Security. I keep \nhearing all this comment about: Well, this budget raids Social \nSecurity. I have heard the figure, $2.6 trillion or $2.7 trillion. If \nyou use that analogy, the budget that was reported out of the Budget \nCommittee last year, but not considered on the floor of the Senate, \nwould have so-called raided Social Security of $2.1 trillion.\n  I want to add some facts on just Social Security and Medicare. The \nreason I add the two together--maybe this is my old business hat--but I \nlook at payroll taxes and individuals who are self-employed. I used to \nbe self-employed. They pay 15.3 percent of payroll taxes, up to--the \ntaxable amount this year is what? I think it is $87,000. Now, it just \nso happens that 12.4 percent of that is Social Security and 2.9 percent \nof that is Medicare. So if you add the two together, it is a combined \ntotal of 15.3 percent of payroll.\n  I actually looked for the last 20 years. I wanted to see how much \nmoney is going in from the payroll taxes and how much money is going \nout in benefits. I did that.\n  As this chart shows, the income coming in is shown on the blue lines, \nand the benefits going out are shown on the red lines. And I notice \nfrom the years 2003 to 2013, the amount of money coming in is less than \nthe money going out.\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\n  I am not crediting interest on these so-called trust funds. I will \ntouch on that for a second.\n  If an individual is self-employed or they are working for a company \nwhere the company matches, they pay 7.45 percent of the 15.3 percent. \nTheir employer matches this amount to create the combined total. That \nis what is coming in to fund Social Security and Medicare. So the total \ntaxes coming in, in the year 2003, for these functions would be $731 \nbillion. And the amount of money going out in Social Security and \nMedicare is $746 billion. There is more money going out than coming in.\n  I wanted to look back at the last 20 years or the last 10 years prior \nto that to see what happened in actual dollars coming in and going out.\n  On this chart, the amount of money coming in is the lighter color, \nand the amount of money going out is the darker color. In almost every \nyear--not every year, but in almost every year--more money is going out \nthan coming in. In a few years there is a surplus.\n  But then I wanted to know: Wait a minute, if there is a surplus, \nwhere did that surplus come from? And I kind of notice there is a \ngeneral fund surplus or general fund transfer from the general fund \ninto Medicare. In other words, for most of these years, but not every \nyear, you will notice there is more money paid out in Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  So I guess you could say: Oh, they had some surpluses in Social \nSecurity, but we are raiding it. Well, if you are raiding it, you are \nmoving it out to pay Medicare.\n  Frankly, an employee, an individual, an employer, they don't really \nmake that fine distinction between Social Security taxes and Medicare \ntaxes. They pay the payroll tax. And it just so happens, they pay the \npayroll tax and the Government is paying out more than what is coming \nin.\n  Even in those few years where there was a surplus--more money came in \nthan went out combined--for those few years, if you look at the amount \nof money in the general fund, transferred in to Part B--and we \nsubsidize Part B, the doctors' portion of Medicare; we subsidize that \nto the tune of 3 to 1, 75 percent Federal Government; not payroll \ntaxes, general revenue funds going in to subsidize Part B, the doctors' \npayments--those amounts exceed any positive amount, as shown over here \non the chart. So the point is, more money is coming out than if you add \nSocial Security and Medicare together. Maybe there is some synergy \nthere.\n  If you look at the amount that some of our colleagues--and I agree \nwith Senator Conrad on many aspects of Medicare and Social Security and \nlong-term challenges that we have. We have an unfunded liability in \nMedicare that is about $15.3 trillion. It is about two or three times \nthat of Social Security. Demographically, we have a big challenge. We \nneed to be addressing it in a bipartisan way. We do not make changes \naround here in Medicare without bipartisan support. So we need to be \nworking together to help save the system and improve the system.\n  In our budget, we provide for up to $400 billion to strengthen, \nimprove, and save Medicare. That is a lot of money. That is a big \nexpansion of an entitlement, not just for prescription drugs but also \nto save the system that we know needs to be addressed. We need to do it \nin a bipartisan way. I hope we will.\n  But I want to make a couple of analyses. I keep hearing about raiding \nSocial Security, and I think: Wait a minute. Do they not know we are \npaying all this money extra for Medicare?\n  Do they not know Medicare has an enormous unfunded liability? Do they \nnot know we are paying a lot of general fund money to subsidize \nMedicare? Those things also should be computed and added. If Social \nSecurity is being raided, it is being raided to pay Medicare.\n  A lot of this trust fund symbolism is because Congress, over the \nyears--well, we have strengthened the Medicare trust fund and HI fund \nbecause we moved home health away from HI into Part B, which is \nsubsidized by the general fund. This made the HI fund look more \nsolvent. In reality, it was financial maneuvering. The real security \nfor Medicare and Social Security is a healthy economy. If we don't have \nthat, we don't have jobs, we don't have payroll taxes coming in, and we \nwon't be able to pay benefits.\n  Both systems are basically on a pay-go system. If they were funded \nsystems, we would be put in jail because we have not funded the \nliabilities in the systems. I used to be a fiduciary and trustee of a \npension plan. There are liabilities to an employer if you don't fund \nthe plans. We don't do that for public employees. We never have in \nSocial Security or in other Federal employee plans. So I just mention \nthat.\n  Finally, I want to touch on this comment about ``raiding the trust \nfund.'' I want to make sure people understand this. Social Security--if \nwe enact no bill, or our budget stays as it is, we will end up having a \n$4.1 trillion trust fund. If we don't do a budget, we will have $4.1 \ntrillion in the trust fund, period. So, again, the important aspect of \nbeing able to pay Social Security and Medicare, frankly, is a growing \neconomy. The President has a plan to grow the economy.\n  If we adopt either of these two amendments pending before us, what we \nwill say is the only growth package we can enact is the one that is \noffered by our colleagues on the Democrat side. Looking at their \npackage--look at the composition of it; it is not a tax package, it is \nbasically a spending package. In 2003, it says, we will spend $85.6 \nbillion, and we will have a tax reduction in 2003 of $16.2 billion, but \nwe will have a tax increase in 2004--next year, 6 months from now--of \n$17.8 billion, and a tax increase in 2005 of $16 billion. We will take \naway the bonus depreciation provision that was in the 2002 tax bill \nthat had strong bipartisan support, that many people are talking about \nmaybe we should extend or improve or enhance. So we really would \nencourage investment.\n  This provision would take it away. If you want to do something to \ndampen the economy, it would be to adopt these amendments. I cannot \nthink of anything more negative on the economy than if we adopted these \nprovisions. They are consistent in saying, yes, we want to cut your tax \nbill, but we want to have our proposal, which is not a tax bill, it is \nreally a spending bill.\n  In about 45 minutes, I urge my colleagues to vote no on both of the \nunderlying amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I don't know, honestly, what amendment our \nchairman is looking at, but it is not mine. I don't have spending in \nthe amendment. I have not provided for the Democratic leader's plan--I \nhave not. In the amendment the chairman is discussing, I have $150 \nbillion of tax cuts, including $25 billion of refundables, which the \nchairman has in his own package. I have matched his own package on \nrefundables. I have no spending.\n  The only thing that, perhaps, he is looking at is in the early years, \nbecause I more front-end-loaded the plan. We have additional interest \ncosts initially. But over the life of the plan, it is substantially \nless interest cost. This isn't a plan with spending in it; it is a plan \nthat has tax cuts in it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am reading your first amendment, and correct me if I \nam wrong. S. Con. Res. 23--it is a point of order amendment; 264 is the \namendment number. On pages 1 and 2, it says:\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or conference \n     report that would increase the deficit in any fiscal year, \n     other than one economic growth and jobs creation measure \n     providing significant economic stimulus in 2003 and 2004, \n     which does not increase the deficit over the time period of \n     fiscal years 2005 through 2013. . . .\n\n  But it does allow--correct me if I am wrong--a significant increase \nin spending in 2003 and 2004, comparable to that as introduced by \nSenator Daschle.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is talking about my first amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That amendment provides for a stimulus package. The \nSenator is correct. In 2003 and 2004, that provides for both tax cuts \nand spending. In the second amendment I am offering, to reduce the size \nof the tax cut and still leave $150 billion in tax cuts, there is no \nprovision of spending. So I guess this is an example of why it is \nbetter if we handle each of these\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\namendments individually rather than to stack them, because we get \nconfused about what amendment we are addressing. I guess that is why we \nare designed here to offer an amendment at a time.\n  Let me just say, on the second amendment, it is--I say this directly \nto the chairman--not designed to accommodate the Democratic leader's \nstimulus plan. It doesn't have the spending that is in his stimulus \nplan. It simply has $150 billion in tax cuts, $25 billion of which is \nrefundables. I have done that to try to give our colleagues different \nopportunities to address what I consider the greatest threat we face, \nwhich is sinking into this abyss of deficits and debt. I believe, with \neverything that is in me, that we ought to do something on both the \nspending side and the tax-cutting side, and that is what the first \namendment represents. It is an attempt to say to our colleagues that we \nare on the brink of war and we don't know what it will cost, we are in \nrecord deficit now, and that what we should do is make it more \ndifficult to spend money and to have tax cuts, with two exceptions: We \ndon't make it more difficult to spend money on defense or homeland \nsecurity, and we don't make it more difficult to have tax cuts to the \nextent that they are for 2003 and 2004, to accommodate a stimulus \npackage to give lift to the economy.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. DODD. I believe this is the chart regarding the second amendment \nthat really makes the point very clearly. He showed this to me the \nother day, and it struck me as graphically describing exactly what the \nSenator from North Dakota is saying. Here are the years 2003 to 2008, \nand 2013. These are surplus numbers. Correct me if I am wrong, but \nthese are surplus numbers we are looking at, in terms of the Social \nSecurity surplus. The light blue at the top is the Medicare surplus. \nThat begins to run down and out around here, just the time that these \ntax cuts go into effect.\n  The point I have understood him to make is that this seems to be \ndesigned specifically to starve our ability to see to it that both \nSocial Security and Medicare have the resources they need. The \nPresident calls for more than $1 trillion in resources to support his \ntax cuts. Right at about the time these tax cuts will really hit home, \nwe then lose the revenue ability to respond to the needs of Social \nSecurity and Medicare; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Connecticut does a very good job of \ndescribing the enormous challenge we face. The hard reality is that we \nhave record budget deficits now, and this is before the baby boom \ngeneration retires. When the baby boom generation retires, the trust \nfunds will turn cash negative.\n\n  I want to clear up one thing if I can. The Senator from Oklahoma, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, says if you take Medicare and Social \nSecurity and lump them together, we are spending more than we are \ntaking in. But what he has done here is mix apples and oranges, if I \ncan say so.\n  First of all, the Social Security trust fund is separate and apart. \nIt is not lumped with Medicare. If you look at the Social Security \ntrust fund, this is what you will see. Right now it is running \nsubstantial surpluses. This year the Social Security trust fund will \nrun a $160 billion surplus. We should be using that money to pay down \ndebt or prepay the liability or invest it, but instead we are taking it \nand using it for tax cuts.\n  We know what is going to happen. In 2018, that trust fund is going to \nturn cash negative, and when it does, it is like falling off a cliff. \nAt the very time it turns cash negative, the costs of the President's \ntax cuts explode, meaning only one thing: massive deficits, massive \ndebt.\n  If we look at the Medicare trust fund, and what the Senator from \nOklahoma has done, as we know, there is a part A to Medicare. It is \nlargely for hospitals. That has a trust fund. That trust fund is now \nrunning surpluses. It is much smaller than the Social Security trust \nfund, but nonetheless there are surpluses in the tens of millions of \ndollars. But that, too, is going to go cash negative in 2013 right at \nthe end of this budget period. When it goes cash negative, it goes cash \nnegative in a dramatic way and, again, right at the time the cost of \nthe President's tax cuts explode, leaving us unable to respond to the \ncrisis that is going to occur. If I can conclude by saying what the \nSenator from Oklahoma has done is he has combined the part A of \nMedicare, which has a trust fund, the Social Security trust fund, and \npart B of Medicare, which largely goes to fund the cost of doctors.\n  The part B of Medicare is funded in a completely different way. The \nSenator from Oklahoma is correct, three-quarters of that money comes \nnot from payroll taxes but comes from general fund transfers. That is \nwhat we did long ago. We have had various formulas, but we decided long \nago that part B was going to be funded in part by payroll taxes and in \npart by general fund transfers.\n  Lumping these all together obscures the fact we do have trust funds \nand that those trust funds are running cash surpluses. They are going \nto go into massive cash deficit, and to run budget deficits on top of \nthat right before the baby boomers retire, and it is going to force \nexcruciating decisions in the future, either massive cuts in benefits \nor massive tax increases or some combination.\n  That is the problem I see with the budget plan put to us by the \nPresident and put to us by our colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, can I receive 5 minutes or so?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I see my colleague from Colorado is \nhere as well and wants some time to speak. I will be brief so he can be \nheard.\n  These two amendments are different in thrust. I will address the \nfirst amendment. I know others have spoken about it.\n\n  I heard over and over, and I agree--in fact, I listened to the Vice \nPresident the other day on one of our national news programs say how \nthe world really has been divided into two parts over the last 18 \nmonths: What was going on prior to 9/11 and what has happened since 9/\n11. I agree with him. I think we have to look at the world in two \nparts. We will never be the same again. Others have said that over and \nover. I do not know anyone who fundamentally disagrees with that point.\n  I am concerned about this budget process coming right on the eve, if \nyou will, of significant, major conflict, and the fact we are debating \nthe budget needs and priorities of our Nation and excluding from this \ndebate the cost of this conflict and the cost of the reconstruction \nthat will come afterwards. For the life of me, it is almost as if we \nare engaging in an Alice-in-Wonderland world here. On the one hand, the \nentire world is anxious about what may happen within hours of this \ndebate, and on the other hand, we are debating a budget process that \nlocks us in for a decade, and there is no discussion about what is \ngoing to become a major issue for us: the cost of this conflict and the \ncost of the reconstruction period afterwards.\n  This morning I tried to go through the news media to see if I could \nfind an article about this debate. I found very little about this \ndebate. Obviously, the attention is on what will happen in Iraq. Yet \nwhat we are debating today, and will be debating tomorrow and the next \nday, in the midst of this conflict, I will argue is as significant in \nmany ways as the impending conflict in the Middle East. But what \nconcerns me is that we are literally locking ourselves into budget \npriorities that are excluding a tremendous cost, a cost, by the way, as \none who supported the resolution last fall, I accept. It is one that we \nhave to bear, but I do not know how the budget can be debated without \ntalking about the major costs of war that we all know will be coming.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota says that we \nought to at least require that the President provide Congress with a \nreport on the costs of the imminent war with Iraq before the Senate \nacts on any new tax cuts or spending initiatives. I am not expecting a \ndetailed accounting here. Obviously, you cannot do that, but you are \nnot going to convince this Senator that there have not been people at \nthe executive branch level who have anticipated best- and worst-case \nscenarios of this conflict.\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\n  We have heard estimates anywhere from $60 billion to $95 billion, \njust on the military part. In fact, I gather we have already spent some \n$25 billion just in getting our forces and equipment to the Middle \nEast. We are already incurring a cost, and yet there is no mention of \nthose costs in this budget.\n  Certainly, the idea that we have not incurred the cost yet because \nthe conflict has not started, therefore, we cannot mention these \nnumbers yet, I think flies in the face of reality. Clearly, we have \ncosts already.\n  I tried to historically see if I could find another example of when \nwe were on a brink of a conflict when we actually had a tax cut of the \nmagnitude we are talking about here. I cannot find any historical \nprecedent for what we are about to do. In fact, Harry Truman, who is \nrevered today as a courageous American President, prior to Korea said: \nWe will do this, but, by the way, I am going to have tax increases to \npay for it. If we are going into a conflict in the Pacific rim, I \ncannot very well ask us to go and not bear the financial cost of doing \nso.\n  The only time I recall we went into a conflict and did not face the \nmusic financially was during the Vietnam conflict. We saw the ultimate \nresults of trying to wage a fight there and not pay for it \nsimultaneously.\n\n  As someone who is supportive of the fact that we have to go to war--\nreluctantly I regret that is the case but understand it must be so--I \nfor one would like to see us adopt the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota because I think the American public would expect nothing \nless of us here. This is absolutely critical. We are prepared to put \nyoung men and women's lives at risk, who are about to bear the burden--\nand let's be honest--almost solely so, certainly solely financially--\nand yet we are engaged in a budget debate and discussion that does not \neven bring up a red nickel in the cost of this conflict and the cost of \nreconstruction.\n  The amendment of the Senator from North Dakota says let's determine \nwhat these costs are. Let's factor that all in and then decide whether \nor not we want to support a $1.3 trillion or a $1.4 trillion tax cut \nover the next 10 years.\n  I do not for the life of me understand why we would not pause a few \nmoments here, a few days even, necessarily to see how this issue is \ngoing and come back to this issue and resolve it. I am hopeful our \ncolleagues will support this amendment. I think it is patriotic. Can \nyou imagine if this does not go as well as we might like and these \ncosts explode and here we are locked into a situation in which we \ncannot afford to pay the costs? How ridiculous we will look as a Senate \nthat we did not wait a few days to determine whether or not we needed \nextra resources to pay for these costs.\n  My time has expired. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment \nand support the second amendment as well. With respect to the first \namendment, I cannot believe we are going to go on record and adopt a \nbudget that does not take into consideration one of the greatest \nchallenges we face as an American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask that the Senator from Oklahoma yield me some time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one and a half minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding me 10 minutes.\n  Before I start my prepared remarks, I wish to thank the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, for a great job. This is the \nfirst year he has taken on the responsibilities of the Budget \nCommittee. It is a tough environment today. With this tough economic \nenvironment and being on the brink of war, he has brought a budget bill \nthat holds down spending, cuts taxes, and actually has a plan in which \nwe can eliminate deficit spending over a 10-year period. In today's \nenvironment, I think that is phenomenal work.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, it has been a pleasure for me to \nwork with him because he has made a commitment to work with members on \nthe Budget Committee to try to put together a reasonable proposal. It \nis important we get a budget passed in this Congress, this session. \nLast year we experienced the problem of what happens when we do not \npass a budget from the Senate, and we see the free-for-all that happens \nin spending.\n  I think we are in a spending spree. There have been some speakers \nearlier today who tried to blame the current economic problems we are \nhaving on this President. I have to remind the Members of this body \nthat the economy was starting to show a downturn the first few months \nthat the President was in office. He did not have any effect on that \neconomic downturn that was coming. In fact, what this President did was \nhe proposed a tax cut. It ended up being a temporary tax cut because it \nwas opposed by the other side, but it was a 10-year tax cut. It was put \nin place and the argument was made, well, here we are, we are just \ndoing something that is going to benefit the wealthy.\n  If we look at the figures of who pays the individual income taxes in \nthis country, the top 50 percent of the income producers of this \ncountry pay nearly all of the taxes. There is only about 4 percent of \nthe taxes that are paid by the lower 50 percent of the income producers \nin this country. The other 50 percent pays 96 percent of the taxes. So \nhow can there be a tax cut policy without addressing the needs of those \nproducers who we have in this country?\n  The naysayers criticize the temporary tax cut, but about October of \nlast year we began to hear some of them admit, yes, the tax cut, even \nthough it was temporary in the spring of 2001, it did help the economy. \nIt helped buoy up the economy. Even an editorial last October in the \nWashington Post, which is no friend of those of us who want to continue \nto cut taxes, had to admit that it was the temporary tax cut that \nhelped buoy up the economy.\n  We are looking at an economy today that is struggling. I had a town \nmeeting this last weekend in my home State of Colorado, the largest \ncounty in the State of Colorado in Denver, and we talked about the \neconomy. I talked with them about just having gone through a spending \nspree--a spending spree, I might add, that started before this \nPresident stepped in to office. I said, if we look over the past 4 \nyears or so of spending, it has been the largest amount of spending \nthat we have incurred in any 4 years, excluding World War II. If \nspending is what it is going to take to stimulate this economy, why \nhave we not seen the economy improve today? At that point nobody wanted \nto increase spending at that town meeting.\n\n  I asked, well, why don't we just do nothing? I mean, some Members of \nthe Senate are saying let's do nothing, leave the current laws as they \nare and let it ride. I asked, do you think a do-nothing proposal is \nwhat we need to help today's economy? Nobody agreed to that.\n  So what is left? What is left is we need to cut taxes because if we \nlook as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the amount of taxes \nthat are being paid today by Americans is among the highest it has ever \nbeen in history. It is not the highest. We peaked down a little bit. \nSeveral years ago it was the highest, but we are still among the \nhighest as far as a percentage of gross domestic product. That is very \nsignificant because the gross domestic product has been growing in the \nlast decade or so at phenomenal rates. So it is a huge burden.\n  I commend the President for coming forward with a tax cut that would \nactually increase jobs in this economy. I am looking at some figures \nthat have been supplied to me about the job growth in this country, and \nthere have been a number of studies that have been put out. Some of \nthem say that 60 percent of what the President is providing in tax cuts \nwill actually spill over to create more job growth and that is going to \nbe reflected in growth in revenue to the Federal Treasury, and as a \nresult of that, the fiscal notes that we have in the Congress are not \nas severe as some may believe because we are not taking into account \nthe real world of what happens when we actually do a tax cut, how that \nstimulates the economy.\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\n  Now we looked at some individual States where they have done some \nanalysis. This is not the one that says it is 60 percent; it is not the \nlowest one, which is 40 percent. I might add, the 40-percent economic \nanalysis on number of jobs was made by President Clinton's former \nassistants in OMB, Office of Management and Budget. The figures are \naround 57 percent that they came up with, and so we see a growth in \njobs in all the States.\n  Take my State of Colorado, in 2004 we see 16,200 new jobs created \nbecause of the economic stimulus plan that is put forward by the \nPresident. We go down and look at, for example, Oklahoma, where the \nchairman of the Budget Committee is from, 11,600 jobs. We can look at \nTexas, the State of the Presiding Officer, we are looking somewhere at \n74,000 new jobs created in the State of Texas. Look at North Dakota, \nfor example, a much smaller State but still there is a proven growth \nimpact of 2,300 jobs. As a result of the President's proposal, \neconomists have analyzed that they anticipate this job growth to occur.\n  The point can be made, well, we are having to spend money if we use \nthe static analysis that we use in the Congress, but there is a return \non that. That same study has indicated that for every dollar of \ninvestment, there is a $3.22 return.\n  I remember when I started my business I had to incur a debt to get \nthings going, to create jobs, to be able to buy equipment and get \nmoving. I considered that was a worthy investment. I think we are going \nto have to make an investment in today's future. I think we need to \nmake that investment in terms of a tax cut, and I think we need to do \nsomething along what the President is suggesting we ought to be doing, \nthat for each $1 in tax cuts we are going to get a $3.22 return over a \n10-year period.\n  That brings me to the two amendments that are before us now. The \nfirst amendment we will vote on, where we are cutting out all the whole \nproposal basically other than what is going to be proposed by the other \nside of the aisle, which has a lot of severe restrictions on it. There \nare a couple of problems I have with that amendment. I think we pretty \neasily defined defense, but in homeland security, sure, we want to \nprotect the homeland security in general terms. That means securing our \nborders and providing assistance to those people who will deal with \nemergencies in case of some kind of a terrorist attack, and that is \npolice and firemen in this country. There are individuals who are \ntrying to expand that definition of homeland security.\n  The point I make is that homeland security has not been well defined, \nand in some instances we may open up a hole for more spending than what \nwe intend to do.\n  The other thing I point out that we have, I will take them at their \nword, $150 billion is what they want to use to stimulate the economy. \nIt does not do much. If we took that $150 billion and put it out over \n11 years, it is only .5 of an impact on the total amount of taxes \ncollected over that period of time. That does not do much. We need to \ndo more.\n  Mr. President, $150 billion is a drop in the bucket. We need to look, \nat a minimum, at what the President is looking at. Maybe we ought to do \nmore. Time of war I don't think is the time to be pulling back on the \neconomy. It is the time to try and stimulate the economy. When we \nstimulate the economy, we create job growth, we allow individuals and \nbusinesses to retain more of the money in their own pockets. They spend \nmoney on equipment, and that means we will begin to see this economy \ngrow.\n  I will vote no on the two amendments. I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I thank Senator Nickles for granting me the time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 10\\1/2\\ minutes for the majority \nand 5\\1/2\\ minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time \nbe equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And the vote is scheduled for 5 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to talk about \nthe two amendments I have offered that are now pending. The first \namendment I offered says we should not add to new spending initiatives \nor tax cuts until we have a full idea of the cost of this war.\n  As my colleagues know, there is no provision in this budget, either \nin the one sent to us by the President or the one that has come out of \nthe Budget Committee, for war costs. We know the number is not zero. \nThat is the number that is in the budget.\n  So the first amendment I offered is to make it more difficult to add \nto deficits by spending or tax cuts, with two exceptions. On the \nspending side we would have an exception for national defense or \nhomeland security. On the tax-cutting side, we would have an exception \nfor a stimulus package with costs in 2003 or 2004. So that is the first \namendment I have offered.\n\n  The second amendment I have offered would reduce the tax cut by $1.2 \ntrillion, still leaving a $150 billion tax cut but using the $1.2 \ntrillion to strengthen Social Security, given the fact that the baby \nboom generation is about to retire, given the fact under the budget \nresolution before us, virtually every penny of Social Security surplus \nduring the entire next decade is being used to pay for other things. It \nis being used to pay for tax cuts. It is being used to pay for other \nexpenses of Government.\n  Those are the two amendments I have pending. I hope very much my \ncolleagues will give serious consideration to them.\n  Again, the first amendment says simply this:\n\n       The Senate may not consider legislation that would increase \n     the deficit until the President submits to Congress a \n     detailed report on the overall estimated costs of the war.\n\n  That is enforced with a 60-vote point of order, so it could be \novercome if there were a supermajority vote here in the Senate. There \nare two exceptions: On the spending side, legislation relating to \nnational or homeland security and, on the tax-cutting side, an economic \nrecovery and job creation package which does not increase the deficit \nover the time period 2005 to 2013. That would permit a stimulus package \nin 2003 and 2004. Again, the second amendment reduces the tax cut, \nwhich approaches $1.4 trillion, by $1.2 trillion, and reserves that \nmoney to strengthen Social Security.\n  I again welcome support from my colleagues on both of these \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have already made a budget point of \norder on the first amendment. Senator Conrad moved to waive it. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote no on the motion to waive.\n  The amendment creates a new 60-vote point of order against spending \nand tax legislation until the President does something, until the \nexecutive branch does something. I think that is a serious mistake. We \nare going to handicap what congressional action can be waiting on what \nthe executive branch must do. There are other ways of getting the \nadministration's attention than saying we are not going to legislate. \nSo I think that's a serious mistake.\n  Also, it is very interesting but fatally flawed from its definition. \nIt says we won't do anything except for--well, maybe the Democrat \nstimulus plan. In other words, we are not going to consider anything \nbut maybe our bill, because it says we have an exemption in 2003 and \n2004, and also not increase the deficit in 2005 to 2013.\n  If I look at the Democratic leader's package, it has significant \ndeficit increases in the first year of about $100 billion in 2003; \n$85.6 billion in spending, $16 billion in tax reduction for a total of \na $101 billion increase in deficit in\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\n2003. Then in 2004 it has $26 billion in new spending but a tax \nincrease of $17.5 billion, and a tax increase in 2005 of $16 billion.\n  It assumes the bonus depreciation that we passed in 2002 would be \ncurtailed; In other words, a tax increase on business. Even though we \nhave already given it to you, we are going to take that away from you. \nThat is really going to help the economy?\n\n  I think this resolution is fatally flawed, and I hope our colleagues \nwould vote no on it.\n  On the second amendment, it is an amendment that basically says we \nshould have at least $1.2 trillion more tax increases than proposed by \nthe President or the budget resolution that is pending before us; a \n$1.2 trillion tax increase. It is not every day we vote for something \nthat large. It also says no reconciliation bill. It says let's do a \n$150 billion--actually $121 in tax reduction, $29 billion in spending \nin the first year or so. Again, it is kind of patterned where maybe \nthis would fit for the Democrats' proposal but not anything like the \nPresident's proposal. Let's have our stimulus or growth package or just \ngut the bill.\n  What is the net increase? It assumes the 2001 tax cuts that are \nscheduled to sunset in 2010, that will not happen. Those tax increases \nwe are going to hit. So people who are paying 10 percent, look out, \nyour tax rate will go to 15 percent.\n  In our proposal we assumed we would extend those tax cuts, but we did \nnot do it in reconciliation, so Congress would have another 6 years or \n7 years to make that decision. Senator Conrad's amendment assumes we \nare going to have those tax increases hit. We are going to allow all \nthe changes we made in 2001 to sunset; therefore, you are going to see \ndeath tax rates go back up to 55 percent; you are going to see rates \nclimb back to higher levels. It means for couples who were receiving \n$1,000 per child, that is going to be reduced to $500. It means couples \nwho have a combined income of $56,000 and are paying in the 15 percent \ntax bracket are going to find about $12,000 of that income is going to \nbe taxed at 28 percent instead of 15 percent.\n  It is a big tax increase compared to the resolution we have before \nus. I urge my colleagues to vote no on both amendments.\n  These are important amendments. I thank my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota because I told people, if people want to cut the growth \npackage, let's vote and find out where the votes are. This is an \namendment to say the growth package should be maybe $150 billion, but \neven at that we are going to reduce the total amount of tax reduction \nassumed in our bill to zero on the growth package, other than the $150 \nbillion, and assume there will be very large tax increases actually \nhitting the American people in the years 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n  I hope we would not enact such a plan. I think it would be a \ndisastrous move for the economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me be clear. My first amendment does \nnot contain the Daschle growth package. It does not. It simply is not \nreading my amendment. My amendment says very clearly the following: \nThat we would prevent additional increases to the deficit by spending, \nor by taxes. And we would enforce it with a 60-vote point of order with \ntwo exceptions: On spending for national security, homeland security, \nnational defense; on taxes, you can have a stimulus package in 2003 and \n2004. It could be the Daschle package. It could be the Nickles package. \nBut you could not have a stimulus package that adds to the deficit in \n2005 and beyond.\n  That in no way restricts you to the Daschle package. It would allow \nit, but it would not prevent any other stimulus package from being \nenacted for 2003 and 2004.\n  On my second amendment, which reduces the tax cut by $1.2 trillion, \nstill leaving a tax cut of $150 billion, the money is used to \nstrengthen Social Security. It is held in a reserve fund. That allows \nus to reduce the deficit and reduce the debt. If we want to have a \ngrowth package here, we better get serious about the deficit and the \ndebt because most economists are telling us the President's so-called \ngrowth package doesn't grow the economy at all. It actually hurts long-\nterm economic growth. Why? Because the President's tax cuts are not \noffset by spending reductions. The President's tax cuts are offset by \nborrowing.\n\n  That increased borrowing, that increased deficit, that increased debt \nreduces the pool of societal savings, reduces the pool of money \navailable for investment and reduces economic growth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank my colleague and want to inform \nour colleagues we will be voting in 2 minutes on two important \namendments, and I encourage our colleagues to vote no.\n  I have a list of economists who state the President's package would \nhelp the economy and help grow it. It is several pages. I don't know if \nI want to clutter the Record further. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted at least a couple of pages. I do not want to burden the \ntaxpayers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Here is what prominent economist and industry leaders are \n     saying about the President's economic growth proposal:\n       ``President Bush's fiscal stimulus package is desirable not \n     only to deal with the current sluggishness in the economy, \n     but also with the longer term problems arising from \n     disincentives to save, invest and work in America.'' (Richard \n     Vedder, Distinguished Professor of Economics, Ohio \n     University)\n       ``The President's economic growth package is a very \n     positive step forward for investors, workers, and taxpayers. \n     For the sake of the economy, we hope that Congress will \n     speedily enact the President's tax relief proposals and NTU \n     will be working toward that goal.'' (John Berthoud, \n     President, National Taxpayers Union)\n       ``The package is a great New Year's surprise. We'll be \n     raising our economic and equity outlooks and lowering our \n     unemployment rate expectations.'' (David Malpass, Bear \n     Stearns & Co. Inc.)\n       ``A brilliant, double-barrelled tax cut that will increase \n     the income of every American worker and create millions of \n     new and better jobs.'' (Martin Anderson, Keith and Jan \n     Hurlbut Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University)\n       ``President Bush's proposed growth plan is not just a bunch \n     of random tax cuts, it is a plan that really pushes the \n     `growth buttons' by improving incentives to work, save and \n     invest, and is a step toward real tax reform. This package, \n     along with recent improvements in the tax treatment of \n     business investment, will give a real lift to jobs and GDP.'' \n     (Stephen J. Entin, President and Executive Director, \n     Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation (IRET))\n       ``By accelerating tax rate reductions and eliminating the \n     double-taxation of dividends, President Bush's tax package \n     would significantly increase the economy's performance. But \n     the proposal also represents much-need tax reform and is a \n     significant step toward a simple and fair system like the \n     flat tax.'' (Dan Mitchell, The Heritage Foundation)\n       ``President Bush's proposal on dividends ameliorates the \n     double-taxation of corporate profits, ending the incentives \n     in our tax code #1 to over-leverage business, with the \n     consequence of too much debt and vulnerability to the \n     business cycle, and #2 to over-rely on accounting numbers \n     rather than the pay-out of cash. His proposal on expensing of \n     capital expenditures will help invigorate our economic \n     recovery.'' (Clifford F. Thies, Professor of Economics and \n     Finance at Shenandoah University, and member of the Board of \n     Directors of the American Association of Small Property \n     Owners (AASPO))\n       ``The double taxation of dividends has never made sense and \n     this is a perfect time to remove this crazy form of taxation. \n     It not only harms economic growth in the obvious ways, but \n     also in subtle ways. Given the wave of recent corporate \n     scandals, this is the perfect time to introduce a policy \n     change that will simultaneously increase investor confidence \n     while creating greater accountability for managers.'' (Brian \n     J. Hall, Associate Professor, Harvard Business School)\n       ``Taxpayers at all income levels should cheer President \n     Bush's call for greater tax relief. These pro-growth and pro-\n     family tax cuts are well-timed to provide stimulus for the \n     U.S. economy.'' (Russell Lamb, North Carolina State \n     University)\n       ``The President's proposal eliminates unfairness in the tax \n     code, distributes the gains widely to Americans who pay \n     income taxes, and creates incentives for growth. What more \n     can we ask?'' (Don Booth, Professor of Economics, Chapman \n     University)\n       ``The President's Economic Growth Package is a solid and \n     aggressive plan to further boost economic growth and job \n     creation in 2003 and beyond. The cuts in marginal tax rates \n     will allow all individuals to better spend, save, and invest, \n     and they are especially beneficial to the ongoing viability \n     of\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\n     the small businesses that pay taxes at the individual level \n     such as Subchapter S Corporations.'' (Paul Merski, Chief \n     Economist & Director of Federal Tax Policy, Independent \n     Community Bankers of America)\n       ``I think this is a bold economic package that both \n     provides much-needed near-term economic stimulus and boosts \n     after-tax incentives for growth and investment. The current \n     double-taxation of dividends is unjustifiable on economic \n     efficiency grounds and its elimination should provide a \n     welcome lift to the equity market by increasing after-tax \n     returns on stocks and further improve corporate governance by \n     encouraging firms to increase dividend payouts. The \n     acceleration of the margin tax rate cuts from 2006 into 2003 \n     should eliminate incentives to defer income and economic \n     activity, which in turn should further boost economic growth \n     in 2003. This is the most significant proposal to roll back \n     tax disincentives to growth and stimulate the economy since \n     the Reagan tax cuts.'' (John Ryding, Chief Market Economist, \n     Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.)\n       ``This is the type of bold action needed to jump start the \n     stagnant U.S. economy. When these measures go into effect, \n     the U.S. industrial sector will resume its role of innovating \n     and creating jobs to provide an engine for growth in the \n     global economy.'' (Thomas J. Duesterberg, President and Chief \n     Executive Officer of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a \n     public policy and business research organization in \n     Arlington, VA)\n       ``The President's plan is directly targeting consumer \n     spending and investment incentives. The reduction of marriage \n     penalty, the increase in child tax credit, the extension of \n     unemployment benefit and speeding up tax relief will help \n     revive consumer spending, increase confidence and boost \n     aggregate demand in the short-run. The end of double taxation \n     of dividends and increasing incentives for small businesses \n     should help sustain momentum in favor of job creation and \n     long-term growth.'' (Magda Kandil, International Monetary \n     Fund)\n       ``Once again, President Bush is demonstrating his strong \n     leadership ability. This stimulus package is just the type of \n     measure his economy needs to get back on track. Just upon \n     hearing about it the markets have reacted wildly in response. \n     Imagine how it'll be when it's enacted.'' (Horace Cooper, \n     Centre for New Black Leadership)\n       ``Business investment is key to fostering healthy levels of \n     economic growth. President Bush's plan offers much needed \n     capital and incentives to the sector of the economy \n     shouldering the bulk of job creation, economic growth and \n     innovation--small businesses and entrepreneurs. We are also \n     encouraged by the President's proposal to eliminate the \n     double taxation of dividends. With the strength of the \n     economy becoming increasingly dependent on the health of the \n     equity markets, this measure will help restore both certainty \n     and investor confidence. The overall package is good for \n     small business, which means it's good for America.'' (Karen \n     Kerrigan, Chair, Small Business Survival Committee)\n       ``The President's plan alleviates one of the most \n     economically destructive distortions in the tax law and also \n     provides welcome relief to small businesses.'' (David R. \n     Burton, The Argus Group)\n       ``President Bush's `Taking Action to Strengthen America's \n     Economy' plan is a sound and well thought out policy package. \n     The plan offers not only short-term stimulus for the American \n     economy but it also lays the foundation for long-term, non-\n     inflationary, economic growth for the decades ahead. By \n     extending unemployment benefits, the plan reaches out to \n     those workers who, through no fault of their own, find \n     themselves out of work. In addition, the creation of the new \n     Personal Reemployment Accounts will help to ensure that \n     America has the most dynamic labor markets the world has ever \n     seen. One of the most impressive things about the plan is \n     that it is not limited to only short-term stimulus. President \n     Bush obviously understands the importance of long-term \n     economic growth for America's future. By eliminating the \n     double taxation of dividend income President Bush's plan will \n     allow Americans to save more effectively for their \n     retirements and to save money for their children's future. In \n     addition, by encouraging small business to invest and invent \n     the plan will help to ensure the rapid advancement of \n     American productivity. These productivity increases will help \n     to insure that America's children of today will enjoy a \n     higher standard of living than their parents and their \n     grandparents. The positive effects of the President's plan \n     will be felt for decades into the future.'' (Michael W. \n     Brandl, Ph.D., The University of Texas at Austin, McCombs \n     School of Business, Department of Finance)\n       ``A far-reaching reform of the U.S. tax system to reduce \n     the large distortions implied by the existing structure of \n     taxes on capital income is long overdue. Studies published in \n     leading economics journals show that the welfare of U.S. \n     households improves by an amount equivalent to an increase of \n     between 1.5 to 3 percent per quarter forever because of the \n     tremendous efficiency gains that the economy stands to make \n     from lower taxes on dividends and other forms of capital \n     income. These findings are not driven by glossy budgetary \n     arithmetics. In fact, they follow from economic models that \n     impose tough assumptions keeping current levels of government \n     expenditures and transfer payments covered and making the \n     long-run rate of economic growth independent of the tax \n     cuts.'' (Enrique Mendoza, University of Maryland)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I also have a list of economists who say the President's \npackage would greatly increase the stock market: James Glassman from \nChase, 10 percent to 15 percent; Charles Schwab, 10 to 15 percent; and \non and on. Some of us would love to see the stock market increase. The \namendment of the Senator would basically gut the growth package. There \nwould be zero growth package--maybe $150 billion in the first 2 years, \nbut that is not long-term growth. And his first amendment does say a \npoint of order would lie unless there was significant economic stimulus \nin 2003 and 2004, and also you can't have any increases. It happens to \nfit the Daschle plan. It doesn't fit any plan I have seen on this side, \nso it is kind of a carve-out. We will have a budget point of order or \nsuper point of order against any bill I have seen, but certainly not \nthe minority leader's plan.\n\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the motion to waive. And then I \nwill move to table the second amendment at the appropriate time.\n  Also, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nsecond amendment be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I take a second to update Members as to the schedule for \nthis evening and the remainder of the week. There are approximately 35 \nhours remaining for the consideration of the budget resolution. The two \nmanagers were here late into the evening yesterday and have been here \nall day today. Both are ready for business. Thus, we will continue to \naround 11 o'clock tonight. Members who will be offering amendments \nshould notify the chairman or ranking member so there can be some sense \nof order to the process, both tonight and over the next several days, \nas well.\n  We will finish the budget resolution this week. To that effort, the \nSenate will need to remain in session late into the evening tonight, \ntomorrow night, and likely the next night. With that, we will consume \nthe statutory limit of time. Members should be aware of these lengthy \nsessions this week and adjust their schedules accordingly.\n  With respect to tonight, there will be one other amendment laid down \nshortly. That amendment will relate to ANWR. A number of Senators will \nwant to speak on that issue tonight. I do not anticipate any further \nrollcall votes tonight.\n  Again, I will alert Members that we will remain in session late.\n  Mr. REID. If the leader will yield, speaking for this side of the \naisle, the ANWR amendment will be laid down. Senator Conrad, the \nmanager on our side, and our leader, have indicated it would be to \neveryone's interest on our side to debate ANWR tonight. So if Members \nhave a speech to give on ANWR on our side, it should be done tonight \nbecause there will shortly be a unanimous consent agreement that we \nwill attempt to have approved that has the approval of both leaders \nthat will take us to other amendments tomorrow morning, pay-go and the \ntax cut to be offered on our side. The two leaders have indicated these \nwould be stacked for votes sometime tomorrow afternoon.\n  On our side, I repeat, we have all night tonight to debate as much as \npeople want on ANWR. Tomorrow morning and afternoon on our side will be \na very limited time to speak on ANWR.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we will also encourage our Members to \nspeak on ANWR tonight. I do know there is at least one Member who wants \nto speak on ANWR tomorrow--at least two people.\n  The other statements were correct. Pay-go will be laid down tomorrow, \nanother amendment will be laid down in the morning, and we will likely \nhave stacked votes some time tomorrow afternoon, the time to be \ndetermined based on people's schedules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield as \nmuch time as the Senator from California desires to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 272\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. I ask the following cosponsors be included on this \namendment: Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nEdwards, and Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, and \n     Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Reid, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 272.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prevent consideration of drilling in the Arctic National \n      Wildlife Refuge in a fast-track budget reconciliation bill)\n\n       On page 45, beginning on line 13, strike subsection (a) \n     (the reconciliation instruction to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources).\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is a great honor for me to offer this \namendment. I hope very much that Members on both sides will support it. \nThe amendment is very simple. It strikes the reconciliation \ninstructions given to the Energy Committee that will lead to oil \ndrilling in a pristine place in America, a God-given gift, the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  We are striking, in essence, the instructions, and that will in \nessence say, no, we will not have drilling in this pristine area.\n  There are so many Members on both sides of the aisle that want to \nspeak on this tonight, I will give a little instruction as to the \nbeauty of the refuge, and then I will yield to my colleagues as they \ncome over, and get back to the stream of my four-part argument.\n  In light of the world situation, we need to see something beautiful. \nThis is something quite beautiful. I will show some beautiful \nphotographs from the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. This is Wild \nSweet Pea and Marsh Creek in the coastal plain. It speaks volumes to \nwhat God has given us.\n  This picture on the plain shows the caribou and beautiful mountains \nwith the water in front. The last time we debated this issue, I showed \nthis photograph and one of my colleagues from Alaska said this is not \nwhere it is going to happen. We quickly called to Alaska and had their \nwildlife people confirm that is a fact.\n  Let me show more of the wildlife. This is a magnificent bird, the \nchart\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\nbird. This unbelievable photograph shows a polar bear reflected in the \nwater. Cast your eyes on this. This is pretty extraordinary. One cannot \npaint anything quite as magnificent as what God has created. The musk \noxen is seen running through this area. The next photograph shows the \nporcupine caribou swimming. These are pretty extraordinary photographs.\n  This gives Members an idea of what we are trying to save and why we \nask colleagues from both sides of the aisle to please support us in \nstriking this instruction from the budget.\n  I first make an argument about process. After I do that, I am going \nto yield to my colleague from Connecticut for up to 10 minutes.\n  This debate over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, though it is \ncoming in the evening at 6 p.m., is a very important debate. It is a \nvery important environmental issue. If you look at some of the polling \ndata from every one of our States, people believe very strongly that \nthis place should be preserved, as it was when it was given to us.\n  The fact we are discussing it as an amendment to the budget bill is, \nit seems to me, inappropriate. It deserves to have much more debate. It \ndeserves to have much more consideration. It deserves to have much more \npublic input. It deserves to have much more time. But this is the hand \nwe are dealt. We are dealt a hand where, without even mentioning the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge except in one line, it really is kind \nof snuck into this budget resolution.\n\n  But be that as it may, the result is the same. We then move forward \nunder reconciliation and we could not stop it except if we were able to \nget the majority vote. We could not really filibuster it.\n  I want to have printed in the Record a letter on this point from \nOlympia Snowe, Lincoln Chafee, and there are four others on this. I \nwill read their names: Susan Collins, John McCain, Mike DeWine, Peter \nFitzgerald. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, January, 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: With the start of the 108th Congress, \n     we believe the Senate has an opportunity and obligation to \n     set the nation's fiscal priorities by ensuring that a sound \n     and responsible budget blueprint is adopted. As this \n     important work begins, we respectfully ask for your \n     leadership in promoting an FY 2004 budget that does not \n     include an assumption for the leasing of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge or reconciliation instructions directing the \n     raising of such revenue.\n       Because the opening of the Arctic Refuge to drilling raises \n     a host of policy concerns, including serious environmental \n     ramifications, we do not believe this issue should be \n     injected in the budget process. Opening up the Arctic Refuge \n     proved to be extremely controversial in the 107th Congress \n     and was debated at length during the Senate's consideration \n     of an omnibus energy bill. Ultimately, on April 18, 2002, by \n     a vote of 54-46, the Senate defeated a procedural motion to \n     invoke cloture on an amendment that would have opened the \n     Arctic Refuge to drilling. With its strict rules limiting \n     debate, the budget is not conducive to adequate consideration \n     of an issue of this magnitude.\n       We believe that the Arctic Refuge should be preserved and \n     that budgetary effects of oil leases in the Refuge are \n     incidental when considering the profound negative impact of \n     drilling in the Arctic Refuge.\n       Accordingly, given the strict rules governing debate of the \n     budget and the significance of our national policy on the \n     Arctic Refuge, we respectfully ask that you resist efforts to \n     include provisions in the FY 2004 budget resolution related \n     to opening up the Arctic Refuge for drilling.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Olympia Snowe.\n     Lincoln Chafee.\n     Susan Collins.\n     Mike DeWine.\n     John McCain.\n     Peter Fitzgerald.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. They make this point I think quite eloquently. They say:\n\n       Because the opening of the Arctic refuge to drilling raises \n     a host of policy concerns including serious environmental \n     ramifications, we do not believe the issue should be injected \n     into the budget process.\n\n  I have to applaud my Republican friends who wrote this letter. Such \nan important issue about such a place involving such beauty should not \nbe the subject of a little amendment here dealing with reconciliation. \nWe need to have much more serious debate.\n  I will close this part of my statement in this way. In 1960, when \nPresident Eisenhower set aside 8.9 million acres to form the original \nArctic Range, his Secretary of the Interior noted that the area was:\n\n       one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness areas \n     in North America, a wilderness experience not duplicated \n     elsewhere.\n\n  As you can see, nothing has changed about that description. It \nremains a special place, richer in wildlife than perhaps any other part \nof the country.\n  I say to my Republican friends, it was a Republican President who \nsaid let's preserve this place forever. It seems sad that the \nRepublican President now is saying let's simply turn our back on this \nlegacy. I hope Republicans and Democrats will join together. I think we \nhave a good chance to do it and stand up tonight during debate and \ntomorrow when we have this vote, and make the case that this is a \nspecial place that deserves protection.\n  There is not enough oil in it to make a whit of difference, which I \nwill get into later. Let's do the right thing here.\n  I am very pleased Senator Lieberman is here. He has taken a \ntremendous leadership role on this issue. It is my delight to yield him \n10 minutes, or if he needs more time, I am happy to yield that as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for introducing this amendment and taking \nthe lead role on it. It is characteristic of the way in which, ever \nsince she came to the Senate, she has been a great champion for \nenvironmental protection, for natural resource conservation, and for \nthe protection of the American people from the assaults on their health \nthat are so often represented by environmental pollution.\n  I rise to support the amendment and to say, once again, the issue is \njoined here about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Will we allow \noil companies to drill for oil on this extraordinary piece of America, \none of God's great gifts to this country? The pictures speak much more \nthan 1,000 words about the beauty and magnificence, the tranquility, \nthe sense that you are looking at a piece of Earth the way it looked \naround the time of creation, if I may take some liberties with the \ndescription.\n  Is it worth desecrating--and I use that word advisedly--this \nmagnificent part of America for oil, 6 months' worth of oil, to ruin \nthe natural beauty of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge forever for 6 \nmonths' worth of oil which will reduce our dependency on foreign oil by \nthe year 2020, if, God forbid, drilling is allowed, from 62 percent to \n60 percent?\n  This question before us invokes the extent to which we value and wish \nto protect in the spirit not only of Eisenhower but in the spirit of \nthe seminal figure in American government for the conservation ethic, \nwhich is another great Republican President, Teddy Roosevelt. Do we \nvalue this land and are we prepared to protect it or are we going to \ndesecrate it, diminish it, change it forever for a small amount of oil? \nIs that really what our energy policy should be about? Does it really \noffer us any hope of more energy independence which we strive for? The \nanswer of course is, no, it is not worth it.\n  This is a battle that has gone on now in Congress for more than a \nquarter of a century. It is one of the reasons why I sought to come to \nthe Senate of the United States in my campaign in 1988, because the \nincumbent Senator I declared against had voted in favor of drilling for \noil in the Arctic Refuge. It is a battle I have been proud to continue \nto wage with colleagues on both sides of the aisle over the 14-plus \nyears I have been here. I feel sometimes as if we are guards at the \nborders protecting the beauty that those pictures illuminate.\n  Here the issue is joined again and joined, if I may say so, in a way \nthat is a backdoor method. It is kind of an abuse of process, if I can \nuse a term from my old law practice and attorney general days. It is an \nabuse of practice because it attempts to allow for the drilling for oil \nin the Arctic Refuge by including the permission and authorization in a \nbudget bill. It does it, of course, for one reason, which is to\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\novercome and avoid the Senate's proud tradition of unlimited debate.\n  Senator Byrd is in the Chamber. I have heard him speak so eloquently \nabout this, and about the extent to which the Senate honors this \ntradition. Of course, this goes back to the very way in which our \nFounders and Framers conceived of the Senate, the famous saucer and cup \nmetaphor. I have heard the Senator say, and have been moved by it, the \nrule of unlimited debate--filibuster, if you will--is there to protect \nthe Nation, its values--in this case its resources, unmatched natural \nbeauty and resources--from falling to the passions of the moment that \ndestroy something timeless, our values, or in this case, again, the \nnatural beauty of a part of America. For what?\n  That is exactly why we ought not as a matter of process allow this \nend run to occur. I would like to think that even those who favor \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge would consider voting for this amendment \nSenator Boxer has introduced just on the principle of it, the process \nprinciple of it. If we allow this controversy to be settled in a \nbackdoor method with far less than 60 votes, which would be required on \ncloture, we are opening the door for this to happen on more and more \nissues that are of concern to our colleagues.\n  That is the fundamental question that is raised as a matter of \nprocess, the substance I have spoken to, a 62- to 60-percent reduction \nin dependence on foreign oil. This is of course the wrong policy. But \nwe need to invest our resources in alternative, renewable, clean \nsources of energy. We have so many. We need to depend on sources of \nenergy that are within our possession, not dispersed in unsettled areas \nof the world that compromise our international security and \ninternational independence. We need to require vehicles to be more fuel \nefficient. That would save much more energy and make us a much stronger \ncountry than the drilling for oil in this most beautiful place.\n  The coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge has been called the American \nSerengeti. It is inhabited by 135 species of birds and 45 species of \nland mammals. The plain crosses all five different eco-regions of the \nArctic. It is breathtakingly beautiful.\n  Some will argue in this debate, as they have off the floor, that you \ncan somehow put oil wells and pipelines into this area, and it is just \ngoing to be kind of a small blemish on the landscape of the refuge--a \nlittle brown mark on a red apple. But, believe me, this apple will soon \nbe rotten to the core. If we allow these pipelines to go on there and \nthis drilling to occur, there will be a series of blemishes--dozens of \nholes that will be connected together by roads, pipelines, and other \ninfrastructure. Spidering out of these blemishes would be an elaborate \nadditional infrastructure of roads and pipelines and airstrips and \nprocessing plants.\n  The effect of all this has been documented over and over again, most \nrecently in an independent study authorized and requested by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, which documented the impact of the \ndrilling that has gone on in other areas in this part of America, and \ndocumented it in a very discouraging and upsetting way.\n  This is going to be a close vote. We have had many close calls in \nthis long-term, very worthy effort to protect the Arctic Refuge.\n  I was with a group of people the other day, advocates who are \nconcerned about the refuge. We were commenting that this battle has \nbeen going on for more than a quarter century here in the Senate. I \nmentioned I had been fighting it for my 15 years in the Senate. There \nwas a lady, a very distinguished woman from the Gwich'in Native \nAmerican people who inhabit this area, and she said: We have been \nliving here and working to protect and preserve this sacred ground for \nmore than 10,000 years.\n  That is what is on the line here: whether not just the Gwich'in \npeople but all the American people are going to be able to enjoy the \ntranquility, the perspective, for another 10,000 years, and another \n10,000 years beyond that, that comes from the natural magnificence that \nis dramatized in the pictures Senator Boxer has shown us.\n  This is not a time to ignore the basic conservationist--I would add, \nconservative--values of our country that teach us we ought not to look \nat every available natural resource area in our country as something \nmore to exploit. Our values are stronger than that and longer term than \nthat. We owe the Earth that God has given us more respect than that. \nNature, after all, reminds us of our humanity. And that is what \nconservation and this battle on this amendment are all about.\n  So I thank my colleagues of both parties for standing with us. I \nthank Senator Boxer again for being such a leader, a battler, a \nchampion for what is right. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager of the bill, \nSenator Conrad, I yield 15 minutes off the resolution to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might add, if we could make clear \nthat when Senator Byrd concludes, Senator Kerry be recognized for 10 to \n15 minutes to speak on the amendment that is pending.\n  Mr. REID. That would be yielded off of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, for her thoughtfulness and her characteristic \ncourtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 264\n\n  Mr. President, I speak with reference to the Conrad amendment No. \n264, which was voted on earlier today. I had hoped to speak prior to \nthe vote on that amendment, but I was unable to do so.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that was before the Senate at that time \nwas one of simple common sense. The President, last night, spoke to the \nNation of imminent military action. The American people know that war \nis looming. The Senate knows that war is looming. And yet the budget \nresolution before the Senate ignores that war. It ignores the obvious \ncosts that are staring all of us square in the face. This Senate ought \nto be up front with the Nation and anticipate the costs of war in this \nbudget.\n  Last night, I went to the White House with a number of my colleagues \nfrom this body and from the other body. The message I carried was a \nsimple one. I will support the funds as ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee to ensure the safety of the men and women in \nour Armed Forces. They did not ask for this mission. They did not ask \nto go overseas. But they are there. They are ready to carry out their \norders. They are ready to defend America. I will not flinch when it \ncomes to their safety and support.\n  But I do not support the policy that sent them there or that sends \nthem there even though they will not have the support and endorsement \nof the United Nations.\n  What I will not support is a blank check for this administration to \nallow military action in Iraq to slowly creep into other operations, \ninto other lands. We have seen how the goal of disarmament in Iraq has \nchanged to fighting terrorism in Iraq, to ousting the leadership of \nIraq, to bringing peace to the Middle East through war in Iraq, to \nforcing Saddam Hussein and his sons from Iraq. Is it any wonder that I \nand others worry what goal may be next? Where is this preemptive \nstrategy taking us? Where are we taking the world?\n  I have stood in this Chamber time and again to warn of the dangers of \nthis policy of preemptive strike without imminent threat. I have urged \nthe President to step back and reconsider his decisions. But the \nadministration has its eyes shut, its ears covered, its mind closed. \nThe decision, apparently, has been made.\n  This is a war that does not have to be. This is a war that could be \navoided. But the President has placed this Nation on the road to war, \nand there is little hope, if any, of turning back.\n  In the coming days, we will hear again from the President. I hope \nthat, as he gives the command to commence military action, he and his \nadministration will be looking at several moves ahead.\n  Reconstruction and peacekeeping will be huge tasks. The American \npeople must be prepared for the strains of\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\nthese missions. We should not feed them rosy scenarios that a war will \nbe painless or that an occupation would be of minimal length. Nor \nshould we keep them in the dark. It is imperative that, in times of \ncrisis, the American people can maintain trust in their Government.\n  We must repair our alliances. Already our move to war has had fallout \nfor our closest ally, Britain, with the resignation of Britain's \nForeign Secretary. There is an ever-increasing chance of serious \nrepercussions in the Middle East. We will need the combined political \nstrength of all of our friends and allies, and the process of repairing \nour ties must begin immediately.\n  Winston Churchill once said about war:\n\n       The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that \n     once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of \n     policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable \n     events.\n\n  It is those unforeseeable and uncontrollable events that may be \nprecipitated by a war with Iraq that keep me awake at night. I wish I \ncould share the President's confidence that the toppling of Saddam \nHussein and his regime will set into motion a peaceful revolution in \nthe Middle East. Perhaps it will. We may be lucky. But I have watched \ntoo many decades of strife and bloodshed in the Middle East to believe \nthat yet another war can serve as a reliable road map to peace.\n  It is true that no one can predict the final cost of this war. But it \ncertainly is not zero. That is what the President has asked us to \nbudget, zero, and that is what the resolution would budget. Absolutely \nnothing. It is as if the looming war where simply a figment of one's \nimagination.\n  If only that were the case.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question before Senator \nKerry takes us back to this very important environmental amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to thank my colleague once again for \ncontinuing to speak out from his heart on an issue that is on \neveryone's mind. I remember so well standing with my friend on this \nissue and coming to the floor in October and laying out a number of \nquestions. How much would this war cost, I was asking in October. How \nlong do we plan to stay in Iraq? Who would bear the combat risk with \nus? Who was going to pick up the bill? Are there any other countries, \nand what would they pay? And what is the impact of this war on \nterrorism here at home? Are we prepared?\n  It seems to me amazing--the question I have for my friend is--that \nhere we are debating the budget for this year and everyone knows \nexactly what is going to happen because the President has been very \nopen about it. We are going in there. I say to my friend, does he have \none more answer today than he had those 5 months ago, in October? Does \nhe have one more answer to those economic questions or those very \nimportant questions that were raised at that time than he had 5 months \nago?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have had no answer. I received no answer, \nno estimates whatsoever. And the administration, through some of its \ndepartment heads, has said: That is impossible. It is impossible. And \nwhy should we do that? That would be--if I may use my own words--a \nwasteful exercise. The administration has sent forth no estimate.\n  Of course, we all understand that there can be no hard and fast \nestimate at this point. Many of us have been Members of this body and/\nor the other one through previous wars. We know how difficult it is to \ncome up with solid estimates. But we also know when an administration \nis leveling with us. After all, we are the elected representatives of \nthe American people. They send us here. They are entitled to know the \nanswers to these questions. The American people are entitled to know \nwhat is the best estimate at this particular time and, under the \nconditions the administration foresees at this point, what are the best \nestimates of the actual cost of the war in treasure and blood, what is \nthe best estimate with respect to the occupation of Iraq, the morning \nafter, reconstruction in Iraq. But we get nothing. We get nothing from \nthe administration.\n  The administration treats the elected representatives of the American \npeople with seeming contempt. When the representatives of the people \nask those questions, the answer, may I say to the Senator, is what it \nwas then: We don't have the estimates.\n  The administration is no nearer now than it was then in giving it to \nus. I think it is our duty to continue to ask.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I certainly will continue to ask.\n  I believe under the previous order Senator Kerry gets the floor; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Was a request made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was made without objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have been waiting for time. I would hope we would not \nenter a unanimous consent request without some consultation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An order has already been entered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. For parliamentary purposes, I don't want to have the \nSenator from Alaska believe something was abused here. I would like to \nsee what he would like. There was no effort to try to slide something \nby. There was nobody else on the floor, and the Senator just asked if \nwe could have a little bit of time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am perfectly happy. I will seek \nrecognition when the lady has finished.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think the request was for 10 to 15 \nminutes. That is all. Then I will yield the floor. The Senator can \nproceed as he desires.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nminute outside of that time. I want to say a few words to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, to whom I have \nlistened over the course of the last months, who has asked \nextraordinarily important questions of the Senate. While we differ on \nthe vote, we don't differ in our goals or on what we believe have been \nthe failures of diplomacy over the course of the last months. He is \nabsolutely correct about the failure to be forthcoming. One can desire \na goal and hope that an administration is in fact going to implement \nthe goal effectively. Many of us feel bitterly disappointed by the way \nin which diplomacy, relations with Congress, the transparency, the \ndegree of effectiveness of our involvement with allies--there are a \nhost of failures that raise extraordinary questions.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia whose years here are \nunparalleled and whose credibility as a consequence is unmatched by \nanybody here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nkind remarks. He is overly charitable, and I deeply appreciate them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 272\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from California. I thank her for bringing this amendment, which \nis one of the most important issues we will vote on in the Senate this \nyear. It is not just a vote to protect a refuge; it is a refuge; it is \na pristine wilderness.\n  The words ``pristine wilderness'' together mean something. They carry \nmore than just the notion of a policy put in place by President \nEisenhower in 1960, I believe, reinforced later in the Alaska Lands Act \nsigned by President Carter. This is a national treasure. The words \n``pristine wilderness'' both are destroyed, the entire concept is \ndestroyed, by what this amendment seeks to do, may I add, not in the \nnormal process of legislation as we approach it here but slipped into \nthe budget for the specific purpose of trying to bypass the normal \nrules of the Senate.\n  Now, certainly, any tool is available to anybody, but I think \nAmericans ought to judge whether or not they want a pristine wilderness \ndestroyed in its pristineness and in its wilderness for the sake of a \nminor, tiny percentage of oil that has no impact on world oil prices, \nhas no impact--or negligible, to be accurate, about a 2 percent impact \nultimately, 10 years from now, if it delivers its potential--on the \ntotal amount of dependency on American oil from abroad.\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\n  In 1975, when President Carter first began to wrestle with the issue \nof America's dependency on oil, we were about 35 percent dependent on \nforeign oil. At that time, we sought to reduce that dependency and to \ncreate alternatives, renewables, and to move to a different kind of \nenergy base.\n  Today, after all the talk of seriousness of purpose, guess what. The \nUnited States of America is no longer 35 percent dependent; we are \napproaching 60 percent dependency on foreign oil. God only gave us 3 \npercent of the world's oil. Saudi Arabia has 46 percent. The Middle \nEast, in total, has about 65 percent. So do the equation. Any kid in \nAmerica can do this equation.\n  If the United States only has 3 percent of the world's oil, and the \nMiddle East has 65 percent of the world's oil, and your demand for oil \nis going from 35 percent to 60 percent, a 2 percent difference for the \ndestruction of the wilderness does not solve America's problem.\n  The bottom line is, there is only one way to solve America's problem. \nYou cannot drill your way out of America's problem. You have to invent \nyour way out of America's problem. Inventing your way out of America's \nproblem means beginning to push the curve on the creation of an \nentirely differently based economy--a hydrogen-based economy or some \nother. We could do that if we were to harness the energy of our \ncolleges, universities, and venture capitalists and create the tens of \nthousands--if not hundreds of thousands--of high-value-added jobs that \nwould come from pushing in that direction.\n  So my objection is to the proposal by those who want to drill in the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge, which is shortsighted and destructive of a \nwilderness. This photograph represents what the wilderness looks like \ntoday. If you start drilling, this other photo is what it could look \nlike. It will be no longer a wilderness.\n  Most recently, the GAO issued a report that said there is an enormous \nnegative downside to the environment in those areas in which we have \nalready agreed to drill. In those areas in which we have already agreed \nto drill, there is an extraordinary amount of drilling left to be done. \nWe have enormous leases that are available and open that can be \npursued. We don't need to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. In fact, \nthe most important oil companies of the country are not particularly \nseeking to drill there. They don't have any intention of drilling \nthere, except to the degree that it is opened up and someone else goes \nthere; then they may believe, competitively, that they have to.\n  Lord John Brown, the president of British Petroleum--which has been \nworking hard to push solar and alternatives and renewables--said \npublicly: We don't really need the Alaska refuge. We don't think it is \nthe principal place to drill.\n  The real drilling for America's future is offshore drilling in the \nGulf of Mexico. I know some will argue that it is an energy security \nmagic bullet. But I have described why it is not a magic bullet, No. 1. \nNo. 2, this is not sound energy policy.\n\n  The United States of America is still spending, I think, about $6 \nbillion in order to provide oil and gas fossil fuel incentives. The \ntotal incentive of the United States for alternatives and renewables is \n$24 million. Billions of dollars to go after fossil fuel, which we know \nis a dependency that leads us nowhere--in fact, it leads us to \nincreased global warming problems, to increased dependency on foreign \noil--$24 million going into alternatives and renewables.\n  Europe has a much better sense of the future than, apparently, this \nadministration in the United States right now. Great Britain has \ndetermined that they are going to provide almost all of their \nelectricity in Great Britain--even though they are oil rich in the \nNorth Sea--from windmills, wind power, over the next 10 to 15 years. If \nyou go to Holland or Denmark, you will see in the bays off those \ncountries windmills that are providing enormous power.\n  In Minnesota, in our own country, I have met farmers who are actually \nearning more providing wind power to their local farm neighbors. From \nwindmills, wind power, they are earning more, providing some 2,000 \nfarms with power, than they are from farming. Think of what you could \ndo if you began to move to biomass ethanol or corn-based ethanol for \nIowa and for other States that grow and farm, which are already in huge \ndependency on the U.S. Government for billions of dollars--to do \nnothing or to not grow.\n  We are completely on the wrong track. This effort to try to drill in \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge is a misguided effort to try to keep America \nlocked into a place that takes us nowhere. I believe we need to open up \na different future for this country, and the Energy Information \nAdministration concluded last year that drilling in the refuge would \nonly reduce oil imports by a tiny 2 percent, which provides no security \nto the United States at all. It is not good environmental policy, it is \na terrible excuse for an energy policy, and it seems to me that \ndomestic and renewable sources are urgently needed.\n  Why? Well, no foreign government can embargo them. No Saddam Hussein \ncan seize control of them and reduce the flow. No cartel can play games \nwith them. No American soldier will ever have to go and protect them \nwith his or her life because they are here, they are home grown, and \nthey don't put us into that predicament.\n  So I will be voting in support of Senator Boxer's amendment in favor \nof protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. We have had this debate before. A majority \nof the Senate had decided previously that this does not contribute to \nthe energy policy of our Nation, and I hope we will stand by that \ndecision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nyield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming and that I be recognized \nafter that time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I have \nan understanding as to how much time will be used on your side before \nit returns to our side of the aisle?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my intention to use such time as \nmay be available to me in making statements to answer comments made by \nthe Senator from California and the Senator from Massachusetts. I have \nno estimate of how long I am going to take.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding--and I may be mistaken--all I am trying to establish is \nhow long you will speak on your side before it returns to this side of \nthe aisle. Can the Senator give us an estimation of the time that you \nwill use?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't think I am limited in time. I will yield myself \ntime off the bill, by authority of the manager on our side. I don't \nknow how much time. I will not agree to a time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am just confused. Senator Thomas is \ngoing to speak for how many minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it on this measure? Senator Durbin has been here, and \nhe would like 10 minutes, too. If you can work him in following Senator \nThomas, then the Senator from Alaska can talk the night away if he \nwants.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator that I will speak \nnow, and then I will yield to him later. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for a second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just to clarify, I believe the Senator from California \nyielded to both the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, in addition to making an opening speech. So there were \nat least three speakers.\n  The Senator from Wyoming wanted 10 minutes, and the Senator from \nAlaska wishes to speak as well. So we would like to have the idea that \nwe would alternate back and forth, but I believe there were three \nconsecutive speakers on your side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend, if he does not mind \nyielding to me for an answer, we were very brief on this side. I spoke \nabout 7 minutes. Several speakers spoke for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\nAll I am trying to do is get Senator Durbin into the debate. Senator \nStevens may well want to go on for an hour or so. We just do not know. \nWe are just trying to work Senator Durbin in at some point.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a request pending, and I ask it \neither be agreed to or I be permitted to start speaking. I believe I \nstill have the floor; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have withdrawn my request. If the Senator wishes to \nask me a question, I will be glad to answer the question. I would be \npleased to make a request that the Senator from Wyoming be accommodated \nin his request to speak for 10 minutes. I do not wish at this time to \nbe limited to the amount of time I can speak. I am speaking about my \nState. I am speaking about the future of my State, and I do not see why \nI should be yielding back and forth 5 minutes at a time in terms of \nspeaking on this issue. It is a very important issue to me. I do not \nknow how long I am going to speak, but I am not going to speak all \nnight, obviously. I am not prone to long speeches, but I do not wish to \nsay how long I am going to speak at this time.\n  I renew the request that the Senator from Wyoming have 10 minutes; \nafter that, I be recognized to make my statement about an issue so \nvital to my State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I appreciate the \nopportunity to talk a few moments about energy for this country, about \nan energy policy that we have not yet developed and have the \nresponsibility to develop. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about \nthe requirement for an energy policy.\n  We worked on this issue last year, my colleagues will recall, and did \nnot get this done. It is more necessary now than before that we have an \nenergy policy for the future of this country's economy. It is a little \nnaive to talk about all the little problems when we do not talk about \nwhere we need to be. And if we paid attention at all to what has been \ndone in energy over the last several years and what the demands are \ngoing to be for energy, we would start being a little more realistic \nabout where we want to go.\n  I have listened for several years to the environmentalists and the \npolitical aspect of energy, and I think that is what it is. We need to \ntalk about the realism of providing energy for American families and \nfor the jobs that are required.\n  Energy is such an important element in our lives. I live in a State \nthat is a producer of energy. I live in a State where we have lots of \npublic lands. I live in a State where we have been able to have access \nto public lands and production from public lands without ruining the \nenvironment.\n  Most of us recognize that America is now 60 percent or more dependent \non foreign sources of oil. Much of that comes from areas of the world \nthat are now in great upheaval and are hostile to the interests of the \nUnited States. Oil represents about one-third of our trade deficit. We \nspend hundreds of millions of dollars per day overseas to support \nunstable regimes around the world. ANWR is one of America's best \nchances for a major discovery, as much as 16 billion barrels of oil. \nEach barrel produced at home is one less we need to buy abroad.\n\n  Just a few months ago, we saw the labor strike in Venezuela shut down \noil production there. It halted nearly 15 percent of our imports. A \nthreatened strike in Nigeria also constrained oil supplies, and we saw \nthe result of that in prices this time. One of these days, we will see \nthe result in a shortage of energy.\n  Domestic oil inventories are at an all-time low level, the lowest in \n27 years, destroyed by the strike in Venezuela and a colder than \naverage winter. There is very little excess capacity in the world for \noil production. The International Energy Agency recently said that the \nglobal oil supply is running on empty. They said that on March 13. \nDevelopment of ANWR will, of course, ease the strain on global markets \nbut ensure a continued stable supply.\n  In addition, of course, higher oil prices are a tax increase on the \nU.S. economy, and every American citizen feels that loss. Economists \nestimate a loss of 0.5 percent in GDP for every $10 increase in oil \ncosts. Every American family spends more of their money on energy, and \nit leaves less money for other important priorities, such as education, \nhealth care, investments in new homes, and in the economy.\n  Energy costs hit lower income Americans the hardest. A family earning \nless than $15,000 a year spends 14 percent of its household budget on \nenergy compared to only 2.3 percent for a family earning $50,000 a \nyear, and we are very concerned about that. We talk about it all the \ntime. Here is an opportunity to do something about it. Diesel prices \nand truckers--there are lots of issues, and we all know what they are.\n  I think, too, we ought to talk--and I am sure the Senator from Alaska \nwill--about the development of oil and gas in ANWR. It will be \nconducted with the best advanced technology available in America today: \nIce roads, directional drilling, 3-D seismic exploration, many we have \nused in Wyoming. We know it can be done. New technologies allow a field \nthe size of Prudhoe Bay, with 20 percent of U.S. oil supply for the \nlast 25 years, to be developed in an area less than the size of Dulles \nAirport.\n  This proposed development at ANWR would be limited to less than 2,000 \nacres in an area of 19 million acres, close to the coast, not up in the \nmountains as the picture always shows. The picture is not valid. It is \nnot true. It is not there.\n  Exploration will be limited to the winter months, November to May, to \nprotect breeding and wildlife migration patterns.\n  I have been through this a number of times. I have been to Alaska. I \nhave been to this area. I am satisfied it is going to be a great boon \nto our need for energy. I am satisfied it can be done in a way that is \nenvironmentally satisfactory, and I think it can be a great boon for \nour economy. I certainly hope we can take an opportunity to provide a \nbetter chance for our future economy by opening this field.\n  I thank my colleague for the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my blood pressure goes up when this \namendment comes up because I was in the Eisenhower administration, and \nI was one of those who participated in drawing the order which led to \nthe creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Range. That order stated \nspecifically that the area involved was withdrawn from all forms of \nappropriations under the public land laws, including the mining but not \nthe mineral leasing laws. So starting in that period in the fifties, \nthe area of Alaska way up in the corner, 9 million acres, was set aside \nat the request of the Fairbanks Women's Garden Club.\n  My then-boss, Secretary Fred Seaton, Secretary of the Interior, \ndecided to take that action, and it was subsequently confirmed by \nPresident Eisenhower 2 years later.\n  That land along the Arctic has never been closed--never been closed--\nto oil and gas leasing and exploration. In 1980, President Carter \nsigned a law after the election which set aside over 100 million acres \nof Alaska land.\n  I start off with this map to show our State is the largest State in \nthe Union. One-fifth the size of all the land under the American flag \nis in Alaska. When one looks at this map, all the colored areas have \nbeen set aside by an act of Congress. They are no longer available for \ndevelopment in Alaska. These lands were set aside after prolonged \nbattle over the Alaska lands.\n  One of the few conditions, stipulations we requested was that this \narea of the Arctic Plain be open for oil and gas exploration. At that \ntime, I parted from my then-colleague, Senator Gravel of Alaska, and \nallowed this bill to become law in 1980, which President Carter \nsigned based upon the commitment that was made to me by two Senators.\n\n  This is the photograph that was taken at the time we entered that \nagreement, Senator Jackson of Washington, Senator Tsongas of \nMassachusetts, and myself, in 1980. I was the minority whip, Senator \nJackson was chairman of the Interior Committee, and Senator Tsongas was \na member of that committee. I was in the minority.\n  These gentlemen wished to withdraw over 100 million acres of Alaska. \nWe\n\n[[Page S3861]]\n\nasked for some stipulations pertaining to access and other such matters \nthat were in the bill President Carter signed. The one area we asked be \nmaintained to be available for oil and gas was the Arctic Plain. I say \nthis in all humility, but those who come to this floor and say that is \nwilderness are not telling the truth. It is not a wilderness area. It \nhas never been a wilderness area. It was specifically left out of the \ndesignation of wilderness and it is not wilderness.\n  Those photographs we have seen of caribou, the caribou are the \nporcupine herd. They come up from Canada. They come up and they calve \nin this area in the summertime. Oil and gas exploration does not take \nplace in the summertime. The tundra is soft. We wait until it is frozen \nand we build ice roads across. The caribou are not there when the oil \nand gas exploration takes place, and the assertion that it is \nwilderness is absolutely not true. Those who offer these photographs \nand claim this is wilderness ought to come in here and say that.\n  By the way, I do not know where that crossing is which the Senator \nfrom California is displaying in her chart, but I presume that it is in \nJune sometime when the caribou come up and leave within, at the \nmaximum, 6 weeks. As a matter of fact, in recent years, they have not \ncome up at all. They have gone up to calve on the Canadian side of the \nArctic.\n  In any event, of the enormous amount of caribou that reside in \nAlaska, and they do reside there year round, this herd does not reside \nthere year round. It migrates up for a few days in the summertime. The \ncentral Alaska herd which is up around Prudhoe Bay--I heard all of \nthese arguments about caribou and I saw the beautiful pictures at the \ntime the oil pipeline amendment was on the floor to authorize the \nconstruction, the right of way of the Alaska oil pipeline. We heard \nclaims that the action in building that pipeline would destroy the \ncaribou, that they would suffer all sorts of harm. As a matter of fact, \nthat is a myth. The caribou herd in the vicinity of the oil pipeline is \nalmost six times larger than it was at the time the pipeline was built. \nOil and gas activity does not harm the caribou at all. There is no \nproof whatsoever it ever harmed the caribou.\n  That is not the only caribou herd. There is a western caribou herd. \nThere are more resident caribou, not migrating caribou, in Alaska than \npeople. I represent more caribou than I do people. I am trying to \nrepresent those caribou, too, because they are maligned by this \nassertion that oil and gas activity has harmed them when their numbers \nhave grown so greatly since that took place.\n  Some claim this oil and gas activity we seek to have take place in \nthe 1002 area, as we call it, is opposed by the native people. We are \ngoing to hear that from people on the other side of the aisle. That is \nnot true, either. There is one group of Alaska Indians whose basic home \nis in Canada, the Gwich'ins, who reside on the South Slope of the \nBrooks Range. At the most, they number a thousand of our people and \nsome of them are in Canada. They oppose it. All the people of the North \nSlope and the Alaska Federation of Natives, which represents over \n100,000 Alaska native people, support going forward with the oil and \ngas activity in this 1002 area.\n\n  The real problem about it is, I have trouble trying to get people to \nunderstand the size of Alaska. I want to show Alaska's map superimposed \non the South 48, as we call it. As we can see, Alaska is almost as wide \nand almost as deep as the United States. Up in the corner is the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge which was created in 1980, which engulfed the \nArctic Range. The Arctic Range came down like this, and this is the \n1002 area in green. It is not part of the wildlife refuge.\n  When the oil and gas activity is over, we stipulated it would revert \nto the Refuge. My colleagues cannot see it, but right up there is a \nlittle dot. This green area is a million and a half acres. That little \ndot is 2,000 acres. We have agreed that not more than 2,000 acres will \nbe used out of the million and a half acres set aside for oil and gas \ndevelopment in prosecuting the exploration and development of oil and \ngas in the North Slope.\n  I think we have to take a look at what is going on in terms of the \nestimates that have been made. I understand there have been assertions \nof fact that I disagree with entirely. The largest untapped oil field \nin the North American continent is the area of the Arctic Plain, or the \n1002 area. There is estimated recoverable oil there of 10.3 billion \nbarrels.\n  For historic basis, let's go back to the time that Prudhoe Bay was \ndiscovered and we were trying to build this enormous pipeline from \nValdez to Prudhoe Bay. The estimate then was there would be a billion \nbarrels of oil in that reserve at Prudhoe Bay. Last year, out of \nPrudhoe Bay, we produced the fourteenth billionth barrel of oil. The \nestimates were conservative fourteen times over. They said there would \nbe about a billion barrels of oil, and we have produced already 14 \nbillion barrels and we know we have more to go.\n  Some people assert this is a small amount of oil. It is more than is \nproduced in Texas. Our reserves are greater than Texas's. The estimated \ndaily production is about 1.4 million barrels a day from the 1002 area, \nfrom the area we are talking about. Texas produces 1,065,000 barrels. \nWe can see across the level of production as far as the--we produce \n972,000 barrels from Prudhoe Bay now and that is another story. That is \none of the stories I did not want to be limited on because I want to \ntell the Senate this story.\n  At the time we had the Persian Gulf war, at the request of the \nFederal Government, the throughput of the Alaska oil pipeline was \nincreased from 1.9 million barrels a day to 2.1 million barrels. We \nwent up 200,000 barrels a day to offset the loss of access to oil at \nthat time and the increased demand for oil because of the war.\n  Today, that throughput is 972,000 barrels. That pipeline is less than \nhalf full. Why? Since the 1970s, it has been producing from the Prudhoe \nBay area, and we need additional daily production. Where is it to come \nfrom? Where did we believe it would come from? We believed it would \ncome from the 1002 area, from the area that is in dispute as to whether \nor not we should drill it. If that area is not drilled and we do not \nget additional reserves, the time will come when it will be \nuneconomical to use the oil pipeline. That is really what these people \nwant. They want to go back and reverse history because they do not like \nthe oil pipeline becoming filled again.\n  This is the greatest reserve we have in the United States. This is \nanother depiction of the situation at the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. This is the refuge. The area in light brown is wilderness. The \narea in green is not wilderness. It is reserved for oil and gas \nexploration, and the balance of the area is wildlife refuge. The \nCoastal Plain is the 1002 area, a million and a half acres. Its \ndescription and its boundaries were drawn by Senator Jackson and \nSenator Tsongas in order to make sure the area would be available to \noil and gas exploration. As a matter of fact, when he signed the bill, \nPresident Carter referred to that. I quote from the signing ceremony \nfrom the administration of Jimmy Carter in 1980:\n\n       This act reaffirms our commitment to the environment. It \n     strikes a balance between protecting areas of great beauty \n     and value and allowing development of Alaska's vital oil and \n     gas and mineral and timber resources.\n\n  The only area covered by that bill that had any oil and gas potential \nwas the 1002 area. We have the right to explore and develop this 1.5 \nmillion acres, and President Carter withdrew over 100 million acres.\n\n  Now this amendment seeks, once again, to renege on that commitment my \ntwo friends from the Senate in 1980 made and put into law. It was not \njust a verbal commitment but a proposed development of the Arctic \nCoastal Plain of up to 1.5 million acres.\n  We have included in this resolution a reference to income that will \ncome from the bidding to develop oil in that area. It is $2.1 billion. \nThat is the beginning. We estimate the income to the Federal Government \nfrom the development of that area on an annual basis will be roughly $1 \nbillion a year. That is from the royalties that come from developing \nFederal land.\n  What has to be recognized is this is an area of barren tundra. Ask \nanyone who has been there in the wintertime. This is not some picture \nof caribou and\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\nlakes and a dreamy sort of place to be. As a matter of fact, one of the \nreasons the caribou do not come up is, the bugs are so bad, they go \ninto Canada. When they are really bad in that part of Alaska, they go \nto Canada. They go up there and get in the water to avoid the bugs.\n  If they want to show a picture of the 1002 area, that is it, as far \nas you can see--nothing but frozen tundra. You do not see any caribou; \nyou do not see any bears; you do not see pictures of beautiful flowers. \nThere are tourists in the summertime, the 6 weeks the caribou are \nthere, and they leave with the caribou. My Eskimo people stay there and \nlive there. They want this land drilled so they can have some income to \nsupport their lifestyle.\n  Before the oil and gas came up there, I used to go up there in the \n1950s, and it was a terrible place, to see how those people lived. Now, \nbecause of the revenue they get from the development of oil on the \nNorth Slope, they have nice homes, they have nice buildings, they have \none building with a nice elevator, they have a beautiful small college, \nthey have one of the most beautiful set of schools to be found anywhere \nin America. They support it with their money, coming from the taxes \nthey derive from drilling and activities on their land.\n  One time I took a postmaster general up there to visit the area. We \ngot into a bus right off the airplane and went over to the post office. \nHe went into the post office. I thought he would faint because the \ndigital thermometer said minus 99. It was a wind chill factor \nthermometer, minus 99. My people were living up there. We went to the \npost office; we went to lunch that day.\n  This is a picture of some of these children in Kaktovik. This is the \none village in the center of the area that people say is a wilderness \narea. Right in the center is this village of Kaktovik. You do not have \ndevelopment in wilderness--that is my memory. These are beautiful \npeople. And they know what they want. They want that area drilled so \nthey can continue to get the income, send their children to school, \nhave telephones, and have the kind of facilities we have everywhere \nelse in the country. Without it, they have no basic income. Their \nincome is in resources.\n  By the way, to shock the Senate, half the coal in the United States \nis also in Alaska. We do not produce it because a Senator came on the \nfloor one day and offered an amendment to prohibit the mining for coal \nunless the natural contour was restored after taking the coal out--a \nvirtual impossibility: Take tons of coal out of the tundra, and you are \nsupposed to restore the natural tundra. That has blocked coal \ndevelopment in Alaska for 45 years. That is another typical type of \namendment that comes from people with minds that oppose this.\n\n  Look at that picture. I hope the camera can compare that with where \nthe children are in wintertime. This is propaganda of the worst sort, \nfrom the richest people in the United States, who finance these extreme \nenvironmental organizations and come here and tell us how to live in \nAlaska. They spend more money in lobbying than the oil industry. They \nspend less money than the oil industry in protecting the environment. I \nhave an aside on that, too, which I will get to tomorrow.\n  Another aspect of this is pipeline prices. One of the problems about \nthe supply of oil in the United States is the ability to maintain some \nstability in prices. This is a busy chart, but it shows the \nrelationship of the throughput of Alaska pipeline to the price of oil \nin the United States. The green line is the throughput of the oil \npipeline. The red line is the price of oil. As the throughput started, \nas we started to build the pipeline, the price kept going up. But when \nwe reached the peak of production, the price was the lowest in the \nUnited States that it has been in 30 years. When we keep going, as the \npipeline throughput declined--and this is the current situation--the \nprice of gasoline in the whole United States went up. Our ability to \nproduce 25 percent of the domestically produced oil in the United \nStates stabilizes the price of oil and stabilizes the price of gasoline \nin the United States.\n  The price of gasoline today is up considerably. The price of aviation \ngas is almost double. The spiking price on gas, top demand gas, went up \nabout 900 percent this last week. We are running short of both oil and \ngas domestically produced. The way to keep prices down is to maintain \nthe ability to approve a substantial portion of what we consume. At the \ntime of the oil embargo of the 1970s, we imported 34 percent of our \noil. Today, we import 56 percent of our oil. That is what is causing \nthat price to go up.\n  This is a chart that shows the potential of production from ANWR to \nthe amount of imported crude oil by the barrels we are bringing in. We \nare bringing in 1.5 million barrels a day from Saudi Arabia; Canada \nsends 1.4; Mexico, 1.2; Venezuela, 1.2; Iraq, half a million, but the \nstability for prices comes from our ability to produce oil.\n  What is happening today is, the pipeline is less than half full. We \nneed to get greater reserves and start producing at the rate of at \nleast 1,000 barrels a day, fill up the pipeline, and we will maintain \nsome stability in the price of oil.\n  Now to the problem of people who I call extremists who say there is \nonly a 6-month supply of oil in ANWR. That assumes ANWR has only 3 \nbillion barrels, and the estimate is at least three times that. It also \nassumes the only oil the United States uses in that 6-month period is \nthat from ANWR. You could apply the same suggestion to Texas. If all \nthe current production of Texas was used and that was the only oil we \nused, it would be a 9-month supply. This one deposit in Alaska, under \ntheir computation, is 6 months. That is the worst statistic \neconomically I have ever seen used on the floor of the Senate. It is so \nmisleading as to be dishonest. It is a dishonest statistic.\n\n  I really believe we have to find some way to get Senators to \nunderstand what this is basically all about.\n  When Prudhoe Bay was developed, the technology then required using a \nsubstantial amount of land. Of the 19 million acres in the area known \nas ANWR, the Coastal Plain is 1.5 million acres, as I have said. The \nlimitation under the proposal before the Senate is 2,000 acres. This \nwould depict the size of Dulles Airport--13,000 acres. We are looking \nat an area that is so small it would fit into Dulles Airport more than \nsix times. We are not using a lot of land. We will not use a lot of \nland. We agreed to this limitation. Not more than 2,000 of the million \nand a half acres will be used for oil and gas development.\n  The other thing they say is there will be permanent damage to our \narctic tundra. This is an area that was developed. That was an oil well \nat one time. The whole area has been restored.\n  One of the interesting sidelights is what the University of Alaska \ndid when there was development of the Arctic. They developed a whole \nnew set of grasses that are planted in the area which produced some of \nthe best forage for caribou that was ever known. That is why that one \nherd increased almost six times.\n  This, at one time, what I just showed you, was a well right here \nsimilar to this well. As a matter of fact, it has been totally restored \nby virtue of the activities of our universities, as they have led the \ncountry in rehabilitation of land used for oil and gas development. We \nhave a commitment in every contract for drilling in Alaska to restore \nthe area to its original state or better. There will be no real \nproblem.\n  In terms of restoration, to date the oil industry has spent over $200 \nmillion in restoring the area that is used for oil development. We also \nhave more than $30 million committed to go further, to restore and \nstudy the vegetation, make certain everything is going to survive.\n  We have a problem with regard to gravel. Gravel itself has been \nremoved from drill beds and replaced. This is the most scientifically \ndesigned oil and gas development in the world, on Alaska's North Slope. \nWhat the opponents would rather have us do is go to Russia, I guess. \nOne of them even suggested that in a debate last year, we should look \nto Russia. I know Russia is going to produce substantial oil in the \nfuture. But there is no question that assertions made that we will be \npermanently damaging this property is wrong.\n  As a matter of fact, the permit issued by the Federal Government to \nuse this land states categorically that if and when the permittee \ndesires to abandon the activity authorized by the district\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\nengineer, the permittee must restore the area to a condition \nsatisfactory to the engineer. The State of Alaska says:\n\n       All operating areas shall be maintained and on completion \n     of the operation shall be left in a condition satisfactory to \n     the director.\n\n  We have absolute control over anyone's ability to abandon an area. \nThey must restore it under Federal and State law.\n  Where are we, when it comes right down to this? The real problem is--\nwhat are we talking about? We are talking about jobs for our people, \nand not just jobs for Alaskans, by the way. But I believe the experts, \nin terms of job creation, are America's unions. America's unions are \nbehind us in terms of our desire to open this area for oil and gas \nexploration: The Teamsters, the Seafarers International Union, the \nBuilding Construction Trades, the Iron Workers, Laborers, Operating \nEngineers, Masons, Sheetmetal Workers, Maritime Workers, Carpenters, \nPlumbers and Pipefitters.\n  There is no question in my mind that those people who are interested \nin the security of the United States, in terms of energy, should look \nto the Arctic.\n  I heard the Senator from Massachusetts talk about windmills. I invite \nhim to go to Alaska. We have some windmills in Alaska. They are working \nfairly well to supply power to very small areas.\n  He mentioned the United Kingdom and their fuel supply. Forty percent \nof the United Kingdom's fuel supply comes from natural gas; 32.2 \npercent comes from petroleum oil; only 1.1 percent comes from renewable \nenergy. Are we to rely on the 1.1 percent for the future of America?\n  He had a chart here that shows how much land it would take to have \nthe equivalent of this energy reproduced with wind power. It is \nsomething one must look at. I will refer to it as soon as it gets here.\n  One of my predecessors as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Hatfield, stood here on the floor one day and explained to the \nSenate why he was voting for the development of this area. He said he \nhoped never to see the day when one American would have to go overseas \nto try to protect an area's oil production when that could be produced \nin the United States, that oil could be produced here in the United \nStates. This is a sound proposition for America, I believe.\n  The equivalent of Rhode Island and Connecticut both would have to be \ntotally in wind power to equal the daily product that will be produced \nfrom this area, roughly 1.4 million barrels of oil a day. People who \nwant to talk about wind power ought to talk about how much land it will \ntake. We are going to take 2,000 acres to drill for oil, on an area \nthat is 1.5 million acres on the Arctic. It would take 3.7 million \nacres to have wind power sufficient to have the same amount of energy \nproduced on a daily basis.\n  I should allow other people to speak, as the Senator from California \nhas indicated. I intend to speak a little bit more tomorrow when we \ncome back to the amendment.\n  I know of nothing in my service in the Senate that represents the \nissue this is for me because at the time that 1980 bill passed, I went \nagainst the other members of my delegation, Congressional delegation, \nto support getting a bill done. We had been arguing 7 years over how \nmuch of Alaska's land should be withdrawn. We finally came to a \nconclusion and that conclusion is represented by the basic map I have \nhere. All of those areas there, all of them, were withdrawn by \nPresident Carter.\n  The only thing we got out of the whole bill in land guarantees was \nthe guarantee that 1.5 million acres of the Arctic Plain would remain \nopen to oil and gas. It was left open by President Eisenhower. I \nunderstand the Senator from California mentioned President Eisenhower. \nIt remained open. It was specifically mentioned in the order that was \nissued on the Arctic Wildlife Range that it was open to oil and gas. As \nthese withdrawals were made--just think of this.\n  Think of this: That bill created 13 new national parks and added land \nto 3 other national parks; it created 9 wildlife refuges and added \nadditional land to another 9 wildlife refuges. And all that Alaskans \nreceived, when all of those lands were set aside, was a commitment that \nthese 1.5 million acres would remain open for oil and gas exploration \nand would not be part of the refuge until that period of oil and gas \nexploration was completed.\n  Now, I do not know what other people think, but I have always acted \non the basis that Members of the Senate would be bound by the law, that \nwe would follow the law and understand what led to the passage of the \nlaw, that we would honor the commitments that were made by our \npredecessors, and if they were wrong, we would find some way to handle \na matter of correcting their wrong without damaging the people who had \nrelied upon the commitment that was made by the United States in a \npublic law.\n  The people of my State on the North Slope relied upon that commitment \nthat oil and gas exploration would be permitted. We started in 1981 to \nfulfill that commitment. This is 22 years later, and we are still here \narguing against the same people who tried to block the Alaska oil \npipeline, and may well block this.\n  It is a very close vote for everyone. So was the Alaska oil pipeline. \nThat pipeline, as I said in the beginning, was authorized after an \naction here in the Senate based on a tie vote, which Vice President \nAgnew broke when he voted for the building of the Alaska oil pipeline.\n  I hope Senators tomorrow, when we vote, will think about the history \nof this area, the commitments that have been made to the people of this \narea by the Senate and by the Congress of the United States, and will \nvote no on the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I will \nnot be speaking long at all. I just want to put a few things in the \nRecord and wrap up my comments for tonight. It will probably take me 10 \nminutes--maybe a little longer--and that will be it for me. I know \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Alexander would like to speak. I see \nSenator Cantwell is in the Chamber.\n  Let me put a few things in the Record.\n  The first thing I want to have printed in the Record is a letter from \nthe Alaska Inter-Tribal Council, which represents 187 Alaskan tribes. \nThey oppose drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. I ask \nunanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Alaska Inter-Tribal Council,\n\n                                 Anchorage, AK, December 11, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: We urge you to reject H.R. 4 and any other \n     proposals to authorize oil exploration and development of the \n     birthplace and nursery of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, during \n     the conference committee on the National Energy bill. The \n     very heart of the Gwich'in culture is at stake and their way \n     of life must not be negotiated or traded in any shortsighted \n     schemes to open the last 5% of America's Arctic coast to \n     development when 95% is already open to oil and gas \n     exploration and development.\n       The Gwich'in continue to live a subsistence-based way of \n     life. The Gwich'in remain firm in resistance of oil and gas \n     development of the birthplace and nursery of the Porcupine \n     Caribou Herd, the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge--Vadzaii Googii Vi Dehk'it Gwanlii The Sacred \n     Place Where Life Begins. The Gwich'in rely upon the Caribou \n     to meet their essential physical, cultural, spiritual, \n     economic and social needs. The Gwich'in ancestral way of life \n     is a birthright, to bestow upon their unborn future \n     generations. Oil development of this sacred place will have \n     devastating impacts on the very health and well being of the \n     Gwich'in.\n       The U.S. Geological Survey concluded that there is only six \n     months of oil in the Arctic Refuge. The future of the \n     Gwich'in must not be jeopardized for such a short-term fix of \n     oil. We believe that there are solutions that would be more \n     appropriate. Our energy policy should emphasize decreasing \n     the demand rather than increasing the supply, of fossil \n     fuels. There are reliable and sensible means of achieving \n     these ends--such as energy conservation, alternative energies \n     and improved energy efficiency--which can reduce our \n     dependence on oil without sacrificing Gwich'in culture and \n     the last intact arctic ecosystem.\n       This issue is about the basic inherent fundamental human \n     rights of the Gwich'in to continue to live their ancestral \n     way of life. These rights are affirmed by civilized Nations \n     in the international convenants on human rights. Article 1 of \n     both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n     and the Internatonal Covenant on\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n     Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights read in part:\n       ``In no case may a people he deprived of their own means of \n     subsistence.''\n       We support the Gwich'in to seek permanent protection of \n     this sacred Arctic Refuge, which is vital to their \n     livelihood. Regardless of how much oil may be in the refuge, \n     it is morally wrong to expect the Gwich'in to sacrifice their \n     way of life to meet this country's energy needs. What will be \n     lost and what is at stake is too high a price to pay.\n       The American public has consistently defended the rights of \n     the Gwich'in, and the integrity of the Arctic Refuge. We urge \n     you to defend their plea and reject efforts to destroy this \n     essential Sacred Place Where Life Begins.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Mike Williams,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n                                      Alaska Inter-Tribal Council.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would also like to have printed in the \nRecord an editorial that was published just yesterday in the Los \nAngeles Times. I think it said it very well. I would like to read part \nof it, and then I will have it printed in the Record. The first thing \nthey do is call attention to the Fish and Wildlife Service. They have a \nWeb site. And the Web site says:\n\n       The Arctic refuge is among the most complete, pristine and \n     undisturbed ecosystems on Earth . . . a combination of \n     habitats, climate and geography unmatched by any other \n     northern conservation area. . . .\n\n  And they say:\n\n       The refuge will no longer be complete, pristine or \n     undisturbed if President Bush and [Secretary Gale] Norton \n     have their way.\n\n  And they point out that Secretary Norton showed a slide and said:\n\n       This image of flat, white nothingness is what you would see \n     the majority of the year.\n\n  The LA Times makes the point that it is really an interesting \nsituation. As a matter of fact, the headline is: ``A Curious \nCommemoration.'' It says:\n\n       The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proudly celebrating \n     the 100th anniversary of the national wildlife refuge system, \n     which it manages.\n\n  Then it just points out how ironic it is that Secretary Norton calls \nit an ``image of flat, white nothingness.''\n  I want to put that in Record. I think it is a good editorial. I ask \nunanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        A Curious Commemoration\n\n       The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proudly celebrating \n     the 100th anniversary of the national wildlife refuge system, \n     which it manages. Theodore Roosevelt created the first \n     refuge, Pelicans Island in Florida, 100 years ago this month \n     to save brown pelicans from hunters who gunned them down for \n     their feathers. The system's 575 refuges today cover 95 \n     million acres and shelter everything from tropical fish to \n     polar bears.\n       The service is marking the occasion by ``showcasing and \n     strengthening the entire agency's programs.'' It's curious \n     then that the service's ultimate boss, Secretary of the \n     Interior Gale A. Norton, should have asked Congress last week \n     to subject one of the nation's most celebrated refuges to oil \n     and gas exploration and production. Even more curious, Norton \n     painted the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Alaska's North \n     Slope as a barren, uninviting place where it would scarcely \n     matter if some tundra was torn up.\n       Showing House members a slide, Norton said, ``This image of \n     flat, white nothingness is what you would see majority of the \n     year.'' Never mind that the refuge often teems with birds, \n     fish and wildlife, including the Porcupine caribou herd, \n     polar bears and wolves. Environmentalists call the refuge \n     America's Serengeti because of the richness of its wildlife.\n       The decision may hang by a single votes. Democratic Sens. \n     Blanche Lambert Lincoln and Mark Pryor, both of Arkansas, \n     Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) and Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) \n     are being heavily lobbied to abandon the fragile majority \n     opposed to drilling.\n       Norton's Appeal Wednesday was that Alaska's Arctic coastal \n     plain (she mostly avoided referring to it as refuge) could \n     produce more oil than any state. That may sound impressive, \n     but the nation could save more oil and sooner, by raising \n     fuel-economy standards by a few miles per gallon.\n       Norton said oil companies would be required to use new \n     technology and to drill with little or no damage to the \n     tundra. She did not add that if oil was found, the wells \n     would be linked by collection pipelines that must be \n     maintained in summer and winter. This industrial support \n     infrastructure is what most mars the landscape and creates a \n     hostile environment for wildlife.\n       The Fish and Wildlife Service makes a compelling case on \n     its own Web site for keeping the refuge as it is: ``The \n     Arctic refuge is among the most complete, pristine and \n     undisturbed ecosystem on Earth. . . a combination of \n     habitats, climate and geography unmatched by any other \n     northern conservation area. . .'' The refuge will no longer \n     be complete, pristine or undisturbed if President Bush and \n     Norton have their way.\n\n  tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, then there is the question of how much \noil is there. Senator Stevens basically said, anyone who says it is 6 \nmonths' worth of oil is not--I don't want to put words in his mouth--\ntelling the truth was the essence of his remarks.\n  I want to make a point. In the USGS report in 1998, they said there \nwas a 50 percent chance that the amount of economically recoverable oil \nis 3.25 billion barrels. So I think what we are seeing here is a very \ndifferent point of view. And CRS estimated that the Alaska wildlife \nproduction would range from 200,000 to 1 million barrels daily, and \nmaybe at some point reach 1.9 million barrels a day.\n  The point is, when Senator Stevens says people who are saying there \nis 6 months' worth of oil are being disingenuous, that is just not the \ncase.\n  I also want to put in the Record a paper entitled ``Caribou in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge.'' It talks about the caribou and what \nis happening and kind of backs up what was stated here, that the Native \npeoples are saying the oil activity is driving the caribou herds away. \nAnd they explain what has happened to the caribou.\n  The Senator from Alaska, I certainly respect his point of view, but \nthese are Alaska groups that have this very important discussion about \nwhat has happened to the Porcupine caribou herd. I ask unanimous \nconsent that that paper be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Caribou in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\n       There are two separate caribou herds found in the Arctic \n     Refuge. The Porcupine Caribou herd--named after the Porcupine \n     River found within its range--which numbers about 128,000 and \n     makes long migrations each year between winter habitat in \n     Canada and Alaska south of the Brooks Range, and summer \n     habitat (calving and post-calving) on the Arctic Refuge \n     coastal plain. The second herd is the Central Arctic Herd, \n     which uses the central portion of the North Slope including \n     the area around Prudhoe Bay and the western part of the \n     Refuge, and numbers about 27,000 animals. Almost 30 years of \n     data have shown that the concentrated calving and post-\n     calving area of the Porcupine herd is located within the \n     Refuge's coastal plain nearly every year. Both herds \n     frequently use the northwest portion of the Refuge during the \n     post-calving period for insect relief habitat.\n       One of the greatest myths concerning caribou is that oil \n     development has caused an increased in the Central Arctic \n     herd's numbers. Before development, the herd contained about \n     5,000 animals. Today it number around 27,000. This increase \n     is largely attributable to several years with mild weather \n     and has nothing to do with development. In truth, the Central \n     Arctic herd's calving activity has shifted away from \n     developed areas to alternative calving grounds with poorer \n     quality habitat.\n       The Porcupine herd has no alternative calving areas to \n     shift to because of the densities of the herd and the \n     narrowness of the coastal plain within the Arctic Refuge; \n     there are 5 time more caribou in about one-fifth the area \n     compared to Prudhoe Bay. On the few occasions when weather \n     has prevented the Porcupine herd from reaching the coastal \n     plain before calving, calf survival was significantly \n     diminished. The caribou need the coastal plain during the \n     calving and post-calving periods because the core calving \n     area of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain provides the highest \n     quality forage, lowest density of predators, and optimal \n     insect relief. Should they be forced to shift their calving \n     activities away from the region because of oil development, \n     calves would be vulnerable to higher predation and lower \n     quality forage possible leading to a decline in their \n     numbers. Numerous scientific articles written by leading \n     caribou researchers clearly document that industrial \n     development has resulted in changing caribou movements and \n     distribution within the oil fields displacing caribou from \n     the highest quality habitat.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in closing my remarks, I have shown the \nbeauty of the wildlife refuge. Now I want to talk about the yield from \nthe wildlife refuge when you compare it to what you could gain in \nenergy with some very simple things we could do.\n  For example, better tires: We are talking about a 4.3 percent \nreduction in dependence on foreign oil if we could just get that out of \ntires. And this chart shows, in the billions of barrels, what could be \nsaved in the same period of time.\n  Also, if you close the SUV loophole, look at how many billions of \nbarrels you save by 2030. These are all by the year 2030. If we just \nsaid that cars would average 35 miles per gallon, look at the fuel \neconomy we would save if that occurred by the year 2013. So by\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nthe year 2030, look at this: We could do so much more for our country \nwithout giving up one bit of our quality of life, just getting the SUVs \nto have the same fuel economy as our autos. Every 6 years, you would \nactually have another ANWR field.\n  So for people to say we have to drill, we have to drill, we have to \ndrill, I just would tell them, these are just a few ideas that some of \nus have on how we can avoid drilling in a place that looks like this \nchart shows, a place that President Eisenhower chose to save.\n  So I really think, if you look at the several arguments I have laid \nout--first, the fact is, this is not the way to go about debating the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge: a little bit of a sentence in the big budget. \nThat is not right. It deserves a lot more discussion.\n  This is a God-given, this God-given land. This is precious, and it \ndeserves more debate than we are going to be able to give it tonight \nand a little bit in the morning. So it makes no sense. It is a \nmagnificent area.\n  Second, we can get the equivalent way more--way more--than what you \ncould get in the Arctic, by doing some very simple conservation. Just \nto take this SUV loophole: saying that they get the same mileage as \ncars, we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 16 percent. This \nreduces it by 2 percent. Let's do it by 16 percent.\n  If we increase the CAFE, the corporate average fuel economy, to 35 \nmiles per gallon by the year 2013, by the year 2030--listen to this; \nthis will really get you excited if you are listening to this debate--\nwe could cut back on the importation of foreign oil by 43 percent.\n  So when anyone tells you, we have to drill in a place that looks \nlike--you know what I want to show you, those beautiful pink flowers; \nhere it is--that looks like this, yes, not every month of the year--\nWashington does not look so great right now, but in a couple of months \nit is going to look good.\n  I don't think we want to bring the oil cranes on to the Capitol \nGrounds, although it kind of looks something like that right now.\n  I will close by showing some of the wildlife to my friend from \nWashington. These are so magnificent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that she be given 10 minutes upon completion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To be followed by the Senator from Tennessee, if he \nwishes, 10 minutes after that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I close the debate the way I started it and leave it to \nmy good friend to wrap things up. This is what we are talking about. No \none could make this up: The polar bear; the muskoxen. Look at this; \nthis is called the chart bird, so we have it on a chart. Quite \nextraordinary, isn't it? I say to my friends, think about what you are \nabout to do here. Don't have this on your conscience when you could \njust raise fuel economy and have 10 ANWRs, 20 ANWRs, because when you \nsave this, you save it over and over again.\n  I hope my amendment will pass. I am very proud that Senators Chafee \nand Snowe are on the amendment and other Republicans because this is \nnot about politics, this is about saving a God-given gift. That is the \nway I see it.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California \nfor her articulate presentation of this issue, not only protecting a \nvery important part of our wildlife refuge system but also for talking \nabout the issue from an energy consumption perspective. Where is the \nbest place for the United States to be investing its time and energy \nand to get the highest return, particularly at a time when our foreign \ndependence on oil is very important for us to make those decisions to \nmove forward?\n  I commend the Senator from California for her time and energy and for \nher amendment that we will be voting on tomorrow, a very important \namendment that, on the one hand, you could say got a lot of attention \nin a debate last year. This body heard many hours of presentation from \na variety of Members and made a decision on that issue. Tomorrow I will \nsupport Senator Boxer's amendment, but I question seriously why we have \nto go to this extent of having Senator Boxer's amendment at all. Why is \nthis issue coming up on a budget resolution when a more appropriate \ntime and place would be for us to take it up as part of our energy \ndiscussion, even though we did that last year and decided that it \nwasn't a priority for us in the Senate?\n  I support what we are trying to do in protecting the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge because by protecting that wildlife, we are protecting \nas well a great part of what has been the last great wilderness in the \nUnited States. Proponents of drilling in the Arctic Refuge talk about \nreducing dependence on foreign energy supplies. I also support us \nfocusing on reducing that foreign energy. But the best way to meet \nthat goal is to develop a domestic natural gas resource, particularly \nlooking at Alaska, and also to promote renewable energy technologies \nand reduce oil consumption through conservation measures.\n\n  Alaska is a very important source of domestic energy. Make no mistake \nabout that. The North Slope has trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. \nWe should develop that natural gas on Federal lands, including the \nNational Petroleum Reserve which was set aside for development. I am \neager to work with my colleagues, Senator Stevens and Senator Murkowski \nand others, to build that gas pipeline to bring natural gas to the \nmarketplace. Building a gas pipeline and developing the NPRA in an \nenvironmentally sound manner will create jobs in Alaska and will \nbenefit the Native communities. It will strengthen our overall energy \npolicy.\n  We also, though, need to develop renewable energy sources, including \ndomestically produced biofuels, and to focus on energy efficiency \ntechnologies, some of which I am sure we will be discussing later in an \nenergy bill. These technologies can reduce our dependence on foreign \noil sources.\n  For example, Senator Boxer showed a chart on what could be done by \nusing low-friction tires. That was an interesting chart because we have \nseen that in focusing on these new cars to help them comply with fuel \nstandards, these new tires could cut gasoline consumption of all U.S. \nvehicles by 3 percent. That is a savings to our Nation of about 5 \nbillion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. As Senator Boxer pointed \nout, the reason that number is so important is, it is the same amount, \n5 billion barrels over the next 50 years, that the U.S. Geological \nSurvey says can be economically recovered from drilling in ANWR.\n  Why take what is a national treasure in the last great wilderness for \nthese 5 billion barrels when we can do the same thing by moving to a \nmore efficient energy economy?\n  I believe through a balanced approach, we can demonstrate our \ncommitment both to wildlife conservation and strengthening energy \nsecurity.\n  However, this budget resolution is not a balanced approach. Drilling \nin the Arctic really is a reversal in America of about 100 years of \ncommitment to conservation. I say that because, most importantly, the \nresolution would violate our duty as stewards of the Arctic Refuge, in \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System as a major system, and would take \naway what has been one of our most valuable national treasures.\n  During this debate, we must consider the number of people who have \nbeen involved and how we have been involved over the last 100 years to \nwork to protect the sensitive wildlife habitat in this country and \nspecifically the Arctic Refuge. Senator Boxer showed many pictures \ndemonstrating what that wildlife refuge looks like and how pristine it \nis today and the wildlife that exists there. Everyone in this body \nwants to see us continue the Wildlife Refuge System.\n  Last week, we marked our 100th anniversary of establishing the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System. That was done by President Theodore \nRoosevelt at Pelican Island--the 100-year anniversary. Through that \nwork, countless Americans have helped build a system of over 500 \nrefuges in every State in the country. Tens of thousands of volunteers, \nseveral hundred ``friends organizations,'' scores of partnership \norganizations have worked closely with the\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain the integrity of the system.\n  In Washington State, local volunteers have built and helped protect \nvarious lands: Willapa Bay, the Nisqually River, the Hanford Reach of \nthe Columbia River, and many other locations. Americans have worked to \nbuild the system because they love wildlife and because there is the \ntrust that we in Congress will be good stewards of these lands.\n  Unfortunately, that stewardship is being called into question with \nthis budget resolution as an assault on the system as a whole. This \nbudget undermines the work of millions of Americans, including hunters, \nanglers, wildlife enthusiasts, and many others.\n  It is very important that the hard work and focus of maintaining our \nwildlife, not just in the Arctic but all throughout America, be \ncelebrated this week as we have reached this 100th anniversary, and \nthat we support the Boxer amendment tomorrow, to say there is a wiser \nway for us to preserve and to move forward our energy conservation and \nsecurity, and that there is a wiser way for us to get off our foreign \ndependence on oil, and that wiser way will mean making the right \ninvestment in natural gas, in technology, in conservation, and in \npreserving the Arctic Refuge.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \nstatement count against the opposition's time on the amendment, which \nis our side's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I support the Budget Committee's \nrecommendation that there be an instruction to the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, on which I serve, to permit leasing and drilling \nfor the oil in Alaska.\n  I listened carefully to what the senior Senator from Alaska told us \nabout history tonight. He reminded us that most recently, in 1980, our \ncountry made a decision. Congress debated it here, and President \nCarter, during his administration, made this decision. He approved of \nand made both parts of the decision as President. One was to set aside \n100 million acres of land in Alaska, an astonishing amount for \nwilderness area--of which I approved--and then to set aside 1.5 million \nacres for drilling. That was the decision our country made.\n  Almost all of our decisions about energy and the environment \nintersect. They almost always are balanced. In 1980, we decided 100 \nmillion acres in Alaska for conservation and 1.5 million acres for \ndrilling. And then we are talking, in this proposal, about 2,000 of \nthose 1.5 million acres that we would drill.\n  I would not stand here and say there is no environmental burden when \nwe drill for oil. Of course, there is. But I would like to assert that \nwe almost always seek to find a reasonable balance. What is on the \nother side of the balance? Why do we need the oil? We are being \nreminded of that in a great many ways today. We are a nation about to \ngo to war. We are a nation where gasoline prices and gas prices are \ngoing up in remarkable numbers. That means for us fewer jobs. That \nmeans for us cold homes. We know we are a nation that depends upon a \nreliable supply of energy. We also know that this Alaskan Refuge we are \ndebating tonight has--as the Senator from Alaska reminded us--more \nreserves than the State of Texas. So it is not incidental, unless \nsomebody wants to call the oil of Texas incidental. I would not.\n  It is also more than a million barrels of oil a day through the \npipeline. By one estimate--the one by the Senator from Alaska--it is \n1.4 million a day. So it seems the 1980 balance that this Senate, this \nCongress, and President Carter made was the right balance, which ought \nto be honored. A hundred million acres in Alaska for conservation, 1.5 \nmillion for drilling, and we will drill on 2,000 of those 1.5 million.\n  I, too, agree that I am ready to see us become serious in our country \nabout finding a new energy base for our economy. I was pleased with the \nPresident's proposal for a hydrogen car. In the Energy Subcommittee, \nwhich I chair, we will spend a lot of time on that. But the hydrogen \ncar and a hydrogen-based economy are 20 years away. In the meantime, we \nneed jobs and we need to be able to drive to work. We cannot afford to \nhave energy prices and home heating oil and natural gas prices going up \nto a level our citizens cannot afford. So we have to strike a \nreasonable balance. I believe the Budget Committee did that, and I \nsupport that.\n  Second, I want to point out something else the Budget Committee did \nthat hasn't been mentioned in the debate, as far as I am able to tell. \nThe Budget Committee has within it the creation of a new reserve fund \nfor the State grant program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n\n  If this budget resolution is passed by the Senate, I, along with \nSenator Sununu of New Hampshire, and Senator Stevens and Senator \nMurkowski of Alaska--and I hope many other Senators--will introduce \nlegislation to take the first $250 million of each year's revenues from \ndrilling in this Alaska venture and put it into the State side of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. Let me repeat that. If we produce, by \nauthorizing this drilling for oil in the 2,000 acres, the $1 billion a \nyear that is expected, which should happen in about the year 2005 or \n2006, the legislation I propose, along with other Senators, would take \nthe first $250 million and put it into the State side--not the Federal \nside--of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  This money is used by States and cities and communities to create \nneighborhood parks, greenways, and land trusts. In other words, we \nwould be balancing what we are doing. We might be creating some \nenvironmental burden, taking some environmental risk, but we would be \nbalancing that by a huge environmental benefit on the other side by \nhelping build numbers of State parks and greenways and land trusts, \ncloser to where people live, near their homes.\n  The legislation I propose would more than double the Federal dollars, \ncreating critically needed neighborhood parks, trails, and greenways. \nMore important, it would substantially and reliably fund that State \ngrant program, as Congress intended and the President pledged we would \ndo.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the most popular \nprograms in America with State and local officials. It stems from the \nrecommendations of the Rockefeller Commission, appointed by President \nJohnson in 1963. When Ronald Reagan was President, he sought to have a \nfollowup to the Rockefeller Commission. I was its chairman. We called \nit the President's Commission on America's Outdoors. It had four \nMembers of Congress as participants. The vice chairman was Gilbert \nGrovner, president of the National Geographic Society, and it included \nsuch distinguished members as Patrick Noonan, who is today president of \nthe Conservation Fund.\n  We made a number of recommendations in 1985 and 1986 to Congress, to \nthe President, and to the Nation. One of the most important of those \nrecommendations was that we use money from nonrenewable energy sources \nto create permanent assets for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nThis was a conservation commission, and we recognized that we would be \ndrilling for gas and oil, but we wanted to use some of that money to \nbuild neighborhood parks.\n  Twenty years after President Reagan's Commission on America's \nOutdoors, I still believe in that principle. I believe we should use \nrevenue from oil and gas drilling, and other activities that deplete \nour natural resources, to fund conservation efforts, and I believe \nsmart development always includes strong environmental stewardship.\n  The State grant part of the National Park Service Land and Water \nConservation Fund provides matching grants that can be used for \nplanning, acquisition, and site development in all 50 States. Many \nStates have actually increased their revenues so that they can match \nthese popular programs. But the State grant program of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund has been underfunded by 70 percent, or more, \nand it has been very unreliable. It has gone up, and it has gone down.\n  Our cities are in desperate need of more funding for neighborhood \nparks and recreation areas. It is a nice idea to drive all the way out \nto Yellowstone if you live in New York City, or in Nashville, but most \npeople cannot\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\ndrive that far. Eighty percent of the people do their outdoor \nrecreation in the neighborhood where they live. The most important park \nto them is the park that is somewhere in their neighborhood, and this \n$250 million a year would help create thousands and thousands of new \nneighborhood parks, walking trails, and greenways. It would create a \nsource of reliable funding. The funding, as I said, has been volatile \nand inconsistent. This legislation would make the reserve fund from the \nANWR revenues mandatory.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--the land we are discussing that \nis near there--is owned by all the people, and all should benefit.\n  By allocating a portion of these revenues, a generous portion, in a \nmandatory way for the benefit of communities everywhere in America, we \nwould be making sure that we balanced our conservation ethic with our \nneed for energy and oil.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \ncomparison of land and water conservation funds.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n COMPARISON OF LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND--$160 MILLION \\1\\ (FY 04\n  PROPOSED ADMINISTRATION BUDGET) AND

of Proposed FY 04 Funds are directed toward\n  administration of the program.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it compares on one side the \nadministration's proposals for this budget we are debating. For the \nyear 2004, there is $160 million in President Bush's budget. By my \ncalculation, with full funding of the State side of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, we would go to $450 million. That would mean, for \nexample, in California, instead of having $13 million for neighborhood \nparks, there would be $35 million, or in Tennessee, instead of $3 \nmillion for neighborhood parks, there would be $7.7 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for a moment, the \nChair informs the Senator he has used the 10 minutes which he was \nyielded under the previous order. Would the Senator like to ask consent \nfor more time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. In Missouri, instead of $3 million, there would be \n$7.7 million. In Washington State, there is $3 million for neighborhood \nparks under the President's proposal; this would raise it to $8.3 \nmillion.\n  I call to this body's attention two parts of the budget resolution. \nThe first part has to do with drilling in ANWR. The second part is a \nnew reserve fund that would permit taking the first $250 million of \nmoney that comes from the oil drilling and put it in the State grant \nprogram for the Land and Water Conservation Fund which would more than \ndouble the amount of Federal dollars available for neighborhood parks.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that my statement count against the opposition's time to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is actually quite fortuitous I am \nstanding before you tonight. I have not spoken on the floor but once \nsince I have been here in my new role as the junior Senator from \nAlaska. But I stand before you tonight to do the one thing I have been \nasked by the residents, the people of Alaska to do, and that is to work \nfor jobs, for a sustainable economy for my State and for my \nconstituents. So to stand tonight to talk about ANWR and what ANWR \nmeans not only to my State but to all of America is, as I say, \nsignificant because ANWR is about jobs, it is about the economy, it is \nabout economic security, domestic energy production. It is also about \nNative rights in my home State, and it is about common sense.\n  I have been listening very closely to the comments that have been \nmade tonight, some by my fellow colleague from Alaska, quite \npassionately arguing the facts. We have seen some beautiful pictures, \nand we have seen some numbers thrown around. I think it is so important \nthat we put into perspective what ANWR really is, what it means. To do \nthat, we have to go back a bit in history. We have to look to the \nhistory of ANWR.\n  We have known about ANWR's oil potential since the early 1900s. It \nwas in 1913, 1914 that the U.S. Geological Survey found strong \nindications of oil. So we have known that oil reserves, strong oil \nreserves, are on the North Slope.\n\n  This area now known as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was \noriginally created in 1960 by Executive order under the Eisenhower \nadministration. This Executive order has been pointed to a couple times \ntonight. It seems that it has been construed that it was recognized by \nthis order that somehow ANWR, the Coastal Plain, should be reserved as \nsome wilderness or should be put off limits. It is important to go back \nto the language of that Executive order so we understand clearly what \nPresident Eisenhower recognized in 1960.\n  The order states:\n\n       For the purposes of preserving the wildlife, the \n     wilderness, and the recreational values described in \n     northeastern Alaska containing approximately 8.9 million \n     acres, is hereby subject to valid existing withdrawals, \n     withdrawn from all forms of appropriations under the public \n     land laws, including mining, but not the mineral leasing \n     laws.\n\n  This is where people are failing to read the rest of that order: \n``but not the mineral leasing laws.''\n  In 1960, through Executive order, was the first time it was \nrecognized that the potential for mineral and oil was significant on \nthe Coastal Plain.\n  I have a chart that details exactly what is in the refuge. The \nCoastal Plain, which is 1.5 million acres, was created in 1980 under \nANILCA. The wilderness area in yellow was also set out in ANILCA. When \nthe initial refuge was set up, it was this portion, additional refuge \nland, which is not wilderness, which was created under section 303 of \nANILCA. It added this section.\n  When we talk about ANWR, the refuge, and the wilderness and the 1002 \narea, it is important to keep in mind that we are talking about \ndifferent animals, if you will. The Coastal Plain, the 1002 area, is \nseparate and distinct from the wilderness area that has been created \nand separate from that refuge.\n  In 1959, Alaska had become a State with certain rights guaranteed to \nit under the Statehood Act. Within that act was a recognition by \nPresident Eisenhower--again through the Executive order--that the North \nSlope had\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\nvast oil and gas potential and that it should remain available at all \ntimes for domestic use.\n  There was a recognition in 1960 that something was different about \nthe Coastal Plain--a Federal recognition that the oil and gas potential \nalong the plain is too important to lock it up.\n  Go forward 13 years when Congress authorized through the Trans-Alaska \nOil Pipeline Authorization Act the construction of the Trans-Alaska \npipeline. This pipeline was to carry up to 2.1 million barrels of oil \nfrom the North Slope to the tidewater in Valdez for export to the lower \n48. This was the next recognition, if you will, of the potential for \nreserves in the North Slope.\n  Our pipeline spans 800 miles from the north of the State all the way \ndown to the southern terminus in Valdez. It goes through some of the \nmost rugged and beautiful country one is ever going to see, and this \npipeline carries the oil safely and efficiently without harm to the \nenvironment or the wildlife. It survived the biggest earthquakes the \ndesigners could have foreseen. We had a 7.1 earthquake in November. It \nwas a construction marvel that pipeline worked the way the designers \nhad envisioned it would.\n  Our pipeline is an amazing wonder of American ingenuity and spirit. \nThis pipeline has been around for three decades now, and it has been \ndoing a good job. As Senator Stevens pointed out earlier this evening, \nour pipeline is half full. We need additional oil deposits to maintain \noperations.\n  I have said this is an 800-mile pipeline, but again I think it helps \nto put things in perspective if one is not from the State of Alaska. \nThis pipeline covers a span of country equal to the distance between \nDuluth, MN, and New Orleans, LA. To date, it has carried over 14 \nbillion barrels of Alaska oil to the lower 48--day in, day out.\n  This pipeline was constructed in 1973. We have been transporting oil \nin it ever since. In 1980, Congress enacted the Alaska National \nInterest Land Conservation Act, which is commonly known as ANILCA. This \nbill was a culmination of 5 years' worth of legislative negotiations \nspanning three separate Congresses. There was an agreement reached, \nwhich Senator Stevens mentioned earlier, between Senator Scoop Jackson \nof Washington and Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, two Democrats \nand two protectors of the environment. The bill included language which \nwas agreed to by Alaska to ensure access to the Coastal Plain for oil \nand gas exploration.\n  This is where we get the phrase or why we keep referring to this \nparcel as the 1002, because it came from section 1002 of ANILCA. It \nspecifically set forth the requirements for exploration and development \nof oil and gas reserves in this small portion of ANWR, consistent with \nthe protections for wildlife.\n  With ANILCA, we doubled the size of President Eisenhower's Arctic \nNational Wildlife Range. This was the range initially. We doubled the \nsize by adding the refuge and changed the name to the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Through ANILCA, we put half of the land in refuge, 8 million in \nwilderness and 1.5 million reserved as an energy bank for the United \nStates. Again, I point out, it is important to mention that the 1002 \narea is technically not part of the refuge. It lies within the outer \nboundaries of the refuge, but it is technically not part of it. It is \nessentially an area in legal limbo waiting for Congress to fulfill the \nstatutory requirements that were set out in section 1002 of ANILCA, and \nto fulfill the promises that were made to Alaska on statehood.\n  It is not really in the refuge, but it is definitely not a part of \nthe wilderness, and it is not part of the wilderness by definition or \nin just the everyday sense of the word.\n  If one looks up ``wilderness'' in Webster's, it is defined as an \nunsettled and uncultivated region. The Coastal Plain does not meet this \ndefinition of wilderness, because for years we have had military \ninstallations that have been involved in monitoring Soviet and cross \npolar activity. We have a community. We have the village of Kaktovik \nwhich sits right within the 1002 area. These people call the area home. \nThey have their homes there. They have a school there. They have \ncommunity centers there. They have hospitals. They have a community. \nThis is not a wilderness.\n  Some of the pictures we have seen lead one to believe there is \nnothing up there, but when you take your camera, you can look in \nwhatever direction you want to prove your point. So I think we need to \nkeep in mind, let's envision what we have up there. We have made offers \nto people. If they have not seen ANWR, come up and see what we are \ntalking about. See what the Coastal Plain is. See what drilling looks \nlike in Alaska.\n  At the outset, I mentioned this also had to do with Native rights \nissues. Under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, some Alaska \nNatives were given the right to select lands on the North Slope. A \ngroup of Alaska Natives from the North Slope region selected 92,000 \nacres within the boundaries of the 1002 area specifically for its oil \nand gas potential. Those Natives who have selected those lands are \ndenied any opportunity to develop. Through the 1971 act of Congress, \nthey were given the right to select those lands. They selected them, \nbut there is nothing further they can do with them. They are being \ndenied the right to do with the land what they feel should be done. If \nthey need jobs and opportunities, we are denying them that opportunity.\n  This refusal to allow the Natives to use their land is another \nexample of the hand of Government falling upon Natives and Indians in \nAmerica, because Government knows how to do it best. So that is kind of \nour preliminary history lesson about ANWR.\n  Let's get to some of the facts, though, that have been mentioned this \nevening. We are importing nearly 11 million barrels of oil every day \nfrom other countries. Most of them are from countries that are not so \nvery friendly or not so very stable. Alaska is producing 1 million \nbarrels of oil per day, when the pipeline can carry twice that amount. \nWe are wasting this national asset. We have a pipeline that is half \nfull.\n  Prior to the last gulf war, Alaska produced nearly 2.1 million \nbarrels of oil per day, all of it destined for West Coast ports in the \nlower 48. Now, rather than move to open a small portion of the Coastal \nPlain to responsible oil and natural gas development, our opponents are \nsuggesting we can basically conserve our way out of the reduced \ndependency in an economically responsible manner.\n  I will be the first to tell my colleagues we must work on our \nconservation efforts, but we must be realistic about what it is we can \nand cannot do. I have heard those who state that ANWR is a false choice \nwhen compared with higher CAFE standards, that that is the way we need \nto go. But desiring tougher standards at the expense of more domestic \nproduction is the real false choice. It is a false choice because we \nhave to do both. We have to pursue conservation, but we have to pursue \nincreased domestic production if we are going to get our energy \nsituation back on track.\n  To suggest we do not do any more, that we cut it off, that there is \nno need for any more oil, that we are going to go to this wonderful \nhydrogen-based society and we are all going to be able to power our \nvehicles on something other than gasoline, it is not today, it is not \ntomorrow, it is probably not 10 years. Having said that, should we not \nwork toward it? Sure, that is fine, but let's keep in mind that we use \ngasoline for more than powering our vehicles. We use gasoline in a \nwhole host of ways.\n  I was talking to a group of students this morning. They said, \ngasoline is used for cars, and if we change the way our vehicles are \nfueled, surely we will not need to rely on gasoline.\n  But it is used for home fuel oil, jet fuel, petrochemicals, asphalt, \nkerosene, lubricants, maritime fuel, other products. If we look at this \nchart, of the gasoline that we consume, one barrel of oil makes 44.2 \ngallons of economic essentials. So 44 percent of a barrel of oil is \ngoing into the gasoline component. The remainder, 56 percent, is going \ninto all of these other things.\n  So the kids wanted to know, what are all of these other things? They \nare plastics, CDs, crayons, contact lenses, panty hose, photographs, \nroofing material, dentures, shaving cream, perfumes, umbrellas, golf \nballs, aspirin, bandages, deodorant, tents, footballs.\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\n  To suggest we need to cut back on oil because we do not want to have \na society that is dependent on oil for our vehicles is one thing. We \ncan look to alternatives for how we might power our vehicles. But we \nhave to recognize we are oil-dependent: 56 percent, 58 percent of the \noil we consume in the United States is imported oil. That is not a good \nplace to be, particularly when we can do better domestically. We want \nto be able to do that.\n  Alaska has been a proud supplier of 20 percent of this country's oil \nproduction for the past 25 years. We produce this oil in the harshest \nenvironment imaginable. We do it better and we do it safer and we do it \nin a more environmentally sound and scientific manner than anywhere on \nEarth. Every spill on the North Slope is reported. Every drop. If a can \nof soda pop is dropped, it is reported. We are conscious. We know what \nis going on. We are being careful and cautious.\n  The National Academy of Sciences 2 weeks ago released a report on the \ncumulative impact of North Slope oil development. What did they find \nabout oil spills on the North Slope? No major oil spills had occurred. \nThere was no cumulative effect. The discussion about how to drill and \nwhere to drill is moot because we are in a situation where we have \nessentially a professional environmental community that says no \ndevelopment at all anywhere. They are using ANWR as their rallying cry.\n  What they are doing by stopping development in ANWR and by saying you \ncannot go there, they are shutting down not only oil development but \nhuman progress. There is a community in Kaktovik, a community on the \nNorth Slope in Barrow, existing because of oil. Their school, their \nhospital, their community exists because they have jobs and a resource \nbase. That is human progress that most would see as positive.\n  There was an interesting article in the Washington Post a few days \nback. Phillip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, \nsummed up what today's modern professional environmental movement is \nabout, talking about drilling in ANWR and talking about the technology \nand whether cumulative impact had been good or bad. He noted, even if \nnew technology has lessened the environment damage, it is not the \ndrilling itself but the other activities, such as road building, \nhousing for workers, the infrastructure needed to support them, that \ncause damage.\n  If you think that through, if it is the school, if it is the house, \nif it is the road that causes the damage, it is not necessarily the \ndrilling. They are doing the drilling fine. The road is that way or the \nhouse is blocking the wind and causing snow to drift and that will \naccumulate and then melt and puddle in the spring; that is a negative \nchange. We are going to have all kinds of problems. By Mr. Clapp's \nstandard, the elementary school in Fayetteville, AR, causes a negative \nimpact.\n  We have to be realistic. We deal with this not-in-my-backyard \nsyndrome and it seems this NIMBY is now morphing into BANANA, build \nalmost nothing anywhere near anyone. If you carry it further to a \nlittle more ludicrous level, you have the term NOPE: not On planet \nEarth.\n  We in Alaska are starting to feel cut off from the rest of the world, \nthat the rest of the world or the rest of the country would just as \nsoon lock us up and say nothing, nada, zip, you cannot do anything. You \nare not responsible enough to carry on development because we are \nconcerned about the environment.\n\n  Again, I challenge Members to come up, see the oil development, how \nwe bring oil out of the ground safely every single day and deliver it \nto the rest of the lower 48. We do a good job. Give us credit.\n  We had a bit of an example about the technology used on the North \nSlope now. The comment was made earlier when we first began producing \nin Prudhoe Bay, the size of the oil fields, the pads, the footprint was \nbigger, but the technology in the past 30 years has brought us to a \nremarkable place where we can drill, and for all intents and purposes \nyou do not know we are there. We have a picture that shows when the \ndrill is complete there is a stump put in the ground. That is what you \nlook at at the end. You do not have a huge infrastructure.\n  I had a meeting this afternoon with an independent oil company \nworking in Alaska, explaining to us some incredible new technology that \nallows for construction of modules on the tundra, elevated so the \ntundra is not affected by any warmth or heat coming off the building. \nThese modules are supported on beams not made from ice but inserted in \nan ice sleeve so when drilling is complete, when the project is \ncomplete, they melt the ice, pick everything up, and they are out of \nthere. The technology we have today is so remarkable, so incredible, we \ncan go in, we can do the job, and we can do it in a manner that does \nnot disturb the environment.\n  The point was made earlier about the size we are talking about. The \nmaps of Alaska do not do justice to the size or the expanse. The \ndevelopment of the Coastal Plain would use an area of land smaller than \nthe Little Rock airport. It was mentioned that in the area of drilling \nwe are looking to do in the 1002 area, six of them would fit within \nDulles Airport. Conceptualize this: An area 290 times smaller than Ted \nTurner's private ranch in New Mexico. I have not been there, but I can \nvisualize it. Or an area the size of George Washington's Mount Vernon \nwhen he first inherited the property in 1761.\n  This is what we are talking about, a tiny sliver on the Arctic \nCoastal Plain. Yes, we did see lovely pictures taken during the summer \nwhen the tundra is abloom. Those flowers do exist, although I don't \nknow, I have seen the purple flowers. But most of the time it looks \nlike the moon. It is white, it is deserted. Most days you cannot tell \nthe sky from the land. This is the world that we are talking about. It \nis frozen 9 months out of the year. It is windswept. It is bitter cold. \nIt is not hospitable country. Yet small groups of Alaskan Eskimos have \nchosen to call this home and want to be able to stay there, have decent \njobs there. This is what we are talking about when we talk about ANWR.\n\n  I was going on about the size of ANWR. It was pointed out to me that \nthe amount of land we need is the same size as the world famous \nPinehurst Golf Resort in North Carolina, home to eight world-class golf \ncourses. In fact, a new golf course opens every day in the U.S., which \nmeans that the amount of land that we need to produce billions of \nbarrels of oil for the American consumer is gobbled up in just 8 days \nby golf courses nationwide.\n  It seems kind of silly to be comparing ANWR and the incredible \ncontribution you are going to be getting from ANWR and its resources to \na golf course, but I think it helps to put it in perspective. First, \nthink about the size we are talking about and think about our land use. \nThis is not an area you would want to go and have a round of golf.\n  Also tonight there has been discussion about the wildlife up in the \n1002 area. Since Alaska oil production began nearly three decades ago, \nthe caribou herds have increased an average of 450 percent; duck, \ngeese, and other migratory birds are flourishing. As has been \nmentioned, there are more caribou in Alaska than there are people. The \ncaribou are doing fine. They hope it is not going to be another bad bug \nyear, but the caribou are thriving.\n  When we get right down to what ANWR is about to the Alaskan people, \nit is about economic opportunity; it is about real jobs for them. But I \ndon't stand here and try to suggest that only my State is going to \nbenefit, that the only reason we should open ANWR is so people in the \nState of Alaska can have jobs. This is jobs for the Nation. This is \njobs for America.\n  By opening the Coastal Plain as intended by President Eisenhower, we \nwould create hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide, employ thousands \nof union and nonunion members in many States, and produce $2.1 billion \nin the first few years alone for the Federal Treasury.\n  Going back to the jobs I mentioned, it is not just Alaska. There was \na study done. It was just completed in Alaska by probably the most \nreputable analyst in the State, the McDowell Group. They did an \nassessment of ANWR-developed-related employment throughout the United \nStates. They base their numbers on $36-a-barrel oil. But given that \nprice range throughout the 50 States, it is estimated that a total of \n575,000 jobs would be created across the country.\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\n  We are talking today, tomorrow, and the following day about the \nPresident's economic stimulus plan, the economic growth plan. I am here \nto tell you, if we want economic growth, if we want economic stimulus, \nwe need jobs. And 575,000 jobs across the country is nothing to shake a \nstick at.\n  It is not just jobs on the west coast. Just pick a number here. \nPennsylvania: 27,000 jobs; Tennessee--the good Senator was here \nspeaking earlier: 11,000 jobs are estimated to be available in \nTennessee.\n  The sponsor of this amendment, from California--California will see \n63,000 jobs. The Senator from Washington was here earlier: 10,000 jobs \nin Washington.\n  You can go down the list. There is no State that somehow or other \ndoes not stand to gain if we are able to open ANWR.\n  You say, how are we really getting 10,000 jobs in Washington or \n63,000 jobs in California? We are going to need the pipes, the valves, \nthe drill bits, the trucks--everything else that goes along with \ndrilling and opening a new field and connecting these pipes. So these \nare real.\n\n  It is not an accident that this is included in this budget \nresolution. It is part of the President's priority and agenda because \nthis is about jobs.\n  To many of the unions across the country, they have truly identified \nthis as a jobs issue and are working very hard on this issue. To many \nof the families who are struggling, this is a family issue.\n  We talk about the caribou and we are concerned about the caribou and \nwe care for the wildlife. But the fact is, you have to have money to \nbuy your kids shoes and put food on the table, and only the jobs can \nprovide that.\n  The other thing about the jobs that will come, they will be real jobs \nwith real wages for people in my State. To hear the opponents of ANWR \ntalk, you would think that they want Alaska to be locked up and to be \njust this big, beautiful tourist attraction so they can come and visit. \nThat is nice. We want to have visitors to our State. We want people to \ncome up and see Prudhoe Bay. We want them to come and see the good job \nthat we do.\n  But this thought process implies that they want California or \nMassachusetts or New York or other States to produce tangible items for \nour economy. Alaskan residents, my constituents, the jobs they will get \nare carrying bags for these people when they come to visit as a \ntourist. Those are not the kinds of jobs that I want for my \nconstituents. That is not the kinds of jobs that Alaskans want. We want \nreal jobs. We want the ability to create real jobs.\n  It is demeaning and it is unfair to say that Massachusetts can keep \nits 20,000 petroleum-based jobs; that New Jersey can keep its 27,000 \npetroleum-industry jobs; and New York can keep its 36,000 petroleum-\nindustry jobs, while Alaska supposedly looks to other alternatives. Why \nis it OK for everybody else to do it, and yet in Alaska for some reason \nwe are not responsible, we can't handle it, we don't do it right, we \nneed to lock it up and preserve it because it is the last Serengeti?\n  By opening ANWR, we are trying to save the 11,000 petroleum-industry \njobs that we have in Alaska. We want to provide other States with \nsimilar opportunities.\n  When it comes to resource development in Alaska, we are not looking \nto spoil the environment. We want the environmental safeguards. We want \nto make sure we do it right. We want to make sure that we, those of us \nwho choose to live there, are going to continue to want to stay there \nbecause it is the quality of life that attracts us. We don't want to \ncircumvent any environmental requirements or processes. We want to use \nthe most safe and most clean and most expensive technology available to \nget this oil out of the ground.\n  I have lived my whole life in Alaska. I was born there. I am third \ngeneration. In fact I am the first person to represent Alaska in the \nCongress who was actually born in the State. I was actually born during \nterritorial days. I have no desire to see the environment of my State \nruined.\n  My husband came to Alaska because he was attracted by the beauty of \nthe State, by the fishing, by the wildlife. My husband and I are \nraising two sons who live for hunting and fishing and camping. This is \nwhy we are in Alaska. I would be the last person to suggest that we \nshould do anything to ruin our environment.\n  But I have seen what we can do. I know we can do it right. And we can \nbalance the development with the environment. They are not \ncontradictory terms.\n\n  It is difficult to stand here as a new Senator and go over these \narguments, but I cannot imagine what it must be like to stand in the \nsenior Senator's shoes, and having had this argument and this \ndiscussion and this debate about opening ANWR for the past 20, 25 \nyears, and to hear the same concerns and the same argument and the same \ndiscussion, and still our oil is locked up. It is a long time to be \ntalking about this. It is a long time.\n  If we had been successful--actually, they were successful in 1995, \nwhen ANWR passed the Congress, but President Clinton vetoed that ANWR \nlegislation in 1995. If he had not vetoed that, the oil from ANWR would \nsoon be on its way down the existing Alaska oil pipeline in time for \nwho knows what lies ahead.\n  I have mentioned we have a lot to look forward to in the years ahead, \nand it is not necessarily an oil-based economy. We have mentioned that \nthe President's initiative, the hydrogen initiative to power our cars, \nis out there. We are looking forward to that. But we have also talked \nabout the need to continue with our oil reserves for all those other \nresources and products that we have out there.\n  I have not touched on the desire, the concern, the request from \nAlaskans. Alaskans are looking at ANWR and saying: Well, wait a minute. \nWhy is it so difficult? If we are willing to accept the development in \nour State, why can't we move forward with this?\n  We listen very well and very closely to the arguments and concerns in \nother locales. In the Midwest, right now, they are saying: No, don't \ndrill in the Great Lakes. We don't want to do that. And I would say: If \nyou don't want drilling in the Great Lakes, and you are the people who \nlive there, and you say, no, we don't want it in our area, then, no, \nthere is no need to go there.\n  But in Alaska, we have said: We accept it. We want it. We are here to \nhelp. Yet we are being turned down. We are being refused. We are being \nblocked by outside interests that seem to think they know better than \nAlaskans about what we need to do.\n  In Alaska, we do not have this NIMBY syndrome. We are saying: Put it \nin our backyard. We will accept it. We will be responsible stewards for \nthis environment and for this resource. Let us help you.\n  We respect and defer to the opinions of those in other parts of the \ncountry who do not want drilling near them. All that we ask is that \nsame deference be afforded to us.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that we need to increase our use \nof renewable fuel sources. We have had some good discussions with \nseveral Senators about biodiesel, ethanol. But the Senators from those \nStates also need to recognize that in order to grow the crops necessary \nto make these renewable fuels, they are going to need fertilizers.\n  Fertilizers come from natural gas. I have been talking, for most of \nthe evening, about oil. But we need to also keep in mind that ANWR has \nvast deposits of natural gas, as much as 10 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas that could be used to mitigate the unusually high natural \ngas prices we are seeing.\n  Yesterday we received a letter from the American Farm Bureau \nFederation. In it the Farm Bureau requests support of environmentally \nsound energy development in ANWR and supports its inclusion in the \nSenate budget resolution. They recognize it is critical, it is \nimportant, for the farmers of America. If they are going to get the \nfertilizer they need, they are going to need that natural gas from \nsomewhere. They are projecting ahead; they are anticipating that \ndemand, and asking that we assist with the supply. And ANWR can assist \nwith the supply.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the \nAmerican Farm Bureau be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Lisa A. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: The American Farm Bureau Federation \n     requests that you support environmentally sound energy \n     development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and \n     support its inclusion in the Senate Budget Resolution.\n       America's farmers and ranchers utilize numerous energy \n     sources in the most efficient ways possible to grow the \n     products that help feed and clothe the world. Current world \n     circumstances have clearly pointed out this nation's over-\n     reliance of foreign sources to meet our energy needs. \n     American agriculture will spend from $1-2 billion more this \n     year than last and that is just to complete the planting \n     season and to get a crop in the ground. The instability of \n     current energy prices negatively affects each and every \n     aspect of agricultural production. From the fuel we use \n     directly to the natural gas that is turned into fertilizer \n     for crops to the diesel used in the locomotives and barges to \n     transport agricultural commodities to processors and \n     consumers; we are all reliant on affordable energy.\n       A balanced national energy agenda, complete with new \n     technology advancements, renewable energy allowances and a \n     significant increase in the domestic production of oil and \n     gas supplies will help meet the energy needs of America's \n     growing economy and population while providing a more \n     reliable, affordable and environmentally responsible energy \n     supply.\n       AFBF supports the environmentally sound energy development \n     in ANWR and urges you to oppose any attempt to remove this \n     language from the budget resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was commenting a moment ago about the \ndesire or the willingness of Alaskans to take on ANWR development, that \nwe are receptive to it. Earlier, on the floor this evening, the good \nSenator from California mentioned, and I believe had printed in the \nRecord, a statement of opposition to drilling from a tribal entity. I \nhave not seen that. I am not certain from where it came.\n  But I would like to also have in the Record that the Alaska \nFederation of Natives, which is the federation of all the Natives in \nthe State of Alaska, has passed a resolution in support of the opening \nof ANWR and urging the Congress ``to adopt legislation to open the \nCoastal Plain area of ANWR to an environmentally responsible program of \noil and gas leasing and development.'' I ask unanimous consent that \nthis resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Alaska Federation of Natives, Inc., Board of Directors, Resolution 95-\n                                   05\n\n       Whereas, the members of the Alaska Congressional \n     Delegation, as representatives of the people and in their \n     capacity as newly elected Chairmen of the Senate and House \n     Committees having jurisdiction over matters related to Alaska \n     Native people and the management of the energy and natural \n     resources on public lands, have requested the Alaska \n     Federation of Natives' Board of Directors to adopt a \n     resolution in support of the opening of the Coastal Plain; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Governor of the State of Alaska has requested \n     the Alaska Federation of Natives' Board of Directors to adopt \n     a resolution in support of the opening of the Coastal Plain \n     of ANWR, with a proviso for the protection of the Porcupine \n     Caribou Herd and the subsistence needs for the Native people \n     of Alaska; and\n       Whereas, the Alaska State Legislature has adopted a \n     resolution calling upon the U.S. Congress to adopt \n     legislation that would open the Coastal Plain of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge to responsible oil and gas leasing \n     and development, with protection for the Porcupine Caribou \n     Herd and the subsistence needs for the Native people of \n     Alaska; and\n       Whereas, North Slope oil production has declined from more \n     than two million B/D in 1990, to less than 1.6 million B/D \n     today; and\n       Whereas, revenues from oil production have been providing \n     about 85 percent of the State's revenues to fund programs to \n     meet the educational, social welfare, and other needs of \n     Alaska's people; and\n       Whereas, the small 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain study \n     area of ANWR, adjacent of Prudhoe Bay and other producing \n     fields is the nation's best prospect for major new oil and \n     gas discoveries; and\n       Whereas, opening the Coastal Plain area to an \n     environmentally responsible and carefully regulated program \n     of environmental oil and gas leasing would provide important \n     revenue benefits to the U.S. and to the State of Alaska; and\n       Whereas, opening the Coastal Plain will create new jobs for \n     Alaska Native people, new contracting opportunities for \n     Native-owned companies, and stimulate the State's local and \n     regional economies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the Board of Directors of the \n     Alaska Federation of Natives calls upon the Congress of the \n     United States to adopt legislation to open the Coastal Plain \n     area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to an \n     environmentally responsible program of oil and gas leasing \n     and development.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is, obviously, an issue that \ngenerates a lot of passion. We have seen that on the floor this \nevening. It has generated a lot of facts and figures. I would caution \npeople to look critically at the facts. Make sure they add up.\n  We have heard discussion from a couple of different individuals \ntonight about the amount of oil that is out there. And is it a 6-month \nsupply? And, if so, we surely should not open up ANWR.\n  As was pointed out by my fellow Senator from Alaska, that is assuming \nthere is no other source produced domestically or used domestically. It \nis an overt effort to skew the facts to one side's advantage.\n  In a debate such as this, it is critical that we know that our facts \nare sound, that our science is sound. So I ask people not to be swayed \nby the emotion. Caribou are beautiful animals, but I can tell you, we \nare caring for the caribou, our caribou are doing fine, our caribou are \nmultiplying at a wondrous rate, and they are doing it around the areas \nof development.\n  So it is important to try to show the rest of the country what ANWR \nis. But keep in mind, these little, tiny brief snapshots of a flowered \nfield, with beautiful mountains in the background, are not where the \n1002 area is that we are intending to drill. We are intending to drill \nan area that is the size of the Pinehurst Golf Resort in North \nCarolina, in an area that looks like the Moon.\n  I appreciate the hour. I appreciate the attention to this issue \nbecause in my State there is nothing more important that is happening. \nI would certainly encourage my colleagues tomorrow to listen intently \nto the debate.\n  I hope we move forward on oil and gas exploration along Alaska's \nCoastal Plain and oppose the Boxer amendment.\n  I don't see anyone else in the Chamber. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues as a \ncosponsor of this amendment, because the provision in the Budget \nResolution on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, also known more \ncommonly as ``ANWR,'' has no place in this resolution.\n  There are so many great things about our country. And one of them is \nthe progress made to protect our natural resources, including wildlife \nrefuges such as ANWR. ANWR--which constitutes just five percent of the \narea of Alaska's North Slope--is the last remaining stretch of the \nNorth Slope that is closed by law to oil and gas development. Even if \nthe oil in this small patch there were plentiful, which it is not, the \nprovision in this resolution still would not be the path we want to \nchoose.\n  The oil in the refuge could supply only a tiny percentage of our \nneeds, and is not worth the likelihood of permanent damage to wildlife \nin this vital habitat. A recent report from the National Academy of \nSciences highlighted the current damage to Alaska's North Slope from \nenergy production. For example, animals have been affected in different \nways, including direct mortality and displacement, reduced reproductive \nrates of birds due to enhanced predator populations, diversion of \nbowhead whale migrations, and altered distributions and productivity of \ncaribou. Furthermore, the National Academy of Sciences report concluded \nthat while new technologies have reduced some effects from energy \nproduction, expansion in new areas is certain to exacerbate existing \neffects and generate new ones. I see no need to risk an American \ntreasure in an environmentally-damaging hunt for this very limited, \nunsustainable fossil fuel source.\n  The long-term solution to our fuel needs is to tap a variety of \nrenewable\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nenergy sources, such as ethanol and biodiesel, wind, and biomass, as \nwell as energy efficient technologies such as hydrogen-powered fuel \ncells.\n  My continual support for ethanol is only strengthened by the topic on \nthe table right now. Ethanol offers a much more environmentally \nfriendly and economically sustainable energy option than the short-\nsighted approach embodied by the ANWR drilling plans. Fuel that is 80 \npercent ethanol--developed over the next decade or two--will \ndramatically reduce our dependence on fossil and foreign fuels.\n  Another source of renewable energy is soy diesel. For example, over \n30 buses in Cedar Rapids, IA, now run on soy diesel.\n  The transition to cleaner, domestically-produced fuels offers near \nand long term benefits, and we must start investing now in these \nrenewable fuels. Pinning our energy hopes on reaping a relatively small \namount of oil from an ecologically fragile area is not a long term \nstrategy. It is, in fact, very short-sighted, and will not meaningfully \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  The Department of Energy has estimated that without drilling in the \nArctic refuge, we'll import 62 percent of our oil in the year 2020. If \nwe do drill, the department says we'll still be importing 60 percent of \nour oil in 2020, when ANWR production will reach its peak, according to \nthe Energy Information Agency. Furthermore, according to the U.S. \nGeological Survey, the Arctic Refuge contains less economically \nrecoverable oil than the U.S. consumes in 6 months. Oil company \nexecutives confirm it would take at least 10 years of exploration and \ndevelopment before this oil would reach markets. That's scarcely a \ncompelling case for despoiling this environmental treasure.\n  And with 10 year build-up, this is not a short term, immediate \nstimulant for our economy. The revenue won't be seen for years, and it \nwill be a small amount at that! Instead, we should focus on developing \nnew domestic energy sources in this country by supporting the \ndevelopment of renewable fuels.\n  Further, we shouldn't be authorizing this kind of policy in a budget. \nInserting controversial policy changes into a budget measure via \nreconciliation instructions shortchanges the normal legislative process \nby limiting debate. This ANWR debacle short circuits the normal \nlegislative process used for consideration of controversial policy \nissues of this magnitude in the Senate.\n  I am committed to protecting and preserving our wilderness areas, \nparks, forests and wildlife. I cherish these resources, and I will \ncontinue to do what I can to see that they are protected. I am likewise \ncommitted to energy security for our Nation. The only way truly to \nachieve that goal is with renewable sources of energy available right \nhere in our country.\n  Because of the concerns I have stated here, I am opposed to the \nBudget Resolution's reconciliation instructions to the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to write a bill that would open up ANWR so \nthat the Federal Government can receive revenue from drilling in that \nfragile area. Consequently, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting \nfor this important amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support amendment No. \n272, which is similar to one I offered in the Budget Committee. It \nwould strike the reconciliation instruction to the Energy Committee \ncontained in the budget resolution before us.\n  This instruction requires the Energy Committee to produce $2.15 \nbillion by reporting out legislation by May 1, 2003, with the \nassumption that they open the coastal plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil drilling.\n  Management of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain has been hotly debated \nfor many years. Some Senators, like myself, believe that this area \nshould be designated as a Federal wilderness area. Other Senators \nbelieve that this area should be explored for its oil potential.\n  I support this amendment because I believe that the fate of the \ncoastal plain of the Arctic Refuge is a question of Federal National \nWildlife Refuge management, not budgetary policy. And if a Senator \nbelieves that oil reserves which may be located under the coastal plain \nare needed today or 20 years from now, for reasons of enhancing this \ncountry's energy security, then the fate of the refuge is a question of \nenergy policy, not budgetary policy.\n  No matter where a Senator might consider himself or herself in the \ndiscussion over the fate of the refuge--and this issue was debated at \nlength during the Senate's consideration of the energy bill last year--\nno Senator has said that the primary reason to change the management of \nthe Refuge was because we just needed the revenue.\n  In fact, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Nickles, again \nstated, when I offered my amendment in committee, that these \ninstructions are included in the budget resolution because Arctic \ndrilling is needed to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and produce \noil.\n  I know there are strongly held views on this topic, and I do not \nintend here to go into all the reasons why I have concerns about the \npossibility of oil drilling in the refuge. Other Senators who join in \noffering this amendment will be making that case.\n  I feel that the fate of the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge is too \nimportant to become a number in the budget process.\n  I also think that, for several reasons, Senators who support drilling \nin the refuge should support this amendment and object to using the \nbudget resolution and reconciliation to achieve that goal.\n  As Senators know, debate on a reconciliation bill and all amendments, \ndebatable motions, and appeals related to it is limited to a total of \n20 hours. After 20 hours, debate ends. Consideration of amendments then \nmay continue without debate.\n  I am concerned that using a fast track procedure like reconciliation \nto open the refuge exposes the Senate to criticism that we are using \nthe refuge revenues in part for tax cuts or to authorize new spending \nprograms.\n  Particularly, the Senate may be accused of dispensing refuge revenues \nin unrelated accounts to gain political support for refuge drilling. \nOur constituents may also be concerned that we will have to spend a \ngreat deal to implement a drilling program in the Arctic Refuge because \nmuch of the infrastructure needed to bring oil from the Refuge to the \nrest of the country does not exist today.\n  As well, I am concerned that some Senators are supporting drilling in \nthe refuge because they feel that it can be done in an \n``environmentally safe'' way or they feel that it should be done \njointly with energy efficiency, oil savings, and alternative energy \nprograms to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil.\n  But reconciliation limits the way in which Senators who are concerned \nabout these issues, and who do not serve on the Energy Committee, are \nable to address those issues on the floor.\n  The Congressional Budget Act explicitly prohibits the offering of \nnongermaine amendments to a reconciliation bill. If a Senator felt that \nthe Energy Committee's reconciliation bill opening the refuge did not \ngo far enough to regulate environmental impacts associated with Arctic \ndrilling, or to promote alternative energy in light of Arctic drilling, \nthe Senator may not be able to offer amendments on the floor to improve \nthe bill.\n  Such amendments, which might improve the bill from an environmental \nstandpoint, might well be considered extraneous because they do not \nraise revenue. I would caution all Members of the Senate who have \ncommitted to support Arctic drilling only in certain cases, or only if \ncertain other legislative or regulatory actions take place, to think \nseriously about whether reconciliation serves their interests and their \nconstituents' interests.\n  Finally, I oppose using reconciliation because I believe it is being \nused to limit consideration of a controversial issue. The American \npeople have strongly held views on drilling in the refuge, and they \nwant to know that the Senate is working to pass legislation to manage \nthe area appropriately in a forthright and open process.\n  That will not be achieved if reconciliation instruction on the Arctic \nRefuge is included in the resolution before us. I urge support for the \namendment of the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\ninclusion of provisions in the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution that \nwould provide for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The United States critically needs to reduce its dependence on \nforeign oil. Some believe we can drill our way to energy independence. \nThat is simply not the case.\n  If we were today to start drilling in ANWR, our largest remaining \ndomestic oil reserve, we would do almost nothing to decrease our \nreliance on foreign oil. It is a cold, hard fact: the United States \nuses about 25 percent of the world's oil, but only possesses 3 percent \nof the world's known oil reserves.\n  The Department of Energy has projected that if current trends \ncontinue, we will need an additional 5 million barrels of oil per day \nby 2020. Even under the most optimistic scenarios, ANWR could supply \nonly a small fraction of that amount.\n  The alternative is to increase energy efficiency and develop \nalternative technologies. Simply increasing fuel economy standards for \nautomobiles would do far more to reduce our imports of foreign oil than \nwould drilling in the Arctic. Not only that, but it would also save \nAmericans billions of dollars.\n  Protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the right thing to \ndo for the environment. Along with increased fuel efficiency and \nrenewable energy production, protecting the Arctic is also the right \nthing to do for the economy and for America's energy security. Most \nimportant, it is the right thing to do for future generations.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in support of removing provisions \nfrom the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution that would open ANWR to oil \ndrilling.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Boxer's \namendment to strike the budget resolution provision opening the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.\n  To begin, I do not believe that the ANWR provision should be attached \nto a budget resolution. ANWR is a prominent national issue, arousing \nthe passions of people of both sides. Regardless of one's view on the \nissue, the question of whether to open the refuge to drilling warrants \nan independent debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  We must also remember that a majority of Americans--55 percent \naccording to the latest poll--oppose drilling in the refuge. We should \nnot use backdoor techniques to sneak a drilling provision through on a \ntechnicality.\n  The budget bill is simply not the appropriate forum for the Arctic \nRefuge debate.\n  As a member of the Energy Committee, I believe the ANWR debate is \nbetter addressed in the context of an energy bill.\n  Now to discuss the provision itself. Proponents of drilling claim \nthat drilling in ANWR will free us from our dependence on oil from the \nMiddle East. This is simply not the case.\n  The bottom line is that, according to estimates from the United \nStates Geological Survey, the Arctic Refuge would yield only about 6 \nmonths' worth of oil.\n  Facts are, we would have to get the oil over a longer period but \nwould still receive less than a million barrels of oil per day even at \npeak production.\n  Furthermore, the oil would not flow for at least 10 years and would \ndo nothing for our current national security situation.\n  Even the Energy Information Administration, the most optimistic \nforecaster of ANWR's oil potential, estimates that drilling in ANWR \nwould reduce our oil imports by only 2 percent by 2020. And for a \nreduction of 2 percent, we would damage a national treasure.\n  Proponents of drilling would also have us believe that we can drill \nin ANWR without significant environmental cost. However, as the recent \nreport by the National Academies shows us, even with the newest \ntechnologies, oil exploration and development harm the North Slope's \nWildlife, ecosystems, and wilderness qualities.\n  The report tells us that the effects of previous development on the \nNorth Slope will remain for centuries, and we know that the oil is a \nshort term supply.\n  To quote the report, we face an essential trade-off in assessing \n``whether the benefits derived from oil and gas activities justify \nacceptance of the inevitable accumulated undesirable effects'' that \naccompany development on the North Slope. My answer to this question is \na resounding no, the small benefits are simply not worth the costs.\n  Development's effects on wildlife warrant more discussion. According \nto the National Academies' report, oil exploration and development has \nnegatively affected--and will continue to affect--caribou and bowhead \nwhales.\n  In some developed areas, feeding on garbage has caused population \nexplosions of predators and the local populations of nesting birds can \nno longer support themselves without immigration from undeveloped \nareas.\n  As more and more of the North Slope falls prey to oil development, \none has to wonder from where the additional birds will come.\n  Therefore, while I agree that we are too dependent on foreign oil, \nand need to reduce that dependence, drilling for oil in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge is simply not the answer. Drilling would not \ngive us energy security and would carry huge environmental costs.\n  Reducing oil consumption and increasing Corporate Average Fuel \nEconomy, or CAFE standards, is the better route to energy security.\n  In contrast to a small, temporary supply available far in the future \nand including serious environmental consequences, simply raising \naverage fuel economy standards for sport utility vehicles could save us \nmore than a million barrels per day by 2020.\n  The savings from increasing efficiency would begin sooner than oil \nfrom ANWR and, unlike oil from ANWR, the savings would not run out. \nRaising CAFE standards for all vehicles would save even more oil.\n  I would like to focus on energy security for a moment. If we truly \nwant to increase our energy independence, it is vital that we \nunderstand why we are now so dependent on foreign oil.\n  The United States contains only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves \nand only 4 percent of the world population. And yet we consume 25 \npercent of the oil produced worldwide.\n  Almost two-thirds of that oil goes to fuel the transportation sector.\n  Given our current level of consumption in relation to our domestic \nreserves, it is clear that modest increases in domestic production--as \nfrom ANWR--will not solve our energy problems.\n  Reducing consumption is the key to increasing America's energy \nsecurity.\n  Our system of fuel economy standards needs updating. When CAFE \nstandards were created in 1975, the U.S. consumed about 16 million \nbarrels of oil per day and imported a little more than a third of that \noil. Today, American consumes about 19 million barrels each day but we \nnow import more than half of that oil.\n  When fuel economy standards were first implemented, a lower standard \nwas created for light trucks because they were not considered passenger \nvehicles. At the time, light duty trucks made up a small percentage of \nvehicles on the road and were primarily used for agriculture and \ncommerce, not as passenger vehicles.\n  Today, however, SUVs are predominantly passenger vehicles and yet \nthey are still held to a lower fuel economy standard than other cars.\n  The fuel economy standard for other passenger automobiles has \nremained constant at 27.5 miles per gallon since 1990, while the \nstandard for SUVs and light trucks has been just 20.7 miles per gallon \nsince 1991. This lower standard is called the ``SUV loophole.''\n  When there were few SUVs and light trucks on our roads, the SUV \nloophole did not affect our national oil consumption. However, with \nSUVs and light duty trucks now making up almost half of all new \nvehicles sold, overall fuel economy has reached its lowest level in two \ndecades. We have been moving backwards.\n  Senator Snowe and I have introduced a bill which would require SUVs \nand light duty trucks, which are used as passenger vehicles, to meet \nthe same fuel economy standards as other passenger vehicles by 2011.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences, automakers can meet \nthe higher standard with existing technologies.\n  The Feinstein-Snowe bill would save 1 million barrels of oil a day, \nmore than we can expect to recover from ANWR, and, again, these \nbenefits would not run out.\n  Our legislation would increase SUV fuel economy, reduce oil \nconsumption,\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\nand increase energy security. But just closing the SUV loophole is not \nenough.\n  The Feinstein-Snowe legislation would also increase the average fuel \neconomy of the Federal Government's fleet of vehicles. With Federal \nvehicles comprising about one percent of all vehicles sold in the U.S. \neach year, the Federal Government should set an example and reduce the \nFederal fleet's fuel consumption.\n  Increasing fuel economy includes additional benefits. First, \nincreased efficiency will protect consumers from higher gasoline costs. \nOur bill would save American motorists billions of dollars per year at \nthe pump.\n  Second, the Feinstein-Snowe bill would fight global warming by \npreventing about 240 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the \natmosphere each year.\n  Still, we should also go beyond the Feinstein-Snowe legislation and \nincrease average fuel economy standards for all cars.\n  Raising average fuel economy standards to 39 miles per gallon, an \nachievable goal, would save 51 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 \nyears, 5 to 10 times more than what is technically recoverable from \nANWR.\n  So if this were really a debate on our dependence on foreign oil, we \nwould already have passed legislation to improve fuel economy \nstandards.\n  Drilling in ANWR, on the other hand, would not significantly increase \nour energy security and would not fight climate change. Because the \nprice of oil is set on the world market and the quantity of oil in ANWR \nwould not affect the world price, drilling in ANWR also would not save \nconsumers any money.\n  To sum up, drilling in ANWR is simply not worth the price. The Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge is a crown jewel of the National Wildlife \nRefuge system.\n  ANWR is the only conservation unit in the U.S. encompassing a \ncomplete range of arctic ecosystems, and the coastal plain provides \nessential habitat for many species.\n  The coastal plain, which proponents of drilling paint as small and \ninsignificant, is the ecological heart of the refuge, the center of \nwildlife activity, and the calving area of the porcupine caribou herd.\n  Proponents of drilling would have us risk all of this for a small \namount of oil that would not even begin to flow for 10 years and would \nbarely reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  The National Academies' report shows us that we should not consider \nthe drilling provision in isolation. We must consider both the role of \nthe coastal plain in the overall refuge and the cumulative effects of \ndevelopment in surrounding areas.\n  ANWR is a crucial part of the larger landscape and is now the only \nsliver of the North Slope coastal plain that the administration is not \nopening to leasing.\n  In short, the refuge's coastal plain is too precious, and contains \ntoo little oil, for us to allow drilling to take place.\n  Although the National Academies' report is silent regarding ANWR \npolicy, the chairman of the committee, Dr. Gordon Orians, has said that \nhe hopes the report will inform the debate. The committee's findings \nshould inform our decision. The price of drilling is simply too high.\n  Future generations will thank us for our foresight in protecting the \nANWR coastal plain and its wildlife. They will thank us for finding \nother avenues to increased energy security.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of a patriotic pause \namendment to the budget resolution.\n  America stands on the brink of war. Yet this budget resolution \nignores the war and ignores the costs of war. We need to take a \npatriotic pause and not proceed with huge permanent tax breaks when we \ndon't yet know the cost of this war--or the costs that come after the \nwar, in the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  This budget resolution calls for a $1.4 trillion tax cut. These are \npermanent tax breaks that would add to the structural deficit even \nwithout war. The patriotic pause amendment states that before we \nconsider tax cuts, we need to ensure the Federal budget addresses our \nvery real national security needs. That means the cost of deploying our \ntroops; the cost of fighting the war; the cost of keeping troops in the \nregion afterward and the cost of rebuilding Iraq.\n  The budget must also provide for the continuing war on terrorism. It \nmust cover the costs of other conflicts and potential conflicts, such \nas standing sentry on North Korea. The budget must ensure that we can \nhelp our troops and their families face the hardships of deployment. \nAnd it must meet the costs of homeland security--and hometown security.\n  I supported a multilateral approach to confronting Iraq--to enable \nthe world to share the costs and the burden. I believe that because \nSaddam Hussein is a danger to the world the world should share the \nburden of defanging him. America must redouble our diplomatic efforts \nto broaden the coalition of the willing. That means returning to the \nU.N. to share the costs of the war and the costs of rebuilding Iraq.\n  In the meantime, the administration must consider the costs of this \nwar. The former White House economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsay, \nestimated that the war in Iraq could cost $100 to $200 billion. The \nfact that some of these costs may be hard to predict does not excuse \nassuming they won't cost anything at all. One thing we know for sure is \nthat the cost is not zero. We must ensure that our national security \nneeds are covered before considering tax cuts. We need to think about \nnational security--and economic security.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a patriotic pause in \nthe budget process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3874-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

WAINWRIGHT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today marks the 40th anniversary of the \nSupreme Court's Gideon v. Wainwright decision, which held that all \npeople facing serious criminal charges are entitled to a lawyer, \nwhether they can afford one or not. The anniversary of this watershed \nmoment in American law should be a cause for celebration.

The unfortunate fact is that in some parts of the \ncountry, it is better to be rich and guilty than poor and innocent, \nbecause the rich will get their competent counsel, but those who are \nnot rich often find their lives placed in the hands of underpaid court-\nappointed lawyers who are inexperienced, inept, uninterested, or worse.\n  Just 2 years ago, the Department of Justice declared that public \ndefense in the United States is in a ``chronic state of crisis.'' \nAround the country there are alarming statistics about the many flaws \nthat continue to plague the\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\ncriminal justice system. For example, according to the National Legal \nAid and Defender Association: In Wisconsin, more than 11,000 people go \nunrepresented annually because anyone with an annual income of more \nthan $3,000 is deemed able to afford a lawyer. In Bucks County, PA, the \npublic defender office handled 4,173 cases in 1980. In 2000, with the \nsame number of attorneys, the office handled an estimated 8,000 cases. \nIn Lake Charles, LA, the public defender office has only two \ninvestigators for the 2,550 new felony cases and 4,000 new misdemeanor \ncases assigned to the office each year. Indigent clients in Lake \nCharles typically meet their public defender for the first time an \naverage of 281 days--more than 9 months--after their arrest. In \nVirginia, a juvenile charged with a felony who cannot afford a lawyer \ngets an attorney who is paid for the equivalent of only 90 minutes of \nwork because of the $112 per-case fee cap.\n  The crisis in public defense is not limited to misdemeanor and minor \nfelony cases. I have spoken many times over the past 3 years about the \nshameful but all too common spectacle of underpaid, underfunded, and \nincompetent counsel in capital cases.\n  When people in this country are put on trial for their lives, they \ndeserve to be defended by lawyers who meet reasonable standards of \ncompetence, and who have sufficient resources to investigate the facts \nand prepare thoroughly for trial. As citizens, we expect that of our \nprosecutors. We ought to expect the same thing of our defense \nattorneys. Yet in these most important cases, where life or death hangs \nin the balance, defendants have been represented by sleeping lawyers, \ndrunk lawyers, lawyers under the influence of drugs, lawyers who do not \nmeet or even speak with their client until the eve of trial, and \nlawyers who refer to their own client with racial slurs.\n  Part of the problem, I think, lies with some State court judges who \ndo not appear to expect much of anything from criminal defense \nattorneys, even when they are representing people who are on trial for \ntheir lives. Good judges, like good prosecutors, want competent \nlawyering for both sides. But some judges run for reelection touting \nthe number and speed of death sentences they have handed down. For \nthem, the adversarial system is a hindrance.\n  The problem of low standards is not confined to elected state judges. \nLast year, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was OK for the defendant \nin a capital murder trial to be represented by the same lawyer who \nrepresented the murder victim. Two years ago, a Federal appeals court \nstruggled with the question whether a defense lawyer who slept through \nmost of his client's capital murder trial provided effective assistance \nof counsel. Fortunately, a majority of the court eventually came to the \nsensible conclusion that ``unconscious counsel equates to no counsel at \nall.''\n  If Gideon is to have any meaning in the 21st century, the courts must \nstart demanding more of defense lawyers than that they simply show up \nfor the trial and remain awake. At the same time, the people's \nrepresentatives in the State legislatures and here in Congress must \nalso do their part.\n  For 3 years, I have been working with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to pass the Innocence Protection Act, a basic, commonsense \npackage of criminal justice reforms. This bill would help make good on \nGideon's promise of equal justice in the small but consequential set of \ncases in which the accused faces a possible death sentence. More \nspecifically, the bill would help States create the systems and pay the \nprice for qualified attorneys in capital cases.\n  Last year, the Innocence Protection Act won the support of a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and more than \nhalf the entire House of Representatives. This year, my cosponsors and \nI are committed to getting the bill signed into law.\n  The anniversary of Gideon is a time to reflect on how far we have \ncome, and how far we have to go, in ensuring equal justice for all \nAmericans. The United States must do better to protect the rights of \nits citizens and provide qualified defense counsel to the poor and \ndisadvantaged. It should not take another 40 years to deliver on this \nbasic constitutional guarantee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3875-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SUPPORT FOR A MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on \nthe execution of Louis Jones, Jr., earlier today by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Louis Jones was a highly decorated 22-year Army veteran, including \nservice to our nation as an Army Ranger.\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nHe rose through the ranks to reach the top of enlisted personnel and \nretired with an honorable discharge in 1993 as a Master Sergeant. After \nserving on active duty in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert \nStorm/Desert Shield, Mr. Jones returned to the United States and began \nexperiencing symptoms consistent with gulf war syndrome. He exhibited \npersonality and behavior changes, including increased hostility, \naggression, and a tendency to fixate irrationally.\n  In 1995, in a Federal district court in Texas, Louis Jones, Jr., an \nAfrican-American, was convicted and sentenced to death for the \nkidnaping and murder of an airwoman at Goodfellow Air Force Base in \nLubbock, TX. There is no question that Mr. Jones committed this \nhorrific crime. Mr. Jones did not dispute his guilt. But what Mr. Jones \nrequested, and what I believed he should have had, was further \nexamination of his medical condition and its potential role in the \ncrime he committed.\n  Evidence of his brain damage was not available at his trial, as \nscientific research about the effects of exposure to toxins during the \ngulf war was still in its early stages. Since his trial, however, \nextensive research on gulf war syndrome and its symptoms has revealed \nbrain damage as one possible result of exposure to toxins during the \ngulf war. Dr. Robert Haley, one of the Nation's most renowned \nresearchers and experts on gulf war syndrome, has now concluded that \nMr. Jones's symptoms were consistent with those of a subset of gulf war \nsyndrome patients who were exposed to particularly toxic chemical \nagents during the gulf war. Had the jury known of Mr. Jones mental \ncondition and that his condition was the result of service in the gulf \nwar, it is very possible that the jury would have returned a sentence \nother than death.\n  It is unconscionable that the Federal Government would execute a gulf \nwar veteran who displayed the symptoms of gulf war syndrome at the time \nof the crime, but was denied a fair opportunity to use this evidence to \nargue for a sentence other than death. On the eve of war, and \nespecially on the eve of another war in the Persian Gulf region where \nmore than 200,000 brave American men and women are prepared to make the \nultimate sacrifice for their nation, President Bush could have taken a \nsmall step for fairness and justice. He could have stayed the execution \nto allow further medical testing and examination.\n  I believe that President Bush should have done more. He should not \nhave gone forward with this execution in the face of increasing \nconcerns about the fairness of the Federal death penalty system.\n  Today, more than 2 years after the U.S. Department of Justice \nreleased a survey showing geographic and racial disparities in the \nFederal death penalty system, we still do not have an explanation of \nwhy who lives and who dies in the Federal system appears to relate to \nthe color of the defendant's skin or the region of the country where \nthe defendant is prosecuted. Attorney General Janet Reno was so \ndisturbed by the results of this survey that she ordered a further, in-\ndepth study of the results. Attorney General John Ashcroft pledged to \ncontinue that study, but we still await the results.\n  And while we await the results of this study, we have also learned \nthat the Justice Department appears to be seeking the death penalty \nmore aggressively in Federal cases. Attorney General Ashcroft appears \nto be pursuing consistency in the application of the Federal death \npenalty nationwide by seeking it more aggressively in jurisdictions \nwhere Federal prosecutors have infrequently requested authorization \nfrom the Attorney General to seek the death penalty. In other words, he \nseems intent on making the Federal system replicative of States that \naggressively pursue the death penalty States like Texas, which this \nweek is scheduled to execute its 300th inmate in the modern death \npenalty era.\n  I am very concerned that the Attorney General's apparent \ndetermination to increase death penalty prosecutions, including \nsometimes overriding decisions of local prosecutors, increases the risk \nthat the Federal Government could execute an innocent person. Former \nFederal prosecutors have said that ``they need to take every last \nprecaution to avoid the risk of condemning an innocent person to \ndeath.'' Last week I sent a letter to Attorney General Ashcroft \nexpressing my grave concern about these issues and asking him to answer \nseveral questions about the Justice Department's decision-making \nprocess in death-eligible cases.\n  There is no punishment in our criminal justice system more worthy of \ncareful review and absolute certainty before we carry it out than \ncapital punishment. Each time the Federal Government carries out the \nultimate punishment while so many questions remain unanswered, it \nerodes confidence in the justice system. The case of Louis Jones, Jr., \nis no exception. His case is plagued by particularly troubling \ncircumstances that also cast doubt on the fairness of the Federal death \npenalty system. The existing cracks in our Federal death penalty system \nseem to be widening, and new ones are appearing, further weakening the \nfoundation of our justice system.\n  Today, with the execution of Mr. Jones, our Federal criminal justice \nsystem has taken a step backward. Our goals of fairness and equal \njustice under law were not met, and the American people's reason for \nconfidence in our Federal criminal justice system was diminished.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a temporary freeze on executions to \nallow a thorough, nationwide review of the fairness of the \nadministration of the death penalty. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe National Death Penalty Moratorium Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the above-referenced \nletter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2003.\n     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,\n     Attorney General of the United States,\n     Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: I write to inquire about \n     the decision-making process for determining whether to seek \n     the death penalty in federal capital-eligible cases.\n       I am concerned about the fairness of the decision-making \n     process, after reading recent news report that indicate you \n     have overridden the recommendation of local federal \n     prosecutors in at least 28 federal death-eligible cases. You \n     appear to be pursuing consistency in the application of the \n     federal death penalty nationwide by seeking it more \n     aggressively in jurisdictions where federal prosecutors have \n     infrequently requested authorization from the Attorney \n     General to seek the death penalty. In other words, you seem \n     intent on making the federal system replicative of states \n     that aggressively pursue the death penalty--states like \n     Texas, which next week is scheduled to execute its 300th \n     inmate in the modern death penalty era.\n       I am concerned that your apparent determination to increase \n     death penalty prosecutions, including sometimes overriding \n     decisions of local prosecutors, increases the risk that the \n     federal government could execute an innocent person. Former \n     federal prosecutors have said that ``they need to take every \n     last precaution to avoid the risk of condemning an innocent \n     person to death.'' See ``In Brooklyn Murder Case, Doubts on \n     Identification,'' New York Times, Feb. 12, 2003. While you \n     and I may disagree on the fundamental question of whether the \n     federal government should be authorized to use capital \n     punishment, I hope that we can agree that the Constitution \n     and the integrity of our criminal justice system require the \n     fair administration of the death penalty and that only the \n     guilty are convicted.\n       I join in Senator Leahy's request in a letter to you dated \n     February 7, 2003, for the following information about the \n     capital case review and decision-making process:\n       (1) (A) What is the process by which the Department decides \n     whether to accept a U.S. Attorney's recommendation that the \n     death penalty should or should not be sought in a particular \n     case? (B) To what extent are the U.S. Attorney's \n     recommendations afforded deference? (C) In cases in which the \n     death penalty has been sought, does the Department follow the \n     same process and afford the same level of deference in \n     deciding whether to approve a plea or cooperation agreement \n     that requires withdrawal of the notice of intention to seek \n     the death penalty?\n       (2) (A) Since you became Attorney General in February 2001, \n     how many capital-eligible cases have been submitted to the \n     Department for review? (B) In how many cases has the \n     Department rejected a U.S. Attorney's recommendation not to \n     seek the death penalty, and in what States? (C) In how many \n     cases has the Department rejected a U.S. Attorney's \n     recommendation to seek the death penalty, and in what States? \n     (D) In how many cases in which the death penalty was sought \n     has the Department authorized the U.S. Attorney to enter into \n     a plea or cooperation agreement that requires withdrawal of \n     the notice of intention to seek the death penalty? (E) In how \n     many cases in\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\n     which the death penalty was sought has the Department \n     overridden the judgment of local federal prosecutors and \n     rejected a plea or cooperation agreement that requires \n     withdrawal of the notice of intention to seek the death \n     penalty?\n       In addition, I request that you provide responses to the \n     following questions:\n       (a) (A) Since you became Attorney General in February 2001, \n     in how many cases and in which federal districts have you \n     directed the federal prosecutor to seek the death penalty, \n     even though both the U.S. Attorney and the Capital Case \n     Review Committee made recommendations to decline seeking the \n     death penalty? (B) In how many cases and in which federal \n     districts have you directed the U.S. Attorney to seek the \n     death penalty, where the U.S. Attorney recommended against \n     seeking the death penalty and the Capital Case Review \n     Committee recommended in favor of seeking the death penalty? \n     (C) In how many cases and in which federal districts have you \n     directed the U.S. Attorney to seek the death penalty, where \n     the U.S. Attorney recommended in favor of seeking the death \n     penalty and the Capital Case Review Committee recommended \n     against seeking the death penalty? I note that the Department \n     provided similar information as part of its 2000 survey of \n     the federal death penalty system, and I request that the \n     Department compile this information again and provide it \n     to me. See the Federal Death Penalty System: A Statistical \n     Survey (1988-2000), U.S. Dept. of Justice (Sept. 12, \n     2000).\n       (4) ``The Attorney General will, of course, retain legal \n     authority as head of the Justice Department to determine in \n     an exceptional case that the death penalty is an appropriate \n     punishment, notwithstanding the United States Attorney's view \n     that it should not be pursued.'' The Federal Death Penalty \n     System: Supplementary Data, Analysis and Revised Protocols \n     for Capital Case Review, U.S. Dept. of Justice (June 6, \n     2001), p. 27 (emphasis added). I understand that, as of March \n     11, 2003, 30 of your 67 death penalty approvals have \n     apparently been such ``exceptional cases.'' (A) How do you \n     account for this amazingly high proportion of cases in which \n     you have forged ahead to seek death despite your own \n     prosecutors' recommendations to the contrary? (B) In how many \n     cases, in which federal districts, and under what \n     circumstances, have you concluded that the case was \n     ``exceptional'' and exercised your authority to direct U.S. \n     Attorneys to seek the death penalty?\n       (5) In June 2001, you revised the ``death penalty \n     protocols,'' U.S. Attorneys Manual Sec. 9-10.000, et seq., by \n     changing the definition of ``substantial federal interest'' \n     so as to remove an earlier provision that forbade the \n     Department from relying on the fact that a state has chosen \n     through democratic means not to impose capital punishment. \n     U.S.A.M. Sec. 9-10.070. (A) In how many cases and in which \n     federal districts, have you directed U.S. Attorneys to seek \n     the death penalty where the death penalty would be \n     unavailable in a state prosecution? (B) For each of these \n     cases, please state whether the U.S. Attorneys, the Capital \n     Case Review Committee, or you accorded any weight to the \n     unavailability of the death penalty under state law as a \n     reason favoring federal prosecution, or federal pursuit of \n     the death penalty.\n       (6) The June 2001 revisions to the ``death penalty \n     protocols'' included adding a provision under which proposed \n     plea bargains in death-eligible cases must be approved by you \n     rather than by the U.S. Attorney. U.S.A.M. Sec. 9-10.100. You \n     enacted this modification in an attempt to address the \n     concern that white defendants fare better in the plea \n     bargaining process and are almost twice as likely as African \n     American defendants to enter into plea bargains, thus saving \n     them from a death sentence. (A) In how many cases and in \n     which federal districts, have you denied requests to approve \n     plea bargains, after you have authorized the U.S. Attorney to \n     seek the death penalty? (B) In how many cases and in which \n     federal districts, have you granted requests for such \n     approval? (C) With respect to each of these cases, please \n     provide data on the race and ethnicity of the defendants. \n     (D) With respect to each of the above cases, how many of \n     the proposed plea bargains included a provision requiring \n     the defendant to provide cooperation to the government?\n       (7) Concern that racial and geographic disparities exist \n     continue to plague the federal death penalty systems. See. \n     e.g., ``Death Penalty Cases Raise Race Questions,'' New York \n     Times, Feb. 13, 2003. In releasing the 2000 survey, then-\n     Attorney General Reno directed the National Institute of \n     Justice to fund research about the use of the federal death \n     penalty. At your confirmation hearing in January 2001, and \n     again in testimony by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson \n     before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution \n     in June 2001, you and the Department expressed your \n     commitment to pursuing such research. (A) Please provide an \n     update as to the status of that research project, including a \n     description of who is conducting the research and when it is \n     expected to be completed.\n       (B) In your letter to me dated July 25, 2001, and the \n     Department's responses to my written questions following the \n     June 2001 Constitution Subcommittee hearing, you agreed to \n     support researchers in gaining access to the data they will \n     need to conduct this study and expressed your intention to \n     issue guidance to all U.S. Attorneys to cooperate with the \n     researchers, consistent with privacy and sensitive law \n     enforcement issues and grand jury secrecy rules. What \n     instructions have you provided to U.S. Attorneys or \n     Department employees about granting the researchers access to \n     information regarding the investigation and prosecution of \n     potential capital cases? Please provide me with copies of all \n     instructions or guidance you have issued to U.S. Attorneys \n     and Department employees about this issue.\n       (8) ``U.S. Attorneys will be required to submit \n     information, including racial and ethnic data, about \n     potential capital cases, as well as those in which a capital \n     offense is actually being charged.'' The Federal Death \n     Penalty System: Supplementary Data, Analysis and Revised \n     protocols for Capital Case Review, U.S. Dept. of Justice \n     (June 6, 2001), p. 4. Specifically, the Department has stated \n     that ``more complete racial and ethnic data'' should be made \n     ``available for both actual and potential federal capital \n     cases on a continuing bases.'' Id. I am pleased that the \n     Department recognizes that there is a need for public \n     disclosure of information about the use of the federal death \n     penalty on a regular basis.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a young man from \nMissoula, MT, who was killed when the Army helicopter he was riding in \ncrashed in the remote woods of New York State during a training \nexercise. PFC Stoutenburg was among the 11 people in his 13-person unit \nkilled in the Black Hawk crash. PFC Stoutenburg was only 18 years old.\n  Like his fellow men and women in uniform, PFC Stoutenburg dedicated \nhis life to defending our country and upholding the principles it was \nfounded upon. As a member of the 10th Mountain Division based at Fort \nDrum, NY, he trained not only to defend the United States against \naggressors but also to uphold our country's greatest values--freedom, \nliberty, equality, and democracy.\n  PFC Stoutenburg's sacrifices for his State and country make all of us \nproud to be Montanans and Americans. He truly did his part to hold the \nbright torch during the dark night that will guide the way to a \nbrighter day of democracy and stability around the world. His tragic \ndeath is a reminder that our freedom is the result of the courageous \nmen and women who everyday face great risk while defending our country.\n  PFC Stryder Stoutenburg is survived by his mother Jane; maternal \ngrandmother, Joyce Sleep of Dade City, FL; two sisters, Laurel Miller \nof Middletown, NY, and Joyce Rodriguez of Harrisonburg, VA; and two \nnieces and two nephews.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3877-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3877-S3878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                ROY ROWE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a true \nAmerican hero from my State--Mr. Roy Rowe of Mena, AR. In the coming \nweeks, Mr. Rowe will be awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for his \nservice in the U.S. Army during the Second World War, an honor that is \nrichly deserved.\n  Roy Rowe was inducted into the U.S. Army in October 1942. Serving in \nthe Pacific theater, Mr. Rowe was assigned to the 96th Infantry \nDivision. Over the course of three months beginning in April 1945, the \n96th Division landed on the beaches of Okinawa as part of the greatest \nconcentration of land, sea, and air power ever assembled in the \nPacific. The battle for Okinawa was the costliest single battle of the \nPacific war for both sides. In terms of U.S. casualties, Okinawa was \nsecond only to the Battle of the Bulge. Of U.S. Army personnel, 4,436 \nwere killed in action, and 17,343 were wounded. Of U.S. Marines, 2,793 \nwere killed and 13,434 were wounded. Japanese casualties numbered \n107,539 killed in action and 10,755 captured. It was a terrible price \nto pay for both sides, but the result brought the Allied forces to \nJapan's doorstep\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nand helped to precipitate the war's end in August 1945. I should also \nnote that, following the war's end, the United States and Japan entered \ninto a long period of geopolitical alliance, cultural goodwill, and \neconomic partnership, and to this day we count the Japanese people \namong our closest friends in the world community--a fortunate result \nstemming from a long and difficult war.\n  As rifleman, Roy Rowe fought alongside his fellow soldiers to secure \nOkinawa as a base for launching an attack on Japan. He was awarded \nnumerous decorations for his service, including the Purple Heart, the \nAsiatic-Pacific Ribbon, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, the American \nTheater of Operation Ribbon, and the Silver Star Medal. Mr. Rowe's \nservice ended in October 1945, three years after it had begun. His is a \nservice record that he can be proud of, and we're proud of him for it. \nThrough his service to his country and his willingness to endure great \npersonal sacrifice to defend our freedoms, Roy Rowe represents the most \nadmirable qualities in the American spirit.\n  In this new century, in these difficult times, when a new generation \nof young Americans is taking up arms to defend our freedoms against the \nthreats posed by international terrorism and rogue nations, let's \nremember Roy Rowe's example of courage, patriotism and selflessness. I \nam honored to pay tribute to him on the floor of the Senate \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3878-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NCAA TOURNAMENT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past few days my friends and \nfellow Senators have repeatedly been asking me one question: What in \nthe world is a catamount? Today I am delighted to answer that question \nby explaining what a catamount is, what it takes to be a catamount and \nwhy it is so fitting that the University of Vermont chose the catamount \nas its mascot.\n  On Saturday, March 15, the 2003 University of Vermont men's \nbasketball team defined ``catamount'' for college basketball fans \nthroughout the great State of Vermont and the Nation. These determined \nyoung men, from four different countries and nine states, including \nVermont, took victory Saturday afternoon against No. 1-seeded Boston \nUniversity in a close 56-to-55 game, becoming the 2003 American East \nConference Men's Basketball Champions and earning themselves a chance \nto play in the national championship tournament--the ``big dance,'' \nMarch Madness--the 2003 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship \nTournament. This is the first time the UVM men's basketball team has \ntaken the title and made it to the national tournament in the program's \n103-year history.\n  It is only appropriate that the catamount, a type of cougar known for \nits athletic ability, including its speed and its ability to jump, is \nthe emblem of these hard-working and talented young men. The catamount \nwas once thought to be extinct from the Green Mountains of Vermont. \nLike the division title for men's basketball, it had not been seen in \nVermont for more than 100 years. But within the last decade, the people \nof Vermont have started seeing the mountain cat in our beautiful \nmountains. And it was only a little over a decade ago that the fans of \nUVM basketball saw the UVM Catamounts come within one game of the \ndivision title. One of my former staffers, Bill Bright, played on the \nteam from 1987 to 1991 and was at that game on March 10, 1990. But the \ntitle eluded Vermont and Bill Bright.\n  Last Saturday, the UVM squad proved that catamounts do exist. Their \ndramatic victory came on a last-second shot by sophomore David Hehn at \nBoston University's Case Gymnasium. The Burlington Free Press quoted \nDavid Hehn after the game as saying: ``For all the guys in this room, \nthis is our dream.'' Vermont was the only team in the Nation this year \nto win a conference title on their opponent's home court.\n  Members of my staff, including a senior counsel on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and a member of the Catamount's 1981 through 1985 \nsquads, Ed Pagano, gathered last weekend to watch the game on ESPN, and \nyou can be sure we will be watching again Thursday as they play their \nfirst game in the NCAA tournament. Many Vermonters, including my good \nfriend Mary Anne Gucciardi--known by many on the UVM squad as Momma \nGucc--will be clearing their schedules Thursday to watch history in the \nmaking in the first round of the tournament.\n  Coach Tom Brennan, who is in his 17th season with UVM, led these \nyoung men to victory. I have had many conversations with Coach Brennan, \nboth personal and professional. He is the co-host of a popular radio \nshow in Vermont. In a Burlington Free Press interview he said, ``I just \nkept believing this day would come, I have been treated so wonderfully \nat Vermont. . . . To be able to give that back and say `Here, this is \nfor you' it's the most incredible feeling that I've had in a long, long \ntime.''\n  I find it fitting that the two Vermonters on this year's team were so \ninstrumental in the team's championship run. Sophomore Taylor \nCoppenrath of West Barnet was given the Reggie Lewis Award for being \nthe America East Player of the Year, and junior Matt Sheftic of Essex \nJunction won the Kevin Roberson Most Valuable Player Award for his \nexceptional performance in the America East Tournament.\n  The conference title means the University of Vermont has secured its \nfirst-ever berth in the NCAA Tournament in the competition's 64-year \nhistory or, as the Free Press called it, UVM's ``First Dance.'' On \nThursday, March 20, they will travel to the University of Utah in Salt \nLake City to face the University of Arizona Wildcats. The Wildcats are \nthis year's Pac-10 regular-season champion, and this will be their 19th \nconsecutive NCAA Tournament appearance. Like Ethan Allen and the Green \nMountain Boys fighting for our freedom, the Catamounts know the \nWildcats are well-groomed for the match, but they are determined to \nplay their best against the goliath Wildcats.\n  I called Coach Brennan and the team to wish them luck before \nSaturday's game and again Sunday as they found out who they would be \nfacing in the tournament. The team is excited and energized for their \ntrip to Utah and to face one of the Nation''s top-ranked teams. Coach \nBrennan says, ``We're going to do the very best we can, we're going to \nenjoy it.''\n  I would like to add that the entire State of Vermont is going to \nenjoy it. And I would like to thank Coach Brennan, the Athletic \nDepartment at UVM, our student-athletes and their families for giving \nso much to the State and to the fans of Catamount Basketball.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3878-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE STUDENTS OF ST. ALBERT THE GREAT SCHOOL AND JAMIE DIEBEL\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to the students of St. Albert the Great School in Louisville, \nKY.\n  In September of 2001, 13-year old student Jamie Deibel was diagnosed \nwith leukemia. Jamie was unable to attend school with her classmates \nall last year since she was frequently in and out of the hospital. \nJamie's treatment forced her to lose her hair twice. Even though she \nwill be in treatment until next January, Jamie fortunately feels well \nenough to attend class at St. Albert's and participate on the \nvolleyball, softball, basketball, and swim teams.\n  Jamie's friends at St. Albert showed their support for their \nclassmate this week by raising money for the National Childhood Cancer \nFoundation. In a show of solidarity with Jamie, more than 60 students \nshaved their heads to donate their hair to Locks of Love. Locks of Love \nmakes wigs for children like Jamie who have lost their hair due to \ncancer treatments and other reasons. Beauticians from all over \nLouisville donated their services for this worthwhile cause. Students, \nteachers, and parents from St. Albert have so far raised over $3,500 \nand hope to raise at least $5,000 for the National Childhood Cancer \nFoundation.\n  I ask that my fellow colleagues join me in honoring Jamie's courage \nand the gracious efforts of the students from St. Albert to support one \nof their classmates. I believe we all can learn from St. Albert's \nexample of caring for and serving others. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith Jamie and her classmates.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3879-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n             COMMENDING THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I recognize The Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation in Princeton, NJ, which recently awarded its five \nbillionth grant dollar to improve the health and health care of all \nAmericans.\n  Established in 1972, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is the \nNation's largest philanthropy devoted exclusively to health and health \ncare. It concentrates its grantmaking in four goal areas: to assure \nthat all Americans have access to quality health care at reasonable \ncost; to improve the quality of care and support for people with \nchronic health conditions; to promote healthy communities and \nlifestyles; and to reduce the personal, social and economic harm caused \nby substance abuse.\n  Since its inception, the Foundation has spearheaded a number of \nimportant advances in Nation's health. Currently, 97 percent of all \nemergency management systems, EMS, use 911 as the universal access \nnumber for emergencies. This is the result of a program RWJF launched \nin the early 1970s to start multi-community emergency medical networks \nin 32 States. Today, Americans benefit from professional, organized, \nand effective emergency medical care as a result of this program\n  The foundation has also made significant contributions to the nursing \nand dental professions. It helped to create the fields of nurse \npractitioners and physician assistants during the early 1970s as part \nof its effort to increase health care access in the inner cities and \nrural areas.\n  All dental students are now trained to treat patients with \ndisabilities, such as cerebral palsy or seizure disorders, building on \na foundation-funded training program. The project, Health Care for the \nHomeless, became a model that was cited when the federal government \npassed the McKinney Act in 1987, providing Federal funds to improve \naccess to health care for homeless people throughout the country.\n  The creation of school based health clinics represents another area \nwhere RWJF has had a major impact. The foundation's interest was \nsparked by reports that American teenagers suffered from deteriorating \nhealth. Approximately six million adolescents during the mid-1980s \nsuffered from at least one serious health problem. Five million \nteenagers did not have health insurance. This was an especially \nalarming figure considering the increase in drug and alcohol abuse and \nrise in sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents. During the \npast 12 years, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has helped to \nestablish more than 1,100 health centers in schools.\n  More recently, the foundation has recognized the need to focus \nincreased attention on promoting healthy communities and lifestyles. \nFor example, the recent grant to push the Foundation over the $5 \nbillion threshold went to the Church Health Center in Memphis, TN, \nwhich will use its funds to test a model program designed to help \npeople age 50 and older become more physically active. Physical \ninactivity is one of the greatest health risks for mid-life and older \nadults, contributing to illnesses and disabilities such as arthritis, \ncancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.\n  There are obviously a number of other noteworthy examples of efforts \nthe Foundation has undertaken--from pediatrics to care at the end of \nlife--which continue to result in important positive health outcomes \nfor our citizens.\n  It is with great pride that I commend The Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation for its ongoing commitment to improving health and health \ncare for all Americans. As we in the Congress face the daunting \nchallenge of addressing a number of health care problems in this \ncountry, we must continue to draw on the experience and lessons learned \nfrom foundations and their grantees, which truly serve as the \nguideposts for experimentation and innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3879-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROSWELL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the achievements \nof a New Mexico high school.\n  Roswell High School has been honored with the esteemed designation of \nbeing named one of the top 10 schools in America by the Bill and \nMelinda Gates Foundation. This great honor is a tribute to the hard \nwork and commitment to excellence demonstrated by the students, parents \nand families, teachers, staff, and administration of Roswell High \nSchool.\n  In order to qualify for this award, schools must meet very strict \ncriteria. Each school must have both a minority student population and \nlow income rates of 50 percent or higher. In addition, the recipient \nmust have a graduation rate of at least 90 percent with 90 percent of \nthe previous years graduating class attending either a two- or four-\nyear college. I am both honored and privileged to announce that the \nclass of 2001 from Roswell High School had a graduation rate of 96 \npercent with 90 percent of graduating seniors enrolled in post-\nsecondary education courses. This is truly a laudatory achievement.\n  Roswell High's students come from many different backgrounds, but \nthey are successful because they have the mind-set that says every \nstudent can succeed. They have embraced the differences in their \nstudent body, and they have demonstrated that every single student, \nregardless of background, can and will learn. It takes the dedicated \nleadership of a good principal, talented teaching corps and engaged \nparents to achieve this level. The Gates Foundation recognition is a \nsalute to the successful learning environment achieved at Roswell High.\n  Soon after President Bush took office, he called on Congress to \nfundamentally change the structure of education, and enact the most \nsweeping change in education in 35 years. When President Bush signed \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, he began a new era of improved student \nperformance, and introduced us to an educational system that insists on \naccountability, results, and teacher quality.\n  Roswell High School has embraced this philosophy and they have taken \nthe lead in their community by insisting on teaching methods that work \nand taking a stand to get involved and change the expectations we have \nfor our public schools. They deserve to be recognized for their \nexcellence.\n  One of the most honorable and important duties of government is to \neducate its children. As our Nation grows, and new generations of \nleaders emerge, the education they receive early on will reflect in \ntheir ability to lead us through tough times, such as the ones \ncurrently facing our great country. It is our responsibility to ensure \nthat this new generation is prepared. Their success in the future is a \ndirect reflection on each and every one of us.\n  Roswell High's student success is also a tribute to this city's long \nhistory of a ``can do'' spirit, deriving from the hearty first settlers \non the Chisum Trail, to the rocketry breakthroughs of Robert H. \nGoddard, to the constant striving of its current leaders to build the \nbest American city possible.\n  I congratulate Roswell High School. Its commitment to excellence is \nsomething that every high school in New Mexico and America should \nstrive to attain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3879-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3879-S3880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:49 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to 22 \nU.S.C. 276L, and the order of the House of January, 8, 2003, the \nSpeaker appoints the following Member of the House of Representatives \nto the British-American Interparliamentary Group: Mr. Petri of \nWisconsin, Chairman.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 276d, and the \norder of the House of January 8, 2003, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Member of the House of Representatives to the Canada-United \nStates Interparliamentary Group: Mr. Houston of New York, Chairman.\n  The message further announced that pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 276h, and \nthe order of the House of January 8, 2003, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Member of the House of Representatives to the Mexico-United \nStates Interparliamentary Group: Mr. Kolbe of Arizona, Chairman.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 501(b), and the \norder of the House of January 8, 2003, the Speaker appoints the \nfollowing Members of the House of Representatives to the House \nCommission on Congressional Mailing Standards: Mr. Ney of Ohio, \nChairman; Mr. Aderholt of Alabama; Mr. Sweeny of New York;\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\nMr. Larson of Connecticut; Mr. Thompson of Mississippi; and Mr. Holt of \nNew Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/18/senate-section/article/S3880-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3880-S3881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1612.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe first $2,000 of health insurance premiums to be fully deductible; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Health \nInsurance Tax Relief Act to help our Nation's working families deal \nwith the recent dramatic increases in health care costs. The \nlegislation would allow taxpayers to deduct up to $2000 in out-of-\npocket health insurance costs per year.\n  While this small Federal contribution to assist families with the \nhealth care costs they bear will not solve all of the problems in our \nhealth care system, it will provide immediate help for working families \nwho have seen health care costs explode. In 2001, the last year for \nwhich we have data, the cost of health care for employer sponsored \ninsurance rose 11 percent. To deal with this increase, 75 percent of \nlarge employers and 42 percent of small business employers said they \nwere likely to increase employee premium costs.\n  In addition, according to the Center for Health System Change, \nemployers will likely be raising deductibles and co-payments and \nperhaps using more coinsurance, where patients pay a percentage of the \ncost of their care rather than a fixed dollar amount. And, some \nbusinesses are dropping health insurance benefits entirely.\n  This is an issue of fairness. We already provide a tax break for \nsmall business owners who provide health insurance, and we also provide \none for individuals who are self-employed. But currently there is no \nprovision that allows for employees, who are faced with additional \nfinancial responsibility for their premium costs, to take a tax \ndeduction on their out-of-pocket expenses. This legislation rectifies \nthat unfairness and will help families meet rising health care costs.\n  The need for this legislation is particularly important for employees \nin small businesses, many of which sought to minimize premium increases \nby adding or increasing deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance. But \nthis shifting of health insurance costs from employers to employees is \nnot limited to small firms. The California Public Employees' Retirement \nSystem, CalPERS, the second-largest purchaser of health care after the \nFederal Government, approved a 25 percent increase in health insurance \npremiums for 2003. CalPERS provides retirement and health benefit \nservices to more than 1.3 million members and nearly 2,500 employers. \nThese are hard working Americans struggling to make ends meet in a weak \neconomy.\n  That is why, we should provide some targeted assistance to help \nfamilies pay for health care. I urge my colleagues to support my \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Wyden, \n        Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 639. A bill to designate certain Federal land in the State of Utah \nas wilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce America's Red \nRock Wilderness Act. This legislation is in keeping with our Nation's \nbipartisan commitment to preserve our natural heritage. The \npreservation of our Nation's vital natural resources will be one of our \nmost important legacies.\n  Unfortunately, remaining wilderness areas are increasingly threatened \nand degraded by oil and gas development, mining, claims of rights of \nway, logging and off-road vehicles. America's Red Rock Wilderness Act \nwill designate 9.1 million acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, in Utah as wilderness under the Wilderness Act. \nWilderness designation will preserve the land's wilderness character, \nalong with the values associated with that wilderness--scenic beauty, \nsolitude, wildlife, geological features, archaeological sites, and \nother features of scientific, educational, and historical value.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act will provide wilderness protection \nfor red rock cliffs offering spectacular vistas of rare rock \nformations, canyons and desert lands, important archaeological sites, \nand habitat for rare plant and animal species.\n  Volunteers took detailed inventories of thousands of square miles of \nBLM land in Utah to help determine which lands should be protected. \nThese volunteers provided extensive documentation to ensure that these \nareas meet federal wilderness criteria.\n  The BLM also completed a re-inventory of approximately 6 million \nacres of Federal land in the same area. The results provide a \nconvincing confirmation that the areas designated for protection under \nthis bill meet Federal wilderness criteria.\n  For more than twenty years Utah conservationists have been working to \nadd the last great blocks of undeveloped BLM-administered land in Utah \nto the National Wilderness Preservation System. The lands we propose to \nprotect surround and connect eight of Utah's nine national park, \nmonument and recreation areas. These proposed BLM wilderness areas \neasily equal their neighboring national parklands in scenic beauty, \nopportunities for recreation, and ecological importance. Yet, unlike \nthe parks, most of these scenic treasures lack any form of long-term \nprotection.\n  I'd like to thank all of my colleagues who are original cosponsors of \nthis\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\nmeasure this year, many of whom have supported the bill since it was \nfirst introduced. The original cosponsors of the measure are Senators \nFeingold, Leahy, Harkin, Kennedy, Bayh, Cantwell, Corzine, Wyden, \nStabenow, Reed, Schumer, Boxer, and Kerry. Additionally, I would like \nto thank The Utah Wilderness Coalition, which includes The Wilderness \nSociety and Sierra Club; The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance; and all \nof the other national, regional and local, hard-working groups who, for \nyears, have championed this legislation.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated, ``The Nation behaves well if it \ntreats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the \nnext generation increased and not impaired in value.'' Enactment of \nthis legislation will help us realize Roosevelt's vision. In order to \nprotect these precious resources in Utah for future generations, I urge \nmy colleagues to support America's Red Rock Wilderness Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to again join with the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, as an original co-sponsor of \nlegislation to designate more than one million acres of Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, lands in Utah as wilderness.\n  I had an opportunity to travel twice to Utah. I viewed firsthand some \nof the lands that would be designated for wilderness under Senator \nDurbin's bill. I was able to view most of the proposed wilderness areas \nfrom the air, and was able to enhance my understanding through hikes \noutside of the Zion National Park on the Dry Creek Bench wilderness \nunit contained in this proposal and inside the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument to Upper Calf Creek Falls. I also viewed \nthe lands proposed for designation in this bill from a river trip down \nthe Colorado River, and in the San Rafael Swell with members of the \nEmery County government.\n  I support this legislation, for a few reasons, but most of all \nbecause I have personally seen what is at stake, and I know the \nmarvelous resources that Wisconsinites and all Americans own in the BLM \nlands of Southern Utah.\n  Second, I support this legislation because I believe it sets the \nbroadest and boldest mark for the lands that should be protected in \nSouthern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers wilderness \nlegislation it ought to know, as a benchmark, the full measure of those \nlands which are deserving of wilderness protection. This bill \nencompasses all the BLM lands of wilderness quality in Utah. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has not, as we do today, always had the \nbenefit of considering wilderness designations for all of the deserving \nlands in Southern Utah. During the 104th Congress, I joined with the \nformer Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Bradley, in opposing that \nCongress's Omnibus Parks legislation. It contained provisions, which \nwere eventually removed, that many in my home state of Wisconsin \nbelieved not only designated as wilderness too little of the Bureau of \nLand Management's holding in Utah deserving of such protection, but \nalso substantively changed the protections afforded designated lands \nunder the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  The lands of Southern Utah are very special to the people of \nWisconsin. In writing to me over the last few years, my constituents \nhave described these lands as places of solitude, special family \nmoments, and incredible beauty. In December 1997, Ron Raunikar of the \nCapital Times, a paper in Madison, WI, wrote: ``Other remaining \nwilderness in the U.S. is at first daunting, but then endearing and \nalways a treasure for all Americans. The sensually sculpted slickrock \nof the Colorado Plateau and windswept crag lines of the Great Basin \ninclude some of the last of our country's wilderness which is not fully \nprotected. We must ask our elected officials to redress this \ncircumstance, by enacting legislation which would protect those \nnational lands within the boundaries of Utah. This wilderness is a \ntreasure we can lose only once or a legacy we can be forever proud to \nbestow to our children.''\n\n  I believe that the measure being introduced today will accomplish \nthat goal. Identical in its designations to legislation sponsored in \nthe other body by Rep. Maurice Hinchey of New York, it is the \nculmination of more than 17 years and five Congresses of effort in the \nother body beginning with the legislative work of our recent deceased \ncolleague, the former Congressman from Utah, Mr. Owens.\n  The measure protects wild lands that really are not done justice by \nany description in words. In my trip I found widely varied and distinct \nterrain, remarkable American resources of red rock cliff walls, desert, \ncanyons and gorges which encompass the canyon country of the Colorado \nPlateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great Basin. The lands \nalso include mountain ranges in western Utah, and stark areas like the \nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. These regions appeal to \nall types of American outdoor interests from hikers and sightseers to \nhunters.\n  Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, answered an important question I \nam often asked when people want to know why a Senator from Wisconsin \nwould co-sponsor legislation to protect lands in Utah. He wrote on \nSeptember 13, 1995 simply that ``These are not scenes that you could \nsee in Wisconsin. That's part of what makes them special.'' He \ncontinues, and adds what I think is an even more important reason to \nact to protect these lands than the landscape's uniqueness, ``the fight \nover wilderness lands in Utah is a test case of sorts. The anti-\nenvironmental factions in Congress are trying hard to remove \nrestrictions on development in some of the nation's most splendid \nareas.''\n  Wisconsinites are watching this test cane closely. I believe, that \nWisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save Utah's lands as a \nsign of where the nation is headed with respect to its stewardship of \nnatural resources. For example, some in my home state believe that \namong federal lands that comprise the Apostle Islands National \nLakeshore and the Nicolet and Chequamegon National Forests there are \nlands that are deserving of wilderness protection. These federal \nproperties are incredibly important, and they mean a great deal to the \npeople of Wisconsin. Wisconsinites want to know that, should additional \nlands in Wisconsin be brought forward for wilderness designation, the \ntype of protection they expect from federal law is still available to \nbe extended because it had been properly extended to other places of \nnational significance.\n  What Haslanger's Capital Times comments make clear is that while some \nin Congress may express concern about creating new wilderness in Utah, \nwilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not created by legislation. \nLegislation to protect existing wilderness insures that future \ngenerations may have an experience on public lands equal to that which \nis available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild lands by \nextending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 will publicly \ncodify that expectation and promise.\n  Third, this legislation has earned my support, and deserves the \nsupport of others in this body, because all of the acres that will be \nprotected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the \nfederal government for the people of the United States. Thus, while \nthey are physically located in Utah, their preservation is important to \nthe citizens of Wisconsin as it is for other Americans.\n  Finally, I support this bill because I believe that there will likely \nbe action during this Congress to develop consensus legislation to \nprotect the lands contained in this proposal. We all need to be \ninvolved in helping to forge that consensus in order to ensure the best \nstewardship of that land. As many in this body know, the BLM has \ncompleted a review of the lands designated in the bill sponsored in the \n106th Congress by the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and adjacent \nareas. BLM has found that 5.8 million acres of lands, slightly more \nthan the acreage of the old bill, meet the criteria for wilderness \nprotection under the Wilderness Act. While the re-inventory is not a \nformal recommendation to Congress for wilderness designation, it \nsuggests that there are and should be more lands in play as the debate \nover wilderness protection in Utah moves forward.\n  I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to \nprotect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues as a \ncosponsor of the Redrock Wilderness Act. It designates 9.1 million \nacres of Federal public lands in Utah, managed by\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nthe Bureau of Land Management, as a wilderness area under the 1964 \nWilderness Act. Wilderness designation affords lands an extra level of \nprotection--preserving the land in its ``wild'' state for future \ngenerations.\n  I know that citizens all across America, including many in Iowa, have \nenjoyed the wilderness in Redrock. Or some folks may never have visited \nthat great place and just want it to be protected because it is so \nprecious.\n  The redrock canyons of Utah are famous, even to many who have never \nbeen there. The dramatic cliff walls, sculpted by wind and water into \nswirling crimson towers have been captured in stunning photographs. \nPink sandstone arches stretch across creek beds and gold-toned crevices \nslice through massive slabs of rock. These are refreshing sights we \nmust save for generations to come.\n  And we must preserve Redrock for its invaluable wildlife. For \nexample, some of Utah's last healthy populations of longhorn antelope \nand bighorn and sheep roam this isolated and majestic desert landscape.\n  Thanks to the Bush administration's rush to turn over public land for \nenergy production, this unspoiled place is now in grave danger. The \nInterior Department has fast-tracked oil and gas leases and projects, \nopening the door to habitat destruction, road building, and industrial \npollution. These precious lands should not be the target of energy \nproduction when we have bountiful sources of renewable energy, \nincluding sources from agriculture that can also help farmers and rural \ncommunities.\n  At a time when the administration is willfully neglecting our public \nlands by rejecting adequate funding for them, proposing oil and gas \ndevelopment in them, and increasing destructive logging practices, we \nneed to protect these areas from such assaults.\n  Utah's unique Redrock Wilderness area should be designated as \nwilderness and protected from environmentally destructive activity. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of the Redrock Wilderness Act, and urge my \ncolleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 640. A bill to amend subchapter III of chapter 83 and chapter 84 \nof title 5, United States Code, to include Federal prosecutors within \nthe definition of a law enforcement officer, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, with my good friends \nSenator Hatch, Senator Mikulski and Senator Durbin, the Federal \nProsecutors' Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2003. This bill would \ncorrect an inequity that exists under current law, whereby Federal \nprosecutors receive substantially less favorable retirement benefits \nthan other nearly all other people involved in the Federal criminal \njustice system. The bill would increase the retirement benefits given \nto Assistant United States Attorneys by including them as ``law \nenforcement officers'', LEOs, under the Federal Employees' Retirement \nSystem and the Civil Service Retirement System. The bill would also \nallow the Attorney General to designate other attorneys employed by the \nDepartment of Justice who act primarily as criminal prosecutors as \nLEO's for purposes of receiving these retirement benefits.\n  The primary reason for granting enhanced retirement benefits to LEOs \nis the often dangerous work of law enforcement. Currently, Assistant \nUnited States Attorneys, AUSAs, and other Federal prosecutors are not \neligible for these enhanced benefits, which are enjoyed by the vast \nmajority of other employees in the criminal justice system. This \nexclusion is unjustified. The relevant provisions of the United States \nCode dealing with retirement benefits define an LEO as an employee \nwhose duties are, ``primarily the investigation, apprehension, or \ndetention'' of individuals suspected or convicted of violating federal \nlaw. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  8331(20) & 8401(17). AUSAs and other \nfederal prosecutors participate in planning investigations, \ninterviewing witnesses both inside and outside of the office setting, \ndebriefing defendants, obtaining warrants, negotiating plea agreements \nand representing the government at trials and sentencings, all of which \nfall within the definition of the duties performed by law enforcement \nofficers. Indeed, once a defendant is brought to into the criminal \njustice system, the person with whom they have the most face-to-face \ncontact, and often in an extremely confrontational environment, is the \nFederal prosecutor.\n  Although prosecutors do not personally execute arrests, searches and \nother physically dangerous activities, LEO status is accorded to many \ncriminal justice employees who do not perform such tasks, such as \npretrial services officers and probation officers and accountants, \ncooks and secretaries of the Bureau of Prisons. Moreover, because they \nare often the most conspicuous representatives of the government in the \ncriminal justice system, Federal prosecutors are natural targets for \nthreats of reprisals by vengeful criminals. Indeed, there are numerous \nincidents in which assaults and serious death threats have been made \nagainst federal prosecutors, sometimes resulting in significant \ndisruption of their personal and family lives.\n  Only recently a veteran Federal prosecutor in the Western District of \nWashington was murdered in his home, and, although the crime remains \nunsolved, based upon the facts of the case the authorities have \nreferred to the crime as a hit. In addition, I have received many other \naccounts from Federal prosecutors regarding specific threats to which \nthey and their families have been subjected because of the performance \nof their duties. Federal prosecutors have written to me that they have \nbeen forced to relocate themselves and their families due to death \nthreats; that they have been assaulted; that they and their families \nhave been followed by members of criminal organizations; that have been \nforced to install security systems at their homes and to change their \nroutes to and from the office to protect their safety and the safety of \ntheir families.\n  As our fight against terrorism continues, Federal prosecutors arel on \nthe front lines once again as the symbols of our criminal justice \nsystem, and unfortunately therefore the targets of those who seek its \ndownfall. Among other tasks, the Attorney General has designated AUSA's \nto play a major role working with police and Federal agents in each \njudicial district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force. One Federal prosecutor \nwrote to me stating that shortly after his name was in the local news \nas heading his district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force and he had spoken \nto his family about taking suitable precautions, that his young son \ncame into his bedroom one night holding a hockey stick for protection \nasking about their safety. Thus, Federal prosecutors and their families \nwill deal more than ever with a level of stress and danger that \njustifies their being treated as LEOs.\n  Another example of the danger facing Federal prosecutors appeared in \nthe USA Today earlier this month. That article, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to make part of the Congressional Record, reports that United \nStates Attorney's will also be asked to play an advisory role in \npotential hostilities with Iraq. If there was ever an illustration of \nthe importance of granting Federal prosecutors equal retirement status \nas their other law enforcement partners, this is it.\n  Enhanced retirement benefits are also justified by the Federal \nGovernment's need for experienced prosecutors to bring ever more \nsophisticated cases under increasingly complex Federal criminal laws. \nIn recent years, we have seen the growth of complex Federal \nprosecutions to combat the threats posed by organized crime, drug \ncartels, terrorist groups and other sophisticated criminals. The \nprosecution of such difficult cases is best handled by experienced \nprosecutors. It is therefore in the public interest to provide \nreasonable financial incentives for talented, experienced prosecutors \nto remain in government service.\n  This bill would make Assistant United States Attorneys and other \nFederal prosecutors designated by the Attorney General eligible for \nimmediate, unreduced retirement benefits at age 50 with 20 years of \nservice. For example, prosecutors who are covered by the Civil Service \nRetirement System would receive 50 percent of the average of their \nthree highest years' salary. At\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nthe same time, it would exempt prosecutors from the mandatory \nretirement provisions that require other law enforcement officers to \nretire at age 57. Because the loss of physical strength and agility \ndoes not adversely affect a person's ability to function as a \nprosecutor, there is no reason to mandate early retirement.\n  Two important features of this bill will contain its costs. First, \nthe bill provides that incumbent Federal prosecutors are themselves \nresponsible for making up the difference in individual contributions \nowed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for their \nprior service. An incumbent has the choice of making up this difference \neither by making a payment up front or by accepting a reduction in \nretirement benefits. Second, government contributions for the prior \nservice of incumbents are made ratably over a ten-year period under \nthis bill. Thus, payments for prior government contributions are spread \nout to lessen the financial impact. These two provisions will insure \nthat the cost of the bill is kept well within reason.\n  This bill enjoys broad, grass roots support. When Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced this same bill in the last Congress, I received literally \nhundreds of letters supporting this bill, sent from over 40 states, \nDistrict of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The bill also enjoys support in \nthe law enforcement community. The National Association of Assistant \nUnited States Attorneys, the Federal Criminal Investigators \nAssociation, and the Southern States Police Benevolent Association have \nall wrote me to voice support for the inclusion of AUSAs in the \ndefinition of an LEO. I tried, with Senator Hatch, to include this \nmeasure in our Department of Justice Authorization legislation in the \nlast Congress, but the House would not agree to its inclusion in the \nconference report. I hope that we can work together in both houses to \nenact the bill in this Congress.\n  In addition, I know that other Senators, including Senator Mikulski, \nare considering additional measures to expand these same retirement \nbenefits to other Federal employees who perform law enforcement \nfunctions, including IRS employees whose primary duty is to collect \ndelinquent taxes. I cosponsored such a measure in the last Congress, \nand I continue to support and commend her leadership in bringing these \nmatters to the forefront.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation \nwith Senators Hatch, Mikulski and Durbin, and I urge its swift \nenactment into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord along with the sectional analysis and the newspaper article to \nwhich I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Tanks could be \n     parked next to mosques. Chemical weapons plants might also \n     produce medicine.\n       In a war with Iraq, U.S. commanders could often have an \n     agonizing choice: strike a target and run the risk of killing \n     civilians, and being accused by the rest of the world of \n     committing a war crime, or hold fire and run the risk that \n     Saddam Hussein will still have deadly weapons he can use \n     against U.S. and British troops or neighboring countries.\n       To help weigh those issues, the Pentagon has dispatched \n     dozens of attorneys to command posts in the region. Their \n     job: help keep the United States legal if President Bush \n     unleashes its fury against Saddam's forces.\n       Military commanders have long had legal advisers. But more \n     than ever, attorneys are in the teams that choose the \n     strategies, the targets and even the weapons to be used. \n     Lawyers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines will be \n     working around-the-clock to be on hand when targets appear \n     and fast decisions are needed.\n       With so much of the world skeptical of U.S. intentions, \n     pressure will be high. ``The world expects the United States \n     to do the right thing,'' says Capt. Noah Malgeri, an Army \n     lawyer.\n\n\n                           Collateral damage\n\n       Col. Rocco Lamuro, who runs a course on ``targeting law'' \n     at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, say that when air power came \n     of age in World War II, the missions would almost always be \n     planned weeks in advance. There weren't any spy satellites \n     sending ``real-time'' pictures of enemy movements--and thus \n     pushing commanders to make quick decisions on whether to \n     strike. In World War II, there was plenty of time to discuss \n     legalities and debate the potential ``collateral damage,'' \n     the unintentional killing of civilians.\n       It was also true back then that collateral damage was \n     accepted as an unfortunate but natural part of war. Sixty \n     years ago, ``you might send 100 B-17 (bombers) to try to \n     destroy something that's within an acre,'' Lamuro says. There \n     were no ``smart bombs'' that could zero in on small targets. \n     It was assumed that many bombs would hit ground far from the \n     target. Today, Lamuro says, ``you'd send only one'' bomber or \n     missile, and the weapon would be expected to hit its target.\n       When missiles do go awry, as happened when the United \n     States accidentally struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in \n     May 1999 or when a bomb dropped on Baghdad hit a shelter and \n     killed 408 civilians in 1991, there is alarm worldwide.\n       What do U.S. military lawyers--who work in offices of each \n     service's Judge Advocate General (made famous by the CBS-TV \n     show JAG)--use to guide them? The Law of Armed Conflict is a \n     set of rules derived primarily from post-World War II Geneva \n     Conventions. Commanders also must follow U.S. law and the top \n     command's rules of engagement.\n       The rules are not pie-in-the-sky pronouncements. They \n     reflect how battles are fought. They try to protect innocents \n     but recognize the reality of battle. ``If you're a priest \n     who's running around blessing people on the battlefield, \n     you're OK,'' Lamuro says. ``If you pick up a gun, you'll get \n     shot. You can't use a technicality to shield yourself.''\n       In most cases, there's little dispute about the legality of \n     clear military targets. A tank on a battlefield is always \n     fair game. A school is not--unless it can be proved that it's \n     used as a military site.\n       Other cases are less clear, and legal issues aren't the \n     only factors. There is, for instance, the issue of human \n     shields. The 1949 Geneva Convention specifically states that \n     the presence of civilians cannot be used to render a target \n     immune from attack. Just because an enemy has surrounded a \n     weapons depot with civilian volunteers does not make it an \n     illegal target. Even so, Lamuro says, commanders must also \n     worry about ``the CNN test.'' Is the target worth all the \n     loss of innocent life--and the inevitable outcry? Targets \n     such as dams and power plants also are hot-button issues \n     because their destruction would harm civilians. The \n     lawyers would advise they be destroyed only when \n     necessary, Lamuro says. It's practical advice, he says, \n     because the military must be ``as concerned with winning \n     the peace as winning the wars.''\n\n\n                              individuals\n\n       Targeting individuals is an especially difficult issue. A \n     year ago, there were numerous reports that a Predator drone \n     aircraft loaded with Hellfire missiles had the ousted Taliban \n     leader Mohammed Omar in its sights in Afghanistan. But no \n     missile was fired, reportedly on the advice of a lawyer.\n       It isn't known for sure whether the strike was scrubbed \n     because civilians were nearby or for some other reason. But \n     the incident provoked discussion about whether attorneys have \n     too much influence. Lamuro says it would be wrong ``to \n     overstate the lawyers's role.'' They are advisers, he says. \n     Commanders make the ultimate choice.\n       One of the hottest legal topics that would be decided only \n     at the highest levels is whether to target Saddam himself. \n     Legally, it could depend on timing: Lawyers say that before a \n     war, he would not be considered a valid military target. U.S. \n     policy also prohibits assassinations of leaders.\n       If there was a war and Saddam was commanding the Iraqi \n     army, he would be considered a combatant and could be \n     targeted.\n       If he no longer had that role and allied forces caught him \n     fleeing, the target status might be revoked. Instead, he \n     might be given exile or arrested and charged with war crimes.\n       Another tenet of the Law of Armed Conflict is that the \n     force used should be proportional to the task. For targeters, \n     that fits neatly into their objective of conserving \n     firepower.\n       ``I look for the minimum number of targets that must be \n     struck to adequately achieve the commander's objective,'' \n     says one U.S. intelligence officer, who asked that his name \n     not be reported to protect his identity. In the end, neither \n     the lawyers nor the other officers in the targeting teams \n     have the final word on what will be struck.\n       Air plans are reviewed and approved up the chain of \n     command--again with attorneys on hand--to make sure the \n     individual pieces add up to a war plan that is legally \n     defensible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     ``Federal Prosecutors Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2003''\n\n\n                      section-by section analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short title. Contains the short title, the \n     ``Federal Prosecutors Retirement Benefit Equity Act of \n     2003.''\n       Sec. 2. Inclusion of Federal prosecutors in the definition \n     of a law enforcement officer. Amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8331 \n     and 8401 to extend the enhanced law enforcement officer, \n     ``LEO'' retirement benefits to Federal prosecutors, defined \n     to include assistant United States attorneys, ``AUSAs, and \n     such other attorneys in the Department of Justice as are \n     designated by the Attorney General of the\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\n     United States. This section also exempts Federal prosecutors \n     from mandatory retirement provisions for LEO's under the \n     civil service laws.\n       Sec. 3. Provisions relating to incumbents. Governs the \n     treatment of incumbent Federal prosecutors who would be \n     eligible for LEO retirement benefits under this Act. This \n     section requires the Office of Personnel Management to \n     provide notice to incumbents of their rights under this \n     subtitle; allows incumbents to opt out of the LEO retirement \n     program; governs the crediting of prior service by \n     incumbents; and provides for make-up contributions for prior \n     service of incumbents to the Civil Service Retirement and \n     Disability Fund.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, in \ncooperation with the University of New Mexico, to construct and occupy \na portion of the Hibben Center for Archaeological Research at the \nUniversity of New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce a bill that \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Interior to help construct and occupy \npart of the Hibben Center for Archaeological Research at the University \nof New Mexico. This bill will help the University of New Mexico finish \na state of the art museum facility to store, and display the National \nPark Service's Chaco Collection.\n  Let me give you a bit of background. In 1907, Theodore Roosevelt \nfounded the Chaco Canyon Culture National Historical Park in \nNorthwestern New Mexico. The Monument was created to preserve the \nextensive prehistoric pueblo ruins in Chaco Canyon.\n  The height of the Chaco culture began in the mid 800's and lasted \nover 300 years. Dozens of complex multi-storied masonry buildings \ncontaining hundreds of rooms were built over that time. These complexes \nwere connected to communities by a network of prehistoric roads. I \nhelped to establish the Chaco Culture National Historic Park to \npreserve these areas.\n  Since 1907, the University of New Mexico and the National Park \nService have been partners in this area. From 1907 to 1949, the \nUniversity owned the land within the Park boundaries. During this \nperiod, Dr. Frank Hibben excavated in Chaco Canyon and remained \ninterested in the area throughout his long career. The University built \na large collection of artifacts that it retains today.\n  In 1949, the University deeded the land to the Federal Government, \nand since that time, the University and the Park Service have continued \na partnership through a series of memoranda of understanding. Since \n1985, the NPS Chaco collections have been housed at University of New \nMexico's Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. As both the University of New \nMexico and the National Park Service collections have begun to grow, a \nnew home for them is needed.\n  To this end, Dr. Hibben began planning a new research and curation \nfacility at the University of New Mexico. He asked the Park Service to \npartner with him on this project, and today, construction of the Hibben \nCenter, a modern, professional facility to house the University of New \nMexico's collections as well as the Park Service collections, is a \nreality.\n  Dr. Hibben recently passed away, and left the University of New \nMexico the funds to assist with this project. The partnership between \nthe Park Service and the University will mean that the Hibben Center \nwill hold a world-class collection of historical artifacts and will \nfacilitate and encourage the study of these important Southwestern \ncollections.\n  This bill will provide authorization to pay for the Federal share of \nthe improvement costs to the Hibben Center. This bill is long overdue, \nand will honor both the legacy of Dr. Hibben and the Chaco Culture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance national efforts to investigate, prosecute, \nand prevent crimes against children by increasing investigatory tools, \ncriminal penalties, and resources and by extending existing laws; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have all been devastated by the repeated \nnews flashes of violent crimes being committed against children across \nthe Nation. In June 2002, Elizabeth Smart, a 14 year old from my home \nState of Utah was kidnapped at gun point from her home in Salt Lake \nCity. Just this past week, the entire Nation rejoiced with the Smart \nfamily after Elizabeth was found alive and reunited with her loved \nones.\n  Five year old Samantha Runnion was not so lucky. Just one month after \nElizabeth Smart's abduction, Samantha was kidnapped while playing with \na neighborhood friend down the street from her home in Stanton, CA. The \nfollowing day, her body was found along a highway, nearly 50 miles from \nher home. California authorities have charged Alejandro Avila with \nRunnion's abduction, sexual assault and murder. Reportedly, Avila was \nacquitted two years ago of molesting two young girls under the age of \n14.\n  Elizabeth Smart and Samantha Runnion are just two, among many, recent \nchild victims. The list of tragic cases involving minor victims goes on \nand on.\n  These horrific incidents illustrate the need for comprehensive \nlegislation--at both the State and national level--to protect our \nchildren. We need to ensure that federal and state law enforcement \nofficers have all the tools and resources they need to find, prosecute, \nand punish those who commit crimes against our youth.\n  Today, I rise to reintroduce the ``Comprehensive Child Protection Act \nof 2003'' which enhances existing laws, investigative tools, criminal \npenalties and child crime resources in a variety of ways. I introduced \nthis important bill with Senator Feinstein last year, but it failed to \ngo anywhere. My unwavering commitment to this issue compels me to \nintroduce it again this year. Let me elaborate on the Act's specific \nprovisions.\n  By broadening existing laws, the Act enhances the ability of child \nvictims to pursue and prevail in criminal proceedings against their \npredators.\n  First, the Act extends the statute of limitations period that applies \nto offenses involving the sexual or physical abuse of children under 18 \nyears of age. Current law permits such cases to be brought until the \nvictim reaches the age of 25 years. This amendment will allow \nmeritorious cases of child sexual and physical abuse to be brought up \nuntil the date the minor reaches the age of 35 years.\n\n  It is well-documented that child abuse victims often do not come \nforward until years after the abuse occurred. Victims fail to come \nforward because they fear their disclosures will lead to further \nhumiliation, shame, and even ostracism. Abusers should not benefit from \nthe lasting psychological harms they have inflicted on innocent \nchildren.\n  I believe that there should rarely, if ever, be a time when we say to \na victim who has suffered as a child at the hands of an abuser: you \nhave identified your abuser; you have proven the crime; yet the abuser \nwill remain free because you, the victim, waited to long to come \nforward. Our criminal justice system should be ready to adjudicate all \nmeritorious claims of child abuse. This amendment is meant to recognize \nthat the arm of the law should be long in the prosecution of crimes of \nthis heinous nature.\n  Second, the Act amends an existing Federal evidentiary rule, Federal \nRule of Evidence 414, to permit the admission into evidence of prior \noffenses involving child molestation, or the possession of sexually \nexplicit materials containing actual or apparent minors. The current \nevidentiary rule permits such evidence to be admitted only where the \nvictim was under 14 years of age. This amendment extends the rule to \napply to any minor--any victim who was under 18 years of age at the \ntime the offense was committed.\n  In addition, the amendment makes clear that even where an individual \npossesses what may be virtual, as opposed to actual, child pornography, \nand therefore, may have a valid defense against prosecution in light of \nthe Supreme Court's recent decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech \nCoalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002), such evidence is nonetheless \nadmissible under Rule 414. Like the possession of actual child \npornography, the possession of virtual child pornography is highly \nprobative evidence that should be admissible in a case involving child \nmolestation or exploitation.\n  Third, the Act also limits the scope of the common law marital \nprivileges by making them inapplicable in a criminal child abuse case \nin which the abuser or his or her spouse invokes a privilege to avoid \ntestifying. Where a child abuser is charged with a crime against the \nchild of either spouse, or a child under the custody or control of \neither spouse, neither the abuser nor his or her spouse should be \npermitted a marital privilege to avoid providing critical evidence.\n  The marital privileges exist because we in society believe that \nforcing a person to testify against his or her spouse, or permitting a \nspouse to testify about confidential marital communications, may \njeopardize a marriage. While we value trusting, harmonious marriages, \nour societal interest in the proper administration of justice far \nexceeds our interest in preserving marital harmony where a spouse has \nchosen a vulnerable, defenseless child in the home as his or her \nvictim. In my view, it is more important to prosecute and punish child \nabusers than it is to minimize the potential risk to the life of a \nmarriage in which child abuse is occurring.\n  The Act increases the investigative tools available to law \nenforcement agencies in several significant ways.\n  First, the Act amends the DNA Analysis and Backlog Elimination Act by \nincreasing the categories of offenses that are included in the database \nof convicted offender DNA profiles, the Combined DNA Index System, \nCODIS. Without question, DNA--which is unique to each individual and \nmaintains its evidentiary integrity for long periods of time--is a \nvaluable investigatory tool. Time and again DNA evidence has aided in \nsolving difficult criminal cases by linking suspects to crimes and by \neliminating others.\n  This Act expands the class of offenses that are included in CODIS by \nadding all federal felony offenses to the database. Currently, the DNA \nAnalysis and Backlog Elimination Act includes only select Federal \noffenses. The successful experiences of approximately 19 States, \nincluding Utah, which currently authorize the collection of DNA samples \nfor all felony offenses illustrate the need for this extension. These \nStates have solved numerous crimes where DNA has been found--frequently \nbased on an offender's conviction for a nonviolent offense--such as \nburglary, theft or a narcotics offense.\n  Remarkably, not all States currently authorize the collection of DNA \nsamples from all types of child offenders. Thus, the Act also expands \nthe definition of qualifying offense to include all state offenses \nagainst children, such as those involving child kidnapping or abuse. \nThis expansion will increase law enforcement's ability to solve such \ncrimes where DNA evidence is found.\n  Second, the Act extends the Federal wiretap statute by adding sex \ntrafficking, sexual abuse, exploitation, and other sex-related offenses \nas predicate offenses to the statute. As we all know, the Internet is \nbecoming an increasingly popular means by which sexual predators make \ncontact with child victims. Although predators typically initiate a \nrelationship online, they ultimately seek to make personal contact with \nthe child--both over the telephone and through face to face meetings. \nBut as the law exists today, investigators are restricted in their \nability to investigate such predators. This provision will enable \ninvestigators, who meet the statutory requirements of the Federal \nwiretap statute, to obtain court authorization to monitor such \ncommunications. This amendment will not only aid investigators in \nobtaining evidence of these crimes, it will also help\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nstop these crimes before a sexual predator makes contact with a child.\n\n  To obtain a wiretap, law enforcement authorities will still need to \nmeet the strict statutory guidelines of the wiretap statute and obtain \nauthorization from a court. Thus, the legislation will not undermine \nthe legitimate expectations of privacy of law-abiding Americans. This \nexpanded tool will be particularly useful to investigators who track \nsexual predators and child pornographers.\n  The Act also strengthens criminal penalties by extending the \nsupervised release period that applies to certain offenders, increasing \nthe maximum penalties that apply to offenses involving transportation \nfor illegal sexual activity, and directing the United States Sentencing \nCommission to review the guidelines that apply to criminal offenses \nwith which child predators are frequently charged to determine whether \nthey are sufficiently severe.\n  The Act grants Federal judges the discretion to impose up to lifetime \nperiods of supervised release for individuals who are convicted of \nsexual abuse, sexual exploitation, transportation for illegal sexual \nactivity, or sex trafficking offenses. Under current Federal law, a \njudge can impose no more than 5 years of supervised release for a \nserious felony, and no more than 3 years for a lesser categorized \noffense. This amendment to the general supervised release statute will \nnot require judges to impose a period of supervised release longer than \n5 years; it will simply authorize them to do so where a judge sees fit \nbased on the nature and circumstances of the case.\n  In my view, if there is any class of offenders on which our criminal \njustice system should keep a close eye, it is sexual predators. It is \nwell documented that sex offenders are more likely than other violent \ncriminals to commit future crimes. And if there is any class of victims \nwe should seek to protect from repeat offenders, it is those who have \nbeen sexually assaulted. They suffer tremendous physical, emotional and \npsychological injuries. By ensuring that egregious sexual offenders are \nsupervised for longer periods of time, we will increase the chance that \nthey will be deterred from and punished for future criminal acts.\n  The Act increases the maximum penalties that apply to certain \noffenses, including sexual offenses that involve the trafficking of \nchildren and transportation. Stiffer penalties are needed to punish and \ndeter individuals who commit such offenses.\n\n  The Act also directs the United States Sentencing Commission to \nreview the sentencing guidelines that apply to various offenses that \napply to kidnappers, sexual abusers and exploiters, to ensure that \nFederal sentences are sufficiently severe where aggravating \ncircumstances exist, such as where the victim was abducted, injured, \nkilled, or abused by more than one person.\n  In a number of significant ways, the Act enhances the resources that \nare available to investigate and prosecute crimes against children.\n  First, the Act directs the Attorney General to appoint a Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General to oversee a new section at the Department \nof Justice designated to focus solely on crimes against children. Among \nother things, the new section will be tasked with prosecuting crimes \nagainst children, providing guidance and assistance to Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement agencies and personnel who handle such cases, \ncoordinating efforts with international law enforcement agencies to \ncombat crimes against children, and acting as a liaison with the \nlegislative and judicial branches of government to ensure that adequate \nattention and resources are focused on protecting our children from \npredators of all types.\n  In addition, the Act tasks the new Crimes Against Children section to \ncreate an Internet site that consolidates sex offender information \nwhich States currently disclose under the Federal reporting act. The \nAct also direct States that have not developed Internet sites to do so. \nThe creation of a national Internet site will enable concerned citizens \nto find in one, easily accessible place, critical information about \nsexual predators.\n  Currently, all 50 States have registration statutes that require sex \noffenders to register and to share information with the United States \nAttorney General through the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and over \n30 States make offender information available to the public on the \nInternet. A national Internet site will enhance the public's ability to \nfind and access information that is already available in the public \nrecord, and will protect citizens in States where sex offenders move to \ntry to avoid detection of their past criminal acts. In short, the \nnational Internet site will provide parents and other concerned \ncitizens with essential information about the whereabouts and \nbackgrounds of child abusers, so they can take all necessary steps to \nprotect our Nation's children from harm's way.\n  The Act also increases resources and funding for the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation. The recent series of tragic events involving child \nvictims has convinced me that we need to take a more proactive approach \nto prevent, deter and prosecute child predators of all types--abusers, \nmolesters, pornographers and traffickers. And at the same time, we need \nto provide our children, the vulnerable victims of such predators, with \nthe support systems they need to recover fully from such horrendous \ncrimes and to assist law enforcement in effectively investigating and \nprosecuting these crimes.\n  To this end, the Act directs the FBI to establish a National Crimes \nAgainst Children Response Center whose primary mission will be to \ndevelop a comprehensive and rapid response plan to reported crimes \ninvolving the victimization of children. While the National Response \nCenter is to be established by the FBI, in consultation with the Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General for the Crimes Against Children Office, it \nwill integrate the resources and expertise of other Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement agencies, as well as other child serving \nprofessionals. By creating and training rapid response teams comprised \nof federal, state and local prosecutors, investigators, victim witness \nspecialists, mental health and other child serving professionals, the \nCenter will greatly enhance our national response and prevention \nefforts. The combination of valuable expertise and resources provided \nby such multi-jurisdictional and multi-disciplinary partnerships will \nincrease the likelihood that law enforcement authorities will \nsuccessfully identify, prosecute and punish child predators, and that \nchild serving professionals will provide child victims with much needed \nsupport.\n  The ``Comprehensive Child Protection Act of 2003'' will enhance our \nability to combat crimes against children, but it is by no means an \nend. Congress needs to continue to explore additional ways in which we \ncan improve our ability on a national level to protect our children. \nOur children fall victim to many of the same crimes we face as adults, \nand they are also subject to crimes that are specific to childhood, \nlike child abuse and neglect. The effects of such heinous crimes are \ndevastating and often lead to an intergenerational cycle of violence \nand abuse.\n  I want to do all I can to ensure that we devote the same intensity of \npurpose to crimes committed against children, as we do to other serious \ncriminal offenses, such as those involving terrorism. We have no \ngreater resource than our children. I invite the Department of Justice, \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and other non governmental entities \nand professionals who are charged with protecting our children to work \nwith me to improve our Federal laws and to assist States in doing the \nsame.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, to reintroduce the ``Comprehensive Child Protection Act \nof 2003''--a bill to help protect our Nation's children from child \nmolestation and other forms of abuse. Senator Hatch and I introduced \nthis bill for the first time on September 10, 2002.\n  Sexual abuse of children is a pervasive and extremely troubling \nproblem in the United States. I learned that over 25 years ago when I \nwas serving as the County Prosecutor in Greene County, Ohio. I saw what \nthis kind of abuse does to innocent, helpless children and how \npervasive the crimes are in our communities. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, one of every three girls and one of \nevery seven boys will be sexually abused before they reach the age of \n18.\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\n  Our local police and prosecutors are on the front line in the fight \nagainst these criminals, and they deserve credit and our thanks for \ntheir hard work. For example, in Greene County recently, a number of \nchild pornographers were identified and prosecuted when local law \nenforcement carried out a successful Internet sting operation.\n  Despite successes like this, however, the data suggest that law \nenforcement is fighting an uphill battle. In 2001 alone, there were \nover 5,400 registered sex offenders living in my home State of Ohio--an \nincrease of 319 percent over 1998. Equally troubling, many child \nmolesters prey upon dozens of victims before they are reported to law \nenforcement. Some evade detection for so long because many children \nnever report the abuse. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nbetween 60 percent and 80 percent of child molestations and 69 percent \nof sexual assaults are never reported to the police. And, according to \nthe Congressional Research Service, of reported sexual assaults, 71 \npercent of the victims are children.\n  For these reasons, it is vitally important that Congress do \neverything in its power to support law enforcement in its efforts to \nprotect our nation's most vulnerable citizens. Enacting the \n``Comprehensive Child Protection Act of 2003'' would be a step in the \nright direction. By enacting this measure, we would help protect our \nchildren from sexual predators, pornographers, and others who abuse \nchildren. Among its major provisions, this legislation would: 1. Direct \nthe FBI to establish a new center that creates and trains ``rapid \nresponse teams'' (composed of prosecutors, investigators, and others) \nto respond promptly to reported crimes against children; 2. Establish a \nnational Internet site that would make sex offender information \navailable to the public in one, easily accessible place. Currently, \nabout 30 states make offender information available to the public \nonline; 3. Authorize the collection of DNA samples from registered sex \noffenders and the inclusion of these DNA samples in the Combined DNA \nIndex System, or ``CODIS;'' 4. Permit the prosecution of child abuse \noffenses until a victim reaches the age of 35 (as opposed to the age of \n25 under current law). This provision recognizes that victims of such \ncrimes often do not come forward until years after the abuse, out of \nshame or a fear of further humiliation; 5. Make it easier for \ninvestigators to track sexual predators and child pornographers and \nmake it easier to prosecute criminal child abuse/molestation cases; 6. \nCreate a new section at the Department of Justice to focus solely on \ncrimes against children; and 7. Stiffen penalties for sex-related \noffenses involving children.\n  This is a good bill--a bill that would help ensure that our children \nare protected from some of the most heinous of criminals. It is a bill \nthat would increase the punishment for those criminals. And, it is a \nbill that, quite simply, is the right thing to do. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this important measure.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I again rise in support of the \nComprehensive Child Protection Act. I am proud to be standing with \nSenator Hatch as a co-sponsor of a bill that represents one of the most \ncomprehensive pieces of legislation ever drafted to protect children. \nThe miracle that Elizabeth Smart was found safe and sound, reminds us \nof how important this bill is.\n  As a former chairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee and Ranking \nRepublican on the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs during the 107th \nCongress, I have been greatly concerned with the increase in reports of \nchild abductions and murders, so I am glad to be a part of this effort \nto address this growing problem. In my tenure on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have long fought for our Nation's children, and have \nardently supported laws that bring them and their families greater \nprotection.\n  This legislation comes at a critical time because we are hearing more \nand more about children being taken from their homes or schools and \nabused, or worse, murdered. Our children are a gift to us, are our \nnational treasure, and are our future. We must do all that we can to \nprotect these innocents and give law enforcement every tool possible to \nferret out the criminals who would do our children harm. With this \nlegislation, we will be ensuring a greater measure of protection for \nour children. The miracle that Elizabeth Smart was found safe and \nsound, reminds us of how important this bill is.\n  The bill does many important things. First, it helps law enforcement \nrespond immediately to incidents of child abduction, because, as we've \nseen with the Amber Alert system, time is critical in any abduction \ncase to thwart further injury or harm. The bill creates a National \nCrimes Against Children Response Center at the FBI that will integrate \nthe resources and expertise of all Federal, State and local law \nenforcement sources to provide a rapid response for crimes involving \nchild victims. The bill also helps law enforcement by making it \npossible to get wire taps for suspected sex trafficking and \nexploitation offenses, and will require that all Federal child sex \ncrimes offenders have their DNA added to the national DNA registry. So \nthe bill will help to centralize information about criminals and \ncrimes, and makes the job of the criminal investigator easier and more \naccurate through wiretaps and DNA evidence.\n  The bill also creates a website registry for convicted child sexual \noffenders so that parents, neighbors, and police know who in their \ncommunities is a convicted child predator. This website will supplement \nregistries in all 50 States. This important tool will help families \nmake better and fully informed decisions about their children's safety, \nand will greatly aid law enforcement's response to reports of child \nabductions and other offenses against children. The bill also gives new \ntools to prosecutors and the courts. It extends the statute of \nlimitations for prosecuting child offenders, allows prosecutors to \nintroduce evidence of past child sex crimes in sentencing hearings, \nremoves the so-called ``spousal privilege'' so that a spouse can't \nstand silent in the prosecution of the other spouse for child sexual \nabuse, and increases the maximum sentences and probation periods for \nchild sex offenders. These important tools will make our communities \nsafer by helping to rid them of child predators, and by keeping a tight \nleash on predators when they get released from prison.\n  So this bill helps the public know about sexual predators in their \ncommunities, improves the nation's ability to respond to child \nabduction reports, and aids criminal investigators and prosecutors in \ntheir efforts to protect the public by identifying and locking-up child \npredators. I ask my fellow Senators to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reed, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 645. A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act \nof 1965 to provide assistance to communities for the redevelopment of \nbrownfield sites; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today along with Senators \nCollins, Jeffords and others the Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance \nAct of 2003. As a resident of Michigan I am familiar with the obstacles \nfacing local communities in their attempts to return brownfields sites \nto productive economic uses. As co-chair of the Senate Smart Growth \nTask Force I understand the national economic importance of these \nefforts.\n  Brownfields are abandoned, idled or under-used industrial and \ncommercial properties where expansion or redevelopment is hindered by \nreal or perceived environmental contamination. More than 450,000 of \nthese sites taint our nation's landscape, inhibiting economic \ndevelopment and posing a threat to human health and the environment. \nUndeveloped, or underdeveloped, brownfields sites blight communities \nforcing development onto greenfields where they exacerbate the problems \nassociated with urban sprawl. If brownfields were instead redeveloped \nthey could offer new opportunities for business, housing and open \nspace.\n  Brownfields redevelopment is a fiscally-sound way to bring investment \nback to neglected neighborhoods, clean-up the environment, maximize use \nof existing infrastructure, create jobs and relieve development \npressure on our urban fringe and farmlands. My\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\nhome state of Michigan is a national leader in brownfields \nredevelopment. For example, the City of Traverse City managed to \nleverage $662,000 of government brownfields funding to turn a former \ngas station and junk yard site into a $20 million private investment in \na retail, office and parking facility called Radio Center. The City of \nLudington used brownfields funding to spur the development of a multi-\nuse retail/office/condominium complex adjacent to a marina. These are \nonly two examples of the many successful efforts by local communities \nto leverage Federal, State and local money to harness the resources and \nexpertise of the private sector in economic development efforts. The \nBrownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act of 2003 would open up the \npossibilities of redevelopment to numerous other communities \nnationwide.\n  The Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act expands the Department \nof Commerce's Economic Development Administration, EDA, initiatives to \nassist communities with brownfields redevelopment. The bill authorizes \n$60 million annually for five years for brownfields redevelopment. \nGrant money will be used for purposes including collaborative economic \ndevelopment planning, eco-industrial development and revolving loan \nfunds. By encouraging development in existing communities the \nbrownfields program will strengthen local economies, preserve precious \nresources and make best use of existing infrastructure. This bill for \nthe first time would provide specific authority and funding to the EDA \nfor these initiatives. The new projects authorized by the bill would \ncomplement the existing and successful brownfields efforts of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce and the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors estimates that redevelopment of all of \nthe brownfields nationwide could generate more than 550,000 additional \njobs that would benefit our many economically struggling communities. \nCities and States could see as much as $2.4 billion in new tax \nrevenues. The Economic Development Administration has helped distressed \ncommunities attract investment, create jobs and strengthen their \neconomies for the last forty years. This bill will build on EDA's \nsuccess in helping localities improve their infrastructure and help \nthem redevelop their brownfields sites. Communities nationwide have \nexpressed interest in brownfields redevelopment but lack the financial \nresources necessary to accomplish their goals. This bill is an \nexcellent example of how the Federal Government can be supportive of \nlocal economic development projects. The Brownfield Redevelopment \nAssistance Act of 2003 advances the goals of the smart growth movement \nby helping create healthier communities and strengthens the economy \nthrough federally supportive, locally driven initiatives.\n  Many organizations support these bills, including the American \nInstitute of Architects, American Planning Association, American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, Enterprise Institute, National Business \nIncubation Association, National Association of Counties, National \nAssociation of Regional Councils, National League of Cities, US \nConference of Mayors, National Congress for Community Economic \nDevelopment, Smart Growth America and others. I ask unanimous consent \nto have letters endorsing this bill printed, the Record. I also ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and additional material was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                    The Enterprise Foundation,\n\n                                     Columbia, MD, March 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The Enterprise Foundation commends you \n     for joining Senator Jeffords in introducing the ``Brownfields \n     Redevelopment Assistance Act.'' Enterprise strongly supports \n     this bill.\n       Enterprise is a national nonprofit organization that raises \n     resources and channels them to grassroots groups at the local \n     level for affordable housing, economic development and other \n     community revitalization initiatives in distressed urban and \n     rural neighborhoods nationwide. Central to our mission is \n     generating investment in areas suffering from blight, neglect \n     and disinvestment. Brownfields are prime examples of such \n     areas.\n       Enterprise is engaged in several large-scale brownfield \n     redevelopment efforts around the country. Targeted incentives \n     such as your bill provides would enable Enterprise and others \n     in the private sector to convert more brownfields to \n     productive uses.\n       By spurring brownfields redevelopment, your bill would \n     direct limited public resources to places that already \n     benefit from existing infrastructure and promote economic \n     investment where it is needed most. The bill epitomizes smart \n     growth and comprehensive community development principles.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         F. Barton Harvey III,\n\n                                             Chairman of the Board\n     and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Smart Growth America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Jim Jeffords,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Levin, Jeffords and Collins: Smart Growth \n     America would like to thank you for your leadership on the \n     introduction the Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act of \n     2003. As advocates of smart growth--growth that revitalizes \n     neighborhoods, supports affordable housing, promotes \n     transportation choice, and preserves open space and \n     farmland--we regard brownfields redevelopment as a top \n     priority.\n       With an estimated 450,000 nationwide, brownfields pose a \n     major barrier to reinvestment in many communities. These \n     parcels are not simply gaps, they are an active blight, \n     pulling down surrounding property values and driving \n     development and investment further away from existing \n     infrastructure.\n       The Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act would supply \n     an additional tool for local communities to return these \n     sites to productive use by providing the Economic Development \n     Administration (EDA) with the authority and dedicated funding \n     to support brownfield redevelopment projects. Specifically, \n     the legislation would authorize the EDA to administer a $60 \n     million per year grant program for targeted assistance to \n     projects that redevelop brownfield sites and promote eco-\n     industrial development.\n       We believe the Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance will \n     assist communities nationwide in encouraging economic \n     development, removing environmental and public health \n     hazards, promoting neighborhood revitalization, and \n     preserving open space. We support your efforts and look \n     forward to working with you to pass this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Don Chen,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             National Congress for\n\n\n                               Community Economic Development,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The National Congress for Community \n     Economic Development thanks you for re-introducing The \n     Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act of 2003.\n       We support the efforts of HUD, EPA, and the other agencies \n     that are part of the Brownfields National Partnership. Moving \n     these lands into productive reuse, reducing sprawl, and \n     increasing the tax base will help local economies and improve \n     the quality of life.\n       As the trade association of America's 3,600 community \n     development corporations, we believe that this bill would \n     help in our efforts to revitalize distressed urban and rural \n     communities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Carol Wayman,\n     Director of Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the nation's elected \n     county officials, I am writing in support of the Brownfields \n     Redevelopment Assistance Act of 2003. This legislation is \n     important to the redevelopment efforts of brownfields sites \n     in communities.\n       The National Association of Counties (NACo) has been \n     longtime supporter of brownfield site revitalization. After \n     restoring abandoned properties to active use, redeveloped \n     properties contribute to a community's overall economic \n     vitality through business attraction, job creation, and the \n     enhancement of the local tax base. Also, NACo is a strong \n     advocate for the work of the Economic Development \n     Administration, and supports additional federal economic \n     development efforts by the agency.\n       In particular, NACo appreciates the bill's focus on \n     distressed communities experiencing high levels of \n     unemployment or underemployment, as well as population loss \n     and infrastructure deterioration. Additional federal \n     resources are needed to leverage with local economic \n     development efforts to help alleviate economic distress in \n     many communities across the country.\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\n       NACo applauds your efforts towards the restoration and \n     redevelopment of brownfields sites, and offers its full \n     support of this important legislation. Please feel free to \n     contact Cassandra Matthews or Julie Ufner, NACo Associate \n     Legislative Directors, at (202) 393-6226, if you need further \n     information or assistance.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this matter\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American Society\n\n\n                                           of Civil Engineers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing on behalf of the 130,000 \n     members of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) to \n     let you know of our support for your proposed legislation to \n     expand the brownfields program enacted in 2002 by providing \n     federal assistance for distressed communities under the \n     Public Works and Economic Development Act.\n       As you already realize, the restoration of brownfields is \n     important to the environmental and industrial health of this \n     nation through the revitalization of many of our blighted \n     areas. In 1995, the General Accounting Office estimated that \n     there were more than 450,000 brownfield properties across \n     America. In 2000, the U.S. Conference of Mayors calculated \n     that redeveloped brownfields could generate 550,000 \n     additional jobs and up to $2.4 billion in new tax revenue for \n     cities nationwide.\n       ASCE believes that brownfields restoration, properly \n     carried out, limits urban sprawl thereby achieving a balance \n     between economic development, the rights of individual \n     property owners, the public interest, social wants and a \n     healthy environment. Revitalized brownfields reduce the \n     demand for underdeveloped land. As devastated urban land is \n     returned to productive use, the pressure to develop distant \n     open spaces is lessened, thereby mitigating the undesirable \n     effects of sprawl, and such as traffic congestion, and \n     preserving culturally and ecologically valuable land.\n       If ASCE can assist you in any way to enact this important \n     legislation, please do not hesitate to contact Brian Pallasch \n     at (202) 326-5140 or Michael Charles at (202) 326-5126 in our \n     Washington Office.\n       Sincerely yours,\n                                                Thomas L. Jackson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of over 18,000 municipalities \n     across the country represented by the National League of \n     Cities, I am writing to express our support for the \n     Brownfield Redevelopment Assistance Act of 2003. The benefits \n     of returning contaminated parcels of land to productive use \n     for commerce and industry are extensive. If environmental \n     conditions are improved, brownfields have the potential to \n     contribute to the economic revitalization of many cities. For \n     this reason, the National League of Cities calls on the \n     federal government to implement a policy that allows these \n     sites to serve a viable economic purpose, while ensuring the \n     public's health is maintained.\n       We believe that eco-industrial development, restoring the \n     employment and tax bases, and bringing new investment to \n     distressed communities are necessary and will move forward \n     with the enactment of your brownfields legislation. We \n     support your efforts to provide the Economic Development \n     Administration with funding and tools that will be vital to \n     creating economic redevelopment in economically distressed \n     communities across the nation.\n       We look forward to working with you to build bi-partisan \n     support for the Brownfield Redevelopment Act of 2003.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Donald J. Borut,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the textile mills and tanneries of Maine \nhelped fuel our country's economic growth. But as these industries \nclosed, brownfields replaced once vibrant factories. In many \ncommunities across Maine these sites remain a legacy of our industrial \nhistory.\n  Left undeveloped, brownfields pose threats to the public health, \nenvironmental quality and economic strength of our communities. But \nredeveloped, these sites offer opportunities for new industries, job \ngrowth and economic development. I am pleased to join Senators Levin \nand Jeffords in introducing the Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance \nAct. This legislation will provide communities with economic \ndevelopment resources to redevelop brownfields and return them to \nproductive uses.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would provide EDA with \nincreased funding flexibility to help States, local communities, Indian \ntribes and nonprofit organizations return brownfield sites to \nproductive use. The bill authorizes $60 million each year for five \nyears for brownfields redevelopment. This funding authorized by this \nbill will result in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of economic \nbenefits for States and local communities through the leveraging of \nlocal and State funds and private investments.\n  The bill gives EDA the authority to provide grants for brownfield \nredevelopment projects, including: development of public facilities and \npublic services; business development; activities to help communities \ndiversify their economies; and collaborative economic development \nplanning. This will help States and communities facilitate effective \neconomic development planning for brownfield reuse; develop \ninfrastructure necessary to prepare sites for re-entry into the market; \nand, provide the capital necessary to support new business development.\n  The decline of the New England textile industry led to the closure of \nmany textile mills throughout the region, including the Bates Mill in \nthe City of Lewiston, ME. The Bates Mill was once the State's largest \nemployer providing more than 5,000 jobs. Economic decline and layoffs \nleft the residents of Lewiston with large abandoned mill buildings that \nhave been a challenge to redevelop. As a small city of 36,000 people, \ncontinued support for redeveloping brownfields located in the heart of \ndowntown is critical to the city's future economic vitality. In 1998, \nthe city received a $200,000 grant from the Environmental Protection \nAgency to help facilitate the cleanup and redevelopment of the one \nmillion square foot mill complex. Today, the City has redeveloped about \none-third of the mill and created 1,000 new jobs. The City estimates \nthat it will require $54 million to develop the remaining buildings in \nthe Bates Mill Complex. The economic development resources provided in \nthe Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act will help Lewiston and \nother communities across the nation rebuild their communities and \ncreate new economic opportunity.\n  Brownfields redevelopment is a fiscally responsible strategy for \nstrengthening local economies and reusing existing infrastructure while \nprotecting open space. We recycle cans, bottles and newspapers now we \nmust try harder to recycle our land. I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor of the bill to aid in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 646. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand and improve coverage of mental health services under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Medicare Mental Health \nModernization Act of 2003. I introduce this bill today, along with \nRepresentative Pete Stark (D-CA), in fond memory of our former \ncolleague and friend, the late Senator Paul Wellstone. Paul was a \ncrusader in many ways and for many causes; however, we will always \nremember his commitment to ensuring that all Americans have meaningful \nand equitable access to mental health treatment.\n  It is because of Paul's efforts that so many Americans, including \nmany in the Congress, have rallied around the call for parity in the \ntreatment of mental illness. Many of us are all too familiar with the \nstigma that still surrounds mental illness and the disparities in \naccessing treatment that permeate the private health insurance market. \nWhat many of us do not realize is that these inequities also exist in \nthe Medicare program.\n  Our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries--our elderly and disabled \npopulation--have limited access to mental health services. Medicare \nrestricts the types of mental health services available to \nbeneficiaries and the types of providers who are allowed to offer such \ncare. It also charges higher copayments for mental health services than \nit does for all other health care. In order to receive mental health \ncare, seniors and the disabled must pay 50 percent of the cost of a \nvisit to their mental health specialist, as opposed to the 20 percent \nthat they pay for other services. Medicare also limits the number of \ndays a beneficiary can receive mental health care in a hospital setting \nto 190 days over an individual's lifetime.\n  As we talk about modernizing the Medicare program we must address \nthis problem. The need is glaring. Almost 20 percent of Americans over \nage 65 have a serious mental disorder. They suffer from depression, \nAlzheimer's disease, dementia, anxiety, late-life schizophrenia and, \nall too often, substance abuse. These are serious illnesses that must \nbe treated. Unfortunately, they are often unidentified by primary care \nphysicians, or the appropriate services are simply out of reach. \nAmericans age 65 and older have the highest rate of suicide of any \nother population in the United States. An alarming 70 percent of \nelderly suicide victims have visited\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\ntheir primary care doctor in the month prior to committing suicide.\n  Medicare is also the primary source of health insurance for millions \nof non-elderly disabled. More than 20 percent of these individuals \nsuffer from mental illness and/or addiction. This very needy population \nfaces the same discrimination in their mental health coverage.\n  As our population ages, the burden of mental illness on seniors, \ntheir families, and the health care system will only continue to \nincrease. Experts estimate that by the year 2030, 15 million people \nover 65 will have psychiatric disorders, with the number of individuals \nsuffering from Alzheimer's disease doubling. If we do not reform the \nMedicare program to provide greater access to detection and treatment \nof mental illness, the cost of not treating these diseases will rapidly \nescalate. Without the appropriate outpatient mental health services, \ntoo many of our seniors are forced into nursing homes and hospitals. If \nwe truly want to modernize Medicare and make it more efficient, we must \nprovide access to these services. Not only will they likely reduce \ncosts in the long-term, but they will also increase Medicare \nbeneficiaries' quality of life.\n  The Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act takes critical steps to \naddress these issues. First, the bill reduces the 50 percent copayment \nfor mental health services to 20 percent. The proposed 20 percent \ncopayment is the same as the copayment for all other outpatient \nservices in Medicare. Second, the bill would provide access to \nintensive residential services for those who are suffering from severe \nmental illness. This will give people with Alzheimer's disease and \nother serious mental illness the opportunity to be cared for in their \nhomes or in community-based settings. Third, the bill expands the \nnumber of qualified mental health professionals eligible to provide \nservices through the Medicare program. This includes licensed \nprofessional mental health counselors, clinical social workers, and \nmarriage and family therapists. This expansion of qualified providers \nis critical to ensuring that seniors throughout the nation, \nparticularly those in rural areas, are able to receive the services \nthey need.\n  In closing, I urge all of my colleagues to step forward to support \nthe Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act of 2003. It is time for \nthe Medicare program to stop discriminating against seniors and the \ndisabled who are suffering from mental illness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 647. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nDepartment of Defense funding of continuation of health benefits plan \ncoverage for certain Reserves called or ordered to active duty and \ntheir dependents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to close an \nunfortunate loophole in health insurance coverage for families of \nReserve and Guard members who are called up for active duty.\n  As we face the likelihood of war with Iraq, one hundred and fifty \nthousand members of the National Guard and the Reserves have been \nmobilized for service. These soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen are \nstanding by their country in a time of national emergency. But unless \nthe Congress takes immediate action, too many of the spouses and \nchildren of these brave men and women may find the quality of their \nheath care reduced.\n  Today's military relies more heavily than ever before on the Reserve \nand Guard. Currently, over 150,000 National Guard and reserve soldiers, \nsailors, Marines and airmen have been mobilized. They are spending an \naverage of thirteen times longer on active duty today than compared to \na decade ago.\n  Our men and women in uniform are working and training hard for the \nserious challenges before them. They are living in the desert, enduring \nharsh conditions, and contemplating the horrors of the approaching war. \nAt the same time, they must put their lives on hold, dealing with \nfamily crises by phone and email. We must do our best to take care of \nthose they have left at home.\n  During the Vietnam war, only 20 percent of all Army personnel were \nmarried. Today over 50 percent of the active military are married. \nThese numbers are even higher in the Guard and Reserves. This service \nplaces heavy strain on the families who are left behind to worry and \ncope with the sudden new demands of running a household alone.\n  For the Guard and Reservists' families, a recall to active duty \nbrings new bureaucratic challenges. Employers are not required to keep \npaying the health insurance for reservists while they are deployed. \nMany guardsmen and reservists may not be able to afford to pay for \nhealth care for their families while they are away.\n  If a guardsman or reservist is activated for more than thirty days, \ntheir family is eligible to enroll in the TRICARE program. However, \nduring that first month, the family may not have any health insurance. \nIn addition, if their family doctor does not participate in TRICARE, \nthe family must find a new doctor while coping with all the other \ndemands of the service member's absence. A family with a sick child and \na father or mother sent off to war should not have to cope with the \nadded burden of giving up the family doctor they trust.\n  The bill I am introducing will assure continuity of health insurance \ncoverage for families of Reservists and National Guard personnel called \nto active duty. Under this bill, these families retain the option of \nprivate health insurance coverage during the period of active duty, \nrather than enrolling in TRICARE.\n  The bill amends the COBRA coverage rules to specify that loss of \nemployment-based coverage due to active-duty allows them to use the \nCOBRA mechanism to retain their health care coverage. The Federal \nGovernment will pay the cost of premiums not covered by employers. This \nassistance will relieve some of the financial burden on families when \nthe service member leaves a more lucrative private sector job to serve \nin the military. The Federal Government will also pay the cost of \ncontinuing family coverage purchased in the individual insurance \nmarket, for those who do not have employment-based coverage.\n  The cost of the modest additional help for the families of our \nservicemen will be small, since spouses and children who continue to \nuse their private insurance policies will not be using TRICARE medical \nservices that would otherwise be the government's responsibility.\n  This bill will not change the health care coverage for service \nmembers who will continue to receive health care through the military \nmedical system. Nor will it change the health care coverage for active \nduty family members who retain TRICARE eligibility and receive health \ncare either through the direct care system or TRICARE network.\n  When Reservists and members of the National Guard are called to \nactive duty in time of international crisis, they are asked to put \ntheir lives on the line for their country. The least we can do for them \nis assure that their families can continue to receive quality health \ncare without interruption during their absence.\n  I urge my colleagues to move promptly to enact this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC March 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Daniels: As you prepare the Administration's \n     request for emergency supplemental appropriations, we urge \n     you to consider an important issue facing our National Guard \n     and Reserve Component troops.\n       Today's military relies more heavily than ever before on \n     these forces. Currently, over 150,000 members of the guard \n     and reserve have been mobilized. They are spending an average \n     of thirteen times longer on active duty than their \n     counterparts a decade ago.\n       For their families, a recall to active duty brings new \n     bureaucratic challenges. Employers are not required to keep \n     paying for their health insurance coverage while they are \n     deployed, and many of them may not be able to afford to pay \n     for coverage for their families while they are away.\n       If reservists or guardsmen are activated for more than \n     thirty days, their families are eligible to enroll in the \n     TRICARE program. However, during that first month, the family \n     may not have any health insurance. In addition, their family \n     doctor may not participate in TRICARE, forcing the family to \n     find a\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\n     new doctor while coping with all the other demands of the \n     service member's absence.\n       To address this problem, we are introducing bills to assure \n     continuity of health insurance coverage for families of \n     reservists and National Guard personnel called to active \n     duty. Under this bill, these families will retain the option \n     of private health insurance coverage during the period of \n     active duty, rather than enrolling in TRICARE. This bill will \n     not change the health care coverage for the reservists or \n     guardsmen who will continue to be covered by TRICARE during \n     active military service.\n       The bill modifies the COBRA continuation-of-coverage rules \n     to specify that loss of employment-based converge due to \n     active-duty is a qualifying event for COBRA, so that they \n     can, if they choose, use the COBRA mechanism to retain their \n     health care coverage. The federal government will pay the \n     cost of premiums not covered by employers, as well as the \n     cost of continuing family coverage purchased in the \n     individual market.\n       We believe this step is important as part of the overall \n     effort to take care of the families of our men and women in \n     uniform. We urge you to include a proposal to provide \n     continuity of health insurance for reservists and guardsmen \n     in the emergency supplemental.\n       With respect and appreciation, and we look forward to \n     working with you on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       United States Senator.\n     Michael Capuano,\n       United States Representative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Warner, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Ms. Collins, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 648. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to \nhealth professions programs regarding the practice of pharmacy; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the Pharmacy \nEducation Aid Act along with my colleagues, Senator Enzi, Senator \nJohnson and others. Last year, the Senate recognized and acted to \naddress the growing, nationwide shortage of pharmacists, by creating a \ndemonstration program under the National Health Service Corps whereby \npharmacists agree to serve in rural and medically underserved areas in \nexchange for partial loan repayment. I commend my colleagues for \nresponding in such a strong, bipartisan way to this critically \nimportant health care issue. The bill I am introducing today, the \nPharmacy Education Aid Act seeks to build on that bipartisan step while \ntaking a multi-faceted approach to the problem of workforce shortages \nin the pharmacy sector.\n  The December 2000 Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, \nreport, ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand \nfor Pharmacists'' concluded that due to the rapid increase in demand \nfor pharmacists and our limited ability to expand the number pharmacy \neducation programs to train more pharmacists, the shortage was unlikely \nto abate without significant changes to the current system.\n  Pharmacists represent the third largest and most trusted health \nprofessional group in the United States. In 2000, 190,000 pharmacists \nwere in practice. While this figure is expected to grow to 224,500 by \n2010, demand for pharmacists is expected to continue to outpace supply.\n  These shortages, while particularly acute in rural and medically \nunderserved areas, are felt throughout of health care system. A \nNovember 2001 GAO report found that, on average, hospitals report 21 \npercent of their pharmacist positions are currently unfilled. Vacancy \nrates are even higher in federal health systems, such as the Department \nof Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and the Indian Health \nService.\n  The Pharmacy Education Act seeks to address these chronic shortfalls \nin the supply and distribution of pharmacists by building upon Title \nVII of the Public Health Service Act, with particular emphasis on \nstudents with the greatest financial need.\n  In addition to enhancing students' opportunities to pursue an \neducation in pharmacy, the bill also makes available much needed \nresources to Colleges of Pharmacy to upgrade and expand facilities and \nlaboratory space as well as to recruit and retain talented faculty to \neducate future generations of pharmacists.\n  As Congress works to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit, \nthe need for more pharmacist involvement in health care decision \nmaking, including medication therapy management, formulary development \nand drug utilization review, will be essential to its long-term \nsuccess. We must address the pharmacist shortage now. As such, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues towards expeditious consideration \nand passage of this timely and important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                February 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg, Edward Kennedy, Billy Tauzin, John Dingell, \n       Michael Bilirakis, Sherrod Brown.\n       The undersigned associations and organizations urge you to \n     ensure Americans continue to have access to comprehensive \n     pharmacy services. During the 107th Congress you recognized \n     how important it is to ensure enough pharmacists are \n     available to care for our nation's citizens, especially the \n     most vulnerable. We were very grateful that the House \n     introduced two bills and the senate passed one bill, all \n     addressing the supply and distribution of pharmacists. We \n     request your support for similar legislation that is soon to \n     be introduced during the 108th Congress. Helping the nation's \n     colleges and schools of pharmacy increase their educational \n     capacity is an important way of assuring access to this \n     critical health care professional.\n       ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study of the Supply and \n     Demand for Pharmacists,'' released in December 2000 by the \n     Department of Health and Human Service was just a starting \n     point for raising public awareness of the growing demand for \n     pharmacists. The American Hospital Association released a \n     study in April 2002 that showed vacancy rates for pharmacists \n     in hospitals and health systems exceeded that of nurses. \n     Recent pharmacy workforce reports from North Carolina, Oregon \n     and Washington make it clear that there are imbalances in the \n     supply of pharmacists in rural vs. urban areas. These \n     reports, and others acknowledge that, like the general \n     population, the pharmacist workforce is aging, placing \n     communities at risk of losing access to pharmacy services.\n       Congress, in some recent Medicare drug benefit proposals, \n     increases the demand for pharmacists by recognizing the \n     benefits they bring to health care delivery. Retrospective \n     drug utilization review, formulary development, medication \n     therapy management, and prescribing protocols are some of the \n     mechanisms included in proposed legislation. All these \n     mechanisms are dependent on or directly involve a pharmacist. \n     A Medicare prescription drug benefit will dramatically \n     increase the number of prescriptions dispensed. As a result, \n     pharmacists will serve an increasingly important role in \n     utilization control and medication therapy management. This \n     will only place additional workforce pressure on a health \n     profession already in high demand.\n       The President also increases the demand for pharmacists \n     with his proposals to expand access to health care and \n     improve health through health promotion activities. Colleges \n     and schools of pharmacy educate and graduate a health care \n     professional that is finding growing practice opportunities \n     across a wide range of clinical and community settings. \n     Supported by public and private grants and funding, colleges \n     and schools of pharmacy are working with community-level \n     health care providers to improve patient safety, boost \n     immunization rates, increase patient compliance for \n     treatments associated with chronic illness, and through \n     health promotion activities, better the health and well being \n     of our nation.\n       Increasing the supply of pharmacists is not something that \n     can be accomplished overnight. We know that you face many \n     challenges and competing priorities during the 108th \n     congress. your support and leadership will help meet the \n     demand for the services of an exceptionally knowledgeable \n     health care professional and ensure future access. We \n     recommend you accomplish this by developing and passing \n     legislation that will assist the nations' colleges and \n     schools of pharmacy to increase their educational capacity.\n       Thank you for your continued support of pharmacy education \n     and the pharmacy profession, and for your efforts to improve \n     the health and well being of all Americans.\n       Academy of Managed Care Pharmacists (AMCP)\n       American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP)\n       American College of Apothecaries (ACA)\n       American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP)\n       American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA)\n       American Society of Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP)\n       American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (AHSP)\n       Healthcare Distribution Management Association (HDMA)\n       References: Oregon Health Workforce Project ``Pharmacist \n     Workforce 2002: A Sourcebook,'' December 2002; UNC Cecil G. \n     Sheps Center for Health Services Research ``The Pharmacist \n     Workforce in North Carolina,'' August 2002; Washington \n     Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\n     ``Health Care Personnel Shortage: Crisis or Opportunity,'' \n     2002; GAO-02-137R ``Supply of Health Workers''; Department of \n     Health and Human Services ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study \n     of the Supply and Demand for Pharmacists,'' December 2000; \n     The American Hospital Association, ``In Our Hands: How \n     Hospital Leaders Can Build A Thriving Workforce,'' April \n     2002; Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, \n     Occupational Employment Statistics.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill to address a \nsignificant problem in our Nation's healthcare delivery system--the \ngrowing shortage of pharmacists. I am joined by my distinguished \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in the introduction of the \nPharmacy Education Aid Act of 2003.\n  Why is the shortage of pharmacists in our Nation such an important \nconcern, and why is this legislation necessary? It is because \npharmacists are playing an increasingly important role in the delivery \nof quality healthcare, and our academic institutions are currently \nunable to supply the needed pharmacists. This critical link in our \nhealthcare system is being stretched precariously thin. In December \n2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, issued a report \nwhich confirmed the shortage of licensed pharmacists in this country.\n  I am particularly concerned about the shortage of pharmacists in \nrural and frontier areas like Wyoming. According to the HHS study, ``a \nthreat to the rural pharmacists supply has more dire implications since \nin many cases, the pharmacist may be the only available health \nprofessional.'' We must do more to increase the number of pharmacists \nserving rural areas.\n  As the HHS study highlighted, we must take action now to expand the \npipeline for licensed pharmacists. The Pharmacy Education Aid Act of \n2003 will do so by increasing the likelihood that an individual will \npursue an education as a pharmacist, that the pharmacy schools will be \nable to provide them with a quality education, and that pharmacists \nwill work in facilities having the hardest time recruiting them.\n  What does the shortage of pharmacists mean to many Americans? It \nmeans the closure of local pharmacies. It means a decrease in patient \ncounseling and education. It also means an increase in the potential \nfor medication errors.\n  What will the Pharmacy Education Aid Act mean to many Americans--\nparticularly those in medically underserved areas? It will mean \nrestoring a critical link in their access to quality pharmacy care. It \nalso will mean better healthcare overall.\n  Last year, the Senate passed this bill unanimously. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues this year on the speedy passage of this bill \nout of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and by \nthe Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Dodd, \n        and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 650. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nauthorize the Food and Drug Administration to require certain research \ninto drugs used in pediatric patients; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very \nimportant subject--one that affects parents, doctors, hospitals, nurses \nand our children each and every day. The subject that I am talking \nabout is the safety and efficacy of the medicines that doctors give our \nchildren when they are sick.\n  Nearly six years ago, I was astonished to learn that close to 80 \npercent of drugs on the market were not tested for use in children--\nyet, doctors were prescribing these drugs to our children. Doctors had \nno choice but to prescribe these drugs for children if they thought the \nmedicines would be helpful. And, sometimes the medicines did help--\nsometimes a child's pain was relieved, or a child would be able to \nbreathe easier or digest food better because of the medicines the \ndoctors prescribed them. But, even when the drugs do work, an anxious \nfeeling remains among doctors and parents about whether these medicines \nare safe for children. How are doctors and parents to know for certain \nwhich medicines will work if they haven't been tested for safety and \nefficacy in children?\n  There are many examples, of situations where drugs have been \nmisprescribed for children because doctors simply weren't aware of the \neffects these drugs would have on kids. For example, the drug, \nNeurontin, which is used to treat chronic pain, was given to children \nwithout being properly tested, and doctors eventually learned they were \nunder-dosing children by 50 percent. That means children were suffering \nfrom pain because they were being under-dosed. They weren't being given \nthe proper dose of medication to relieve their pain.\n  Another drug, Lithium, which has been prescribed to treat bipolar \ndisorder since 1940 was never tested for long-term use in children \nuntil just a few months ago. This is an example of a drug that doctors \nhave been prescribing ``off-label'' for years, and only now we are \nfinally getting some evidence of its effect in children. According to \ndoctors, the testing of Lithium revealed important information because \nchildren who suffer from bipolar disorder cycle between mania and \ndepression quicker than adults, and they can even have signs of both at \nthe same time. Unlike adults, they don't have periods of normalcy. \nDoctors now know that Lithium can be used to treat bipolar disorder in \nchildren.\n  Doctors have taken a chance in prescribing medicines for children. \nDoctors tell parents to cut a pill in half or in quarters so it can be \ngiven to a child. Doctors use the best information they have to \ndetermine how much or what kind of medicines to give a child. That is \nall they can do when the medicines children need have not been tested \nfor their use.\n  Doctors and pediatricians should not be left to guess how much \nmedicine our children should receive. And, parents shouldn't have to \nfeel anxious or question whether the half a pill that's been ground up \nand put in applesauce will still be effective in treating their child--\nor whether it's even safe for their child to take.\n  It's been over a year now since the Senate passed and the President \nsigned into law the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children's Act. As many of \nmy colleagues know, that law has been part of a solution--but just a \npart of a solution--to address the problem I just mentioned. The law \nprovides a six-month patent extension to pharmaceutical companies in \nexchange for the testing of medicines in children. And, for as long as \nthe bill has been law, the Food and Drug Administration is reporting \nits success in ensuring that more medicines are tested for use in \nchildren. With the incentive provided by Best Pharmaceuticals, \ncompanies are seeing the value of studying their drugs in children and \nare applying for the patent extension.\n  But, the Best Pharmaceuticals incentive cannot work alone to ensure \nthat medicines in children do not go untested. The incentive in the \nBest Act was never intended to work alone. When the Best Act became \nlaw, there was already a rule on the books that helped ensure that no \nmedicine used to treat children, including vaccines or other biologics, \nwould go untested. Back in 1997, the Food and Drug Administration \nproposed what is known today as the Pediatric Rule. The Pediatric Rule \nallowed FDA to require that the drugs the agency felt are important for \nchildren are safe, effective, and properly labeled for children.\n  Unfortunately, the Pediatric Rule has come under legal challenge, \nwith a District Court ruling just a few months ago stating that FDA \nlacked the statutory authority to require pediatric studies. This was a \ntroubling step backward for children's health--a troubling step at a \ntime when 75 percent of the medicines on the market still aren't tested \nand labeled for pediatric use. We've made some improvements from the 80 \npercent of medicines on the market, but 75 percent is still too much. \nWithout the Pediatric Rule, new medicines and biologics coming onto the \nmarket are not required to be tested for use in children. Congress \nneeds to make sure that the FDA continues to have every tool--that \nincludes the market incentives and the pediatric rule--available to \nthem to ensure that drugs for children are tested for safety and \nefficacy and that they are labeled properly.\n  Everyday that a drug manufacturer chooses not to participate in the \nincentive program, the number of medicines\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\nthat go untested for use in children increases. Everyday that we don't \nhave the Pediatric Rule, we sacrifice our children's safety. Medicines \nthat are used by children should be tested for safety and efficacy. \nThat is why Senators Clinton, Gregg, Dodd, and Kennedy and I are \nintroducing a bill today--the Pediatric Research Equity Act--that would \nensure that the Pediatric Rule continues to work alongside the Best \nAct, so that children will remain on safe footing when it comes to the \ntesting of the medications they use.\n\n  Congress needs to make sure the Pediatric Rule stays in place, \nbecause right now, the Pediatric Rule and the Best Act incentive work \ntogether to ensure that drugs are tested for use in children. As I said \nalready, the Best Act was never intended to substitute the rule, but \nrather to reinforce and work with the rule. For example, the Pediatric \nRule may be invoked in instances where pediatric information is \nessential, but the patent exclusivity is no longer available.\n  The Pediatric Rule also applies to biologics, whereas the Best \nPharmaceuticals does not. A significant portion of therapeutics used in \nchildren, including many cancer treatments, are biological products \n(products that include a live agent). Because Best Pharmaceuticals does \nnot apply to biologics, the Pediatric Rule is the only way to ensure \npediatric labeling.\n  Finally, the Best Pharmaceuticals is voluntary. For any number of \nreasons, including insufficient sales, a manufacturer may choose not to \nconduct the testing necessary to receive additional exclusivity under \nthe Best Act. But, just because a drug manufacturer chooses not to \nstudy the drug in children does not mean that drug is not critical to \nthe proper treatment of our children. Without the Pediatric Rule, there \nis no way to guarantee that a drug that is used in the pediatric \npopulation is tested for children's use.\n  With the establishment of the Pediatric Rule and the financial \nincentives of the Best Pharmaceuticals law, there has been a dramatic \nincrease in the number of studies that have been undertaken. Let me \nquote from the Government's Response to Plaintiff's Notice of \nReauthorization of FDA Modernization Act. This is the document that the \ngovernment filed to defend the lawsuit against the Rule: ``These two \noptions [the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric \nRule] have resulted in a number of drugs being labeled for use in \npediatric populations. As of March 31, 2002, 94 applications containing \ncomplete or partial pediatric use information had been submitted to the \nagency. Of these 94 applications, 45 are attributable to the statutory \nexclusivity provisions. FDA attributes 48 of the 94 applications to the \nauthority of the pediatric rule alone.''\n  The bill that my colleagues and I are introducing today would help \nmaintain that progress--not erode it. Our bill would provide the FDA \nwith the authority it needs to ensure that the medicines children take \nare studied for safety and efficacy. And, our bill would give FDA this \nauthority in a way so that it does not conflict with the incentives \nprovided in the Best Pharmaceuticals Act.\n  Our bill would preserve the waiver and deferral process, so that drug \ncompanies can get waivers or deferrals for a range of legitimate \nreasons. Drug companies could get a waiver or deferral of studies for \nsafety or ethical concerns. A drug company could get a waiver or \ndeferral if the pediatric testing would interfere with the drug's \navailability for adults.\n  Ultimately, though, our bill would help make certain that children \nare no longer a therapeutic afterthought by ensuring that all new drugs \nare studied for pediatric use at the time a drug comes to market. This \nwould put children on a level playing field with adults for the first \ntime. Our children deserve no less, and I encourage my colleagues to \njoin in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Trails System \n     Willing Seller Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In spite of commendable efforts by State and local \n     governments and private volunteer trail groups to develop, \n     operate, and maintain the national scenic and national \n     historic trails designated by Act of Congress in section 5(a) \n     of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1244(a)), the \n     rate of progress towards developing and completing the trails \n     is slower than anticipated.\n       (2) Nine of the twelve national scenic and historic trails \n     designated between 1978 and 1986 are subject to restrictions \n     totally excluding Federal authority for land acquisition \n     outside the exterior boundaries of any federally administered \n     area.\n       (3) To complete these nine trails as intended by Congress, \n     acquisition authority to secure necessary rights-of-way and \n     historic sites and segments, limited to acquisition from \n     willing sellers only, and specifically excluding the use of \n     condemnation, should be extended to the Secretary of the \n     Federal department administering these trails.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING MULTIJURISDICTIONAL \n                   AUTHORITY OVER THE NATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that in order to address \n     the problems involving multijurisdictional authority over the \n     National Trails System, the Secretary of the Federal \n     department with jurisdiction over a national scenic or \n     historic trail should--\n       (1) cooperate with appropriate officials of each State and \n     political subdivisions of each State in which the trail is \n     located and private persons with an interest in the trail to \n     pursue the development of the trail; and\n       (2) be granted sufficient authority to purchase lands and \n     interests in lands from willing sellers that are critical to \n     the completion of the trail.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE LANDS FROM WILLING SELLERS FOR \n                   CERTAIN TRAILS OF THE NATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Intent.--It is the intent of Congress that lands and \n     interests in lands for the nine components of the National \n     Trails System affected by the amendments made by subsection \n     (b) shall only be acquired by the Federal Government from \n     willing sellers.\n       (b) Limited Acquisition Authority.--\n       (1) Oregon national historic trail.--Paragraph (3) of \n     section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1244(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     sentence: ``No lands or interests therein outside the \n     exterior boundaries of any federally administered area may be \n     acquired by the Federal Government for the trail except with \n     the consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (2) Mormon pioneer national historic trail.--Paragraph (4) \n     of such section is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new sentence: ``No lands or interests therein outside the \n     exterior boundaries of any federally administered area may be \n     acquired by the Federal Government for the trail except with \n     the consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (3) Continental divide national scenic trail.--Paragraph \n     (5) of such section is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``No lands or interests therein \n     outside the exterior boundaries of any federally administered \n     area may be acquired by the Federal Government for the trail \n     except with the consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (4) Lewis and clark national historic trail.--Paragraph (6) \n     of such section is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new sentence: ``No lands or interests therein outside the \n     exterior boundaries of any federally administered area may be \n     acquired by the Federal Government for the trail except with \n     the consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (5) Iditarod national historic trail.--Paragraph (7) of \n     such section is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new sentence: ``No lands or interests therein outside the \n     exterior boundaries of any federally administered area may be \n     acquired by the Federal Government for the trail except with \n     the consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (6) North country national scenic trail.--Paragraph (8) of \n     such section is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new sentence: ``No lands or interests therein outside the \n     exterior boundaries of any federally administered area may be \n     acquired by the Federal Government for the trail except with \n     the consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (7) Ice age national scenic trail.--Paragraph (10) of such \n     section is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     sentence: ``No lands or interests therein outside the \n     exterior boundaries of any federally administered area may be \n     acquired by the Federal Government for the trail except with \n     the consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (8) Potomac heritage national scenic trail.--Paragraph (11) \n     of such section is amended in the fourth sentence by \n     inserting before the period the following: ``except with the \n     consent of the owner thereof.''.\n       (9) Nez perce national historic trail.--Paragraph (14) of \n     such section is amended in the fourth sentence by inserting \n     before the period the following: ``except with the consent of \n     the owner thereof.''.\n       (c) Protection for Willing Sellers.--Section 7 of the \n     National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1246) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(l) Protection for Willing Sellers.--If the Federal \n     Government fails to make payment in accordance with a \n     contract for the sale of land or an interest in land for one \n     of the national scenic or historic trails designated by \n     section 5(a), the seller may utilize any of the remedies \n     available to the seller under all applicable law, including \n     electing to void the sale.''.\n       (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 10(c) of the National \n     Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1249(c)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (1); and\n       (2) by striking ``(2) Except'' and inserting ``Except''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Chafee (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Warner, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bunning, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kerry, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 652. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nextend modifications to DSH allotments provided under the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Bob Graham, DeWine, Feinstein, Warner, Cantwell, Smith, \nClinton, Bunning, Rockefeller, Murray, Kennedy, Landrieu, Kerry, and \nHutchison in introducing the Access to Hospitals Act of 2003. This \nlegislation will freeze Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital, DSH, \nreductions at Fiscal Year 2002 levels, thereby eliminating the \nscheduled Fiscal Year 2003 drop-off in Federal Medicaid DSH funding. \nThis bill will also provide a growth rate adjustment to help compensate \nfor the increases in the cost of providing care to the most needy and \nindigent patients.\n  This legislation is necessary because the Medicaid DSH provision \nincluded in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and \nProtection Act of 2000, BIPA, expired on October 1, 2002. This \nprovision provided crucial, but temporary, relief from the deep \nreductions in State Medicaid allotments that were contained in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA. With the BIPA provision, Congress \nrecognized that the funding cuts in the BBA could severely undermine \nhealth care safety net services throughout our Nation. These payments \nhelp reimburse hospitals' costs of treating Medicaid patients, \nparticularly those with complex medical needs, and make it possible for \ncommunities to care for those who lack\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\nhealth coverage. At a time when our Nation's uninsured rate continues \nto climb above 40 million, it makes little sense to be reducing much \nneeded Medicaid DSH payments to safety net hospitals.\n  Hospitals in Rhode Island will absorb approximately $400 million in \nreductions as a result of changes made to the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms in the BBA. Nine out of fifteen hospitals in my State had \noperating loses in Fiscal Year 2002. After the BBA was enacted, it was \npredicted that cuts in Federal Medicare and Medicaid payments would \ncost hospitals in Rhode Island $220 million over five years; however, \nthis estimate has proven to be about $180 million off the mark. Every \nother State is experiencing similar problems. According to the American \nHospital Association, hospitals lost almost $10 million on Medicaid and \nuninsured patients in 2000. This translates into an estimated loss of \nmore than $42 million over five years. Clearly, more needs to be done \nto keep our vulnerable safety net hospitals from continuing on this \ndownward spiral.\n  This legislation represents a common-sense approach that will help \nprevent the further weakening of our Nation's safety net hospitals and \nthe long-term viability of our health care system.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 652\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nenhance the access of medicare beneficiaries who live in medically \nunderserved areas to critical primary and preventive health care \nbenefits, to improve the Medicare+Choice program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Medicare \nSafety Net Act of 2003.'' I am particularly pleased to introduce this \nbill with my good friend and colleague, Senator Bingaman. Last year we \nworked together on this bill, and I am confident that with the \nmodifications that we made to the legislation, we will be able to get \nit enacted into law.\n  This legislation will improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to \nprimary care services and preventative treatments by increasing access \nto Community Health Centers. Community Health Centers, also known as \nfederally qualified health centers, provide care to more than 1 million \nmedically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. In many cases, Community \nHealth Centers are the only source of primary and preventive services \nto which Medicare beneficiaries have access. This is especially true \nfor people living in America's rural medically underserved areas.\n  In Maine, nearly 20 percent of all Community Health Center patients \nare on Medicare, and this figure is expected to rise dramatically in \nthe coming years as 25 percent of health center patients will be aging \ninto Medicare in the upcoming decades.\n  Besides primary and preventive care services, Community Health \nCenters provide other crucial services to seniors and the disabled, \nincluding treatment of chronic diseases, like diabetes and \nhypertension, mental health services and prescribed medications. \nCommunity Health Centers also provide transportation services or \narrange for transportation that allows seniors to access health care in \nthe absence of public transportation or a personal vehicle. In short, \nCommunity Health Centers provide the ease of ``one-stop health care \nshopping,'' meaning that seniors, instead of moving from location to \nlocation to receive comprehensive primary health services, typically \ncan receive all of their essential primary care in one place.\n  The Medicare Safety Net Access Act makes four changes to the Medicare \nprogram to ensure that Community Health Centers can fully participate \nin the Medicare program and provide seniors with the vital services. \nEnsuring that Medicare pays its fair share is important to the \nstability of Community Health Centers. While one in five of all Health \nCenter patients in Maine are Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare \nrepresents only 17 percent of total Health Center revenues. For Health \nCenters to remain a viable part of the health care delivery system, we \nmust make changes.\n  Because Medicare currently does not reimburse health centers for the \nfull cost of providing many vital services, like mammograms, nutrition \nassistance, laboratory and x-rays, health centers must utilize federal \ngrant funding intended to serve the uninsured to cover these costs. \nThis bill will require that Medicare, like state Medicaid programs, \nallow health centers to provide all Medicare-covered ambulatory \nservices to Medicare beneficiaries in their communities.\n  Further, Community Health Centers face many challenges in their fight \nto remain in business and serve their communities. In rural communities \nthat have Community Health Centers, the health center physicians often \ncontinue treating patients when they enter long-term care facilities, \nsuch as a nursing home. And while Congress took steps to ensure that \nthe new SNF prospective payment system did not adversely affect this \nrelationship, it was not successful in identifying all of the services \nthat are provided. This bill will add health centers to the current \nlist of providers that can bill for services provided to patients in a \nhospital or nursing home.\n  Given the role that Health Centers play in serving low-income and \nuninsured members of the community, providers often are willing to \nestablish special arrangements with the Health Centers to provide \nadditional assistance to these clients. An example of this type of \narrangement is offering a reduced price for laboratory work for clients \nof a Community Health Center. However, under Federal anti-kickback laws \nthis and other arrangements could be deemed illegal. Given the \nimportance of developing community support for Health Centers and the \nneed to encourage private-public partnerships to ensure that community \nfinancial support exists to care for low-income and uninsured \nindividuals, this bill creates a safe harbor under the anti-kickback \nstatute.\n  The final step that this legislation takes to improve access to \nprimary and preventative services for Medicare beneficiaries is to \nensure that Medicare covers a Community Health Center's cost of \nproviding care to\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\nMedicare+Choice beneficiaries. While the federal government requires \nMedicare, under the traditional fee-for-service program, to reimburse \nhealth centers for their cost to deliver care to beneficiaries, the \nsame requirement does not exist for Medicare+Choice plans. This bill \nwould require Medicare, like the Medicaid program, to provide wrap-\naround payments covering the difference between the amount paid to the \nhealth center under the managed care arrangement and the amount the \nhealth center would have received under traditional Medicare.\n  By making these four straightforward changes, we will be able to \nenhance the care that all Medicare beneficiaries receive, especially \nthose living in underserved communities. And we will ensure that \nMedicare patients are not diluting federal funding intended to help the \n41 million Americans that were uninsured in 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S.J. Res. 11. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to equal rights for women \nand men; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Senators Murray, Cantwell, \nCorzine, Dayton, Dodd, Kerry, Lieberman, Schumer, Stabenow, Clinton, \nDurbin, Landrieu, Harkin, Feingold, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Feinstein, \nBoxer and I are re-introducing the Equal Rights Amendment to the \nConstitution. In doing so, we reaffirm our strong commitment to equal \nrights for men and women.\n  Adoption of the ERA is essential to guarantee that the freedoms \nprotected by our Constitution apply equally to men and women. From the \nbeginning of our history as a Nation, women have had to wage long and \ndifficult battles to win the rights that men possess automatically \nbecause they are male. In 1920, we amended the Constitution to \nguarantee women the right to vote, and we must do so again to eliminate \ndiscrimination against women. A constitutional amendment is necessary \nto do so, because existing statutory prohibitions against \ndiscrimination have clearly failed to give women the assurance of \nequality with men.\n  Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act in the \n1960s, discrimination against women continues to permeate the workforce \nand the vast majority of areas of the economy. Today, women earn less \nthan 75 cents for each dollar earned by men, and the gap is even \ngreater for women of color. In the year 2000, African American women \nearned just 64 percent of the earnings of white men, and Hispanic women \nearned only 52 percent. Women with college and professional degrees \nhave achieved advances in a number of professional and managerial \noccupations in recent years--yet more than 60 percent of working women \nare still clustered in a narrow range of traditionally female, \ntraditionally low-paying occupations, and female-headed households \ncontinue to dominate the bottom rungs of the economic ladder.\n  The routine discrimination that so many women so often face proves \nthat there is still a need for the ERA today. A bolder effort is \nclearly needed to enable Congress and the States to live up to our \ncommitment of full equality. The ERA alone cannot remedy all \ndiscrimination, but it will clearly strengthen the ongoing efforts of \nwomen across the country to obtain equal treatment.\n  We know from the failed ratification experiences of the past that \nachieving the ERA's adoption will not be easy. But its extraordinary \nsignificance requires us to continue the battle. I urge my colleagues \nto approve the ERA in this Congress, and join the battle for \nratification in the States. Women have waited long enough for full \nrecognition of their equal rights by the Constitution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 11\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1.
