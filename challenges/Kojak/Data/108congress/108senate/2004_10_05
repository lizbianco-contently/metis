Mr. President, this morning we will have a short period of \nmorning business until 9:45 a.m. At 9:45 we will proceed to the vote on \na motion to invoke cloture on the intelligence reform bill. If cloture \nis invoked, many of the pending amendments would fall as a result of a \ngermaneness requirement under rule XXII. It is then hoped we will \ncontinue to process those germane amendments as we move toward final \npassage of the bill. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked and we \ncan finish the bill either tonight or early tomorrow morning. The \ncloture rule, as Senators know, provides for a maximum of 30 hours. \nHopefully all the time may not be necessary. Over the course of the \nmorning, as various amendments are looked at, examined, and discussed, \nwe will have a much better feel as to when we can bring closure to the \nbill.\n  I remind everybody that upon conclusion of this legislation, the \nSenate will turn to the other arm of intelligence reform, and that is \nthe internal intelligence reform that has been put forth by our \ndistinguished majority and minority whips who have been working with a \ntask force of 22 Senators, appointed by Senator Daschle and myself, to \naddress this significant reform within our own body.\n  Our scheduling is compressed more and more as we move closer to \nFriday. It will take the cooperation of all Senators to finish our work \nbefore adjourning. We have these two important arms of intelligence \nreform that we will address. There is other legislation that is in \nconference right now and progress is being made on the FSC/ETI \nmanufacturing jobs bill. Of course, they will be meeting over the \ncourse of today as well. We have Homeland Security appropriations which \nis in conference, and I understand steady progress is being made.\n  Our goal is to adjourn on October 8, but all of this important \nbusiness must be addressed before then. A lot of people are asking, is \nOctober 8 firm? In my mind, October 8 is the goal for us to complete \nour business, and we can complete our business if we continue the very \ngood work by the managers on this bill, by the task force that is \noverseeing the development of the recommendations for our internal \nreform, and the conferences which I mentioned.\n  I thank Members for their cooperation, for working together in a \nbipartisan way on very important legislation, most of which addresses \nthe safety and security of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10381-6", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF THE ASSISTANT MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nmajority leader, I ordinarily don't speak for other Senators, but I \nthink I can speak for Senator McConnell. We appreciate very much the \nmajority leader and Senator Daschle's deliberateness in moving forward \non reform, not only of the intelligence community but also \ncongressional reform. It would be easy to put that aside, but I think \nit is important that we move forward as the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended. They have said quite clearly, you can't do one without the \nother.\n  What we have done, working with the other 20 members of the task \nforce, is come up with what political scientists say are some \nsignificant changes in the history of this body. I don't know if that \nis true or not, but there are some significant changes which would \ncreate a new Homeland Security authorizing committee that would not \nnecessitate the Secretary, as he has this year, appearing 164 times \nbefore different committees and subcommittees. Eighty-eight different \nsubcommittees and committees have jurisdiction over him. That is not \ngood. The new Homeland Security committee will take jurisdiction from \n10 different committees.\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\n  We also are creating, from the pattern given to us by the 9/11 \nCommission, a very strong Intelligence Committee. And in the \nappropriations process, we have a subcommittee there. I spoke last \nnight to Lee Hamilton, one of the cochairs. We have kept them advised \nas to everything we have done, and they are on board. They think what \nwe are doing is totally in keeping with their recommendations. We \nhaven't followed everything they wanted, but we have kept them advised \nalong the way. We have a very good product.\n  Again, Senator McConnell and I extend both to the majority leader and \nSenator Daschle our thanks for keeping your eyes on the prize and \nhaving us go forward, as difficult as it has been.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10382-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will speak within morning business.\n  As we move to adjourn at the end of this week, I fear we will lose \nsight of an important event which will take place at the end of the \n108th Congress. Because at the end of this session, the Senate press \ncorps will lose one of the most distinguished and accomplished members \nof that body.\n  After nearly 25 years of hallway stakeouts, quorum calls, late-night \nvotes, pressing deadlines, takeout food, the Washington Post Senate \nreporter Helen Dewar plans to leave her position when we adjourn sine \ndie. Before that happens, I believe it is appropriate to recognize \nHelen's outstanding career during which she has faithfully informed \nPost readers on the oftentimes complex and intricate actions of this \nbody.\n  Since 1980, Helen Dewar has covered every major Senate debate--from \nbudget battles and judicial nominations to the sweeping intelligence \nreforms we are making now. But Helen's special talent has been to bring \nclarity to the day-to-day operations of this body, the Senate. Helen \nDewar is known for being tough, persistent, inquisitive, and thorough. \nHelen's direct style of asking questions gets right to the heart of \nmatter. She never asks an important question just once; she asks until \nshe is satisfied she has gotten as much as she can.\n  Born and raised in Stockton, CA, Helen Dewar earned her undergraduate \ndegree in political science from Stanford University. Her first stint \nat the Post was filling paste pots for the then-Women's page. She left \nafter one week for a reporting job on the Northern Virginia Sun. she \nreturned to the Post in 1961 as a reporter and has worked steadily in \nthat role since.\n  When Helen was getting started in the newspaper business, women had \nto struggle to get entry level jobs. It was rare for women to win a job \ncovering politics at the Post back in the 1970s. Helen had to push hard \nto move from the ranks of the Metro staff to covering Jimmy carter's \n1976 campaign, and then to winning the coveted assignment covering the \nSenate.\n  Helen began covering the Senate in late 1979. When Ronald Reagan \nswept to victory over President Carter in 1980, the Republicans claimed \ncontrol of the Senate, and Helen was poised to cover a great story. As \nthe Senate reporter who was also responsible for following the budget, \nHelen wrote extensively about the Reagan revolution. She covered the \nbattle over President Reagan's 1981 tax cut and the Cold War military \nbuildup.\n  Helen has covered virtually every major story on the Hill during the \npast 20 years, from Reaganomics to Iran-contra, ethics investigations, \nthe fight over the Gulf War resolution, to the impeachment of President \nClinton. During election season, she covered Senate election battles \nand how they might impact national policy. Helen has reported on the \ncareer of seven Senate majority leaders, including Robert Byrd, Howard \nBaker, Bob Dole, George Mitchell, Tom Daschle, Trent Lott, and myself. \nThe hallmark of Helen's reporting has been fairness, integrity, clarity \nand scrupulous attention to detail.\n  Helen is regarded by her colleagues as the dean of the Congressional \nPress Corps. She intently focuses on detail and comes from the school \nof journalism where the story is more important than the journalist. \nThe hallways of the Capitol and Tuesday stakeouts will not seem the \nsame without her. I offer my warmest wishes to Helen Dewar in all her \nfuture endeavors. Her colleagues here on the Hill and in the Post \nnewsroom will miss her. But those who will feel her departure most \nacutely will be her thousands of readers who, for more than two \ndecades, have looked to her to provide a succinct, unvarnished account \nof the activities of their elected officials.\n  I yield the floor\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader in applauding \nthe remarkable career of Helen Dewar, the dean of the Senate press \ncorps.\n  As Senator Frist mentioned, Helen will be leaving her beat as the \nWashington Post's Senate correspondent at the end of this Congress. If \nI can borrow a phrase, not having Helen Dewar to kick us around anymore \nwill be a loss for the Senate and for America.\n  Helen Dewar is a dogged reporter and graceful writer, and those gifts \nare rare enough, but she has possessed an even rarer gift. From the day \nshe started the Senate beat, she has always known that you cannot \nunderstand the Senate just by walking these marbled Halls and making \nphone calls from a desk in the Capitol; you have to go out into America \nand talk to the people.\n  I recently came across what may be the first story Helen ever wrote \nfrom South Dakota. The date was July 2, 1980. It was a story about the \ncentennial celebration of Arlington, SD, population 953. The headline \nread: ``Celebrating 100 Years Against the Odds.''\n  Helen described the town's parade as 2 miles long, ``considerably \nlonger than the town itself.'' She recounted people's complaints--farm \nprices were too low and gas prices were too high.\n  Mostly, she captured the incredible pride people in Arlington felt \nfor their community. ``The pride was so intense,'' she wrote, ``that a \nvisitor from Washington, offering Arlingtonians a chance to sound off \nabout government and politics, was told to forget all about that \nunpleasantness, grab a plate of barbeque and simply enjoy Arlington.''\n  Helen Dewar is a Washington institution, but she has never worn \nbeltway blinders. For nearly 25 years, she has worked long, hard hours \nin the Senate, and when the Senate recesses, she has crisscrossed \nAmerica to get the story--to explain to reporters what their Government \nis doing and why.\n  She is a reporter's reporter--tough, persistent, perceptive, and \nalways fair. She has earned the respect of her colleagues, her sources, \nand her readers.\n  She has served American democracy well by helping to hold our \nGovernment accountable and to give the people the information and \nknowledge they need to make informed decisions about their Government.\n  After nearly 25 years covering this body, Helen is part of the \ninstitutional memory of the Senate. More than that, she is part of the \nheart of this place. It is a privilege and a pleasure to work with \nHelen, and I know we all wish her well in all her future endeavors.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10382-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10382-S10384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, for the past several days, I have \nfollowed the remarks of the senior Senator from Massachusetts relative \nto Iraq and the war on terrorism. He likes to talk more about yesterday \nand not as much about tomorrow. He finds fault in everything that the \nPresident and his team have done to protect our lives, our liberties, \nand our way of life. He interprets facts to fit his dismal view of \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S10383]]\n\n  What bothers me the most about his many public statements condemning \nthe war in Iraq is that he does so while we still have troops engaged \nin securing that country. These troops know it is vital--absolutely \nvital--for the long-term security of the United States and our allies \nthat they succeed in helping Iraq become a free and democratic country.\n  The most recent edition of the Army Times newspaper contains a very \ntelling survey of Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard troops on \ntheir views of Iraq and the Presidential race which bears out this \npoint. This is the October 11th edition of the Army Times.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article, which appears beginning on \npage 14, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         [From the Army Times]\n\n                              The Military\n\n                         (By Gordon Trowbridge)\n\n       President Bush retains overwhelming support among the \n     military's professional core despite a troubled mission in \n     Iraq and an opponent who is a decorated combat veteran, a \n     Military Times survey of more than 4,000 readers indicates.\n       Bush leads Democratic Sen. John Kerry 73 percent to 18 \n     percent in the voluntary survey of 4,165 active-duty, \n     National Guard and reserve subscribers to Army Times, Navy \n     Times, Marine Corps Times and Air Force Times.\n       Though the results of the Military Times 2004 Election \n     Survey are not representative of the opinions of the military \n     as a whole, they are a disappointment to Democrats who hoped \n     Kerry's record and doubts about Bush would give their \n     candidate an opening in a traditionally Republican group with \n     tremendous symbolic value in a closely contested election.\n       ``For a long time, Kerry thought he had a chance to win the \n     mantle and beat Bush on the issue of who could be the better \n     commander in chief,'' said Peter Feaver, a political science \n     professor at Duke University who has written extensively on \n     civil-military relations and the political opinions of those \n     in uniform.\n       Feaver said journalists and political analyst focus heavily \n     on the opinions of military members because of a situation \n     the nation hasn't faced in more than 30 years: a heated \n     presidential race amid a difficult and controversial war.\n       While the survey found some readers with doubts about \n     Bush's handling of the war in Iraq, there was remarkable \n     consistency in their views of the two candidates.\n       Officers and enlisted troops, active-duty members and \n     reservists, those who have served in combat zones and those \n     who haven't, all supported Bush by large margins. And the \n     survey hints that Kerry's emphasis of his decorated service \n     in Vietnam may have done more harm than good with those in \n     uniform.\n\n\n                           ``from the heart''\n\n       ``It's about honesty and integrity,'' said Marine Sgt. \n     Jason Jester, who was interviewed separately from the survey.\n       Jester, a recruiter from Winston-Salem, N.C., voted for \n     Bush in 2000 and plans to do so again.\n       ``He might not always make the right decisions, but I think \n     the decisions he makes come from the heart.''\n       To conduct the survey, Military Times e-mailed more than \n     31,000 subscribers Sept. 15. They were invited to access an \n     Internet site seeking their opinions on the presidential race \n     and related issues. From Sept. 21 to 28, and before the first \n     presidential debate on Sept. 30, a total of 2,754 active-duty \n     and 1,411 reserve and Guard members took part.\n       The nature of the survey led experts to caution against \n     reading the results as representative of the military as a \n     whole.\n       Unlike most public opinion polls, the Military Times survey \n     did not randomly select those to question. Instead, \n     subscribers with e-mail addresses on file were sent an \n     invitation. That means there is no statistical margin of \n     error for the survey--so it's impossible to calculate how \n     accurately the results reflect the views of Military Times \n     readers.\n       The surveyed group is older, higher in rank and more \n     career-oriented than the military as a whole. Junior enlisted \n     troops in particular are underrepresented in the group that \n     responded.\n       But as a snapshot of the careerist core of the armed \n     services, the survey holds little good news for Kerry, \n     revealing a group with strong Republican leanings that the \n     Democratic challenger has not shaken. Among the findings:\n       Echoing previous Military Times polls and other research, \n     the survey found a group with a close affinity for the \n     Republican Party. About 60 percent of those surveyed \n     identified themselves as Republicans, while 13 percent \n     consider themselves Democrats and 20 percent independents. \n     Among the general population, pollsters usually find voters \n     evenly divided among Republicans, Democrats and independents.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the caption is: ``Troops sound off. Who \ndo you choose for President and why?''\n  Among Active-Duty forces, 66 percent in this poll said the most \nimportant issue for them in deciding for whom to vote is the war in \nIraq. In the same poll, 60 percent said they approve of the way \nPresident Bush is handling the situation in Iraq, and 72 percent said \nif the Presidential election were held today, they would vote for \nPresident Bush. That is quite a statement of support for the Commander \nin Chief and his policies in Iraq from those who are actually doing the \nfighting and the dirty work to bring security and prosperity to that \ncountry.\n  Even more significant are the results from the Reserve and National \nGuard troops who have been called to active duty and deployed to Iraq. \nAmong this group, 72 percent said the most important issue for them is \nthe war in Iraq; 63 percent approve of the President's policies in \nIraq; and a full 76 percent of the Reserve and National Guard soldiers \nwho have actually been deployed to a combat zone said they are planning \non voting for President Bush. These are amazing figures from both our \nActive Duty and Reserve Forces that tell us much more about what is \ngoing on in Iraq than just the reports of the bombings and kidnaping.\n  Listening to the assessments from my colleague from Massachusetts \nbegs the question: Why do the vast majority of our soldiers and marines \nengaged in ground operations in Iraq appreciate the importance of our \nmission there and believe they are engaged in a historical struggle \nthat will lead to a better world and a safer America when a senior \nSenator cannot see the same thing? Are they right or is he right?\n  As I reflect on the words of the Senator from Massachusetts, I am \nreminded of that famous quotation made by McLandburgh Wilson:\n\n       Twixt the optimist and pessimist,\n       The difference is droll:\n       The optimist sees the doughnut,\n       But the pessimist sees the hole.\n\n  When it comes to Iraq and the war on terrorism, my colleague from \nMassachusetts sees the hole, when he should be seeing the doughnut.\n  I suspect that nothing we say in this Chamber will change his views \non the issue. Nevertheless, I feel obligated to make some remarks about \nwhy our troops are fighting in Iraq, and why some are giving the \nultimate sacrifice for our country. It is important for our troops and \ntheir families to know that not all Senators only see the ``hole.''\n  Our policy in Iraq should not be viewed in isolation. The issue is \nfar more complex than that. It is important to understand the linkage \nbetween the Islamic terrorists who want to destroy us and the \ntotalitarian regimes under which so many of them were raised. People \nwho have such a deranged view of a Supreme Being that they believe \ntheir religion sanctions their own suicide, while killing innocent \npeople, and do not come from free, open, and democratic countries and \nsocieties.\n  Let me explain how I look at Iraq and the war on terrorism. If we \nlook at each incident individually, each bombing, each hostage taking, \neach killing, et cetera, we get one impression of these events. What we \nshould do instead is put ourselves in the place of an eagle soaring \nhigh and looking down on everything that is going on inside of Iraq.\n  When we take the eagle's view, this is what we see: Iraq is no longer \na sanctuary for terrorists, it is no longer a country that threatens \nits neighbors, and it is no longer a threat to world peace and order.\n  The insurgency in Iraq is confined to 3 of the 18 provinces, and the \ncountry is preparing for its first democratic election only 4 months \nfrom now.\n  Iraqi leaders, Iraqi soldiers, and Iraqi policemen are stepping \nforward in the thousands to take back their country from the \nterrorists.\n\n  All we have to do to see what progress is being made in this area is \nto look at the success we have had just over this weekend. It was not \njust American troops who had success in Samarra, one of the most \nviolent places inside of Iraq; it was the now-trained Iraqi security \npolice who fought side by side with the American troops, who received \nthe praise of the American troops for the training, preparation, and \nthe great job they did in not just helping secure the peace but driving \nthe insurgents out of that town and providing a safer and more secure\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\ncommunity in which the people could live.\n  America, along with many other countries, remains firm and will not \nbe deterred from achieving the goal of seeing a democracy in Iraq.\n  There is a realistic understanding of the difficulties and dangers in \nIraq, but there are also visionary, optimistic leaders in Iraq and in \nthe many countries that make up the multinational force who are \ndetermined to see the insurgency fail.\n  There have been many references to the July 2004 National \nIntelligence Estimate, or the NIE. In fact, Senator Kennedy said in \nthis Chamber on 29 September 2004 that the best case scenario in that \nNIE was that violence in Iraq would continue at current levels, with \ntenuous political and economic stability. Regardless of what this \nclassified NIE actually said, I do know it was based on information \nthat is but a snapshot in time and that time continues to move on.\n  There are many things visible today that were not clear when that NIE \nwas written. The character of the Iraqi leadership was unknown last \nJune, but no one who heard Prime Minister Allawi speak to the Joint \nSession of Congress recently could be anything but impressed with his \nenthusiasm, his intellect, and, most importantly, his determination to \nsee a free and safe and democratic Iraq.\n  Lieutenant General Petraeus has been working assiduously to build up \nthe Iraqi security forces. Last June, when the NIE was written, very \nfew of those forces had completed their training. Now trained and \ncompetent Iraqi Army and police units are on duty and are assuming the \nmajor role in restoring security in their own country, and the training \ncontinues, so we can expect even more Iraqi security forces to assume \ntheir duties every month, just as they did in Samarra this past \nweekend.\n  We are engaged in an enormous struggle of historic proportions to see \nfreedom and democracy spread throughout the Islamic world, and this \nwill set the foundation for a final peaceful solution between Israel \nand Palestine. It will also, in the long term, eliminate the \npolitically oppressive environment and poor economic conditions that \nhave been the breeding grounds for terrorists to find new recruits.\n  I want to say to our military personnel and their families that your \nrole in this historic and important struggle is the key to its success. \nYou will look back with pride on your contributions and your sacrifices \nto make our country and the world safer. When you see what you have \naccomplished from an eagle's view, you will not see the hole that a \npessimist sees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding morning business, it now be in order to consider \namendments to the pending intelligence reform bill, and for the \ninformation of all Senators, these are amendments that have been \ncleared on both sides. This will only take a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I intended to speak for 1 \nminute before the time had expired for morning business. Will the \nSenator yield for just one brief comment?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this bill came to the floor on September \n27. It was debated a few hours, the 28th and 29th similarly. On the \n30th, it was debated about half a day. Yesterday, we started business \non the bill sometime around noon. Today, we are voting cloture on the \nseventh calendar day, but probably less than 3 days of debate. I think \nthis rush is unbecoming of the Senate.\n  I shall oppose cloture, and I want the record to show I do not think \nthis subject, reform of the intelligence community, has ever taken such \na short period of time. We are acting under pressure primarily from two \nmen whose business was through when they filed their report. I am \nappalled that we are moving at this pace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment goes to the heart of our \ndebate over the structure and purpose of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity. My amendment addresses the allocation of resources at \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.\n  Much of our attention has focused on the creation of a new, \nindependent office to oversee our intelligence activities. Often lost \nin this debate are the details about many of the smaller, lesser known \nFederal agencies whose efforts are essential to our national security.\n  Even though many people don't know who they are, OFAC is one of our \nmost powerful weapons in the war on terrorism, because it is charged \nwith tracking down and identifying the international sources of \nterrorist financing.\n  Unfortunately, OFAC is also tasked with administration of the Cuba \ntravel ban. As we all know, U.S. policy toward Cuba is a highly \nemotional and divisive issue. Still, I would doubt that anyone \nseriously thinks that travel by Americans to Cuba poses a larger or \nmore serious threat to U.S. interests than al-Qaida or the insurgents \nin Iraq, or Syria, Iran or North Korea.\n  My colleagues might be surprised and disturbed, then, to learn that--\nat the direction of the State Department--OFAC diverts more of its \npersonnel resources to imposition of the Cuba travel ban than to any \nother country or project-specific issue.\n  According to their records, the equivalent of 21 full-time OFAC \nemployees are allocated to the Cuba travel ban. On the other hand, only \n16 are allocated to the search al-Qaida's financial sources of support.\n  Less than 15 full-time employee resources are spent on the former \nIraq regime and its insurgents, and less than 14 are spent on Iran. \nLess than 10 are allocated to Syria, Sudan, and Libya combined. \nAfghanistan doesn't even merit one full-time employee--it receives the \nattention of roughly 2/3 of one full-time OFAC employee. North Korea \nonly gets \\1/3\\.\n  In other words, more OFAC personnel resources are spent on the effort \nto prevent Americans from vacationing in Cuba than are spent to track \ndown and shut off the sources of funds used by al-Qaida to carry out \nterrorist activities.\n  This is an appalling diversion of our resources. If we hope to defeat \nthe disparate threats arrayed against U.S. interests--both here at home \nand abroad--we must dedicate our attention to the real dangers \nconfronting us around the world. Wisely allocating our resources will \nbetter ensure our success.\n  The amendment I offer addresses this imbalance by requiring an annual \nreport from OFAC on how it allocates its resources and the criteria it \nuses to make those resource decisions. It also outlines criteria that \nought to be considered when prioritizing the threats posed by different \ncountries and groups. Among these criteria are the likelihood that a \ncountry or organization is: planning or sponsoring a direct attack on \nU.S. interests; participating in a nuclear, biological, or chemical \nweapons development program; financing or allowing the financing of \nterrorists; or providing a safe haven to terrorists.\n  Colleagues, this is an issue of the highest importance. My amendment \nsimply asks for common sense in the allocation of our limited \nresources. We cannot expect to win the war on terrorism if we refuse to \ndedicate our full and focused efforts to fighting it. In this time of \ncrisis, the American people expect us to lead with vision and clarity. \nMy amendment offers this.\n  I see no credible reason why OFAC should waste precious resources \ncreating bureaucratic red tape for Montana producers who just want to \nnegotiate legal agricultural sales to Cuba. Instead, OFAC should focus \nits resources where they are more urgently needed: on shutting down the \nfinancial networks of al-Qaida and other more serious threats to U.S. \ninterests. That is why the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee \nsupports this amendment, and that is why the American Farm Bureau \nFederation and the National Foreign Trade Council support this \namendment.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman, the chairwoman and ranking member managing this bill, and \ntheir staff, for all of their hard work on the Baucus-Roberts-Craig \namendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized. \nThere is no further time remaining on the majority side. The minority \nhas until 9:40 a.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10388-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10388-S10389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IMPROVED NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about an \nimportant bill that I hope we can pass before the Congress leaves town \nand adjourns this year. That is the IMPACT bill, of which Senator Frist \nis the prime sponsor. I have cosponsored it and various other Senators \nhave also cosponsored it.\n  This is a bill that passed the Senate. It is awaiting action by the \nHouse. I wanted today to come to the floor and urge the House to bring \nup that bill and pass it so it can be sent to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Just last week, the Institute of Medicine released a report on \nchildhood obesity. It is a report that I requested in 2001. The report \nindicates that the prevention of obesity in children and youth needs to \nbe a national public health priority.\n  Obesity-associated annual hospital costs for children and youth have \nmore than tripled in two decades to $127 billion. In adults, national \nexpenditures associated with overweight and obesity in adults ranges \nfrom $98 billion to $129 billion annually. The report calls on the \ngovernment, industry, media, health care professionals, the nonprofit \norganizations, State and local educational authorities, schools, \nparents, and families to take immediate steps to confront this \nepidemic. And the IMPACT bill I have referred to will address many of \nthose issues.\n  The bill is of critical importance. It tries to focus attention on \nthese issues. There are a variety of provisions in the bill that I \nthink are extremely important. It will direct us toward finding \nsolutions, first, by preparing the health care community to deal with \nobesity in terms of prevention, diagnosis, and intervention by adding \nobesity, overweight, and eating disorders to the list of priority \nconditions to be addressed in the health professions title VII training \ngrants.\n  Second, IMPACT supports community-based solutions to increase \nphysical activity and improve nutrition on a number of levels. It \nprovides funding for demonstration projects in communities and schools \nand health care organizations and other qualified entities that promote \nfitness or healthy nutrition.\n  It authorizes the Centers for Disease Control to collect fitness and \nenergy fitness expenditure information from children.\n  It directs the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to review \nany new information related to obesity trends among various \nsubpopulations, and includes such information in its health disparities \nreport.\n  It allows States to use their preventive services block grant funds \nfor community education on nutrition and increased physical activity. \nAnd it instructs the Secretary to report on what research has been done \nin this area of obesity.\n  There are a variety of other provisions in the bill. The legislation \nis an excellent first step in the fight to improve health. It is not \nthe only step we need to take, but it is a first step.\n  We also need to assist our schools in providing healthy nutrition \noptions and expanding physical activity programs. We need to grow the \nworkforce such that people have access to the health care professions \nthey need to prevent, diagnose, and treat obesity, and we need to \nensure that Medicare and Medicaid provide the services necessary to \nhelp people prevent obesity and its complications.\n  These are not small goals, but they are critical to our Nation's \nhealth, both today and in the future.\n  I want to continue working with Senator Frist and other colleagues in \nthe Senate to find new ways to address\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\nthese goals, but before Congress adjourns this year we need to go ahead \nand call on the House to pass the legislation we have passed in the \nSenate. This is an important step and one that should not be delayed \nuntil the convening of a new Congress. I hope the House of \nRepresentatives will bring this legislation up quickly, will pass it, \nwill send it to the President, and we can begin down the road of \ndealing with this serious problem that afflicts so many of our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 9 minutes 22 seconds remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10389-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10389-S10390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the debate last week between Senator Kerry \nand President Bush marked a milestone in this campaign. Some 65 million \nAmericans tuned in to this debate, which is an extraordinary number, \nmore than tune in to such popular television shows as the Oscars. \nCertainly, we believe that Presidential debates serve that audience \neven more.\n  It was an important debate because it signaled the beginning of the \nreal campaign. Despite all the time, effort, and money, it appears that \na large group of American voters are waiting to these closing weeks, \nlistening closely to the candidates, to make the decision about how \nthey will vote on November 2, one of the most historic elections we \nhave witnessed in recent times.\n  The debate come Friday night is going to be equally, if not more, \nimportant. We will move from the critical issue of national security \nand foreign policy to issues of great importance related to the \ndomestic situation in America: How are things going for America's \nindividuals and families and businesses?\n  We believe, as we look at the record, that the choice is going to be \nvery clear. We will use the same matrix, the same measure President \nRonald Reagan used when he ran for President, when he asked very \nbluntly: Are you better off today than you were 4 years ago?\n  When it comes to the domestic issues, we believe there is a \ncompelling case and a compelling argument that America is not better \noff today than it was 4 years ago when President George W. Bush was \nsworn in. The numbers speak for themselves. This President will have \nlost more jobs as President than any President in the history of the \nUnited States since Herbert Hoover.\n\n  I have to explain for those not old enough that Herbert Hoover's \nPresidency was a disaster. It was the Great Depression. America saw \nmore suffering from families and businesses in that period of time than \nat any time in that whole era, and now we have a President who came to \noffice, George Bush, saying, give me a chance with my economic policy, \nand by every objective standard the President's economic policies have \nfailed. They have failed to create jobs. We have seen an exodus of \ngood-paying jobs. In my State, 160,000 manufacturing jobs have been \nlost. Some have been replaced, but virtually every single replacement \njob pays less, offers fewer, if any, benefits, and families find \nthemselves falling behind.\n  Look at the national numbers. Consider what has happened. We have \nseen median household income across America decline by 3.4 percent \nunder President Bush. That means the earning power of American families \nhas gone down under Bush's economic policies while the costs of living \nhave gone up. Gasoline prices are up 22 percent over when the President \nwas elected, college tuition at public 4-year institutions up 28 \npercent, and family health care premiums up 45 percent. This is a back-\nbreaking statistic because individual families cannot afford to go \nwithout health care insurance protection, and yet the cost goes up \nevery year. It becomes increasingly expensive and less coverage is \noffered.\n  What has the Bush administration done to help working families deal \nwith these increased costs of living? Virtually nothing. They have \noffered tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, with the blind \nfaith that if the richest people in America are given more money, \nsomehow working Americans and middle-income Americans will prosper. It \nhas failed. It has not worked. The debate on Friday night will focus on \nthat.\n  President Bush will be held accountable not just for the situation in \nIraq and the standing of the United States in the world but in terms of \nwhat he has done or failed to do for families. Listen to what has \nhappened since President Bush has taken office: 1.6 million private \nsector jobs have been lost; 5.2 million more Americans have no health \ninsurance. Since President Bush has been President, 5 million Americans \nhave lost their health insurance, and 4.3 million Americans have \ndescended into poverty. They were above the poverty line when President \nBush came in. His economic policies have driven them below.\n  Household debt has risen $2.3 billion as families borrow more money \nto try to keep up with the costs. Personal bankruptcies have hit a \nrecord high. The S 500 has dropped 15 percent, decimating retirement \nsavings of families across the board. The No Child Left Behind Program \nhas not been funded, shortchanged by billions of dollars. There has \nbeen $500 billion taken out of the Social Security trust fund, and keep \nthis in mind: When President Bush took office, we had a $236 billion \nsurplus. Today, we have a $422 billion deficit. In fact, some argue, \nincluding my colleague from Illinois, that it is almost $700 billion \nwhen the Social Security trust fund that has been raided is added in.\n  This President, a so-called fiscal conservative, has driven us more \ndeeply in debt than any President in our history, has lost more jobs \nthan any President in 70 years. How will he answer the most basic \nquestion: Is America better off today than it was 4 years ago? By every \nobjective measurable standard, when it comes to the comfort and hope of \nAmerican families, the Bush administration has failed time and time \nagain. They have a foreign policy which has put us in a situation in \nIraq with no end in sight. They have an economic policy giving tax cuts \nto wealthy people, which has no sensitivity to the struggles working \nfamilies are facing.\n\n  So how are the constituents of President Bush doing, what he calls \nhis base, the wealthiest people in America? Pretty well. HMO profits \nare up 84 percent, CEO compensation up 20 percent, corporate profits up \n15.3 percent. They are doing great on Wall Street but not too great on \nMain Street, and that is what the issue is going to be in St. Louis at \nWashington University on Friday night when Senator Kerry faces \nPresident Bush in a townhall meeting, where families from across the \nMidwest can ask the questions on their mind. These are the questions \nthey will ask because they reflect the reality of family life in \nAmerica.\n  The President promised us compassionate conservatism. He has failed \nwhen it comes to conservatism, as we have record historic deficits. He \nhas certainly failed when it comes to compassion, as he has not \naddressed the most basic issues: making certain families have good \njobs, that they have health insurance to cover them in times of need, \nthat they can afford the college tuition so their kids can have a \nbetter life than they have had. These are the issues we are going to \nface.\n  What will we do in the Senate after we have considered this important \nbill on intelligence? We will go to a tax bill which is now in \nconference, which is larded up with some of the worst special interest \nfavors we have seen in the history of this Senate. That is the best \nthis Republican-led Senate can do, is come up with that kind of a bill \nat the end to give away literally tens of billions of dollars in a \ndeficit economy to special interest groups again in Washington.\n  What will we do in this tax bill to help working families and small \nbusinesses pay for health insurance? Absolutely nothing. What will we \ndo to stop good-paying jobs, manufacturing jobs, from being outsourced \nto other countries? Scarcely anything. Very little. It\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\nshows where the Republican priorities are on Capitol Hill and where the \nRepublican priorities are in the White House, and it shows the clear \nchoice that American voters are going to face on November 2.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, in a very few minutes we come to a very \nimportant vote before this body, a vote that in many ways brings to a \nhead the debate that has been on the floor the last week and a half to \nthe last almost 2 weeks, a debate that focuses on the safety and \nsecurity of the American people. This is a debate that does encompass a \nmajor reorganization to make our intelligence activities more \nefficient, more effective. The vote we will be taking in a few minutes \nis a product of us filing cloture at the end of last week to give focus \nto the debate.\n  I stand before you as majority leader to encourage our colleagues to \nvote for cloture. That means germane amendments will be considered. The \namendments that have been introduced, that are pending, that are \ngermane, will still be considered, can still be voted upon. In fact, \ngermane amendments also that are brought to the floor can still be \nvoted upon.\n  What it does mean is that over the next 30 hours we have a huge task \nand that task is to bring to closure and ultimately to a vote on this \nbill. It can be as long as 30 hours of debate but hopefully it will be \nmuch less than that. So I urge my colleagues to vote with the managers, \nwith the leadership in the Senate for cloture on this very important \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I join the majority leader in our enthusiastic support \nfor the vote we will soon cast. I hope colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will take this important step. This is an opportunity to make a \nstatement about our determination, on a bipartisan basis, to move this \nlegislation forward.\n  Senators have come forth with a lot of good ideas. I respect them. I \nappreciate the quality of the debate that we have had. It has been a \nvery good debate. But now comes a time when I think we need to limit \nfurther amendments to those which are very relevant to the legislation, \ngermane, and that is what this vote will do. Three commissions have \nmade recommendations that are reflected in the legislative work that is \nbefore us today. Now is our opportunity to build upon that commission \nwork, to build upon what the committee has done so diligently, and to \nwork together to move this legislative vehicle along to accommodate the \nschedule we have here in the Senate, as well as the recognition that we \nstill have to work with our House counterparts to resolve whatever \noutstanding differences there may be with them.\n  This is an important vote. I hope, as I say, that we can speak with \none voice with regard to completing our work and moving on to the \nsecond phase of our 9/11 response, which is the legislative \nreorganization. I join with the leader and express the hope we can have \na resounding vote on cloture this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will not vote to invoke cloture on the \nNational Intelligence reform bill at this time.\n  This legislation reforming the intelligence agencies of our \nGovernment is a critical step in strengthening our national defense and \nour homeland security. If this cloture vote succeeds, it will \nprematurely cut off debate and prevent relevant amendments which could \nimprove this legislation from being considered by the Senate. There are \nabout 57 amendments currently pending before the Senate on this bill \nand perhaps half will be prevented from even being considered if \ncloture is invoked.\n  This is far-reaching and complex legislation which reorganizes the \nbasic elements of our intelligence community. We cannot afford to get \nit wrong or we will end up making us less secure. We owe it to our \nconstituents and the Nation, if necessary, to stay a few days longer in \nWashington and finish the job right. Frustrating the right of Senators \nto offer relevant amendments aimed at improving this legislation is \nunwise.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, finally, what to expect over the course \nof the day. The cloture vote will occur here in a couple of minutes. We \nstrongly encourage votes for cloture. You heard the Democratic leader \nand myself, and you have heard the managers also make the strong case \nfor cloture.\n  Immediately, amendments will be considered that are germane. The \nfocus, hopefully, will be on amendments that have been introduced that \nare germane, so I encourage those proponents to come forward and talk \nto the managers immediately. The clock does start ticking as soon as \nthis vote is completed. With that, we have a limited amount of time so \nwe need aggressively to start addressing this, amendment by amendment, \non the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10390-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to consider sequentially the Feinstein amendment, No. 3718, and \nthe Gregg amendment, No. 3934, both as modified with changes that are \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3718, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, my comments are related to amendment \nNo. 3718, as modified, which the chairman said is at the desk. I will \nnot have to ask for the amendment to be modified. This amendment has \nbeen previously debated. I have spoken on the floor twice about it. It \nwas set aside at my request.\n  The amendment clarifies the relationship of the FBI to the new \nnational intelligence director. It ensures that national intelligence \nprograms include the FBI's intelligence activities. I had hoped that \nthe amendment could be disposed of yesterday, but apparently that could \nnot happen and, thus, the amendment is before us today.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman, Collins, Roberts, and Gregg, all of whose \nstaff worked hard to improve the original amendment. The result is, in \nessence, a compromise that accomplishes our fundamental goal, which is \nto ensure that the intelligence functions of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation are both reorganized and, secondly, effective and \ncoordinated in the intelligence community.\n  The original amendment has been modified to that effect. It is my \nunderstanding that the amendment, as modified, is acceptable to both \nsides.\n\n[[Page S10392]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia for her amendment. She has worked very closely with Senator \nLieberman and me, as well as with the Judiciary Committee and Senator \nGregg.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment is a good one. It strengthens the bill. \nIt underscores her commitment to making the FBI as effective as \npossible in the war against terrorism. I thank the Senator for her \nleadership, and I urge adoption of her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I also thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her persistence, both on the substance of this amendment \nand in the vagaries and twists and turns of the legislative process.\n  This is an important amendment. In some sense, it strengthens, \nratifies, and makes statutory some of the very constructive changes \nthat have been occurring at the FBI, by establishing a directorate of \nintelligence within the FBI that is based on the existing Office of \nIntelligence there.\n  The amendment also modifies the definition of national intelligence \nunder the bill, in order to make clear that national intelligence \nprograms within the FBI will be included within the national \nintelligence program. So there will be no more of the division between \nforeign and domestic, and no more of the division between the FBI and \nCIA, which occurred so heartbreakingly and infuriatingly before \nSeptember 11. We are all going to be together in the national \nintelligence program under the national intelligence director, \nprotecting the safety of the American people.\n  This amendment increases substantially the probability that we can \ndeter the terrorist enemy by knowing where they are before they strike \nus. I thank the Senator for her leadership, and I support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3718), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, is on his way to the floor to speak \nbriefly on his amendment.\n  While we are awaiting his arrival, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3710\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I call up for consideration amendment \nNo. 3710.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  Mr. REID. What was the request, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is seeking to call up amendment \nNo. 3710. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3710.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Unified combatant command for military intelligence.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I call up this amendment with the \nintention of withdrawing it. We had discussions with the chairman of \nthe committee, along with the ranking member. While we feel this is a \nsignificantly important amendment, we are still a ways from coming to \nan agreement relative to the substance of it.\n  Basically, in today's intelligence community, there are 15 agencies \nwithin the Federal Government that have some jurisdiction and some \ninvolvement. Eight of those 15 agencies are located within the \nDepartment of Defense. We have our three combat support agencies--the \nNational Security Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, \nand the National Reconnaissance Office--all of which have been \ndiscussed very liberally within this debate. We also have the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, as well as every one of the four service branches \nwith an intelligence division.\n  Under the current setup--and the setup that will be in place after \nthe passage of the intelligence reform bill, as it is now on the \nfloor--all eight of those agencies report to the Secretary of Defense \nand they will report in a dual capacity to the Secretary of Defense and \nthe National Intelligence Director.\n  Senator Nelson, who has been a very strong cohort and cosponsor of \nthis amendment, and I strongly believe that what we need to do to \nimprove the effectiveness and the communication in the intelligence \ncommunity relevant to the Department of Defense is to combine all eight \nof those intelligence agencies under one combatant commander, create a \nnew combatant commander that is at the four-star level and require all \neight of these agencies to report to that one four-star general so that \nthe Secretary of Defense and the national intelligence director have \none person to go to when it comes to the collection, analysis, and \ndissemination of intelligence from a Department of Defense perspective.\n  Having been involved in this for the last 4 years, both in my last 2 \nyears on the House side and 2 years now on the Senate side, I know how \ncomplex the intelligence world is and how many overlaps there are \nbetween the civilian side and the Defense Department side and how \nabsolutely necessary it is that we have an ongoing line of \ncommunication between the military and civilian departments and \nagencies that are involved in the collection, analysis, and \ndissemination of intelligence and the sharing of that information at \ndifferent levels and across various agencies.\n  For the Secretary of Defense to have eight people report to him and \nfor the new National Intelligence Director to have eight people report \nto him, when we could have one person reporting to both of those two on \nissues relating to military intelligence, seems almost commonsensical \nthat we reduce those eight down to one if we are going to provide a \nmore efficient, a more effective intelligence line of communication.\n  That is the substance of our amendment. While I understand there is \nsome objection forthcoming to the inclusion of the amendment, Senator \nNelson and I wanted to offer it, we want to debate it, and we want to \nmake sure this entire body knows we are going to come back next year \nwhen we have a little different forum within which to operate to offer \nthis amendment again as a stand-alone bill and see it to its \nconclusion.\n  I close by saying that there is some objection from the Department of \nDefense on amendment 3710. While they are not publicly objecting, if \nthey were asked, they would say they would rather not have a unified \ncombatant command for intelligence because they want to have the \nflexibility of doing it the way they want to do it.\n  Several years ago, we had a similar situation relative to the \nconsolidation of special operations when this body took the lead and \ntold the Department of Defense: We are going to create a new \nunified combatant command for special forces, or SOCOM; we are going to \ncreate a four-star commander and consolidate all special operations \nunder SOCOM and that one combatant commander.\n\n  The Defense Department resisted that, but today they will tell you at \nthe Pentagon that it is one of the best things we have ever done. It \nwas this body that initiated it. Senator Nelson and I think the same \nthing should apply in the area of intelligence. While I will withdraw \nthe amendment, we both wanted to stress that a unified combatant \ncommand for military intelligence will be equally important for \ninforming the National Intelligence Director of military intelligence \nrequirements as it will be for assigning military intelligence \ncapabilities to assist in fulfilling the National Intelligence \nDirector's intelligence responsibilities.\n  I yield to my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank my colleague for the \nopportunity to join with him to support this bipartisan legislation \nwhich we will be working to get passed in January.\n  As my colleague said, the new command will be a functional rather \nthan a regional command, just like the U.S. Strategic Command in my \nState of Nebraska, and the U.S. Special Operations Command in Florida, \nthe U.S. Joint Forces Command in Virginia, and U.S. Transportation \nCommand in Illinois.\n  As stated, the goal of this new command will be to organize the eight \ncombat support intelligence elements within the Department of Defense \nunder a single military commander. These elements will include bringing \ntogether what are often referred to as the alphabet agencies. Most \npeople know them more by their initials than they do by the actual \nnames. But it will bring together the DIA, or the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, the National Security Agency, the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the Army, \nNavy, Air Force, and Marine intelligence offices. All total, these \noffices employ thousands with budgets in the billions.\n  Eighty percent of all intelligence gathered by the U.S. Government is \nused by our armed services, and the ability to rapidly disseminate this \ninformation, as well as share the information, often means the \ndifference between success and failure in the field. This new combatant \ncommander will streamline the flow of information from our combat \nsupport elements to the warfighter, an important part, an important \nrole for this agency.\n  The responsibility of the military intelligence commander will \ninclude intelligence collection and analysis in response to requests \nfrom the national\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\nintelligence director. As we know, this past week we all heard a great \ndeal about whether it should be a NID, national intelligence director, \nor a NIC, whether it should be about directing or coordinating. This \ncommander will act as the single entry point for the NID to assign \nmilitary intelligence capabilities, and will strengthen the \ncoordination of those efforts.\n  This will strengthen coordination between the NID and the Department \nof Defense because without one central contact inside DOD who can \nmanage the military intelligence capabilities of the Department, it \nwill be an extraordinary challenge for somebody outside DOD, such as \nthe NID, to proficiently administer eight separate military \nintelligence assets.\n  This new command will prepare and submit to the Secretary of Defense \nand the NID recommendations and budget proposals for military \nintelligence forces and activities. Additionally, the commander will \nestablish priorities for military intelligence that coincide with \nnational priorities established by the NID and approved by the \nPresident. The commander will also ensure interoperability of \nintelligence sharing within the Department of Defense and within the \nintelligence community as a whole, as directed by the NID.\n  The commander will answer to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the Secretary of Defense, and the President, and will represent \nthe Department of Defense in the intelligence community under the NID.\n  I realize some of my colleagues may be asking the question whether \nthis new position will add yet another layer to military intelligence-\ngathering agencies, but consider the fact that no military coordinator \ncurrently exists. So I do not see this as another layer; I view it as a \nnecessary position that DOD has been far too long without.\n  Perhaps if the commander for military intelligence already existed, \nthen discovering how command was severed at Abu Ghraib might have been \neasier. The tragedy there likely would not have been prevented \nentirely, but there certainly would have been more direct lines of \naccountability with a combatant commander for military intelligence.\n  This is an opportunity for us to debate the issue at this time, but \nthe opportunity to pass it after the first of the year will be one that \nI think we must, in fact, take up. It will improve coordination and \nwill not undermine the direction of the national intelligence director, \nbut it will, in fact, help harmonize in the sharing of intelligence \nthroughout the entire military and intelligence community.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for the opportunity to participate, \nand I congratulate the chairman of the committee and the ranking member \nfor doing an outstanding job in reforming our intelligence-gathering \nagencies' operations.\n  It is not an easy task. We think this could be a part of it, but \nrather than have any effect in slowing down the operation of what we \nare doing today, we think we can take this up at another time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his always keen \ninsight into the problem that exists and why this amendment would help \nwith the solution to that problem. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith him when we get back in the next session of Congress.\n  I also thank the chairman for her effort to try to figure out some \ncompromise relevant to this particular issue. Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman have been very cooperative, and it is not for a lack \nof effort on their part that we are not able to come to some compromise \non this issue, but we look forward to continuing the dialogue and \nworking with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3710 Withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia and \nthe Senator from Nebraska for their contributions to this debate. They \nhave raised an important issue. It is, as they have recognized, a \ndifficult and controversial issue, and I am very grateful to both of \nthem for being willing to raise the issue but not press forward with \ntheir amendment at this time. I look forward to continuing to work with \nboth of them. Both of them are leaders in military and intelligence \nmatters, and I very much respect their judgment and their knowledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I join Senator Collins in thanking \nour colleagues from Georgia and Nebraska for a very thoughtful and \nsubstantial idea that is not going to be possible to act on in this \nbill, but I thank them for the question they have raised. I think they \nare heading in the right direction, and I look forward to working with \nthem.\n  We have two choices. The four of us could work together on the Armed \nServices Committee or we could continue to work through the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, but in either case, as Senator Collins \nhas said, Senator Chambliss and Senator Ben Nelson are leaders in the \nSenate on matters of national security and just in the best tradition \nof our Government and our Congress, which is not always honored, moving \nin a totally bipartisan, nonpartisan way. I thank them for that and \nlook forward to seeing this to fruition someday soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3934, as Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we now \nturn to Gregg amendment No. 3934, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3934, as modified\n\n       On page 121, line 13, strike ``and analysts'' and insert \n     ``, analysts, and related personnel''.\n       On page 121, line 17, strike ``and analysts'' and insert \n     ``, analysts, and related personnel''.\n       On page 121, line 19, strike ``and analysts'' and insert \n     ``, analysts, and related personnel''.\n       On page 123, beginning on line 8, strike ``, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget, modify the'' and insert ``establish a''.\n       On page 123, line 11, strike ``in order to organize the \n     budget according to'' and insert ``to reflect''.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3934), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3933\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to thank the managers of this \nbill for their hard work and perseverance in trying to get the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission passed and their accommodation \nof many Members with various amendments. Obviously they have been \nworking long before this time period, through the August recess and \nsince we have come back, and now we are pushing towards the final \nstages.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for including a provision in the \nbill, a Cantwell-Sessions amendment dealing with the Visa Waiver \nProgram and closing a loophole that I call the Ressam loophole. That is \na loophole that allowed a terrorist to go from Algiers to France to \nCanada and then load up his car with explosives and head to the U.S.-\nCanadian border at the State of Washington with plans to set off those \nexplosives, potentially, at LAX Airport or perhaps somewhere along the \nway of the west corridor.\n  What the amendment did was to basically say to those who are our \npartner countries that the United States wants to make sure that people \ncoming into our country on visas meet certain biometric standards so we \nknow who people are. If we actually knew Mr. Ressam's true identity \nwhen he left France to go to Canada, he would have been stopped at the \nCanadian border. He could have been stopped earlier in the process if \nwe actually knew who this individual was.\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\n  So what this Cantwell-Sessions amendment did, and, again, I thank the \nmanagers for adding it, was to help us identify the types of \ntechnologies that we hope our partner visa waiver countries also adopt \nfor their biometrics on visas allowing people into their country.\n  To put it simply, our borders will only be as strong as our partner \ncountries' and as they adopt standards. The last thing we want to do in \nthe United States is to have a process by which we are more sure of \npeople we are giving visas to, only to have, then, individuals who are \nlooking for ways to get access to the United States to go to Mexico or \nCanada or France or Germany and then find their way to easy entry into \nthe United States by creating a new identity.\n  The estimates are that there are millions of passports that have been \nlost or stolen and that individuals easily create new identities. But \nif our partner countries in the Visa Waiver Program, such as Mexico, \nFrance, Germany, also create biometric on their visas for people coming \ninto their countries, we will have a safer process of understanding and \nstopping terrorists at their point of origin as opposed to continuing \nto allow them to travel around the globe, creating new identities or \npossibly getting easy access to our neighboring countries and then \neasily sneaking across U.S. borders.\n  I thank the managers for their hard work and diligence on this issue \nand for working to accommodate so many Members on what are very \nchallenging issues. We have done great work on making our borders more \nsecure since 9/11. We have put resources there. We have tightened our \nprograms. We have worked on the US VISIT implementation. But we need to \ncontinue to understand that our security will only be as good as the \nsecurity of our partner nations, working in this battle to fight \nterrorism around the globe. I very much appreciate the managers being \nincluded in that.\n  If I could say, I am also pleased that the conference report on the \nJOBS bill is moving. It seems to be progressing. While we are working \nto finish up this 9/11 report and finish up the legislation that \nimplements it, I am hopeful we will be successful in passing the FSC/\nETI conference report before we leave for this recess that is scheduled \nfor this Friday. That is very important legislation to help companies \nthat want a level playing field on the trade front, helping large \ncompanies in my State or exporters such as Boeing and Microsoft--there \nare many more--to get a level playing field.\n  There is also tax fairness in this JOBS bill for Washingtonians and \nseven other States that have not been able to deduct their sales tax \nfrom the Federal income tax. I am glad to see that recision is in the \nbill. I hope we can move forward this week to give the fairness back to \nthose States that have been unjustly penalized on that for about the \nlast 18 years. While this 9/11 legislation is moving through, I hope we \nare also successful in moving the JOBS bill through and that we can \ncontinue to work diligently on that process.\n  As I see no other Members who are ready to offer amendments, I will \nsay one more word of thanks to the incredibly hard work that is going \non in the State of Washington by the U.S. Geological Survey. Many \npeople realize that there is an imminent eruption of Mount St. Helens \nabout to take place. We have seen the ash and steam of several smaller \nevents occur in the last several days. But because of the investment \nthis country has made in the Department Interior and the U.S. \nGeological Survey, we have so much more information at hand today.\n  In 1980, we heard the final cry of a U.S. Geological Survey worker \nwho said, ``Vancouver, Vancouver, this is it.'' Then he ended up losing \nhis life to the explosion, as did 57 other residents of the Northwest. \nThe impact of that volcanic explosion was so significant it impacted \nvarious cities such as Yakima and Vancouver.\n\n  Today, because seismologists, geologists, meteorologists, and \nvulcanologists also have been working together, we have much more data \nand we have been able to advise the larger community on the hazards we \nare facing with another eruption of Mount St. Helens. I thank the men \nand women who are doing terrific work in informing all of us so we can \nmake great plans, so that aviation, transportation, and the health and \nsecurity of the emergency management system can do their jobs, because \nwe have good science and information.\n  I thank the managers of this bill for their hard work and \nperseverance on an issue that many times during this debate didn't seem \nto be very decisive, as Members have many different ideas about how we \napproach terrorism and what our country needs to do to harden our \ntargets and to improve our intelligence operation. But I want to thank \nthe diligence of these Members because they are doing the work to \nunderstand the details of this legislation. They have been doing that \nwork for the summer while we were out on recess, and what they did is \nwork to understand these amendments in detail. I appreciate their \nadoption of the Cantwell-Sessions amendment, which I do believe will \nhelp us not only make U.S. borders more secure but make our partner \ncountries' borders more secure and stop terrorism at the point of \norigin. I thank the managers for their help and support for the passage \nof this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, let me thank the Senator from \nWashington for her kind words about Senator Collins and me, but really \nmuch more than that, for having an excellent idea here which will \nmeasurably increase the security of the American people.\n  Our borders are more secure than they were on September 10, 2001, but \nthey are not secure enough. We don't want to discourage people from \ncoming to the United States for business or pleasure, but to protect \nourselves we have to ask not only of ourselves but of other countries \nthat they begin to use the technology available to identify those who \nare coming to our country, not for business or pleasure but to do us \nharm. This amendment will move us forward on that.\n  Senator Cantwell has been--I think I heard her use the word \n``perseverance'' with regard to the chairman and myself. She has been \nthe model of perseverance because she really believes in this. In the \ntwists and turns of the legislative process where individuals can \nregister objections, the Senator from Washington was here late last \nnight and early this morning. The result is that ultimately all the \nobjections faded away because this is a great idea. It was adopted.\n  I thank her very much and look forward to monitoring the \nimplementation of this as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Minnesota Twins\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will have more remarks on another \nmatter, but I wanted to start this morning by acknowledging yet another \nremarkable year by the Minnesota Twins.\n  Tonight, the Twins will be playing in the Major League Baseball \nplayoffs, and this marks the third year in a row that the Twins have \nmade the playoffs.\n  We follow the Twins in South Dakota because we have no team ourselves \nin the eastern part of the State. So the Twins have become very special \nto many South Dakotans as well.\n  I might remind my colleagues that this is the same small market \nMinnesota Twins team that was threatened not long ago with \n``contraction''--a euphemism cooked up by big city owners for shutting \ndown a team that generations of South Dakotans have come to call their \nown.\n  Tonight the Twins will face off against the New York Yankees, whose \nhuge payroll ensures that it is never a surprise when they make it to \nthe playoffs.\n  The Twins will pitch their ace, YO-han Santana--who also happens to \nbe a leading contender for the Cy Young award. His dominance is in many \nways a symbol of what has made the Twins so solid.\n  After being cast off by another team, he was brought up in the Twins \nsystem,\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nwhich rewards dedication and loyalty. And like so many of the Twins \nstars, he is a hard worker who leaves everything on the field.\n  It is no mistake that the Twins' strengths--dedication, loyalty and \nhard work--are the same traits that have made the Midwest strong.\n  So let me add my voice to those of thousands of Twins fans across \nSouth Dakota and Minnesota in saying to Grady and his boys, good luck. \nYou have made us proud, and we know you will continue to do so in the \ndays ahead.\n\n\n                            HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Congress, unfortunately, is going to miss \nmany important deadlines this year and many critical opportunities to \nhelp relieve the increasing economic squeeze on America's families. \nThis morning, I would like to talk about one of those missed \nopportunities, which is helping families pay for college.\n  We knew for 6 years that the Federal Higher Education Act would \nexpire on September 30. Despite that, the majority failed to set aside \ntime to reauthorize the law.\n  That leaves the Senate in the unfortunate position of having to \nsimply extend the current law--with no improvements, and no additional \nhelp for the millions of middle-class families in South Dakota and \nacross America who are struggling to put their sons and daughters \nthrough college.\n  Kim and Todd Dougherty are two of those parents. They live in \nChamberlain, SD. They have three children: two sons, ages 20 and 22, \nand a daughter who is a junior in high school. Todd is a salesman. Kim \nteaches second graders at a tribal school. Both of her parents were \nteachers, too. This is a family that believes in education.\n  The Dougherty's older son, Scott, started college at a small college \nin Minnesota 4 years ago but left after two semesters because of \nfrustration with a learning disability and came home to consider other \nschools and options.\n  Shortly after he returned home, Scott tore the ACL ligament in his \nknee. Unfortunately, he had let his health insurance lapse because he \ncouldn't pay his tuition and insurance premiums at the same time. His \nknee surgery cost him $12,000. After his surgery, he had to start \npaying back his student loans.\n  Today, Scott works as a cook in a restaurant. He pays $409 each month \ntowards his medical and student loan debts, and another $200 a month \nfor health insurance. That leaves him $75 a month for everything else. \nHe can't go back to college until he pays off a sizable portion of his \ndebts, and he worries that he can't get a better-paying job because he \nhas so much debt.\n  All across America, there are tens of thousands of families who are \nin situations similar to the Doughertys'--or soon could be.\n  They are hard-working, middle-class families in which parents have \nsaved for years to pay for their children's college educations. There \nis no margin for error in their family budgets. If one thing goes \nwrong--if a parent loses a job unexpectedly, or someone in the family \nhas a serious illness or accident--the debts start to pile up and \nsuddenly, college starts to feel unattainable. Middle-class parents \nwatch their dreams for their children's future start to slip away.\n  We need to do right by these families, and that means keeping the \ndoors of college open to all Americans, no matter what their family's \neconomic circumstances.\n  Unfortunately, we are moving in the opposite direction. This year, \nnearly a half-million Americans will be turned away from colleges \nstrictly for financial reasons. They can do the work, they just can't \nafford the tuition.\n  Since President Bush took office, the average tuition at a 4-year \npublic college has increased 28 percent; when this year's increases are \nreleased in about a month, that number is likely to climb to well over \n30 percent.\n  College costs are rising faster than inflation--faster than average \nfamily incomes--and much faster than increases in student financial \naid.\n  Every 2 years, a non-partisan group called the National Center for \nPublic Policy and Higher Education releases State-by-State report cards \non higher education. The report cards grade each State on six different \ncriteria. One is affordability: How large a share of their income do \nfamilies have to pay for college at a public 4-year college or \nuniversity?\n  Their latest report, released in early September, ought to concern us \nall. Thirty-seven States--including South Dakota--got an ``F'' for \naffordability. Thirty-seven of 50 States. Ten additional States \nreceived ``Ds,'' two States got ``Cs,'' and one State received a ``B.''\n  No State earned an ``A.'' Even in the best-performing States, we are \nlosing ground; college is less affordable today than it was a decade \nago. This is a serious national problem.\n  What is the response from the administration and congressional \nRepublicans? Silence. They failed to bring the Higher Education Act up \nfor reauthorization.\n  Their oversized tax cuts have eaten up Federal resources that we \ncould otherwise invest in higher education, and in basic research and \ninvestment.\n  The President's proposed budget for next year provides no new money \nfor the Perkins low-interest loan program, no new money for the College \nWork Study program, and the Supplemental Educational Opportunity \nGrants, and no money at all for the LEAP program--all of which help \nlower-income students pay for college.\n  Despite the President's campaign promise in 2000 to increase the \nmaximum Pell grant, his proposed budget for next year freezes Pell \ngrants for the third year in a row.\n  Even worse, the administration is once again proposing changes to the \neligibility rules that would reduce Pell grants by 270 million overall \nand cause 84,000 families to lose their Pell grants altogether.\n  I joined a bipartisan coalition of Senators to protect students and \nfamilies from these unwise changes last year--and we are determined to \nprevent these cuts again this year. Making it even harder for the sons \nand daughters of America's working families to afford college is the \nwrong direction for America.\n  The repeated attempts to cut Pell grants are part of a pattern by \nthis administration and the Republican leadership in this Congress to \ndeny educational opportunities.\n  Earlier this year, Democrats made a simple proposal: Let's help those \nAmericans whose jobs are being shipped to China or India attend a \ncommunity college, where they can learn new skills to get new jobs. The \nadministration said, flatly, ``no'' and shut the doors of college in \nthe faces of these Americans.\n  But we want to do right by America.\n  We support increasing the maximum Pell grant from $4,050 to $5,100--\nthe amount candidate Bush called for in 2000 but has never supported as \nPresident.\n  We support doubling the HOPE Scholarship tax credit from $1,500 per \nstudent to 3,000 per student, extending the deductibility of tuition \nexpenses, and making the education tax credits refundable for the \npoorest families. We support Senator Kerry's proposed $4,000-a-year \n``College Opportunity Tax Credit'' which would be refundable for low-\nincome families.\n  Instead of the cuts the President proposes for tribal colleges and \nthe minuscule increases he recommends for historically black colleges \nand universities, and Hispanic serving institutions, we support \nsignificantly increasing support for these minority-serving \ninstitutions because we believe diversity strengthens our democracy and \nour economy.\n  We believe in expanding the use of loan-forgiveness programs to \nreduce student debt while addressing crucial needs, such as placing \ndoctors and teachers in rural communities and inner cities.\n  We believe our brave National Guard and Reserve members in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who are facing the same bullets as full-time military \nmembers deserve the same education benefits. The National Guard Bill of \nRights provides that educational equity. We should pass an entire \nNational Guard Bill of Rights this year.\n  Over the course of a career, a person with a 2-year college degree \nwill earn an average of $400,000 more than a high school graduate. \nSomeone with a 4-year degree will earn $1 million more.\n  It is not just individuals who benefit when we open the doors of \ncollege to\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\nthe sons and daughters of working families. America's economic future \ndepends on our ability to develop the potential of all of our people.\n  A while back I read a story in the New York Times. The headline read, \n``U.S. Is Losing Its Dominance in the Sciences.''\n  The story said:\n\n       The United States has started to lose its worldwide \n     dominance in critical areas of science and innovation, \n     according to federal and private experts who point to strong \n     evidence like prizes awarded to Americans and the number of \n     papers in major professional journals.\n\n  Unless we reverse this decline and regain America's scientific and \ntechnological knowledge, our children will grow up in a less \nproductive, less prosperous America.\n  Keeping college affordable is a very personal issue for me. I was the \nfirst person in my family to go to college. I worked to pay for part of \nmy tuition, and I also had help from my parents. My mother went back to \nwork when I was in high school to help pay for my college education. \nEven with all of us pitching in, it was still not quite enough. As so \nmany others today, I joined the ROTC program and I spent 3 years in the \nAir Force after I graduated to pay back my loans.\n  I know what a difference it makes when America invests in the \nchildren of regular working people. I also know the pride a parent \nfeels watching his child receive a college degree. I have seen all \nthree of my own children graduate from college.\n  We believe every American deserves those same opportunities. We will \ncontinue to fight for them as we resolve these matters in the Senate \nand elsewhere throughout our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I commend and thank the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Maine, and the ranking \nmember, the Senator from Connecticut, because they have already \napproved and passed last evening an amendment I had offered which will \nbe very helpful as we try to meet this threat of terrorism.\n  Indeed, we have a watch list. Recent news stories say the watch list \nis not necessarily being implemented as it should by the Department of \nHomeland Security. Nevertheless, we try. That watch list has been \nspecifically targeted to commercial aviation.\n  The watch list needs to be expanded because there is plenty of \nopportunity of mischief, as I have said in this Chamber many times, \nwith regard to the securing of our seawater ports and, specifically, in \naddition to cargo, the cruise ship industry and the thousands of people \nwho vacation on a cruise ship.\n  This is particularly important to my State of Florida because we have \nthe three largest cruise ports in the world: the Port of Miami, Port \nCanavaral, and Port Everglades, all on the east coast of Florida and \nall of which have these gigantic cruise ships that sail to the great \ndelight of the passengers. These are cruises that are sometimes only a \nday but usually they are 4 to 7 days in duration. It is certainly a \nplace for a wonderful vacation for people to cruise to the Bahamas in \nthe midst of this floating hotel, a cruise ship.\n  Because there are several thousand people located in one place and \nthey are treated as passengers on an airline, checking their baggage \nand their persons for all kinds of weapons and other destructive \nmaterials, is it not logical that the watch list for avowed terrorists, \ngiven to commercial airline companies and to TSA, should not be \nadministered by TSA as they check the baggage of people on cruise \nships? The answer to that is common sense. Yes, it should be.\n  Because of the very professional manner in which the Chair and her \nranking member of this committee have handled this legislation, they \nunderstood that and they have agreed to the amendment. They were very \nkind to pass the amendment last night. I cannot imagine this would \nbecome an issue in the conference committee.\n  I give credit where credit is due, to the cruise industry. The cruise \nindustry recognizes the possibility for mischief. It makes sense. I \nthank the cruise industry for stepping up.\n  I am compelled to speak about two more matters not directly related \nto this but which are very timely in the consideration of the Senate.\n  Did the Senator from Maine have a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Would the Senator be willing to yield for two quick \nunanimous consent requests?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is the absolute least I can do for the \ngracious Senator from Maine who recognized the common sense of this \namendment. She, along with Senator Lieberman, have made it possible to \nbe accepted.\n  I certainly yield.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator for his cooperation and his \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in \nrecess from 12:30 to 2:15 today to accommodate the weekly party \nluncheons and that the time in recess be counted against the \npostcloture period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Hurricane Cleanup\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the leaders for the \ntremendous job they have done in handling this legislation. Anyone who \ncan pass legislation in such a contentious atmosphere has to be Merlin, \nthe Magician. My hat is off to the Senator from Maine and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Two other very timely topics, timely in the sense of an emergency, \nafter having been hit by four hurricanes in Florida, with the \ntremendous debris that is left over, part of the moneys we have passed \nhere for FEMA is for debris cleanup of which FEMA then reimburses the \nlocal governments that go out and, either with their own crews or by \ncontracting out, arrange for the removal of debris. This is not only \nclearly getting one's life back in order but it is also a health \nquestion, a safety question.\n  I was going through some of this debris on Sunday at a mobile home \npark for senior citizens called Palm Bay Estates in my home county of \nBroward. All of the aluminum, particularly on carports, was whipped up \nand twisted by the wind and now is in piles, with razor-sharp edges. So \nit is a safety as well as a health question. The debris accumulates in \ncanals, in waters, in estuaries, particularly if it is of an organic \nnature. Then it starts to become a health hazard as well. We simply \nneed to have it picked up.\n\n  But that is not the question. FEMA is taking the position that they \nare not going to reimburse the local government unless it is picked up \nfrom a public right-of-way. Yet FEMA has the authority, if it involves \nthe health and safety of the people, to allow the repayment for the \npickup from private rights-of-way.\n  Why is that important in Florida? Because we have huge senior citizen \ncomplexes with thousands of senior citizens. But they are not public \nrights-of-way, they are private rights-of-way. That debris has to be \npicked up for health and safety reasons. Yet who is going to pay for \nit? FEMA has the authority to do that. Since the local governments are \nnot going to be able to bear the cost of all that pickup, especially \nafter four hurricanes, the only other alternative is to assess the \nresidents of that area for the pickup.\n  Senior citizens on fixed income cannot afford that. FEMA has it under \nits authority, but FEMA is not doing it. We want to give them a little \nencouragement.\n  I have spoken to the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee. That bill is now in conference with the House. I have \nsuggested some language that will give FEMA some help to recognize that \nthis is in the public interest, particularly in the State of Florida, \nafter four hurricanes, and that they should be so directed. I am \nhopeful the conferees will accept that language.\n\n\n                     Voter Registration in Florida\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the last item I want to talk \nabout is of grave concern. Yesterday was the final day for voter \nregistration in the State of Florida. As one can imagine, there were \nhuge lines at all of the registration points in Florida's 67 counties. \nBut there is a subtle administrative order that could be directing \nextreme mischief in denying people the right to vote; for a directive, \naccording to the supervisor of elections in one of our counties--\nspecifically in Volusia--has come out from the secretary of\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\nState's office, division of elections, in the capital city of \nTallahassee, that says if any piece of information on this Florida \nvoter registration form is missing, this voter registration is to be \ntreated as null and void.\n  Why am I concerned about that? Because they specifically say in the \ndirective that if the box on line 2 that states, ``Are you a U.S. \ncitizen?'' is not checked yes, they are to discard it, when in fact the \noath that is signed specifically states, ``I do solemnly swear or \naffirm that I am a U.S. citizen. I am a legal resident of Florida.'' \nAnd the voter registration applicant signs that form.\n  This is a clear intent--hopefully, not an intent--it is a clear \nmanifestation of disenfranchising people, of not allowing them the \nright to vote, if on a technicality, because on line 2 they have not \nchecked the box of being a U.S. citizen, but on line 17 have sworn \nunder oath that they are a U.S. citizen, they are saying that they are \ngoing to discount the voter's registration application.\n  I hope we don't have to go to court again. I hope we don't have to do \nwhat CNN did, go to court to strike down a law that said they were \ngoing to strike 48,000 convicted felons but would not release that to \nthe public so that the public could see if those names were accurate. \nAnd lo and behold, when the Miami Herald got hold of the list, they \nfound over 2,000 who were legitimate registered voters and not \nconvicted felons.\n\n  Why do we have to keep going back to the courts to enforce this when \nwhat is at stake is the right of people to vote, which is absolutely a \npart of the constitutional foundation of this country?\n  The people should have the confidence and the knowledge that if they \nare eligible, they will be able to register and then, if registered to \nvote, that they will have the right to vote and to have that vote \ncounted as they intended.\n  We are only about 4 weeks away from an election. I don't want to see \na repeat in Florida of what happened 4 years ago when there was so much \ndissension and uncertainty. The whole electoral process has to work. It \nis important that it works for the sake of our democracy. A good place \nfor us to start is for the secretary of State's office, the division of \nelections of the State of Florida, to stop issuing such edicts and \ndirectives to the election supervisors in Florida's 67 counties that \nwould cause a voter trying to register to be thrown out on a silly \nomission, which is covered by their solemn oath.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 3739 and 3750, Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendments \nNos. 3739 and 3750 be withdrawn. These are amendments that had been \noffered by Senator Roberts previously. He has asked that I withdraw \nthem on his behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Points of Order, En Bloc\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it now be in \norder to raise points of order, en bloc against the following \namendments in that they are not germane under the provisions of rule \nXXII. They are the following amendments: 3887, 3888, 3889, 3890, 3891, \n3892, 3893, 3894, 3808, 3849, 3782, 3905, 3747, 3881, 3724, 3928, 3873, \n3871, 3870, 3803, 3930, 3931, 3874, 3850, 3851, 3855, 3856, 3872, 3926, \nand 3819.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to raising the points of \norder?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I announce that this will allow us to officially \nconsider the remaining germane amendments. The nongermane amendments, \nas determined last week, will fall under this order. We will continue \nto work through the pending amendments that remain at the desk as we \nmove toward completing this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection. I want to ask \nSenator Collins, through you, my staff thought the Senator from Maine \nmay have inadvertently read 3908 as 3808. Just to clarify, it is 3908.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would not be surprised.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Their ears are much better than mine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the list be corrected to \nindicate the correct number is 3908.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair sustains the points of order, en bloc. The amendments fall.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to discuss the situation in \nIraq.\n  Every day we see the terrible news about innocent Iraqis being \nkilled, about the terrible tension in the country, about our young \npeople being attacked and killed and, frankly, the mess we are \nwitnessing, which is painful to see.\n  It came home today in a stark recitation, in a statement by Paul \nBremer.\n  Paul Bremer was sent to Iraq to be in charge of the transition as we \ntried to go from the culmination of what appeared to be the end of the \nviolence until we got to a government that was going to be run by \nIraqis on an interim basis and the vote coming up in January. But what \nwe heard from Mr. Bremer was painful to hear, and it has to be \nparticularly painful to President Bush and his administration. What he \nsaid was there were not enough troops to do their job. We believed that \nfrom the beginning. General Shinseki said it, and he was overruled by \nthe Pentagon and by the Defense Secretary. He was fired for saying: We \nneed more troops to do the job, Mr. President.\n  People across the country understand that we need more people. Over \n300,000 I believe was the number he used. He now says that and the \nfailure to immediately stop the looting, stop the violence, and stop \nthe response from those who would commit violence on the country were \npart of the reasons we are in this terrible situation we are in.\n  Last week, we finally had a chance to hear what President Bush's \nplans for Iraq were. And this is the image of what we got. It is blank. \nIt says nothing. There is no plan.\n  Last Thursday, we heard repetition from President Bush, the same \ntired slogans we have heard for almost 2 years now, no plan was \narticulated, no new ideas, nothing, just the same as we see on this \nplacard. President Bush basically said that we are going to get more of \nthe same in Iraq. What a terrible condition that is. Iraq has become an \nabsolute crisis, and there is no plan to fix the situation.\n  When the President asked Senator John Kerry what his plan is, it adds \ninsult to injury. He has a plan. He talked about his plan. But the \nPresident has offered nothing on his side and challenges John Kerry to \nhave a plan, and John Kerry presents a plan and the President doesn't \nshow any. The President is showing a stubbornness. He calls it \n``staying the course.'' It is a stubbornness that is costing American \nlives, the lives of our young people, the lives of our soldiers, and \nthe lives of American workers in Iraq.\n  We need a dramatic change in direction. Everything that was assumed \nto be in order was wrong. They were\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\nwrong about the weapons of mass destruction, and they were wrong about \nhow our troops would be greeted on the streets of Iraq. Certainly, as I \nsaid earlier, they were wrong about how many troops we needed to secure \nthe country. They were wrong about the reaction of the Shiites. They \nwere wrong about how long the conflict would last and the toll it would \ntake on Americans lives.\n  The President and his team have just about done it wrong. The \nPresident's worst adviser in terms of being wrong on almost everything \nis Vice President Cheney.\n  At the outset of the war in March of 2003, Vice President Cheney \ndeclared:\n\n       We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.\n\n  In fact, be greeted as liberators? In fact? I don't think so.\n  But maybe the reason Vice President Cheney kept getting things wrong \non the war is he has not ever seen it. He has never worn a uniform, and \nhe was never on a battlefield. In fact, when duty called, Vice \nPresident Cheney turned his back on the call while many answered the \ncall to serve. Dick Cheney took five student deferments in order to \navoid service in Vietnam.\n\n  He wasn't, however, the only member of the Bush team who kept getting \nit wrong. I want to review some of the quotes of President Bush's top \nadvisers. One is by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. He said on February 7, \n2003:\n\n       It is unknowable how long that conflict will last. It could \n     last 6 days, 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months.\n\n  It is one thing to be wrong one time but you try to correct the \nsituation.\n  Here is what Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said:\n\n       We know that there are ties between the Iraqi regime and a \n     whole range of terrorist groups, including al-Qaida, and we \n     know that Saddam has these weapons.\n\n  Again, what kind of a statement is that? It doesn't tell us anything \nexcept that we are wrong.\n  When we look at other statements that have been made, on March 30, \n2003, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n       The area in the south and the west and the north that \n     coalition forces control is substantial. It happens not to be \n     the area where weapons of mass destruction were dispersed. We \n     know where they were. They're in the area around Tikrit, and \n     Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat.\n\n  Each one of these statements indicates a lack of knowledge and a lack \nof understanding as to what was going to happen when this war was \nconcluded. It has not been concluded.\n  When we look at the cost of the war, as of today, 1,058 our troops \nhave died, some 7,000 injured, many with terrible injuries that will \nhandicap them all of their lives.\n  We need to change course. We don't need more of the same. Senator \nKerry, our colleague, is offering a new direction, and that is what we \nneed. We need to stop bearing the entire burden of Iraq. We are taking \n90 percent of the casualties, and the American taxpayers have shelled \nout almost $200 billion for Iraq. It is not right. It is not fair to \nthe American taxpayers. It is certainly not fair to the families whose \nyoung sons and daughters are in service over there. Senator Kerry \nprepared a plan for a new direction in Iraq, a direction that will \nbring other countries to the table.\n  President Bush makes reference to Poland helping us in Iraq. He was \nalmost obsessed with Poland during the debate.\n  What are the facts? Poland has 2,500 troops in Iraq, and they \nannounced just this week they are getting out. They will have all of \ntheir troops pulled out sometime next year. Thailand wants to take its \ntroops out--I think they have some 400 people there.\n  Again, under the administration's war plan, we are left with even \nmore of the burden, and we are left with almost all of the costs both \nin terms of our soldiers' lives and American taxpayer dollars. All that \nhas been accomplished in the last 2 years is we have alienated critical \nallies, and we are paying the price for that.\n  A big part of the problem is that the President refuses to accept \nreality.\n  Last week in a television interview President Bush was asked whether \nhe regrets the moment on the aircraft carrier on May 21st in 2003, the \ninfamous ``Mission accomplished'' speech. Incredibly, President Bush \nsaid he would do it all over again. In fact, in response to that \nquestion, would he have done it, he said he would ``absolutely'' do it \nagain. He went on to say, ``You bet I'd do it again.''\n  It is incredible. He made that speech approximately a year and a half \nago, saying, ``Mission accomplished.'' That meant it was over, that we \nwould not have to worry about things.\n  Instead, we have lost over 800 people, four or five times the number \nkilled during what was considered the active part of the war. We are \nmoving to the delusional. The President does not regret telling our \nNation's military families ``Mission accomplished''? He does not regret \ngiving families false hope that major combat operations had ended?\n  We are now facing the biggest fallout of reservists ever in the State \nof New Jersey. There are pictures in the paper of men and women, saying \nthey are scared; they are worried. Their families are frightened. Their \nkids are scared. Their spouses are scared. They know darn well it is \ndangerous over there.\n  Does the President regret taunting the terrorists and insurgents when \nhe said ``Bring 'em on''? I'm sure the men and women on the ground in \nIraq wish he had never said those words.\n  When I was wearing a uniform a long time ago, during World War II in \nEurope, I never wanted to see the enemy. I never wanted to see anyone \nwho was hostile.\n  It was the wrong thing to say. I hope one day we will be able to face \nup to the truth that these were terrible statements.\n  More recently, President Bush told the world that the war on terror \ncould not be won, but a couple days later he said, no, no, we will win. \nWhen the President was asked about a CIA report and the material he was \nlooking at on intelligence, he said he dismisses the CIA report as just \nguessing when they told him the situation in Iraq was bad and could get \nmuch worse. Just guessing? The arm of our intelligence corps that is \nsupposed to have the latest and the fullest data, and they are just \nguessing?\n  We need someone to take the bad news seriously, a President who will \nreact to it and fix the situation. So far, President Bush simply \nignored the bad news. I guess he hopes it goes away.\n  Unfortunately, he is inflexible on one simple point. He would repeat \nevery one of the mistakes he has made over the last few years. The plan \nto go to war without a real alliance in place, he would do again. The \ndecision to ignore the advice from General Shinseki that 300,000 troops \nwould be needed, he would ignore the general's advice again. The \nargument that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction to reconstitute a \nnuclear programs, links to al-Qaida, he would make all of those \narguments again.\n  All of this while ignoring, for all practical purposes, North Korea, \nIran, countries that are actually developing nuclear weapons, while \ntaking some of the attention away from the pursuit of Osama bin Laden \nwho killed 3,000 Americans.\n  Not only does the President like to stick with bad ideas but there \nare flip-flops when someone else suggested good ideas, often resisting \nand then supporting. One flip was the Department of Homeland support. \nPresident Bush strongly opposed creating it in March 2002. His \nspokesman said a Homeland Security Department ``doesn't solve \nanything.'' Then flopping 3 months later, the President said he did \nwant a Homeland Security Department.\n  President George Bush opposed creation of the 9/11 Commission. In \nApril of 2002, President Bush said he was against the creation of the \n9/11 Commission. He flopped after that as a result of increased \npolitical pressure. The President said he does support creating the 9/\n11 Commission in September of the same year. In April, no; In \nSeptember, yes. It goes on and on.\n  Then the President, in response to an inquiry about Osama bin Laden, \nwhich in September of 2001 President Bush said he wanted Osama bin \nLaden dead or alive. In March of 2002, President Bush said, I don't \nknow where he is; I truly am not that concerned about him.\n  Not concerned? He murdered 3,000 Americans, 700 of my constituents in \nNew Jersey. A terrible comment.\n  What we have seen shows we are on a very bad track right now. In \nfairness to the American people, families, those who are serving, we \nought to come forward with a statement about what we\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nintend to do. How much longer will we have to have people in harm's \nway? How are we going to get the troops that it is suggested are \nneeded--30,000 or 40,000? Where will they come from? Is there an \nintention to initiate a draft? I don't know where we are going to get \nthe soldiers and other service people to fill these obligations.\n  I know one thing. Every day we read about another American \nserviceperson being killed or American civilians being captured or \nbeheaded, it tells everyone in the country we are on the wrong path and \nwe have to make a change.\n  I hope President Bush, even in this interim period, can see the \nnecessity to come forward to the American people and say, look, we made \nsome errors; we are going to correct them. We are going to get more \npeople in there, but we are going to end this conflict by that time so \nwe can start to bring our people home. There is no encouragement out \nthere to believe that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10400-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity as the \nSenate resumes this afternoon's debate to rise in very strong support \nof the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Collins and Senator Joe Lieberman as \na cosponsor of this bill. It is an excellent bill, and I want to \nsupport my two colleagues, Senators Collins and Lieberman, for working \nso hard and to go at it in a way that is not only bipartisan but \nnonpartisan following the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  I am excited about this bill because I think it reforms our \nintelligence to be able to make sure that we prevent any more 9/11s \naffecting the United States; that we reform the intelligence so that we \nnever go to war again on dubious information; that we make the highest \nand best use of the talent in our intelligence agencies, and that they \nhave the framework to be able to protect the Nation, as well as be able \nto speak truth to power.\n  Mr. President, I am no stranger to reform. I am on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I came on the committee before 9/11 to be an advocate for \nreform, particularly in the area of signals intelligence. As I worked \non the committee and served on the joint inquiry about what occurred on \n9/11, I became deeply committed to other issues related to reform: to \nhave a national intelligence director, to create an inspector general, \nto mandate alternative or red team analysis, to always make sure that \nwe policymakers have the best information, and that our troops and our \nhomeland security officials get the best intelligence they need to be \nable to protect the Nation.\n  Following the 9/11 Commission report, but also with the wonderful \nwork of Senators Collins and Lieberman, we now have intelligence \nlegislation that will give us a single empowered leader for our \nintelligence community, a strong inspector general, and a definite \nalternative analysis to make sure that all views are heard.\n  This reform is broad, deep, and also authentic. I think that is what \nthe Nation wants of us.\n  Mr. President, 3,000 people died on September 11. They died at the \nWorld Trade Center, they died at the Pentagon, and they died on a field \nin Pennsylvania. At least 60 Marylanders died. We remember that they \ncame from all walks of life. We must remember those we lost that day. \nThe way we honor their memory is to take actions to do everything we \ncan to prevent it from ever happening again. That is what the families \nhave asked us to do. That is what the Nation has asked us to do. I am \nso pleased that we will act on this legislation before we recess.\n  We need to do this, and we need to do this now. In joining the \nIntelligence Committee, and also after those terrible acts, like many \nothers, I asked what could we have done to prevent the September 11 \nattacks on our country? Also, why did we think that Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction? What kind of information does the \nPresident need before he sends troops into harm's way? What kinds of \ninformation do we need--we, the Members of Congress--to be able to \nprovide the right response to a President's request? We reviewed a lot \nof this information, and now we know we have the kind of reform in this \nlegislation that will help us.\n  The 9/11 Commission built on the 9/11 joint inquiry of the House and \nSenate Intelligence Committees. We did that in a classified way. Then, \nthe 9/11 Commission was organized, and I am happy to say I voted for \nit. The Commission could bring into the sunshine what many of us knew \nprivately because it was classified. We knew about missed \nopportunities, insufficient or unreliable information, the failure to \nshare information, the shortcomings of watch lists.\n\n  The legislation that we have before us will move the priorities \nforward for intelligence reform. First of all, it gives the \nintelligence community one leader with authority, responsibility, and \nfinancial control. In Washington, if you cannot control people or you \ncannot control budgets, you cannot control the agency.\n  Second, it provides for diversity of opinion in the analysis. It \nrequires independent analysis. It also provides a framework for red \nteaming or a devil's advocate so that, again, the policymakers get the \nbest information.\n  It also strengthens information sharing. It provides the support to \nspeak truth to power. And it also provides a unity of effort in the \nglobal war on terrorism. All of this is done with a delicate balance of \nprotecting privacy and civil liberties.\n  I salute my colleagues. While they were doing their homework this \nsummer with the 9/11 report, I was doing mine--built on the experience \nthat I had both as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the joint \ninquiry to investigate what went wrong on 9/11. I continued my homework \nover the summer. I read the riveting report of the 9/11 Commission. I \nattended hearings in the Intelligence Committee and Governmental \nAffairs. I consulted with officials of the FBI and others in homeland \nsecurity in my State. I met with the Director of the National Security \nAgency. Having done that, I now conclude that this is the best \nlegislation.\n  We are at a turning point. This is a new century. It poses new \nthreats to the Nation. Therefore, it requires a new framework to serve \nthe Nation. That is what I believe this legislation will do. So I say \nto my colleagues that one of the best actions we can take now, in order \nto serve the Nation, is stand up for our troops, protect the homeland, \nand pass the Collins-Lieberman legislation, which I truly believe \nbrings about the reform of the national intelligence community.\n  I also salute the work of Senator Harry Reid and Senator Mitch \nMcConnell, who were working on how we need to reform ourselves in \nCongress to be able to provide the best oversight of the intelligence \ncommunity so we can have the best intelligence, yet the highest value \nfor our dollar, and at the same time protect the Nation, finding the \nbalance to protect our civil liberties. I believe the task force report \nsaying the Senate needs to reform itself internally will come after \nthis legislation. I think we have done a great job working on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I remember that fateful evening of \n9/11 and that day when we gathered on the Capitol steps. America had \nlived through a lot. We didn't know what was yet to come. But joining \nwith our\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\nHouse colleagues, we in the Senate, with our leadership, joined hands \nand sang ``God Bless America.'' We were not a Democratic Party. We were \nnot a Republican Party. We were the red, white, and blue party, and \nthat is what we need to be here today. We need to join hands, pass the \nreforms necessary to protect the Nation, and to truly ask God to bless \nthe United States of America.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend and colleague \nfrom Maryland, Senator Mikulski, for that very thoughtful and strong \nstatement on behalf of the bill. It means a lot to me and I know \nSenator Collins.\n  Senator Mikulski has focused on these national security intelligence \nissues. She happens to have a lot of people who work in this field for \nus in the State of Maryland. Senator Collins and I were very grateful \nand proud when Senator Mikulski joined us as an original cosponsor of \nthis legislation. I appreciate all that she has contributed to our \nefforts. Her statement is very timely and gratefully appreciated. I \nthank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I echo the words of my colleague from \nConnecticut. Senator Mikulski has been so helpful throughout this \ndebate and in the development of this bill. In fact, when the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee was first assigned the responsibility \nfor evaluating the 9/11 Commission recommendations and producing this \nbill, it was the Senator from Maryland who was the first to call me and \nto offer to help, to share her knowledge from her years on the \nIntelligence Committee and on the Appropriations Committee. I really \nappreciated that gesture.\n  Since that time, she also participated in one of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearings that we held. Her State lost so many \ncitizens on that awful day, and she has been relentless in her \ndetermination to make sure their memory is never forgotten. I very much \nappreciate all of her contributions.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a \nfew minutes on an unrelated matter, pertaining to a bill the House of \nRepresentatives just passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Hold On S. 878\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose S. 878, or at least \nthe version the House of Representatives just passed today. \nEssentially, what the House did was to poison a worthy bill, a bill \nthat was meant to alleviate the crisis of an overwhelming workload \nunder which the Federal judiciary is struggling. The House did so by \nadding language to split the Ninth Circuit into three circuits. In \ndoing so, the House has essentially taken the new judges as hostages to \na starkly partisan and controversial ploy.\n  I will not go along with such bullying tactics, and I am placing a \nhold on that bill today. It is with great regret, and with greater \nfrustration, that I place this hold.\n  I will take a few minutes to explain why we so desperately need the \nnew Federal judges S. 878 would provide, and then I want to make clear \nwhy I am so opposed to the language the House of Representatives has \nadded to split the Ninth Circuit.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, the average \ncaseload for every Federal district judge in the country is now 523 \ncases per judge. In 1999, the average was 480 cases. So it has \nincreased 9 percent in 4 years. But that only tells part of the story. \nOf the four Federal district courts in California, my home State, three \nof them handled more cases per judge than the national average: the \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, 544 cases; \nSouthern District of California, 611 cases; the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District, 734 cases per judge, 40 percent more than the \nnational average.\n  So it is this burden that needed to be remedied, and in this bill \nthere were 51 district court judges. It was an important bill.\n  This situation extends far beyond California. For example, the \ndistrict court for Nebraska, represented by my colleague Chuck Hagel, \nwho has been working on this issue with me, has 627 cases per judge, \nalmost 20 percent more than the average. Other courts with exceedingly \nhigh caseloads are in Iowa and Arizona.\n  The version of the Senate bill that the House Judiciary Committee \namended would have added 51 new Federal district court judges, 32 of \nthem permanent, 15 temporary judges whose seats would expire when they \nretire, and 4 seats that would be converted from temporary to \npermanent. That version of the bill would also have added 11 judges to \nthe circuits of the Court of Appeals. All of these additions came at \nthe recommendation of the nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United \nStates. According to their 2003 report, the need for new judges is real \nand growing.\n  They go on to state:\n\n       Since 1991, the number of criminal case filings has \n     increased 45 percent and the number of criminal defendants is \n     35 percent higher.\n\n  Then it continued on with the statistics. When the judges tell us \nthat they need more judges to supervise criminal trials, to secure our \nborders, and to crack down on deadly firearms, it is our obligation to \nlisten and to act, because these judges are the linchpin of our justice \nsystem. Just as we need soldiers to help win the war on terror, we need \nenough judges to keep safe at home.\n  Instead of moving forward to simply add judges, which is what we \nneed, the House essentially sabotaged the bill by adding an amendment \nto split the Ninth Circuit into these three new circuits.\n  This is not the time or the place for such an action. I am very much \naware of arguments in favor of splitting the Ninth Circuit. In the \nSenate Judiciary Committee we have been debating this for years and, as \nI said at the Senate hearing on the issue earlier this year, I welcome \nthe hearing and look at it with a much more open mind than I have in \nthe past. I am sensitive to the fact that the Ninth Circuit had a 13-\npercent increase in caseload in a single year.\n  However, this is only one side of the argument. We have testimony \nfrom the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, whom I respect greatly, who \ninforms me that the size is not an obstacle to efficiency. We have \nletters from the State Bar Associations of California, Arizona, and \nHawaii opposing a circuit split. I have a letter from Governor \nSchwarzenegger of California opposing a split of the Ninth Circuit. I \nhave letters from eight judges in the Ninth Circuit opposing a circuit \nsplit, and also a letter from Senator Sessions saying that he has \nreceived letters from 15 Ninth Circuit judges opposing a split.\n  Suffice it to say that reasonable minds can differ on whether the \nNinth Circuit should be split. What reasonable minds, I think, have to \nagree on is this is no way to undertake such a momentous change in our \nNation's history. I suspect what is happening is that opponents of the \nNinth Circuit are trying to take a bill that we need, add new judges, \nand make the Congress accept the split to the Ninth Circuit as the \nprice.\n\n  The fact of the matter is the split they propose will not equalize \nthe caseload. There will still be a disproportionate caseload with the \nmethodology used in the split followed by the House decision voted on \nthis morning. Under the House bill, the new Ninth Circuit, with \nCalifornia, Hawaii, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, would have \n407 cases per circuit judge. That is much more than the new Twelfth \nCircuit, of Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, and Montana, which would have 280 \ncases per circuit judge. It is also much more than the new Thirteenth \nCircuit, of Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, which would have 279 cases \nper judge. So the House bill does not solve the problem of an even \nsplit of cases between the circuits.\n  What we found as we looked at this over the years is that an even \nsplit cannot happen unless California is split in half, because the \nState, and ergo the\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\nnumber of cases, is simply too large. This has always been the dilemma.\n  Additionally, this legislation causes major new costs. The \nAdministrative Office of the Courts states that the startup costs for a \nthree-way split that the House today demanded would ring up $131.3 \nmillion to make that particular split.\n  Despite the need for new judges, I cannot accept this ploy. This is \nthe time for new Federal judges. It is not the time to split the Ninth \nCircuit. I think the House of Representatives has harmfully cemented \none weighty issue to the other and it is not going to work.\n  So, regretfully, I must place a hold on this bill. I hope Members who \nare concerned about this will listen, and I hope it is not too late to \nwork out some solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak 10 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      The Guard and Reserve Forces\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know the issue the Senator from \nCalifornia raised is very important and will be considered as we go \nforward in our debates, as our session wraps up. The Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Maine have done an outstanding job in \nmanaging the underlying bill and helping us come to grips with some of \nthe new fundamental changes necessary to reorganize our intelligence \ncommunities to face the challenges confronting our Nation. I do not \nwant to take too much time away from that very important debate. But I \ndid feel compelled to come to the floor and raise an issue regarding \nour military families, especially the families of our National \nGuardsmen and Reservists. They, too, are so critical to meeting and \ndefeating enemies on the home-front and in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Because we call on thousands of Active men and women in our armed \nforces, as well as reservists in our Guard and Reserve, to be in the \nforefront of the battles in Iraq and Afghanistan, I thought it was \nimportant to come to the floor to share some information that will \ndisappoint people in Louisiana and across the United States.\n  Right now, somewhere in this Capitol, there is a conference meeting \ntrying to finalize a tax relief package that we refer to around here as \nFSC/ETI. It is a necessary change in our Tax Code because of some trade \ndecisions that were made relative to the way Europe and America conduct \ntrade and impose taxes and fees on imports and exports. For several \nmonths, members of the Senate Finance Committee and Members of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee have been working to reach a final \nagreement. Different amendments have been added and subtracted as a \nmeans to bring the bill closer to final passage.\n\n  One of the amendments that I thought was one of the most important \namendments in that bill--one that my colleagues in the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, agreed to unanimously called for tax credits \nto be made available to employers who continued to pay the salaries of \ntheir employees if those employees had been activated for duty in the \nNational Guard and Reserves. The Senate agreed that if we were going to \ngive tax relief and a trade fix for corporations and for businesses, \nthen we should also find space in that bill to provide tax relief in \nsome way to the patriotic employers who are trying to help their \nemployees in the Guard and Reserve make ends meet. We should do that so \nthe men and women who put the uniform on every morning and run those \npatrols ferreting out insurgents and terrorists in Iraq would not have \nto take a pay cut to do their job to defend America. We want those \ntroops focused on the war-front, not whether bills have been paid on \nthe home-front.\n  Americans might be shocked, because I am shocked, and I am \ndisappointed, that our Government has not yet found a way to make sure \nthat when we call up the men and women basically out of their regular \nlife--as doctors or lawyers or truck drivers or nurses or teachers or \ngovernment workers or firefighters or police officers--and ask them to \nleave their families, leave their jobs, leave their businesses and go \nfight on the front line for us, that we have not found a way to make \nsure they can do that without taking a pay cut. The GAO has documented \nthat 41 percent of the Guardsmen and Reservists fighting for us--being \ncalled away from their homes, away from their families, and putting \ntheir lives in peril and great danger--are doing so with a pay cut. We \nneed to provide them a helmet and a gun and a flak jacket and some \nprotection. But I think we also should make every effort to ensure \ntheir families back-home have some stability. We should take steps so \nthat the troop in Falujah knows his employer can take care of his \nfamily.\n  If this Congress and the President were not already enacting \ntrillions in tax cuts and we were adhering to a plan of fiscal \nresponsibility, I might be able to look these families in the eye and \nsay, ``Sorry we have a budget deficit. We are doing the best we can.''\n  But do you know what the shame of it is? There is a conference \nmeeting somewhere in this Capitol giving out tax relief to people who \nalready have a lot of money, to corporations some of which may be on \nthe front line but many of which are not, and we have the Republican \nleadership on the House that says we cannot afford a tax credit to \nbenefit patriotic employers, our Guardsmen and Reservists, and their \nfamilies. We are asking our men and women in unifrom to bear 100 \npercent of the risk and burden of fighting the war on terror. Yet in \nall the tax relief in the Republican-drafted plan, the Republican-\nleadership plan drafted by Chairman Thomas, we can't find one penny to \nmake sure the military families get a full paycheck. The cost of my \namendment amounts to less than .1 percent of all the Bush/Republican \ntax cuts enacted since 2001. My amendment is even offset, but the \nRepublican leadership simply refuses to help military families.\n  Since 2001, the Republican leadership has passed over $2.1 trillion \nin tax cuts and tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. I supported \nsome of these tax cuts but the major beneficiaries have been wealthy \nindividuals who had already accumulated great assets, and corporations. \nDirect support for military families has been less than .1 percent, or \n$1.37 billion, of the $2.1 trillion in tax cuts.\n  If you remember, in 2001, we had one bill for tax cuts which we \ncalled the Military Family Relief Act. It amounted to $1.37 billion out \nof $2.1 trillion. So the bulk of the tax relief is going to people who \nare not on the front line. Only limited help is going to the people on \nthe front line.\n  You can see the graph here, $2.1 trillion to everybody else who is \nnot in uniform and $1.37 billion to the military families who are \nfighting the battle. I don't understand how we are fighting this war. \nMaybe somebody can explain it to me.\n  At least people say: Senator, you must not understand that much of \nthese tax cuts get to the military families; it is just not directly. \nIf they have children, they might get the child tax credit. I \nunderstand that. But 75 percent of the enlisted men and women in our \narmed services make less than $30,000 a year. A staff sergeant with 8 \nyears of experience makes $30,000 a year. So if you don't write them \ndirectly into the bills--because the bills are skewed to those \nindividuals and families making over $75,000, mostly $100,000, \n$200,000, $300,000--the military families don't get to take advantage \nof tax cuts.\n  Time and time again, every time a tax bill passes this Congress, the \nmilitary family is left on the cutting room floor. In 2001, we passed \nthe Economic Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, $1.6 trillion--\ndirect support for military families was $0.\n  In 2002, we passed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, \n$41 billion--military families, $0.\n  In 2003, we passed the Jobs and Growth Reconciliation Act, $230 \nbillion--direct support for military, $0.\n  This year we passed the Working Families Tax Relief Act, $146 \nbillion--direct support for military families, $0. This $146 billion \nhad no offsets.\n  Now we have a conference in this Capitol putting together an $81 \nbillion tax bill. And the amendment, the one little amendment we put on \nto encourage employers to keep the salaries up\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\nfor the Guard and Reserve when they are fighting in Iraq, was taken out \nbecause we can't afford it. When it left the Senate, we had paid for \nit. There are plenty of ways the House Republicans could pay for it, \ntoday, but helping military families is not in their interests. We \ncould close a loophole that allows companies to leave the United States \nfor the purpose of reorganizing themselves so they do not have to pay \ntaxes. We could close that loophole and gave it to the men and women \nputting on the uniform to defend our country. These soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines aren't fleeing the country to avoid paying taxes, \nyet we don't get tough on the corporations that are leaving the country \nto avoid taxes. They take every benefit of what this nation has to \noffer, including the blood and sweat of our troops, and pay nothing in \nreturn. But, some in Congress want to put these corporations in front \nof our men and women in uniform.\n  Let me also say I am ashamed for our Government that we have not yet \nclosed our own loophole when a Federal Government worker takes off the \nGovernment suit or dress or uniform and puts on the military uniform \nand goes to fight on the front lines of Iraq. The US Government, as an \nemployer, does not fill the pay gap for Federal employees.\n  Mr. President, 41 percent of the guardsmen and reservists who are \nfighting in Iraq take a pay cut to fight and we keep passing \nappropriations bills and tax cuts to give everyone in the world a tax \nbreak, except our military families. And, our poor military families \nask for help and we have the Republican leadership in the House telling \nthem: Sorry, there is no more money.\n  I just got back from Fort Polk a couple of weeks ago, where I have \n4,000 maybe 5,000 families in Louisiana whose primary breadwinner has \nstopped winning bread at home and gone over to Iraq to help fight this \nwar. I promised them that I was not going to just come on home without \na fight or without raising this issue for the 5,000 families in my \nState and for the thousands of families around this country who do not \nask for much. They ask for good training. They ask for equipment. And \nthey are asking that they don't take a pay cut when they go to fight. \nThey are not asking for a pay raise; they just don't want a pay cut. \nThey'll get that pay cut if we let this last tax bill go out of here \nwithout fixing this provision or without giving some tax credit to \ncompanies, many of them small businesses, who continue to pay their \nactivated Guard and Reserve employees.\n  You can understand why a small business sometimes can't afford to \ncontinue to pay the guardsmen and reservists 100 percent of their \nsalary and then have to pay 100 percent of the salary for a \nreplacement.\n  We are asking for a tax credit for these employers so they can \nvoluntarily, if they want, continue to pay the salary of their Guard \nand Reserve, take a tax credit so we would basically share that expense \namong everyone and allow that guardsman and reservist to get a full \npaycheck.\n  I repeat for the record, the GAO reports that 41 percent of the \nguardsmen and reservists called to active duty take a pay cut. We could \nfix that, but for some reason we do not want to, we do not think we \nshould, or we do not have the money. Yet at the same time we are fixing \na lot of things for a lot of people and passing one appropriations bill \nand one tax bill after another.\n  Forty percent of those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are Guard and \nReserve; 410,000 families or individuals have been activated since \nSeptember 11. We probably have a few more thousand to activate until we \nget it right in Iraq.\n  We can pay for this, as I said, by closing loopholes, but the \nRepublican leadership said, ``No.'' We cannot not pay for it. They have \npassed tax bills out of here and chalked it up to more debt. This would \nnot be that much to add for people assuming 100 percent of the risk to \ndefend this Nation, but they do not choose to do that, either. Right \nnow, as I speak, 3 o'clock today, it is not in the bill.\n  I hope these words are traveling through this Capitol. I hope there \nare people listening and phones start ringing to include the military \nfamilies in this FSC/ETI bill that is moving through conference so this \ntax relief can be given and the pay gap can be closed. If you are on \nthe front line, taking 100 percent of the risk, the last thing you need \nto take is a pay cut.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does the rule of germaneness apply under \ncloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Germaneness on debate is required on cloture.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to speak for not more than 10 \nminutes on a matter not germane to the pending matter before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Veterans Benefits\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, West Virginians have a long and proud record \nof service to the U.S. military. General Stonewall Jackson, one of the \ngreatest military minds of his time, hailed from present day West \nVirginia. Chuck Yeager, the World War II ace and the first man ever to \ntravel faster than sound, is proud to be a West Virginian. SSG Junior \nSpurrier left his home of Bluefield, WV, to fight for the liberation of \nFrance and received just one fewer awards than the legendary Audie \nMurphy, the most decorated American soldier in World War II.\n  There are many more West Virginians whose names will not be recorded \nin the great military histories of our country, but these veterans have \nasked little of their country. They have a right to expect that our \nGovernment will provide them with the benefits they earned in service \nto our country, and that is the one thing they do expect.\n  Time and time again, President Bush has turned his back on veterans \nwho have served our country. Over and over again, President Bush has \nhad to choose between veterans programs and budget-busting tax cuts for \nthe wealthy, and he has chosen to cut taxes for America's super-wealthy \ninstead of taking care, as he should have, of America's veterans. As \nveterans evaluate the actions of this administration, I hope they are \nasking whether they are better off than they were 4 years ago.\n  For the last 3 years, Congress wanted to increase veterans' benefits \nby allowing military retirees to keep all of their VA disability checks \nand the military retirement pay, but President Bush opposed it. He \nfought against it. In fact, he threatened to veto a $396 billion \nDefense bill in order to keep Congress from allowing veterans to \nreceive all the compensation they have earned through their service in \nthe Armed Forces. Yes, my colleagues heard me right. President George \nBush threatened to veto an entire Defense bill because veterans would \nget the benefits they had earned.\n  This year, President Bush approved plans to shut down three veterans \nhospitals and partially close nine more. What is more, the Beckley VA \nMedical Center which serves 40,000 veterans in southern West Virginia \nand is located in my home county of Raleigh narrowly missed the \nPresident's chopping block. Only a last-minute intervention by Senator \nJohn D. Rockefeller, Representative Nick Rahall, and me saved the \nBeckley Veterans Hospital. If the President gets a second term, \nhowever, veterans better watch out. You veterans may have to kiss more \nof your hospitals goodbye.\n\n  But the Bush administration didn't bother to wait for a second term \nbefore slashing veterans health care in other ways. Last year, the Bush \nadministration decided that an entire category of veterans should no \nlonger be eligible to seek health care from the VA. This wrongheaded \ndecision means that by next year more than 520,000 veterans will be \nbarred from VA hospitals. In other words, the White House says it would \nbe too expensive to let these veterans enjoy their VA health care \nbenefits. How can President Bush claim he supports our troops if he \ndoesn't support VA health care for half a million veterans?\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\n  President Bush has also taken to shortchanging veterans to new, \ndisgusting levels. He is no longer content with simply underfunding \nveterans health care to the tune of $3.2 billion per year, according to \nleading veterans' service organizations. Now President Bush has decided \nthat some people who served our country in uniform should pay more for \ntheir veterans health care benefits. The President's budget for this \nyear doubles the cost of prescription drugs for these veterans, \nincreases their fees for doctor visits by 33 percent, and sticks them \nwith new annual enrollment fees.\n  I know that when President Bush hits the campaign trail in West \nVirginia, he will talk about how he cares about veterans, but I doubt \nthat he will tell West Virginia's veterans about his plans to cut their \nbenefits and raise their fees. I am sure you won't hear the President \ntalking about how he has shortchanged the VA, cut veterans health care, \nfought Congress on veterans benefits, closed veterans hospitals, and \nincreased health care charges.\n  The Bible says:\n\n     . . . by their fruits ye shall know them.\n\n  In today's terms, we would say that you have to walk the walk if you \nwant to talk the talk. But when it comes to looking out for veterans, \nGeorge Bush is ambling off in the wrong direction.\n  The veterans of West Virginia know about sacrifice. They have given \nup a lot in their service to this country. This administration has \nspent 4 years undercutting veterans. The people of West Virginia should \nknow that it is time to stand up for our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today what we have seen is a fresh \ntopic of interest, as discussed in the newspaper. I ask unanimous \nconsent that in my hour of time, whatever time I have remaining be \navailable to me as if it were in morning business and that I be \npermitted to use 15 minutes of that time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Paul Bremer's Recent Comments\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the topic of very active discussion is \nMr. Paul Bremer's comments that are in the papers, particularly the \nWashington Post, today. I say this with a great deal of respect for \nPaul Bremer. I think he worked hard to do a very good job. He can \nhardly be described as a leftwing liberal, for sure. He said something \nthat was, to use the vernacular, kind of a show stopper. He said:\n\n       We paid a big price for not stopping it (looting) because \n     it established an atmosphere of lawlessness. . . . We never \n     had enough troops on the ground.\n\n  This is our person in charge of the transition from Iraq's former \ngovernment, purportedly to become a democracy. He is the fellow who was \nin charge in Iraq. We all, whoever went there, visited with him, \nlistened to him. He worked very closely with the military. He is very \nskilled. But he said it. ``We never had enough troops on the ground,'' \nand that was the beginning of the problem in which we are now so deeply \nenmeshed.\n  We have had generals saying it. We had General Shinseki saying that \nwe needed 300,000 of our troops there to do the job, and not having had \nenough caused us, frankly, to become mired in a situation that, at \nleast by current appearances, seems as though it is going to hold us \nthere for a long time at a terrible cost in life, terrible cost in \nfamily relationships, terrible cost financially as well.\n\n\n                   The Vice President and HalliBurton\n\n  Tonight, as everyone knows, the debate will be between Vice President \nCheney and Senator John Edwards, for each of them to present their \ncredentials and their views. But I rise to discuss the Vice President's \nrelationship with Halliburton, his financial relationship with the oil \ncompany he ran from 1995 to the year 2000, the company that is reaping \nthe benefits of multibillion-dollar contracts from the Bush-Cheney \nadministration.\n  Vice President Cheney still receives salary checks from Halliburton \nfor well over $150,000 each year. He holds 433,000 unexercised \nHalliburton stock options. It presents a very questionable picture when \nwe look on this chart at the orange line which conveys the Halliburton \nincome to Vice President Cheney from 2001 on, and his Vice Presidential \nsalary. If one looks, we see the compensation from Halliburton exceeded \nthat of the U.S. Government's compensation or pay for the Vice \nPresident. In the year 2002, Halliburton fell to $162,000 but then \ncrept back up to where they are very close together. That is, the \nsalary paid by the U.S. Government and the deferred compensation plan \nthat gives Vice President Cheney $178,000.\n  When you look at this, it presents a terrible picture. Here is a Vice \nPresident of the United States, the next person in line to take over \nif, Heaven forbid, something happened to the President, and he is \ngetting paid from a company he used to work for. We know this is a \ndeferred compensation plan, that it was earned before.\n\n  I also mention the fact that Vice President Cheney, when he left \nHalliburton, got a $20 million termination bonus plus over $1 million \nin another bonus. If we looked at the deferred salary and the \nnontermination bonus Dick Cheney has received from Halliburton while \nVice President of the United States, it is up to almost $2 million.\n  This is, if not corrupting in its reality, its functionality. It has \nthe appearance that raises enormous questions. This relationship, \ncoupled with Halliburton's no-bid contract and other contracts in Iraq, \nis extremely problematic.\n  On top of the salary, there are 433,000 shares options that are \nexercisable. I come out of the corporate world and I know how valuable \nthe stock options can be. The profits are committed to a charity, \npurportedly, but the more you get, the more you can give away.\n  Why does the Vice President permit this salary arrangement to \ncontinue when he could have done away with it, as did Mr. John Snow, \nwho was the Secretary of the Treasury. He wrapped up 6 years' worth of \ndeferred compensation into one year and said: I want to be done with \nthis. I don't want to have my income coming from my former employer \nwhile I work for the U.S. Government at such a high level.\n  By continuing this financial relationship, the Vice President \nundermines our Nation's ethical credibility here and abroad. On \nSeptember 14, 2003, the Vice President was asked about his relationship \nwith Halliburton and the no-bid contract on the program, ``Meet the \nPress.'' Vice President Cheney told Tim Russert--and I happened to be \nwatching the program; that is what stimulated my interest--the Vice \nPresident said:\n\n       I've severed all my ties with the company, gotten rid of \n     all my financial interests. I have no financial interest in \n     Halliburton of any kind and haven't had now for over 3 years.\n\n  The problem with that statement is that when he said it, he held \nthose 433,000 Halliburton stock options and continued to receive a \ndeferred salary from the company and still has a salary for the year \ncoming into 2005.\n  I went to the Congressional Research Service to see what the \ndefinition of a ``financial interest'' might look like. The \nCongressional Research Service confirmed to me that holding such \noptions and receiving deferred salary constitutes a financial interest. \nThey agree, and so do I, that when you have deferred compensation, when \nyou have stock options, that is a financial interest. They say if it \nlooks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it must be a duck. There it \nis, a financial interest.\n  Even though the exercised prices for Vice President Cheney's \nHalliburton stock options are above the current market price, the \nmajority of the options extend to 2009. My goodness, what does it take \nto free himself from a previous business contact?\n  When I left the company that I helped start and at which I spent 30 \nyears, the minute I left there all of my options were canceled, to my \nregret, because there was a lot of money involved.\n  Any option holder has to hope that the stock price surges so the \nvalue of the options increase. One way this can happen is to be sure \nthat lucrative contracts keep coming from the U.S. Government.\n\n  In the first quarter of 2004, Halliburton's revenues were up 80 \npercent from the first quarter of 2003. Why? Wall Street analysts point \nto one simple factor: The company's massive governmental contracts in \nIraq. Those are the things that are responsible for\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nthis increase in revenue and profits, if any.\n  Vice President Cheney's annual deferred salary from Halliburton is \nsignificant. As I pointed out earlier, in fact, the Vice President's \nHalliburton salary is as high as his government pay--last year, \n$178,000 in salary from Halliburton. I have heard the Vice President's \ndefense of his Halliburton deferred salary. He claims that the deal was \nlocked in in 1999 and there is no way for him to get out of his \ndeferred salary deal.\n  How about if he had an employment contract with the company for 10 \nyears and then became Vice President of the United States, would he say \nhe had to have both jobs at the same time because he had a contract? \nCome on.\n  Checking of the facts revealed otherwise. I obtained the terms of \nVice President Cheney's deferred salary contract with Halliburton, and \nthe bottom line is that the deferred salary agreement is not set in \nstone. In fact, one need only look at the ethics agreement of Treasury \nSecretary Snow to see what the Vice President should have done in order \nto avoid taking salary from private corporations while in public \noffice. Secretary Snow took six different deferred compensation \npackages as a lump sum upon taking office. Get rid of any shadow of \ndoubt, any shadow of conflict.\n  Worst of all, this financial relationship is going on while \nHalliburton is ripping off American taxpayers. I am very specific about \nthis. Halliburton is ripping off American taxpayers. I have said it, \nand I will say it again. Look at the record.\n  The Pentagon's inspector general revealed that Halliburton, while our \npeople were fighting for their lives, overcharged $27.4 million for \nmeals that were never served to our troops. False records. Fraudulent.\n  Another Pentagon audit found Halliburton overcharged the Army by \n$1.09 a gallon for 57 million gallons of gasoline deferred to citizens \nin Iraq.\n  Auditors found potential overcharges of up to $61 million for \ngasoline that a Halliburton subsidiary, KBR, delivered as part of its \nno-bid contract to help rebuild Iraq's oil industry.\n  Under its cost-plus contract with the Pentagon, the more Halliburton \nspends, the more profit it makes regardless of whether that spending is \nnecessary. Several former Halliburton employees have come forward to \nreveal how the company has taken advantage of this sweetheart deal by \nspending millions on nonexistent or vastly overpriced goods and \nservices.\n  According to these former employees, Halliburton engaged in the \nfollowing wasteful practices: They had its employees drive empty trucks \nback and forth across Iraq in order to bill for the trips despite the \nobvious risks that this practice posed to both truck drivers and the \n85,000 trucks. Halliburton, under their arrangement, whatever they \nspent, came up with a profit for them.\n  If they needed an oil change they would buy a new truck. Halliburton \nremoved all of the spare tires from its trucks and failed to provide \nbasic maintenance supplies like oil filters. This is not something I am \nmaking up. It is in the record. As a result, when tires went flat or \ntrucks broke down, they were abandoned or torched, with Halliburton \nmaking a profit on the replacements. This is the most sinister of \nbehavior.\n  When a Halliburton employee needed one drill, his supervisor told him \nto order four. When the employee said he did not need four drills, the \nsupervisor responded: Don't worry about it, it is a cost-plus contract.\n  One employee discovered that Halliburton was paying $45 for a case of \nsoda in Kuwait when local supermarkets charged only $7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator's 15 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I remind the Chair that according to the rules under \ncloture I have an hour of time to be used if I can get an agreement for \nunanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent, because the time is going to be used by me, \nthat I be allowed a few more minutes until I finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is there \nnot a germaneness requirement for the debate at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is, but the Senator had asked to speak \nas in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will not object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the time is running against the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the manager. The Senator from \nMaine has worked very hard on this intelligence reform bill. I \nsupported her as a member of that committee. I know this might be a \ndiversion to her, but I appreciate her consent.\n  One employee discovered that Halliburton was paying $45 for cases of \nsoda in Kuwait when local supermarkets charged about only $7. And then \nthere are the kickbacks. Halliburton admitted to the Pentagon that two \nemployees took kickbacks, valued at approximately $6 million, in return \nfor awarding a Kuwaiti-based company with lucrative subcontracts.\n  The scandal is playing itself out in the real world, while this \nSenate sleeps. It is neglect on everybody's part that this was \npermitted to continue.\n  This kind of corporate behavior resembles that of Enron and other \ncorporations that have sought to defraud the Government with kickbacks \nand bribes and overcharges.\n  Profiteering during war is an outrageous action, if not a crime. When \nI served in World War II, if a company profiteered as people were \nlosing their lives, they would be punished. They would have jail \nsentences in front of them.\n  That is not what I am suggesting. What I am suggesting is that this \nis abominable behavior and it ought not be permitted.\n  When I think of the debate that is going on and John Kerry is accused \nof being soft on defense, when he served so bravely, when even though \nhe disagreed with the policy of the Government, he served the country \nloyally, bravely, and was wounded. The assertions that maybe the wounds \nweren't deep enough were challenged by statements in the paper \nyesterday where it said that he still has shrapnel in his body from \nthose wounds. Anyone who would suggest that because Senator John Kerry \nexamined the question on moneys being spent for the war, because it \nincluded tax relief for some of the richest among us, the fact is, he \nserved without question, without any reservation whatsoever, except he \nhad a difference in policy. But he put his life on the line, which we \nhaven't seen around here, I can tell you, as I have described in past \nspeeches.\n  I used the identification of the chicken hawk. The chicken hawk is \nsomeone who makes war that other people are to fight. I don't think it \nis fair to tear apart the loyalty, the heroism of Senator John Kerry \nanymore than it was fair to challenge the heroism or the loyalty of \nformer Senator Max Cleland.\n  I hope this assault on character can stop and we can discuss the \nissues that affect the American people.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time from my hour \nwhen I come back to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Correct Reporting\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, politics is politics. As we all know, it \ncan be a contact sport. While many things can be considered fair or \nunfair, depending on your outlook, I think most would agree that the \nvoting record and the printed and stated positions of a candidate or \nelected official are right and proper to discuss. But it is also \nimportant that those who report this discussion be correct in what they \nreport.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, may I challenge whether this is part \nof the debate on the intelligence reform bill or is this discussing a \ndifferent matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Georgia be permitted to speak as in morning business for 20 \nminutes, just as the Senator from New Jersey was permitted to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have made my request, but I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thought we were in morning business. If I may now \ncontinue.\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\n  It is also important that those who report the discussion be correct \nin what they report. From most of the national media, we have not had \nthat correct reporting on John Kerry's national defense record.\n  From the media we have heard, from their review of national defense \nrecords, that the liberal Democrat John Kerry and the conservative Vice \nPresident Dick Cheney are, in fact, long lost ideological soul mates, \nseparated only by birth and hair.\n  We hear from Wolf Blitzer and Judy Woodruff on CNN and Chris Matthews \non MSNBC, Alan Colmes of Fox, and the fact finders at the Washington \nPost and the LA Times that if you took Dick Cheney and substituted him \nfor John Kerry or if you took John Kerry and substituted him for Dick \nCheney the defense votes that occurred in the House and Senate and the \noutcomes of defense spending bills and Pentagon operations would be \nvirtually identical.\n  They would have you believe that when it comes to national defense \nrecords, votes and positions, they say the very DNA of Dick Cheney and \nJohn Kerry are practically indistinguishable, that they are doves from \nthe same nest. Or maybe it is hawks now, with Kerry's latest change.\n  As silly as this assertion is, the Democrats are more than happy to \nmake it because many in the media are only too happy to parrot it. \nThere is no better proof of this than the media's response to the \nspeech I made at the Republican National Convention in New York City.\n  Now, I was inclined to let the veracity of an old man soon to be \nretired just go unanswered, thinking that the juice wasn't worth the \nsqueeze. And I would have, if it had been my reputation at stake \ninstead of the safety of my family. Let me start with the LA Times \nwhich bought lock, stock, and barrel the Democrats' official line, and \nI quote:\n\n       The Kerry campaign responded by accusing Miller of \n     mischaracterizing the Senator's record, pointing out that \n     Cheney also voted to cut funding for some of those weapons \n     systems while serving in Congress. Others were targeted for \n     cutback by Cheney when he was Defense Secretary in the first \n     Bush Administration.\n\n  USA Today minimized the negative of Kerry's defense votes this way:\n\n       . . . Kerry voted against large Pentagon spending bills \n     that include many weapons three times in his 20-year career. \n     And Defense Secretary Cheney recommended ending some of the \n     same systems that Miller cited.\n\n  CNN's Judy Woodruff said this to me only a few minutes after my \nspeech:\n\n       John Kerry voted for 16 of 19 defense budgets that came \n     through the Senate while he was in the Senate, and many of \n     those votes you cited, Dick Cheney also voted against.\n\n  Wolf Blitzer of CNN emphasized the similarity of Kerry and Cheney:\n\n       When the Vice President was the Secretary of Defense, he \n     proposed cutting back on the B-2 bomber, the F-14 Tomcat as \n     well. I covered him at the Pentagon during those years when \n     he was raising serious concerns about those two weapons \n     systems. . . .\n\n  And then, that citadel of sanctimony, the home of the whopper, the \nWashington Post, weighed in with this totally untrue statement:\n\n       Miller's list was mostly derived from a single Kerry vote \n     against a spending bill in 1991, rather than individual votes \n     against particular systems.\n\n  Later, a Washington Post analysis added:\n\n       Kerry did not cast a series of votes against individual \n     weapon systems, but instead Kerry voted against a Pentagon \n     spending package in 1990 as part of deliberations over \n     restructuring and downsizing the military in the post-Cold \n     War period.\n\n  Editorial pages began to chime in, such as the Philadelphia Daily \nNews:\n\n       Miller charged that Kerry has voted to strip the Armed \n     Services of necessary weapons systems when Dick Cheney, as \n     Defense Secretary, proposed many of the cuts and voted for \n     others.\n\n  Mr. President, is this true? Are there just a handful of votes by \nKerry against weapons systems? Are those votes identical to those by \nDick Cheney? Did the media have their facts straight? And even more \nimportant, did they really want to have their facts straight? Or did \nthey just simply adopt, without verification, the talking points from \nthe Kerry campaign?\n  Let's start at the beginning. I said in my speech that Kerry \n``opposed the very weapons systems that won the Cold War and that are \nnow winning the war on terrorism.''\n  I then listed the systems that Kerry opposed, such as the B-1, the B-\n2, F-14A, F-14D Tomcats, the Apache helicopter, the F-15 Eagle, the \nPatriot missile, Aegis cruiser, the SDI, and the Trident missile.\n  Did Kerry oppose the weapons systems that won the Cold War? The \nanswer is yes.\n  In 1984, John Kerry ran for the Senate and built his campaign around \nthe promise to reverse what he called ``the biggest defense buildup \nsince World War II,'' a buildup he considered in his words, ``wasteful, \nuseless, and dangerous.''\n  In a key 1984 campaign document, Kerry identified 16 weapons systems \nhe wanted to ``cancel.''\n  All of those weapons systems that I stated that Kerry opposed are \nfound in this 1984 document, except for two--the Trident missile and \nthe B-2 bomber. But Senator Kerry's opposition to those was reported in \nother press interviews in 1984.\n  Mr. President, this 1984 campaign document is the first, but by no \nmeans the last, of Kerry's opposition to these weapons systems.\n  It is strange, but there has not been a single story that I can find \nin the media about this document. No one wants the American people to \nsee what Kerry was wanting to cancel at the height of the Cold War.\n  This document doesn't exist as far as the national media is \nconcerned. But it is vital to any debate about John Kerry's national \ndefense record because it spells out in Kerry's own words his complete \nand total opposition to these weapons systems. This document begins and \nends with the word ``cancel.''\n\n  In his own words, John Kerry says ``cancel'' the MX, the B-1, the \nASAT, SDI, the Apache helicopter, the Patriot, the Aegis cruiser, the \nHarrier, the Tomcat, the Eagle, the Phoenix, the Sparrow, and all of \nthe other weapons systems listed on this chart.\n  If you are like most people, you might read this document and say, if \nJohn Kerry wants to cancel these weapons systems, it certainly doesn't \nmean he is for them. So then he must oppose them. In the name of common \nsense, could you have any other meaning from this?\n  The media tells us that just because John Kerry wanted to cancel \nthose systems, that doesn't mean he opposed those systems. Such is \ntheir strange and twisted logic.\n  Because the media is not convinced John Kerry meant ``cancel'' when \nhe said ``cancel,'' they ignore this document and think the American \npeople should, too.\n  Those who don't ignore this document dismiss it, basically because \nKerry opposed these systems 20 years ago. So what is the big deal \ntoday?\n  Here is why it is a big deal. This document came out in 1984, when \nAmerica was in a life-and-death struggle with the Soviet Union. At that \ntime, the Cold War was anything but cold, and it was certainly not \nover.\n  The premier of the Soviet Union was not Gorbachev but Konstantin \nChernenko, an old Brezhnev hard-liner.\n  This document that outlined John Kerry's vision for our national \ndefense, which the media ignores and doesn't want you to know about, \ncame out about 6 months after the Soviet Union shot down Korean \nAirlines 747 filled with 269 civilians.\n  This Kerry proposal came at a time when Soviet troops were at the \nhalfway point of their armed invasion of Afghanistan.\n  This Kerry proposal came at a time when Cuban troops were in Angola \nand Kampuchea.\n  This Kerry proposal came at a time when Marxists insurgents had taken \npower in Nicaragua and were pushing northward into El Salvador.\n  This Kerry proposal came at a time when insurgents and terrorists \nwere on the attack, and the way Kerry wanted to deal with them was by \ncanceling crucial weapons systems.\n  Here, at the height of the Cold War, at a time when we were playing \ncards with the devil himself, when our own future, the world's freedom, \nand the fate of half a billion souls from Poland to Siberia, from the \nBaltic to Crimea, were all in the pot, John Kerry said ``fold them'' to \nwhat ultimately turned out to be one of the biggest winning hands ever \nplayed for freedom.\n  That is why this 1984 document is a big deal, Mr. President. I ask \nunanimous consent that this document be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                    john kerry on the defense budget\n\n       ``We are continuing a defense buildup that is consuming our \n     resources with weapons systems that we don't need and can't \n     use.''\n       The Reagan Administration has no rational plan for our \n     military. Instead, it acts on misinformed assumptions about \n     the strength of the Soviet military and a presumed ``window \n     of vulnerability'', which we now know not to exist.\n       And Congress, rather than having the moral courage to \n     challenge the Reagan Administration, has given Ronald Reagan \n     almost every military request he has made, no matter how \n     wasteful, no matter how useless, no matter how dangerous.\n       The biggest defense buildup since World War II has not \n     given us a better defense. Americans feel more threatened by \n     the prospect of war, not less so. And our national priorities \n     become more and more distorted as the share of our country's \n     resources devoted to human needs diminishes.\n\n\n                  john kerry has a different approach\n\n       John Kerry believes that the time has come to take a close \n     look at what our defense needs are and to plan for them \n     rather than to assume we must spend indiscriminately on new \n     weapons systems.\n       John Kerry believes that we can cut from $45 to $53 billion \n     from the Reagan Defense budget this year. Some of these cuts \n     include:\n\n                         Major nuclear programs\n\n     MX Missile, Cancel, $5.0 billion\n     B-1 Bomber, Cancel, $8.0 billion\n     Anti-satellite system, Cancel, $99 million\n     Star Wars, Cancel, $99 million\n     Tomahawk Missile, Reduce by 50 per cent, $294 million\n\n                              Land forces\n\n     AH-64 Helicopters, Cancel, $1.4 billion\n     Division Air Defense, Gun (DIVAD), Cancel, $638 million\n     Patriot Air Defense Missile, Cancel, 1.3 billion\n\n                              Naval forces\n\n     Aegis Air-Defense Cruiser, Cancel, $800 million\n     Battleship Reactivation, Cancel, $453 million\n\n                                Aircraft\n\n     AV-8B Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircraft, Cancel, $1.0 \n         billion\n     F-15 Fighter Aircraft, Cancel, $2.3 billion\n     F-14A Fighter Aircraft, Cancel, $1.0 billion\n     F-14D Fighter Aircraft, Cancel, $286 million\n     Pheonix Air-to-Air Missile, Cancel, $431 million\n     Sparrow Air-to-Air Missile, Cancel, $264 million\n\n       In addition, acquisition of equipment and supplies should \n     depend on real defense needs, not inter-service rivalries. \n     ``National security'' is no excuse for bad management \n     practices. The Congressional Budget Office and the General \n     Accounting Office'' agree that an additional $8 billion can \n     be saved by implementing the recommendations of the \n     President's own Grace Commission Report.\n       ``I will never forget that the Defense Budget is not an \n     employment program, but a tool to provide the nation with a \n     strong, lean and stabilizing defense posture.\n       Finally, John thinks it's time for a Senator who will stand \n     up for what's right and not go along with what's expedient.\n       ``If we don't need the MX, the B-1 or these other weapons \n     systems. . . . There is no excuse for casting even one vote \n     for unnecessary weapons of destruction and as your Senator, I \n     will never do that.''\n\n  Mr. MILLER. This document is not the end of this sorry story, for \nwith these weapons systems clearly in his crosshairs as candidate John \nKerry, Senator John Kerry pulled the trigger on them his first year in \nthe Senate in 1985, and then again at every other chance he got.\n  In 1985, the ``series of votes against individual weapons systems'' \nthe Washington Post so snugly swore never took place began.\n  In all, 14 Senate votes took place in 1985 alone on 5 of the specific \nweapons systems Kerry pledged to cancel. Mr. President, 13 of his 14 \nvotes in 1984 were to cut the defense systems he promised to cancel.\n  Four of those were to cut the MX peacemaker missile; two votes were \nto cut antisatellite weapons; two votes were to cut SDI; another vote \nwas to restrict SDI's use; another vote was to cut battleship \nreactivation; and another vote was against binary weapons.\n  Kerry's only vote not to cut a defense program was on SDI. You know \nwhy? Because after voting three times to cut SDI by as much as $1.5 \nbillion, Kerry voted against a cut of $160 million because he said it \ndidn't cut SDI enough.\n  So when it comes to the weapons systems that won the Cold War, John \nKerry said in 1985 he wanted to cancel them, and then in 1985 he voted \nagainst them 13 out of 14 times.\n  There were two other votes to cut back overall defense spending, for \na total of 16 votes in 1985 on national defense alone; but the Mr. \nMagoos down at the pious Post somehow could not locate these facts.\n  In fact, the Washington Post could not only find ``a'' vote--one \nsingle solitary vote over 20 years--where John Kerry voted against \ndefense. That single antidefense vote was after the Cold War in 1990 or \n1991, depending upon which Washington Post report you read.\n  Judy Woodruff did some better. She found 19 total defense votes over \nKerry's 20 years in the Senate. There were 16 votes in 1985 on defense \nsystems and overall spending alone.\n  She also claimed that Cheney voted the same way as Kerry on ``many of \nthose'' 19.\n  Yet how many can ``many'' be if Cheney and Kerry served \nsimultaneously in Congress for only 4 of those 19 annual budget fights?\n  But Wolf Blitzer's defense of Kerry's national defense record was the \nmost interesting. With the wave of a hand, Blitzer dismissed the \nnumerous votes by Kerry against these weapon systems that occurred \nyears before as well as the years after Cheney was Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Cheney's position in 1990 and Kerry's opposition in 1984 is the \ndifference between opposing the Sherman tank and the B-29 in the year \nbefore D-day and then wanting to cut back on them the year after V-J \nday.\n  Mr. President, you could review the series of John Kerry votes on \nweapons systems in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989--all that occurred before \nthe Berlin Wall fell.\n  The fact is you can look at Kerry's votes during the cold war, after \nthe cold war, before Desert Storm, after Desert Storm, after the first \nWorld Trade Center attack, before the war on terrorism and now during \nthe war on terrorism, and you will find John Kerry was one of the most \nreliable ``no'' votes against the weapons our soldiers needed to defend \nthis country and keep the U.S. safe.\n  The point is if the media won't tell you what the impact of Kerry's \nposition would have been on the cold war, they sure are not going to \ntell you what the impact would be today on the war on terrorism.\n  So let me sum up what we can learn from the media's response to my \nspeech at the Republican National Convention on John Kerry's defense \nrecord.\n  The media can only find John Kerry opposing defense weapon systems \nthat Secretary Cheney opposed also.\n  The media will only count overall spending bills as a vote against a \nweapon system, and will not count the numerous votes on the systems \nthemselves nor the overall budget plans as votes on the systems or \nnational defense.\n  And the media can simply find no votes by John Kerry against any \nweapon systems during the height of the cold war--not a one. Not a \nsingle one.\n  What they found, or what they want you to believe they found is that \nCheney and Kerry had practically identical national defense voting \nrecords during the cold war. And that is flagrantly wrong.\n  Let me take another minute to look at this.\n  In 1985, the House in which Cheney was a Member had a series of votes \non 17 specific weapon systems.\n  Seventeen of Dick Cheney's seventeen votes were to protect the \ndefense systems.\n  Seven ayes on seven votes to protect the MX peacekeeper missile;\n  Six ayes on six votes to protect SDI;\n  Another vote to protect the Trident II missile;\n  Another vote to protect binary weapons;\n  Another vote to protect chemical weapons; and\n  Another vote to protect ASAT weapons.\n  During the height of the cold war, essentially every vote by Dick \nCheney was the mirror opposite of John Kerry.\n  Where Cheney repeatedly voted for weapon systems, Kerry repeatedly \nvoted against those weapon systems.\n  Where Cheney supported President Reagan's announced position on each \nvote on these weapon systems, Kerry opposed President Reagan's \nannounced position on each vote.\n  The sole vote of John Kerry against a cut in defense was because he \nwanted\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\na bigger cut--a cut as much as ten times larger in SDI.\n  So there are differences between Dick Cheney and John Kerry on \nnational defense. It's the difference between the world's biggest and \ngreatest military superpower and, well, spitballs.\n  Mr. President, I probably have wasted my time and just spit in the \nocean because we all have learned the hard way that the elite media can \ndo anything it wants and sell anything it wants.\n  We saw earlier this year the New York Times and Washington Post \nrepeat on their front pages false allegations by Ambassador Joe Wilson \nabout Niger uranium and his wife's role in his own activities, but they \nthen buried the correction somewhere in the back pages.\n  We saw Newsweek's Evan Thomas report that: ``The media want Kerry to \nwin'' and that support, in Thomas's words, ``is going to be worth maybe \n15 points.''\n  We see CBS News having to admit they were pushing forgeries about \nPresident Bush's National Guard service.\n  The national media's all-out defense of John Kerry's indefensible \ndefense record falls into this same sorry and disgraceful pattern of \nselling an agenda rather than the facts.\n  What I said in New York was true. It was true then. It is still true \nnow.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      John Kerry's Defense Record\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, John Kerry's record on defense reflects more \nthan approximately 10,000 votes he has cast in the Senate. His defense \nrecord goes back to the steaming jungles of Vietnam where he, as a \nyoung sailor commanding a fast boat, went into harm's way on many \ndifferent occasions. We know about the number of those occasions \nbecause his defense record indicates that the Government of the United \nStates awarded him two medals for heroism--one a Bronze Star, one a \nSilver Star. He was wounded on three separate occasions and received \nthree Purple Hearts. They were awarded not by some gentleman's club but \nby the U.S. military.\n  On the programs about which we have heard a dissertation today, as we \nlook through those--except for the MX missile, which was canceled by \nthe President of the United States, not by Congress, as I recall--all \nof these programs came into being. So to think that any one Senator, \nwith the hundreds and hundreds of votes on defense matters, stopped the \nCold War from being won is really a little silly, for lack of a better \ndescription.\n  Senator John Kerry supported more than $4.4 trillion in defense \nspending, including for 16 of the last 19 Defense authorization bills. \nIn fact, he voted for the largest increase in defense spending since \nthe early 1980s.\n  John Kerry is a strong supporter of the U.S. armed services and has \nconsistently worked to ensure the military has the best equipment and \ntraining possible. In 2002, as an example, Senator Kerry voted for the \nlargest increase in the history of the defense budget. This increase \nprovided more than $355 billion in the Defense Department for 2003, an \nincrease of $21 billion over the previous year. This measure includes \n$71.5 billion for procurement programs, such as $4 billion for Air \nForce's F-22 fighter jets which are now going to be stationed at Nellis \nAir Force Base in Las Vegas; $3.5 billion for Joint Strike Fighter \nwhich will also be stationed in Las Vegas at Nellis Air Force Base, and \n$279.3 million for the E-8C Joint Stars aircraft.\n  Senator Kerry's vote also funded a 4.1-percent pay increase for \nmilitary personnel; $160 million for the B-1 bomber defense system \nupgrade; $1.5 billion for a new attack submarine; more than $630 \nmillion for Army and Navy variants of the Black Hawk helicopter; $3.2 \nbillion for additional C-17 transports; $900 million for R of the \nComanche helicopter; and more than $800 million for the Trident \nsubmarine conversion.\n  For someone who has served in the Senate for 20 years--this is just \none Senator's opinion--it speaks well of him that he is not a \nrubberstamp for requests submitted to us by the Defense Department. \nThat is what we are. We are a separate, equal branch of Government, the \nU.S. Congress, and our part of it is the Senate. We have an obligation \nto review very closely what is given to us by the Pentagon and given \nhere. They always ask for more than they deserve, knowing that we are \ngoing to turn down some requests. We have budgets to meet also. It \nspeaks well of Senator Kerry if he did not rubberstamp everything they \nasked for.\n  As to the Bradley fighting vehicle, which was mentioned in the \nprevious speech, Senator Kerry supported $8.5 billion for the Bradley \nprogram. That is not bad. Senator Kerry, for the M-1 Abrams tank, has \nsupported at least $21.5 billion in defense authorization for that \ntank.\n  He has supported all five new aircraft carriers since he joined the \nSenate. Since 1985, John Kerry has voted to start work on each of the \nfive new aircraft carriers: the USS Stennis, USS Truman in 1988, the \nUSS Reagan in 1993, the USS Bush in 1998, and the newest yet unnamed \ncarrier in 2001. So these aircraft carriers, the Stennis, Reagan, Bush, \nand formerly the CVNX, he voted for all of those.\n  The F-15 fighter jets, Senator Kerry supported almost $20 billion in \nDefense authorizations for the F-15. For the F-16, Senator Kerry \nsupported at least $25 billion in Defense authorization.\n  There is going to be a debate tonight and maybe that is why the \nspeech was given, but in testimony before the House Armed Services \nCommittee, Mr. Cheney said:\n\n       If you're going to have a smaller air force, you don't need \n     as many F-16s. . . . The F-16D we basically continue to buy \n     and close it out because we're not going to have as big a \n     force structure and we won't need as many F-16s.\n\n  According to the Boston Globe, Bush's 1991 Defense budget ``kill[ed] \n81 programs for potential savings of $11.9 billion . . . Major weapons \nkilled include[d] . . . the Air Force's F-16 airplane.'' This was \nSecretary Cheney. This was House Member Cheney. This was Vice President \nCheney.\n  It is also important to note that Senator Kerry has supported at \nleast $10.3 billion in Defense authorizations for the B-1 bomber.\n  The Kerry record on the B-2 bomber. He supported $17 billion in \nDefense authorization for the B-2. Mr. Cheney proposed cuts to the B-2 \nprogram. I am sure there were times when he supported it, as did \nSenator Kerry. There were times when Senator Kerry thought there was \ntoo much being spent, as did Secretary Cheney.\n  According to the Boston Globe in 1990:\n\n       Defense Secretary Richard Cheney announced a cutback . . . \n     of nearly 45 percent in the administration's B-2 Stealth \n     bomber program, from 132 programs to 75 . . .\n\n  If we want to go back and revisit history a long time ago, we do not \nhave to go back very far to find out, just a couple of years ago, an \nintroduction of John Kerry by Senator Zell Miller at the Georgia \nDemocratic Jefferson Jackson Day Dinner, and I quote my friend Zell \nMiller:\n\n       My job tonight is an easy one: to present to you one of the \n     nation's authentic heroes, one of this party's best-known and \n     greatest leaders--and a good friend. He was once a lieutenant \n     governor--but he didn't stay in that office 16 years, like \n     someone I know (Miller). It just took two years before the \n     people of Massachusetts moved him to the United States Senate \n     in 1984.\n\n  Further quoting him:\n\n       In his 16 years in the Senate, John Kerry has fought \n     against government waste and worked hard to bring some \n     accountability to Washington. Early in his Senate career in \n     1986, John signed on to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Deficit \n     Reduction Bill, and he fought for balanced budgets before it \n     was considered politically correct for Democrats to do so.\n\n  Senator Miller went on to say:\n\n       John has worked to strengthen our military, reform public \n     education--\n\n  Let me repeat this quote:\n\n       John has worked to strengthen our military, reform public \n     education, boost the economy and protect the environment. \n     Business Week magazine named him one of the top pro-\n     technology legislators and made him a member of its \n     ``Digital Dozen.''\n  Further quoting:\n\n       John was reelected in 1990 and again in 1996--when he \n     defeated popular Republican Governor William Weld in the most \n     closely watched Senate race in the country.\n       John is a graduate of Yale University and was a gunboat \n     officer in the Navy. He received a Silver Star, Bronze Star \n     and three awards of the Purple Heart for combat duty in \n     Vietnam. He later cofounded the Vietnam Veterans of America.\n       As many of you know, I have great affection, some might say \n     an obsession, for my\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\n     two Labrador retrievers, Gus and Woodrow. It turns out John \n     is a fellow dog lover, too, and he better be. His German \n     shepherd, Kim, is about to have puppies. And I just want him \n     to know Gus and Woodrow had nothing to do with that.\n\n  This is a direct quote from Senator Zell Miller and, among other \nthings, I repeat, ``John has worked to strengthen our military.''\n  The record for Senator Kerry supporting the military is, as Senator \nMiller said, a stellar performance. He has worked to strengthen our \nmilitary.\n  I also say that for someone who opposed the MX missile system, I do \nnot think that makes him a bad guy. We in Nevada did not like the \nsystem. It was eventually stopped. If somebody does not support the \nmissile defense system--I think there is probably somebody sitting in \nthe Presiding Officer's chair today, which can only be presided by \nthose on the majority, who does not support the missile defense system. \nSo the fact that people pick and choose what they support for the \nmilitary does not make them bad.\n  Senator Kerry's record is very good, and I have gone over some of the \nthings he supported. I am not going to belabor the point, other than to \nsay that Senator Kerry supported the F-18, and he supported the $60 \nbillion defense for that instrument of war. The Cheney F-18 record, he \nasked for cutbacks on that.\n  Senator Kerry is a person who truly believes in the military. He was \na volunteer as a young man and went and fought, showing heroism in that \nprocess, and he is still showing heroism in his defense of this \ncountry, under tremendous odds, with terribly negative attacks. For \nsomeone who has served with Senator Kerry for two decades in the \nSenate, I am proud of him. I am proud he is the nominee for my party. \nHe is a man of integrity. He has tremendous competence.\n  I was on the Select Committee on MIA/POW. He chaired that. The \ncochair was Bob Smith from New Hampshire. He did a remarkably good job \nin a most difficult situation.\n  I wish today had not turned into a situation of trying to talk about \nPresidential politics, but that is the way it has turned out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nthe issue of reimportation of prescription drugs. I also wanted to talk \nfor a moment about the tax bill that is being negotiated by the \nconference committee between the House and Senate, especially with \nrespect to the runaway plant issue and tax incentives that now occur \nfor those who shut down their American manufacturing plants and export \njobs. I will speak about those two issues briefly.\n  Before I do that, I'd like to address some of the remarks of my \ncolleague from Georgia, who was speaking when I came to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I disagreed strongly with my colleague when I heard his speech at one \nof the national political conventions. He certainly had every right to \ngive that speech. I disagree strongly with the presentation he gave on \nthe Senate floor, but he has every right, of course, to express those \nopinions on the Senate floor.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Georgia. I honor his \nservice. He has provided great public service to this country in many \ndifferent ways, so I honor that service.\n  But I, of course, reserve the right to disagree with my colleague as \nwell, just as he came to the floor and disagreed with some of the votes \nthat have been cast by Senator Kerry.\n  The last time I was on the floor when my colleague from Georgia came \nto speak, he was offering a proposal that we take away the right of the \nAmerican people to vote for Senators. He proposed instead that Senators \nbe appointed or selected by State legislatures, and that the right of \nthe people to vote for Senators should be rescinded.\n  Well, I thought that did not sound like a very modern approach. We \nleft that idea a long time ago in this country, and I got up and spoke \nand indicated I did not have quite such a pessimistic view of this \ncountry's future and certainly did not agree that we ought to revert \nback to the States appointing their Senators and taking away from the \nAmerican people the right to elect Senators. But that was the only \nprevious occasion I recall on which I took the floor of the Senate and \ndisagreed with my distinguished colleague from Georgia. I must say, \nhowever, that I feel compelled to disagree once again.\n\n  I have not come to the Senate floor to be critical, ever, of \nPresident George W. Bush's military record. I would not do that. And I \nwould not be critical of Senator Kerry's military record. Both of them \nserved.\n  My colleague came to talk about Senator Kerry's record in voting for \ndefense for this country. This is not a new technique in American \npolitics. This is timeless. It always happens that someone stands up \nand points at someone else and says: You don't represent this country's \ninterests in defense. You don't support a strong defense. You are not \nwilling to stand up when you need to stand up and be counted and \nsupport a strong defense for this country.\n  Sometimes that works. But let me just say this. I don't think it \nworks when you point at someone who decided on graduation from Yale \nthat he would volunteer to go to Vietnam; not only that, he would \nvolunteer to serve on a swift boat, where he was certain to be involved \nin hostile action. He didn't have to do that. He did that, he \nvolunteered. He received a Bronze Star, a Silver Star, three Purple \nHearts, and still has fragments in his body from the wounds from which \nthose Purple Hearts arose. I don't think it works to point fingers at \nthat man and suggest he, somehow, is weak on defense.\n  My colleague's assessment of Senator Kerry has changed some. Senator \nReid pointed out that in March of 2001, at a banquet in Georgia, my \ncolleague from Georgia introduced Senator Kerry. Here is what he said \nabout him:\n\n       My job tonight is an easy one. It's to present to you one \n     of this Nation's authentic heroes, one of this party's best \n     known and greatest leaders, and a good friend.\n\n  Then he said this, my colleague from Georgia:\n\n       John has worked to strengthen our military, reform public \n     education, boost the economy and protect the environment.\n\n  Let me say that again because it is important. It is at odds with \nwhat we just heard from my colleague from Georgia on the floor of the \nSenate this afternoon. Speaking of John Kerry, my colleague from \nGeorgia said:\n\n       John has worked to strengthen our military.\n\n  This is a speech from March 1, 2001. What is the difference between \nthen and now? John Kerry has had the same record on defense.\n  Incidentally, John Kerry has supported a great amount of this \ncountry's defense: the Apache helicopter, Aegis, The Bradley, Black \nHawk, B-2 bomber, C-17 cargo jets, F-16, F-18, Tomahawk missiles, C-\n130s, and I could go on and on and on. Billions, tens of billions, yes, \ntrillions of dollars for defense Senator Kerry has voted for.\n  What is the difference between March 1, 2001, in my colleague's \nassessment of Senator Kerry where he said ``John,'' speaking of Senator \nKerry, ``has worked to strengthen our military,'' what is the \ndifference between that and the discussion we have just heard today? \nThe difference is, it's an election year and my colleague has, \napparently, decided to change his mind. If there were an Olympic event \ncalled ``stretching,'' I have a couple of personal nominations for who \nmight win the gold medal.\n  This ought not be, in American elections, an attempt to find out who \nis the worst. It ought to be a search for who is the best. Who can best \nlead this country? Who has a vision for the future that grows our \neconomy, that protects our country, protects our homeland, provides for \na strong defense, protects the environment? It is a search, in my \njudgment, for who is the best, not who is the worst.\n  We have two candidates running for President, both fully qualified to \nserve in that office. It does not serve our country well to point at \none and say somehow he is weak on defense, doesn't support defense, \nespecially when it is so at odds with the record. But it is now an \nelection year. I guess almost anything goes.\n\n  There is a term, I suppose, for changing one's mind, and it is called \nflip-flop. I have not used it, but some have used it to the point of \nsignificant repetition this year. I will not use it here\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nexcept to say what we have just heard today is at significant odds, not \nonly with the record of a member of our caucus who has served with \ngreat gallantry but also at odds with the previously stated views of \nthe person who made the speech today.\n  Let me end as I began and say I honor the service of the Senator from \nGeorgia. I disagree with him about these issues. Four weeks from today \nthis country will see fit to make an informed choice between two men \nwho strive to serve for the next 4 years as this country's President. \nBoth candidates, I am sure, care about national security. Both care \nabout homeland security. As was stated in the debate last week, both \nlove this country.\n  I submit, just as one Senator, both are qualified to serve in that \noffice. Both parties have nominated people they choose to support and \nsupport aggressively. I come to the Senate floor today to simply say \nthis: John Kerry is someone with whom I have served for many years. I \nhave watched him vote. The fact is, he supports a strong defense for \nthis country. He always has and always will. When it came time to \nanswer his call, his country's call, he left one of the prestigious \ncolleges in this country upon graduation and said: Let me volunteer. He \nwent to Vietnam. He went in harm's way.\n  There is no amount of energy or wind that can be exerted by others \nwho will change the basic fact of a voting record that is in strong \nsupport of America's defense.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to the Senator from North Dakota, \nthe Senator from North Dakota has served more than 2 decades in the \nCongress of the United States?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. So you have been called to vote on every Defense bill and \nhundreds and hundreds of amendments offered on those Defense bills over \nthe years.\n  As strong as the Senator from North Dakota is on matters relating to \nthe U.S. military, I don't know this, but I will bet there were \noccasions that you voted to cut certain programs; is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator, I have, in fact. I serve on the \nappropriations subcommittee here on the Senate. I care a lot about this \ncountry's defense. And I voted against the MX missile program, because \nI felt it was a terrible waste of money. But I am a strong supporter of \ndefense. I believe anyone who looks at my record will understand the \nweapons programs I supported, significant weapons programs, have added \nstrength and boosted this country's capability.\n  Because I serve on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I \nwatch what others do as well. From a firsthand knowledge, I say that \nSenator Kerry has a strong and aggressive record in supporting this \ncountry and supporting a strong defense for this country.\n  Mr. REID. The point I make, and I would like the Senator to respond \nto this, a person from time to time, in service in the Congress of the \nUnited States, votes for amendments to cut spending in different areas \nfor a lot of different reasons. They still can be some of the strongest \nhawks we have around here; isn't that true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No question about that.\n  My colleague from Georgia was talking about Vice President Cheney and \nJohn Kerry. I didn't quite understand that comparison of their records \non defense. I have lived a couple of doors down from Dick and Lynne \nCheney for a number of years. I know them well. I would never come to \nsuggest somehow that Dick Cheney doesn't support a strong defense. And \nI know John Kerry very well. I certainly wouldn't come to suggest he \ndoesn't support a strong defense. Both of them have records that \ndemonstrate a support for this country's defense.\n  Well, enough about that. I didn't come to the floor of the Senate to \nspeak about that. But I felt that there should be some response to the \nstatement by the Senator from Georgia this afternoon which I think, \nfrankly, is not supported at all by the facts.\n\n                             American Jobs\n\n  On May 5 of this year, we had a vote in the Senate. That vote was on \nan amendment that I had offered, together with my colleague, Senator \nMikulski from Maryland. The intent of the vote was to shut down a \nloophole that rewards U.S. companies that move their manufacturing jobs \noverseas.\n  Yes, we have that kind of loophole. It is a perverse, insidious \nloophole in our Tax Code that says: Shut down your U.S. manufacturing \nplant, get rid of your U.S. employees and outsource those jobs, and, \nGod bless you, while you leave this country, we will give you a tax \ncut.\n  Talk about a perverse incentive to do exactly the wrong thing, that \nis it.\n  We are now seeing the conference committee between the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee meet and negotiate \nover a FSC/ETI bill, sometimes also called the ``jobs bill.'' If they \nfinish putting this bill together in conference and do not include a \nprovision to eliminate this perverse incentive, they will have done \nprecious little to help protect, nurture, and strengthen American jobs.\n  Incidentally, when I offered this amendment on May 5 of this year, \nthe amendment was tabled by a vote of 60 to 39. Sixty Members of the \nSenate voted to say they did not want to shut down a tax loophole that \nprovides an incentive for companies to fire their American workers and \nmove their U.S. jobs overseas. So that loophole still exists in tax \nlaw.\n  Now I read in the paper this morning they really do not want to pay \nfor the cost of this FSC/ETI bill by shutting down loopholes. This is \nunbelievable.\n  We have American companies now that decide they want to do business \nthrough a post office box in the Bahamas or the Grand Caymans. Why? Do \nthey want to be a citizen of the Grand Caymans? Not exactly. They just \nwant to avoid paying U.S. taxes so everyone else can pay taxes that \nthese folks do not pay.\n  I suggest that once companies have decided to move their corporation \nand run their business out of a mailbox in the Bahamas for the purpose \nof avoiding U.S. taxes, the next time they get in trouble maybe they \nought to call the Bahamian Navy to protect them. I understand the \nBahamian Navy has 20 people. Maybe the next time one of these companies \ngets in trouble with some expropriated assets or other issue they can \ncall on the combined flexed muscle of the Bahamian Navy.\n  My point is simple. We have a real problem in this country with the \noutsourcing of jobs. In the last 4 years, we have actually lost jobs at \na time when we are supposed to be creating jobs. We have an expanding \npopulation. We need new jobs. But we are losing jobs.\n  I will not give the same speech I have given previously about the \nRadio Flyer and Huffy bicycles, those quintessentially American \nproducts that are now being made in China. I will not talk about the \nall-American cookie, the Fig Newton, now being made in Monterey, \nMexico, so that it is now Mexican food. I will not give the speech \nabout the outsourcing of these jobs to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, \nIndonesia, and China. But if this country does not wake up soon and get \nrid of these pernicious loopholes in the tax law that say, ship your \nU.S. jobs overseas and we will give you a big tax cut, if we do not do \nthat, we are not going to succeed.\n  Growing an economy requires us to do the right things. We cannot talk \nabout growing the economy and then support tax loopholes and say, by \nthe way, ship your U.S. jobs overseas. That does not work. We are \noutsourcing jobs every single day and no one seems to care much about \nit.\n  Incidentally, that also relates to the trade deficit, because when we \noutsource the jobs and ship the products from those jobs back into this \ncountry, it means we exacerbate the trade deficit, which is the largest \ndeficit in human history.\n  One can make an argument as an economist--I used to teach a bit of \neconomy in college--one can make an argument that the budget deficit is \nmoney we owe to ourselves. We cannot make that argument with respect to \na trade deficit. We owe a trade deficit to other countries. It will be \npaid inevitably by a lower standard of living in our country in the \nfuture.\n  The largest trade deficit in history ought to be cause for \nsubstantial alarm in this Chamber and at the White\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\nHouse. Yet there is almost a conspiracy of silence all around this town \nabout a trade deficit that, in my judgment, hurts this country very \nbadly.\n  Incidentally, Lou Dobbs has written a book about this trade deficit. \nI encourage colleagues and others to read it. His program, more than \nany on television these days, is talking about the danger of this trade \ndeficit.\n  At any rate, as they finalize this jobs bill in conference, which is \ngoing on as I speak, they need to come back to the amendment I offered \nlast May 5 with my colleague, Senator Mikulski. They need to shut down \nthis perverse incentive in tax law, which gives benefits and \nencouragement and financial help to companies that move their jobs \noverseas.\n\n\n                  Reimportation of Prescription Drugs\n\n  Let me make one other point on another subject that I think is \ncritical. We are told we are near the end of this session. Perhaps on \nFriday of this week we will complete our work and then come back for a \nlameduck session, which happens to be a terrible idea. Perhaps, because \nthis Congress has not done much of the right kind of work or much of \nthe work it needs to do, we will have to have a lameduck session.\n  As we near the end of this session, the one relentless issue that \nmany Members of Congress say they care about and want to do something \nabout is the issue of the prices of prescription drugs. We pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs and there are far \ntoo many in this country who cannot afford them.\n  Senior citizens are 12 percent of our population yet they consume \nover one-third of the prescription drugs in America. Senior citizens \nhave reached that point in their lives when they have a fixed income. \nYet one-third of the prescription drugs are taken by our senior \ncitizens. Why? Because they must. These are lifesaving drugs, miracle \ndrugs. My hat is off to the pharmaceutical industry and to the \nresearchers at the National Institutes of Health and others who have \nhelped create these new drugs, but miracle drugs offer no miracle to \nthose who cannot afford to take them.\n  I sat on a bale of straw the other day at a farm in southern North \nDakota with a fellow who is 87 years old. He told me: I fought cancer \nfor 3 years and I think I finally have beaten it. This is an 87-year-\nold man. I fought cancer for 3 years and I think I finally won. For \nthose 3 years, my wife and I drove to Canada to buy the prescription \ndrugs I needed to fight this cancer.\n  Why? Because the same FDA approved drug, the identical pill, is put \nin the same bottle, made by the same company, but is priced at a \ndramatically lower price in Canada.\n  He said: For 3 years, we went to Canada to save that money because we \nhad to. Senior citizens should not have to go to Canada to save money \non prescription drugs.\n  He is right about that. I would prefer that pharmacist be able to go \nto Canada to purchase those lower priced prescription drugs from the \npharmacist in Canada, come back, and pass the savings along to the \nconsumers in our country.\n  By getting rid of the artificial barriers that prevent re-\nimportation, we would put downward pressure on prescription drug prices \nin this country so people would not have to go anywhere but their local \ndrugstore to purchase prescription drugs. They could purchase them here \nfor a fair price. But we are charged the highest prices in the world \nfor these drugs.\n  We are told by the Food and Drug Administration that if we reimport \nprescription drugs from Canada in any organized way that there would be \na safety issue. We are told by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices that there may be a safety issue. We are told by the President \nthat he thinks maybe we should look at this but there might be a safety \nissue.\n  That suggests somehow that Americans are not able to do what \nEuropeans have done everyday for years. The Europeans have something \ncalled parallel trading. Their parallel trading programs allow someone \nfrom Germany to buy a prescription drug from Spain, someone from France \nto buy a prescription drug from Italy.\n  They don't have any safety issues in Europe. The marketplace \ndetermines the price for the drug, and the market puts downward \npressure so the Europeans don't pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs as we do. They do what is called parallel trading, \nand there are no safety issues at all. European officials have \ntestified before our committees. The safety issues simply are not \nthere. It is a bogus issue.\n  We have drafted a bipartisan piece of legislation called the \nPharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act. Myself, along with \nSenators Snowe, McCain, Stabenow, Feingold, and others, we have drafted \na bipartisan piece of legislation that systematically addresses the \nsafety issues so that there cannot be any safety concerns. Our bill \nwould allow the reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada and \nfrom other major developed countries and would put downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices. The House of Representatives has passed such \na bill. That bill is on the calendar at the desk. The bipartisan bill \nwhich we have introduced is similar to the bill that is at the desk. \nYet we are unable to get a final vote in the Senate.\n  We have had substantial discussion. I had a discussion with the \nmajority leader on this subject at midnight one night earlier this year \non the Senate floor. I had a hold on a nominee. I withdrew that hold \nbecause I believed we had an agreement that we were going to work \ntoward an opportunity to have a vote on this legislation. I believed \nthat agreement with the majority leader existed. He now indicates it \nwas not an agreement for a vote. He indicates it was an agreement that \na process would begin and that the authorizing committee would work on \nthis. The authorizing committee worked on it, to be sure. They would \nhave markups scheduled and markups cancelled, markups scheduled and \nmarkups cancelled. The fact is, they never were able to get a bill out \nof committee because they couldn't get consensus on anything. We have a \nconsensus on the bill that is on the calendar. We have a consensus on \nthe bipartisan bill. If there is a vote on that in the Senate, it will \npass by a significant margin. We don't need another consensus. There is \na consensus that already exists. What we need is a vote on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I encourage the majority leader once again to allow us the \nopportunity to cast this vote. Senator McCain, Senator Snowe, myself, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Feingold, Senator Daschle, Senator Kennedy \nand many others have worked very hard on this issue. In my judgment, it \nis a disservice to those who deserve to pay fair prices for \nprescription drugs not to have a vote on this bill. It is a disservice \nto their interests for us not to complete work on this bill during this \nsession of the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two editorials. One is \nby the Chicago Tribune and it is entitled ``Shielding the Drug \nIndustry.'' This says essentially what I have said:\n\n       While Congress dithers, States and cities skirt if not \n     break the law by helping seniors and others take advantage of \n     lower prescription-drug prices in Canada.\n\n  And the editorial talks about the desperate need for Congress to pass \na law dealing with reimportation. They specifically feel that the \nlegislation that is before the Congress would be meritorious and they \ntalk about Peter Rost who is vice president of marketing for one of the \nlargest drug companies who broke ranks with the drug industry in the \nlast couple of weeks and publicly endorsed the proposal in Congress \nthat my colleagues and I have sponsored.\n  Then I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a New York Times \neditorial that is titled ``The Senate's Chance on Drug Costs.''\n\n       If Dr. Bill Frist, the Senator majority leader, knows \n     what's good for the body politic, he will allow a quick floor \n     vote on the drug reimportation bill he has been bottling up \n     for the benefit of President Bush and the pharmaceutical \n     industry.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Oct. 1, 2004]\n\n                      Shielding the Drug Industry\n\n       Last month Peter Rost, a vice president of marketing for \n     Pfizer Inc., broke ranks with the drug industry and his \n     employer by publicly endorsing a proposal in Maryland's \n     Montgomery County to allow its employees to buy cheaper drugs \n     from Canada. Rost disputed industry claims that reimportation \n     would pose a public health risk. ``The real concern about \n     safety is about people who do not take drugs because they \n     cannot afford it,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\n       Rost--who made it clear that he was speaking only for \n     himself, not Pfizer--joins a growing number of city and state \n     officials across the country arguing for reimportation. Only \n     a few months ago, a new law seemed inevitable. Even Health \n     and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson suggested that \n     was so. Unfortunately, ``inevitable'' may not mean any time \n     soon.\n       Competint reimportation bills have been bottled up in the \n     Senate for months. And Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of \n     Tennessee isn't likely to allow a debate or vote before the \n     election. Last month he argued that with only a few weeks \n     left in the session and other pressing issues, there wasn't \n     enough time for a full debate.\n       While Congress dithers, states and cities skirt if not \n     break the law by helping seniors and others take advantage of \n     lower prescription-drug prices in Canada. One such program is \n     supposed to be introduced soon in Illinois.\n       The lack of progress is frustrating. Last spring, at his \n     confirmation hearings, Medicare chief Mark McClellan promised \n     to help develop legislation to allow imports of lower-cost \n     prescription drugs with safeguards to protect consumers. \n     Frist said that the Senate ``will begin a process for \n     developing proposals that would allow for the safe \n     reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs.'' But Sen. \n     Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) said recently that the process had \n     ``led to nothing.''\n       No wonder some politicians are so frustrated that they're \n     openly challenging the Food and Drug Administration in \n     announcing plans to help consumers link to pharmacies in \n     Canada and elsewhere.\n       Opponents of reimportation have argued that it would open \n     America's borders to a flood of tainted drugs, and that the \n     FDA could not guarantee the safety or purity of such imported \n     drugs. That argument isn't convincing. Many drugs are \n     manufactured abroad, and the FDA inspects those factories and \n     ensures that drugs are shipped to America without tampering. \n     That system could be expanded, using fees paid by those who \n     import or export the drugs.\n       Pfizer execs are asserting that Rost ``has no \n     qualifications to speak on importation'' and emphasize that \n     he is not speaking for the company. But his support for \n     reimportation resonates in Illinois, where 67 percent of \n     registered voters supported Gov. Rod Blagojevich's plan to \n     help residents buy prescription drugs from Canada, Ireland \n     and England, according to a recent Tribune/WGN-TV poll. A \n     survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed about 8 in 10 \n     Medicare recipients support allowing Americans to buy drugs \n     from Canada if they can get a lower price. The same study \n     showed more than 6 in 10 don't believe such a system would \n     expose Americans to unsafe medicines from other countries.\n       It seems terribly clear that congressional leaders have one \n     intention here: protecting their heavy campaign contributors \n     in the drug industry from competition. This issue deserves a \n     vote. The stalling has to stop.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 2004]\n\n                   The Senate's Chance on Drug Costs\n\n       If Dr. Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, knows what's \n     good for the body politic, he will allow a quick floor vote \n     on the drug reimportation bill he has been bottling up for \n     the benefit of President Bush and the pharmaceutical \n     industry. A large majority--up to 75 members, by some \n     estimates--would easily pass the bill and delight the \n     organized older voters who have been clamoring for lower-\n     priced Canadian drugs. American consumers are increasingly \n     aware that their average drug prices are 67 percent higher \n     than what Canadians pay for comparable prescriptions. \n     Bipartisan Senate pressure is growing on Dr. Frist, along \n     with threats of the sort of floor rebellion that saw the \n     Republican House rise up last year to pass a drug \n     reimportation plan over Mr. Bush's opposition.\n       Mr. Bush continues to express concern about potential \n     safety risks from imported drugs while insisting that the new \n     Medicare subsidy for prescription drugs will eventually ease \n     the pocketbook pain of distressed retirees. Dr. Frist also \n     continues to express concern about the need to weigh the \n     benefits of lower prices against possible safety risks.\n       But this concern is addressed in the pending bipartisan \n     bill, which mandates that the bargain drugs would come from \n     licensed Canadian pharmacies and wholesalers registered with \n     the federal Food and Drug Administration.\n       The real issue appears to be to avoid forcing Mr. Bush to \n     choose between signing the bill and angering the drug \n     industry, which donates mightily to G.O.P. campaigns, or \n     vetoing it and infuriating older voters.\n       This page has supported the Medicare drug plan, but with \n     the imperative that the administration work harder to \n     restrain costs, however much the pharmaceutical lobby \n     complains. The reimportation bill is a promising cost saver.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I have indicated, there is a bipartisan group of \nSenators who have worked a long while on this issue. The House of \nRepresentatives passed this idea by a wide bipartisan margin. This is \nnot a partisan issue. It is bipartisan.\n  My hope is that the majority leader will decide that as a matter of \nscheduling, we will, before we adjourn sine die, address this issue and \nresolve it for the benefit of the American people. There is no safety \nissue. Everyone knows that is a bogus issue. To continue to raise that \nissue suggests somehow that Americans are unable to do what the \nEuropeans have done routinely year after year. That is, put together a \nsystem--we call it reimportation; in Europe it is called parallel \ntrading--that is safe for consumers and that puts downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            War on Terrorism\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there has \nbeen use of the Senate floor in the last few minutes to discuss the \nPresidential race and to make statements about the situation in Iraq \nand our President's handling of that and our President's own war \nservice, his service in the guard, which was honorable. I don't know \neverything that was said, but let me say that it is very important we \ntake every opportunity to look at what is happening in the war on \nterrorism and the place that Iraq holds in the war on terrorism. Let's \ndon't forget Afghanistan, either.\n  Our country was hit on 9/11, 2001. Everybody in the world knows that. \nIt hasn't been easy to deal with a different kind of enemy, but that is \nwhat we have, a different kind of enemy. Our President has been \nresolute and firm in fighting this enemy every step of the way. \nAmericans can hardly imagine that human beings would actually be able \nto shoot children in the back as they are running away, as happened in \nRussia a few weeks ago, terrorists taking over a school and children \nrunning away to go to safety and being shot in the back. Three hundred \npeople died in that event.\n  People can't imagine an enemy that would cut someone's head off \nbefore a video camera and spread it out across the world. But that has \nhappened with the kind of enemy we are now facing. Does anyone think \nthat kind of enemy can be dealt with with kid gloves, with good \nmanners, as we would have in a debating society? The President doesn't. \nThe Vice President doesn't. They are standing up for our country. They \nare standing up for our country against an unimaginable enemy, and they \nare doing a great job. They are doing a great job because they feel \nfrom their hearts that we must be firm and resolute against this enemy, \nand we must not let anything stand in the way of protecting America and \nprotecting our homeland.\n  That is why I am so proud of our President and our Vice President. \nThey are not asking anyone else if America can defend itself.\n  And we are at war with terrorists who would shoot children in the \nback and cut innocent people's heads off for absolutely no reason \nwhatsoever. So if we are going to use the Senate floor to be part of \nthe campaign, I think we need to make sure the people of our country \nhear both sides. There are real differences. There are real differences \nin how we would handle the war on terrorism, what we do in Iraq. Iraq \nis not an easy situation. We all know that.\n  We know the enemy has infiltrated Iraq. They have come in through the \nporous borders from all over the world to try to disrupt the stability \nand the stabilization of Iraq. Americans have boots on the ground in \nIraq. Our young men and women are fighting for our freedom in the \ndeserts of Afghanistan and in Iraq so that we will be able to debate on \nthe Senate floor, hold our own elections, and live in the freedom that \nwe have come to know. I think our young men and women deserve the \nrespect that we have a united country in this war and in this effort. \nThis is every bit as much a fight for freedom as any war in which \nAmerica has been engaged.\n  Our President and our Vice President put one thing, and one thing \nonly, first: the security of the American people.\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\nThey want every child in our country to grow up with the same kind of \nfreedom and opportunity every one of us in the Senate has had growing \nup. If we let terrorists curtail the way we live, we will have lost. We \nwill have said that we are not going to answer the call of our \ngeneration to maintain the freedom and opportunity of our country, \nwhich we have been able to enjoy. That is unthinkable. Our President \nand our Vice President are standing firm for the protection of the \nAmerican people. They are standing firm for our economy.\n  One of the other hits we took on 9/11/01 was the hit to our economy. \nThe tourism industry went down, the airline industry was in trouble, \nand it had a ripple effect throughout our economy. But our President \nhas remained firm in the way we would try to stabilize the stock market \nand get jobs back and get people back to work. He is doing it with tax \ncuts, so that people will have more of their own money to spend and \nthey will put it into the economy. Guess what. That has made the \ndifference.\n  The turnaround in our economy started right after the tax cuts were \nsigned by the President. The stock market is up and jobs are coming \nback; 1.7 million jobs have been put on this year alone. We are almost \nback to where we were before 9/11.\n  So, Mr. President, if we are going to use the Senate floor to talk \nabout the election that is going to happen in the next 6 weeks in this \ncountry, I think we better look at the record. The record is good. We \nhave taken the steps that are necessary after being hit by terrorists \nin a way that we could never have imagined being hit on 9/11. Our \nhomeland is more secure. Is it everything it needs to be? No. The \nPresident will tell you that. Anyone will tell you that. But it is a \nwhole lot safer than it was on September 10, 2001.\n  We are taking the steps right now on the Senate floor to reform our \nintelligence-gathering capabilities. We are going to have the best \nintelligence operation in the entire world. We are already making great \nstrides. We have made great improvements. There is much more sharing \nand, in fact, the increased and better intelligence has caused us \nto know that there is a heightened alert right now. But we are taking \nthe steps to codify that and put it into statutory form. We are doing \nexactly what we ought to be doing to assure that our country is \nprepared to go forward, to stay the course in this war, and to win the \nwar on terrorism. We are going to do it one step at a time, with a \nPresident who is absolutely focused on our national security.\n\n  Mr. President, I am proud of our President. I am proud of our Vice \nPresident. They are staying focused. A lot of people think this \ncampaign has gotten pretty rough. Campaigns in America are rough. None \nof us like it, but no one is going to unilaterally disarm. Therefore, \nwe are going to make sure that the truth comes out so that people can \nsee the differences between the two candidates. There doesn't have to \nbe any mud slung in this campaign because the differences are very \ngreat. Our President is resolute that he is going to win the war on \nterrorism and protect the American people, and he hopes we can fight \nthe war on terrorism on the turf where they are rather than allowing \nthem on our turf. That is his strategy, and it is the right one.\n  We have a President who is firmly committed to a domestic agenda that \nincludes an education for every child in our country; quality health \ncare for every person in our country, to bring more people who are \ninsured into our health care system; to have malpractice reform so that \nwe will be able to assure quality health care at a reasonable cost. Our \nPresident is committed to Social Security reform so that it will be \nthere for our seniors, not just for the next 20 years, but for the next \n100 years. It is going to take leadership. It is going to take \nleadership and vision for the next President of the United States. Our \nPresident is doing exactly the right thing in focusing on our security, \non education for children, on quality health care for all of the people \nin our country. Our President is doing a great job. I am proud of him. \nI think the people of America--the more they focus on not only the \naccomplishments of the last 4 years, but the vision for the future--our \nPresident is talking about his vision for the next 4 years and what we \nwill be able to do for our country that will build on the rising \neconomy, the better national security that he has already put in place.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor, and I hope that we can \nkeep this debate on the differences on the issues. I hope we will not \nhave extraneous charges and the use of the Senate floor for extraneous \ncharges that do not have a place in the civilized debate that I hope we \nwill have on the floor of the Senate in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the parliamentary \nsituation in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on S. 2485.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair. I wish to make some remarks on an \namendment that I have filed. I will not ask that that amendment be \nbrought before the Senate this evening, but I look toward doing so at \nan appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, 3 years have passed since the attacks of September 11, \n2001. Largely because of the anger and the concern and the desire to \nshow that the lives of those 3,000 Americans who were sacrificed on \nthat day had meaning, we are nearing passage of a meaningful \nintelligence reform plan. But as we commit ourselves to implementing \nthis plan, I remain convinced that we still will not be doing all we \ncan do, all we should do to win the war on terror and to hold our \nadversaries to account.\n\n  Why do I hold those views?\n  It is my view that we have allowed to escape at least one and \npossibly more make-believe allies that have and may be today supporting \nterrorists with financial, logistical, and even diplomatic resources. \nThese allies are saying one thing in their public relations campaign \nbut doing quite another in their palaces, in the halls of government \nwhen it comes to nurturing al-Qaida and other terrorist networks.\n  Let me give a little explanation of why I think this issue is so \nimportant. For 19 relatively young men, most of whom were strangers to \neach other, to be able to come into the United States without much \ncommand of the English language and almost no knowledge of American \nculture and practices, stay in this country for, in some cases, 18 \nmonths, to be able to refine a plan that had been developed prior to \ntheir entry, to deal with unexpected complications, such as the \ndetaining of the 20th hijacker, and to be able to practice that plan \nand finally execute it with the tragic consequences of September 11 is \nnot an easy task. Many have asked how could they have done it.\n  I believe, for one thing, these 19 people were more capable than we \nmay have originally thought, and that itself is a chilling observation, \nbecause it says something about the adversary we are going to continue \nto be facing once we restart the war on terror.\n  But second, I also believe they were not here alone. In that famous \nAugust 2001 briefing which the President received at Crawford, TX, one \nof the items in that briefing which has, in my opinion, been \ninadequately observed was that the President was told that al-Qaida had \na network inside the United States.\n  Supplementing that network, I believe the Saudis were given license \nto take advantage of a network that was already in existence in the \nUnited States for another purpose, primarily the purpose of surveilling \ncountrymen who were in the United States to determine if they were \nfulminating any plots that might be adverse to the interests of the \nroyal family. That network was then made available to at least 2 and \nmaybe more, possibly all, of the 19 hijackers.\n  I will remind my colleagues again, as I have previously, that much of \nthe information that makes this case is contained in the 27 pages of \nthe final report of the House and Senate inquiry into 9/11, the 27 \npages which were censored by the administration and, therefore, have \nnever been made available to the American people. But I can say this: A \nCalifornia-based former employee of the Saudi Civil Aviation Authority, \na then 42-year-old Saudi national named Omar al-Bayoumi, had extensive \ncontacts with two of the Saudi national hijackers, Khalid al\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\nMihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi. These two men had entered the United States \nin January of 2000 after having attended a summit of terrorists in \nMalaysia a few weeks earlier.\n  Bayoumi was paid $40,000 a year by a Saudi Government subcontractor, \nbut he never showed up for work. He was what is referred to as a ghost \nemployee. Indeed, a CIA agent described him as a spy of the Saudi \nGovernment assigned to keep track of Saudi citizens in southern \nCalifornia, particularly the large number of Saudi students studying at \nhigher education institutions there.\n\n  The day that al-Bayoumi met the two hijackers at a Los Angeles \nrestaurant, he had first attended a meeting at the Saudi consulate with \na Saudi official who subsequently was denied reentry into the United \nStates because of his alleged terrorist background.\n  He then, over lunch, invited the two terrorists to come from Los \nAngeles to San Diego where he proceeded to first allow them to live \nwith him until they could arrange for an apartment, he cosigned their \nlease, paid their first month's rent, hosted a welcome party, and \nhelped them get a variety of services, including driver's licenses and \nflight school applications. He introduced them to others who served as \ntheir translator and other support roles.\n  This is just one strand in the web of connections between hijackers \nand the Saudi Government. But, again, I am restricted in terms of how \nfulsome the details can be.\n  There is other evidence of Saudi complicity, especially when it comes \nto financing al-Qaida. In a monograph on the finances of al-Qaida \nprepared by the 9/11 Commission, staff investigators found government-\nsponsored Islamic charities had helped provide funds for Osama bin \nLaden. The monograph states:\n\n       Fund-raisers and facilitators throughout Saudi Arabia and \n     the Gulf raised money for al Qaeda from witting and unwitting \n     donors and diverted funds from Islamic charities and mosques.\n\n  It attributed this thriving network to ``a lack of awareness and a \nfailure to conduct oversight over institutions [which] created an \nenvironment in which such activity has flourished.''\n  The 9/11 Commission investigators concluded:\n\n       It appears that the Saudis have accepted that terrorist \n     financing is a serious issue and are making progress in \n     addressing it. It remains to be seen whether they will (and \n     are able to do) enough, and whether the U.S. Government will \n     push them hard enough, to substantially eliminate al Qaeda \n     financing by Saudi sources.\n\n  At least one other authority body is even more skeptical. The Council \non Foreign Relations established a task force on terrorist financing, \nand representatives of the task force testified last week on the 29th \nof September before a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee.\n  Mallory Factor, vice chairman of the Independent Task Force on \nTerrorist Financing, said this:\n\n       The Saudi Government has clearly allowed individual and \n     institutional financiers of terror to operate and prosper \n     within Saudi borders.\n\n  Let me repeat that statement:\n\n       The Saudi government has clearly allowed individuals and \n     institutional financiers of terror to operate and prosper \n     within Saudi borders.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Saudi Arabia has enacted a new anti-money laundering law \n     designed to impede the flow from Saudi Arabia to terrorist \n     groups. However, significant enforcement by Saudi Arabia of \n     several of these new laws appears to be lacking. . . .\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Furthermore, even if these laws were fully implemented, \n     they contain a number of exceptions and flaws which weaken \n     their effectiveness in curbing terror financing. . . . Quite \n     simply, Saudi Arabia continues to allow many key financiers \n     of global terror to operate, remain free and go unpunished \n     within Saudi borders.\n\n  Lee Wolosky, the codirector of the Council on Foreign Relations Task \nForce, added:\n\n       There is no evidence . . . that since September 11, 2001, \n     Saudi Arabia has taken public punitive actions against any \n     individual for financing terror.\n\n  That directly contradicts the statements made by this administration \nthat the Saudis have been cooperating and continue to deserve to be \nconsidered as allies.\n  Despite all of the evidence, President Bush has said nothing to \nsuggest that he is reconsidering the assurance he offered to the \nAmerican people in the Rose Garden on September 24, 2001, when he said:\n\n       As far as the Saudi Arabians go . . . they've been nothing \n     but cooperative. Our dialogue has been one of--as you would \n     expect friends to be, able to discuss issues.\n\n  On Sunday, like several million Americans, I watched the Sunday \ninterview programs and I saw a lady I admire, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, as \nshe attempted to explain why she and other key members of this \nadministration, aware of the fact that there was a considerable \ndisagreement as to whether aluminum tubes which were destined for Iraq \nbut had been intercepted, but which had been determined by the best \nexperts in the United States, those in the Department of Energy, to not \nbe appropriate for the construction of a centrifuge, one of the \npreliminary steps in the development of weaponizable material--she said \nany prudent policymaker would have to take the most conservative view \nif there was a disagreement, take the view that would best protect the \nAmerican people.\n  I say this: If we have the kinds of comments that have come from \nresponsible citizens who served on the 9/11 Commission, statements that \nhave been made by a respected independent task force of the Council on \nForeign Relations, and the recommendations of the joint House-Senate \ntask force, why do we not take the same conservative position as \nrelates to Saudi Arabia?\n  This is what our colleagues in this Chamber and the House said in \nDecember of 2002. Recommendation 19 of the final report of the joint \ninquiry stated: The intelligence community, and particularly the FBI \nand the CIA, should aggressively address the possibility that foreign \ngovernments are providing support to or are involved in terrorist \nactivity targeting the United States and U.S. interests. State-\nsponsored terrorism substantially increases the likelihood of \nsuccessful and more lethal attacks against the United States. This \nissue must be addressed.\n\n  If we believe that we should take the stance which is most protective \nof the security of the people of the United States of America, why have \nwe taken this position of coddling passivity and deference to the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia with this record of their support of terrorism?\n  My lack of confidence in both Saudis and the administration, my lack \nof confidence in their ability to level with the American people, leads \nme to offer this amendment on behalf of the families of those who died \non 9/11.\n  Several groups of families and survivors have filed lawsuits against \nthe Saudi Government, members of the Saudi Royal Family, other Saudi \nentities, alleging that they were part of a conspiracy that led to the \nsuccessful attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.\n  The Saudi Government, in Federal court, has moved to strike not only \nthe Royal Family, not only individuals but also to strike virtually \nevery entity under the umbrella, that those entities are a part of the \nsovereign immunity in Saudi Arabia and therefore come under the \numbrella of sovereign immunity from their acts.\n  The effect of this position is to prevent the victims' families from \nproceeding to the discovery portion of the trial which could yield \nvaluable information about the Saudi Government's activities. This \namendment would waive sovereign immunity protections for foreign \ngovernments involved in lawsuits related to the September 11 attacks. \nIt would not automatically declare that the Saudi Government or any \nother government is responsible for the attacks or was complicit in the \nattacks, but it would give victims' families a chance to have their day \nin court. While exceptions like this are rare, this is because \nterrorist attacks of the magnitude of September 11 are rare.\n  Congress has waived sovereign immunity before. In the case of the \nIran hostage-taking, sovereign immunity was waived because there was \nreason to suspect that the hostage-takers had received support from the \nIranian Government. We decided an exception to the law was necessary in \nthis case in order to both get to the truth and see that justice was \nprovided for innocent American families.\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\n  I believe the family members of the victims of 9/11 deserve to have \nan equal opportunity to get to the truth, especially in light of the \ncoverup our Government has engaged in and which has prevented the \nAmerican people from a full understanding of the extent of that \ncomplicity.\n  For all we know, the network which functioned prior to 9/11 and which \ncontributed to the ability of these 19 people who were new to the \nUnited States, woefully deficient in the English language, to be able \nto hide out for 18 months and then refine, practice, and execute a plan \nof terror, that infrastructure is still in place. This amendment would \nhelp these families and the people of the United States better \nunderstand what has happened to us in the past, what the threat might \nbe today, and to hold those responsible and accountable for their \nactions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Flu Vaccine Supply\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I come to the Senate floor this afternoon to express a \ngrave concern about today's announcement concerning a new threat to \nAmerica's flu vaccine supply--and to urge that firm and decisive action \nis needed to meet this potential deadly threat.\n  First, the facts as we know them: Earlier this morning, the \nCalifornia-based Chiron Corporation announced that British regulators \nhad unexpectedly imposed a 3-month suspension of operations of its \nLiverpool plant, citing unspecified manufacturing problems.\n  What does this mean? Mr. President, I believe today's announcement \nmay prove to have worldwide and deadly consequences. This is because \nChiron's Liverpool facility is today one of only two major \nmanufacturers of flu vaccine worldwide, and it supplies approximately \none-half of the total U.S. flu vaccine supply.\n  More specifically, if Chiron is unable to ship its vaccine this year, \nthe U.S. will lose approximately 46 million doses of flu vaccine, just \nunder half of the anticipated supply of about 100 million doses. \nIdeally, as many as 185 million doses would be needed to protect all \nAmericans who are at risk. This gives you some idea of the parameters \nof the problem.\n  Because flu vaccine is produced seasonally and cannot easily be \naccelerated on short notice, and because the annual flu season \ntypically begins in October--the month we are now in--this announcement \neffectively deals a body blow to U.S. preparedness as we enter this \nyear's flu season.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am \nespecially concerned about the effects of this development on America's \nsenior population, who account for over 90 percent of the approximately \n36,000 American flu deaths each year.\n  Indeed, just last week the Aging Committee held a hearing to examine \nways of improving flu preparedness and vaccination rates.\n  At our hearing, Chiron president and CEO testified that Chiron was on \ntrack to deliver its full complement of flu vaccine this year. \nAccording to initial accounts, today's announcement from the British \nGovernment came as an alarming surprise, both to Chiron itself and to \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which itself had conducted \nreviews of Chiron's operations in recent months.\n  Time will tell, of course, but there is no question that today's \ndevelopments have caught the world public health community off guard.\n  So what can be done?\n  First, I am very encouraged that FDA, CDC, and the NIH have moved \nswiftly today to convene emergency meetings of top vaccine experts to \nconfer with their British counterparts and to seek assistance from the \nother major vaccine manufacturer, Aventis. I understand that Secretary \nTommy Thompson has already dispatched a team to England to address this \ncrisis.\n  I believe these discussions are extremely important. Of course, \nsafety must always be our paramount consideration. Nevertheless, \nconsidering Chiron's critical role in flu vaccine production, coupled \nwith the deadly worldwide threat that confronts us, I urge U.S. and \nBritish scientists and officials to do everything in their power to \ncorrect whatever problems might exist in time to permit shipment of at \nleast some of Chiron's vaccine this year.\n  Second, I believe it is imperative that Federal authorities act \nswiftly to guarantee that, if there is to be a sharp drop in vaccine \nsupplies, priority distribution go first to America's elderly and to \nthe young children, as well as certain other especially vulnerable \npopulations.\n  Third, today's alarming announcement is a wake-up call that better \nlong-term flu preparedness is imperative. As we heard at last week's \nhearing, this is especially true in light of the fact that scientists \nnow believe that a return of an especially strong pandemic strain of \nflu is overdue.\n  Scientific progress is being made in a number of promising areas, \namong them options for developing cell-based alternatives to today's \negg-based technology. I am also encouraged that the administration in \nrecent months has made substantial progress in its pandemic \npreparedness planning.\n  In addition, Senator Evan Bayh and I introduced legislation earlier \nthis year to further address some of these longer-term issues. For \nexample, our legislation, S. 2038, would encourage an increase in \nvaccine production capacity by offering a tax credit for companies to \ninvest in the construction or renovation of production facilities and \nfor the production of new and improved vaccines. Our legislation also \ncontains provisions to encourage greater volume of vaccine production, \nas well as to improve outreach and education about the importance of \nflu vaccination.\n  Finally, I want to close by noting that perhaps the single most \nimportant reason today's announcement is so potentially devastating is \nthe simple fact that we have only two manufacturers for flu vaccine.\n  Stop and think about that. In a country as great and as rich as ours, \nwith our medical science as advanced as it is, we rely only on two \ncompanies to produce this vaccine. Why? In part, for example, it is \nbecause in recent years vaccine companies, in trying to guess what the \nmarket is going to be and to produce for the market, lost well over \n$120 million and simply could not take those kinds of losses.\n  That is why Senator Evan Bayh and I introduced legislation to try, \nagain, to resolve this problem.\n  Why? Again, flu is a worldwide killer, and the need for vaccine is \nvery clear. Yet the market has dwindled to a point that the pullout of \njust one company, as was announced today, devastates a worldwide supply \nof vaccine.\n  An additional factor underlying this problem, as in so many other \nsectors, is the issue of tort liability. The risk of lawsuit is so \ngreat today that some of these companies are simply closing their shops \nand walking away.\n  Today is not the time to discuss this particular issue in great \ndetail, but as we move forward we need to ask ourselves, can we put the \nAmerican population at risk simply because we have developed such a \nlitigious society that everybody has to sue? When they do that, we find \nourselves, as the announcement today found us, dramatically wanting for \ntens of millions of Americans who may this year not receive the \nvaccinations they need. Is that a risk that is acceptable, or is that a \nrisk that is too high?\n  There is no question in my mind, and there is no question in the \nminds of the scientists in public health, that flu is a killer. Last \nyear, 36,000 Americans died as a result of the flu or conditions \nstemming from it.\n  Once again, I commend the swift response of Secretary Thompson and \nothers. I hope this grave situation can successfully be addressed. If \nit is, many will be saved.\n  We do not yet know all the facts, and again, safety is paramount, but \nif the American Government and the British Government can perhaps come \nto some degree of accord regarding acceptable and safe development and \nproduction standards between ourselves and Great Britain, thousands of \nAmericans and others worldwide may yet receive the vaccine they need.\n  This is a critical issue, and it is an issue that will play out in \nthe coming days. But whatever transpires, I believe this Congress, the \nCDC, the FDA,\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\nand all who are involved in this issue must clearly prioritize vaccine \ndistribution first for our very elderly, our very vulnerable, and our \nyoungest citizens--those who are the greatest potential victims of this \ntragic illness.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Just the Numbers\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in this election time we are hearing a \ngreat deal of discussion about the economy. We are hearing all kinds of \nspin being placed on the economic numbers. I don't come to the floor to \ntry to put any spin on the numbers, but I do come to try to list the \nnumbers. As I read the various speeches on both sides of the aisle, \nmany times they pick out one particular portion of the economy that can \nbe used to make a point for or against where their political position \nis. I want to simply outline the numbers and let those who may be \nwatching come to their own conclusions as to whether the economy is \ndoing well.\n  First number: Over the past four quarters the U.S. economy has \nexpanded by 4.8 percent. Let's put that in perspective. In that same \nperiod, Italy has seen its economy expand by 1.2 percent; Germany 2 \npercent; 2.8 percent in France; 3.6 percent in Britain; and 4.2 percent \nin Japan. Japan is emerging from a 15-year recession, and they are \nthrilled about their growth at 4.2 percent. In America, we are growing \nat 4.8 percent. Those are the numbers.\n  Comparison to our own history: The U.S. growth rate over the past \nyear has been nearly a full percentage point above the 3.9 percent \ngrowth over a comparable period when President Clinton was seeking \nreelection. August's 5.4 unemployment rate, for those who want to focus \nprimarily on jobs, is well below the average of the 1970s. The average \nunemployment in the 1970s was 6.2; the 1980s, the average unemployment \nin the 1980s was 7.3; and the 1990s, the average unemployment in the \n1990s was 5.75. Our current unemployment is 5.4.\n  The nonfarm business sector productivity growth has averaged 4.6 \npercent per year from the beginning of 2002 through the second quarter \nof this year. Unprecedented in the post-World War II period, the \nannualized productivity increases since early 2002 have been nearly \nthree times the annual average rate that prevailed from 1994 to 1996. \nLet me repeat that. If you go back to those 2 years from 1994 to 1996, \nagain trying to take a comparable period, 2 years before a Presidential \nelection, the average annual rate in that period was 1.6 percent. Right \nnow our annualized rate is three times as high.\n  Consumer price inflation was 3.4 percent in 2000. Since then it has \naveraged 2.4 percent. Inflation is under control. Inflation \nexpectations are very well contained.\n  So we are having growth higher than we have had. We are having \nproductivity higher than we have had. We are having unemployment lower \nthan we have had. And inflation and inflation expectations are well \nunder control.\n  I could go on with additional statistics. Let me cite a few very \nrecent numbers to bring people up to date. One of the things about \neconomics that many of us forget is that the numbers take a while to be \naccumulated. You will have a number released and then, when the \neconomists go back through the data, they come back and say, no, that \nnumber was wrong. We now know that the average was either higher or \nlower than we had indicated.\n  The second quarter GDP growth of this year was originally reported at \n2.8 percent below the numbers I have been talking about, causing some \npeople to say, see, the economy has slowed down. They have now been \nrevised. The economists have gone back, reexamined the data, and have \nrevised that 2.8 percent upward to 3.3 percent, which gives us the \naverage for the four quarters that I cited earlier. The economy is \ndoing very well. Business investment increased by 12.5 percent and has \nnow increased for five consecutive quarters. Export growth was strong \nand the revised second quarter trade deficit was smaller than \npreviously reported.\n\n  Residential investment, primarily home building, is now estimated to \nhave grown at a stellar 16.5 percent annualized rate. This is the \nsecond strongest quarterly growth in home building in 8 years. More \nAmericans own their home now than at any time in American history. \nHousehold wealth--which represents for many people the equity in their \nhomes--is at a record high. It hit a record high--the highest in \nAmerican history--in the second quarter of 2004.\n  For those who talk about squeezes and those who talk about Americans \nwho cannot save anything, Americans who cannot acquire any wealth, I \nsuggest that you look at the facts. Again, according to the Federal \nReserve data, U.S. household wealth hit a record high in the second \nquarter of 2004. It will be interesting to see where it goes in the \nthird quarter.\n  New home sales dropped off for a while. People said maybe the \nrecovery was slowing down. New home sales regained their vigor in \nAugust, with a 9.4-percent annualized rate of increase. Construction \nactivity remains on a solid footing. Housing starts were up by a robust \n9 percent in August over the year before. As I said, the home ownership \nrate in the United States is now 69 percent, the highest in American \nhistory.\n  It is interesting that we focus on the percentage, because the growth \nof the population would allow people to say, yes, it is the highest in \nhistory numerically, but a smaller percentage of Americans are living \nin their own homes. That is not true. It is not only the highest \nnumerically; it is the highest percentage of Americans owning their own \nhome and living in their own home.\n  These are the facts. We will let the politicians in this election \nspin whatever they want to spin, but I hope everybody will ultimately \ncome back to the facts.\n  If I may put my interpretation on the facts which I believe are very \ndefensible, the recovery out of the recent recession has not only taken \nhold, not only gained traction, it is strong, it is growing, and the \nnext President of the United States--whomever he may be--will inherit a \nvery strong and robust economy. He will take credit for it because it \nwill have happened on his watch, but the groundwork for this economy, \nfor the next economy, has been laid already. We are seeing the results \nnow.\n  Economists are looking back and saying 2002 was a better year than we \nthought; 2003 was a stronger year in the last half; and in 2004, the \neconomy is growing at a rate at which every other industrialized \ncountry in the world would be very grateful. America is doing \neconomically very well. Those are the facts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, shortly, I am hopeful we will be able to \nclear three amendments offered by the Senator from Alaska--three \npending amendments. We have reached compromises due to a lot of hard \nwork and good faith on both parts. We have asked the Senator from \nAlaska if he is available to come over to the floor now, and I am \nhopeful we will be able to resolve those three pending amendments this \nevening.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 447, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 447) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the President of the United States should \n     exercise his constitutional authority to pardon posthumously \n     John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson for Mr. Johnson's racially \n     motivated 1913 conviction that diminished his historic \n     significance and unduly tarnished his reputation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I would like to be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \napprove a Senate resolution, which I introduced with my colleagues \nSenators Hatch and Kennedy, calling on the President to exercise his \nconstitutional authority to pardon posthumously the world's first \nAfrican-American heavyweight champion, John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson, \nfor his racially motivated 1913 conviction.\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with the plight of \nJack Johnson, he is considered by many to be the most dominant athlete \nin boxing history. Born in the Jim Crow-era South in 1878 to parents \nwho were former slaves, he realized his talent for the sweet science \nearly in life. In order to make a living, Johnson traveled across the \ncountry fighting anyone willing to face him. But he was denied \nrepeatedly on purely racial grounds a chance to fight for the world/\nheavyweight title. For too long, African American fighters were not \nseen as legitimate contenders for the championship. Fortunately, after \nyears of perseverance, Johnson was finally granted an opportunity in \n1908 to fight the then-reigning title holder, Tommy Burns. Johnson \nhandily defeated Burns to become the first African-American heavyweight \nchampion.\n  Jack Johnson's success in the ring, and sometimes indulgent lifestyle \noutside of it, fostered resentment among many and raised concerns that \nJohnson's continued dominance in the ring would somehow disrupt what \nwas then perceived by many as a ``racial order.'' So, a search for a \nwhite boxer who could defeat Johnson began--a recruitment effort that \nwas dubbed the search for the ``great white hope.'' That hope arrived \nin the person of former champion Jim Jeffries who returned from \nretirement to fight Johnson in 1910. But when Johnson defeated \nJeffries, race riots broke out as many sought to avenge the loss.\n  Following the defeat of the ``great white hope,'' the Federal \nGovernment launched an investigation into the legality of Johnson's \nrelationships with white women. The Mann Act, which was enacted in \n1910, outlawed the transport of white women across State lines for the \npurpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for ``any other immoral \npurpose.'' Using the ``any other immoral purpose'' clause as a pretext, \nFederal law enforcement officials set out to ``get'' Johnson.\n  On October 18, 1912, he was arrested for transporting his white \ngirlfriend across State lines in violation of the Act. But the charges \nwere dropped when the woman, whose mother had originally tipped off \nFederal officials, refused to cooperate with authorities. She later \nmarried Johnson.\n  Yet Federal authorities persisted in their persecution of Johnson, \npersuading a former white girlfriend of Johnson's to testify that he \nhad transported her across State lines. Her testimony resulted in \nJohnson's conviction in 1913, when he was sentenced to 1 year and a day \nin Federal prison. During Johnson's appeal, one prosecutor admitted \nthat ``Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but that it \nwas his misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting \nthe intermarriage of whites and blacks.''\n  Johnson fled the country to Canada, and then traveled to various \nEuropean and South American countries, before losing his heavyweight \nchampionship title in Cuba in 1915. He returned to the United States in \n1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in Federal \nprison. Despite this obvious injustice, Johnson refused to turn his \nback on the country that betrayed him. During World War II, he traveled \nthe country to promote war bonds. Johnson died in an automobile \naccident in 1946.\n  A gross injustice was done to Jack Johnson when a Federal law was \nmisused to send him to prison. The Senate's passage of this resolution \nand the President's pardon of Jack Johnson would not right this \ninjustice, but it would recognize it, and shed light on the \nachievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry \nand prejudice. Taking such actions would allow future generations to \ngrasp fully what Jack Johnson accomplished against great odds and \nappreciate his contributions to society unencumbered by the taint of \nhis criminal conviction.\n  Jack Johnson was a flawed individual who was certainly controversial. \nBut he was also a historic American figure, whose life and \naccomplishments played an instrumental role in our Nation's progress \ntoward true equality under the law. And he deserved much better than a \nracially motivated conviction,\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\nwhich denied him of his liberty, and served to diminish his athletic, \ncultural, and historic significance.\n  The pardon of Jack Johnson would not be an act that would benefit Mr. \nJohnson or his heirs. Rather, his pardon would be a nominal but useful \ncorrective of a shameful injustice that would serve as a testament of \nAmerica's resolve to live up to its noble ideals of justice and \nequality. Instead of erasing from our memories the injustice that \ndeprived a great athlete of his livelihood and freedom, we have an \nopportunity to speak as one in condemning the public intolerance and \nmisuse of Federal authority that was perpetrated against this man.\n  While we know that we cannot possibly right the wrong that was done \nto Jack Johnson, we can take this small step toward acknowledging his \nmistreatment and removing the cloud that casts a shadow on his legacy.\n  I urge adoption of the resolution.\n  I will mention there is a great American named Ken Burns who may be \nthe foremost maker of documentaries in America. Ken Burns, Mohammad \nAli, and many other respected figures throughout America have formed a \ncommittee for the pardon of Jack Johnson. I hope we can get it sooner \nor later.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin calling for a presidential pardon for Jack Johnson, the first black \nheavyweight champion in boxing, who was unjustly persecuted in 1913 for \nbeing famous, wealthy, powerful--and black.\n  Jack Johnson was the son of a former slave. He grew up in Galveston \nin the era of segregation, harsh racial bigotry, and vicious lynching. \nBut Johnson was tough and talented, and he saw a way up. He fought for \nmoney in ``battle royals,'' in which groups of black men fought until \nthe last one standing was declared the winner. He turned professional \nand, at the age of 25, won the Negro heavyweight championship. It was \n1903, and boxing was widely and closely followed throughout the Nation.\n  White fighters didn't fight blacks professionally, but Johnson's \npopularity grew. He was an innovative boxer and was sometimes ridiculed \nfor his smart and relaxed style, even though it was considered a \nbrilliant style when it was later adopted by white boxers.\n  With no worlds left to conquer in segregated boxing, Johnson set his \nsights on challenging white boxers, and sportswriters began to support \nhis challenge. Jim Jeffries, the white heavyweight champion, retired, \nrather than face Johnson. The title went to Tommy Burns, and a match \nwas finally scheduled. Johnson defeated him easily, and whites \nimmediately began to scour the country for a ``great white hope'' to \nwin the title. Under intense pressure, Jeffries came out of retirement \nto face Johnson on the Fourth of July, 1910, in a fight called the \n``Battle of the Century.'' Johnson defeated him easily.\n  Blacks in cities and towns across the country celebrated and some \nwere attacked and even killed. Race riots erupted in some cities. In \n1912, the Justice Department tried to do what no boxer could do at the \ntime, and knock Johnson out. The Justice Department went to vindictive \nlengths to punish the heavyweight champion of the world because of the \ncolor of his skin. The law they chose was the Mann Act, which had been \nenacted by Congress in 1910, and which made it a crime to transport a \nwoman across state lines ``for the purpose of prostitution or \ndebauchery,'' or for ``any other immoral purpose.''\n  Johnson flaunted his boxing success and defined bigotry. He had money \nand power at a time when the vast majority of blacks were poor and \npowerless. He was, athletically, the king of the hill, when blacks were \nregarded as physically inferior to whites. Relationships between a \nblack man and white woman were often deemed ``immoral'' in those days, \nbut Johnson ignored such views. ``I act in my relations with people of \nother races as if prejudice did not exist,'' he said.\n  Johnson's relationships with white women enraged whites, and the \nJustice Department searched his past for a suitable case and convicted \nhim. Most of the charges were thrown out on appeal, but enough remained \nto sentence Johnson to one year in prison. At the time, the prosecutor \nsaid Johnson may have been persecuted ``as an individual'' but ``it was \nhis misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the \nintermarriage of whites and blacks.'' Johnson was the embodiment of the \nhopes of countless blacks, and the prosecutor admitted the conviction \nwas meant to ``send a message.'' Johnson served his one-year sentence, \nwas shunned by the boxing community, and died in 1946.\n  A pardon now would also send a message--that Johnson deserves his \nrightful place in sports history and the Nation's history.\n  Civil rights is still the unfinished business in America. Sadly, \ngenerations of Americans whose names we will never know suffered \nthrough whole lifetimes of bigotry because of the racism that stained \nour Nation for so long. Correcting such a major symbol of injustice in \nthe past reminds us of how much we still must do in the future.\n  I commend Senator McCain for introducing this resolution, and I urge \nCongress to approve it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. 447) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as elected representatives, we often \nget correspondence from people--from our respective States and \nelsewhere--expressing views and opinions on a whole range of issues.\n  Occasionally, a letter comes in that deserves to be shared with the \nentire Senate. I recently received such a letter from Mongolian Prime \nMinister Elbegdorj Tsakhia, who took power after democratic elections \nin that country earlier this year.\n  While some may not pay much attention to Mongolia--it is literally \nhalf a world away--it deserves America's thanks and praise. That \ncountry serves to remind us that the fundamental pillars upon which our \ndemocracy is constructed--individual rights, freedom of the press and \nreligious tolerance--are not Western ideals but universal rights. As \nPrime Minister Elbegdorj points out, Mongolia enjoys a tradition of \ndemocracy and recognizes that it shares a responsibility to support \nfreedom beyond its borders.\n  Today I want to personally thank Prime Minister Elbegdorj and the \npeople of Mongolia for their country's contributions to the War on \nTerrorism in Iraq and for their steadfast support of democracy in \nAsia--and in Burma, in particular. Brave Mongolian soldiers serving in \nIraq, and those who champion the cause of democracy closer to home, are \na tribute to their country.\n  While I will include the text of the Prime Minister's letter in the \nRecord following my remarks, I want to read one line that rings true:\n\n       Having lived under, and fought against, the tyranny of \n     Communism I can assure you of one thing: that no \n     dictatorship, no military regime, no authoritarian government \n     can stand against the collective will of a people determined \n     to be free.\n\n  Amen, Mr. Prime Minister.\n  I encourage you to do all you can to further strengthen democracy in \nyour own country, and to continue to aggressively support Daw Aung San \nSuu Kyi and the people of Burma in their struggle for freedom.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Prime Minister of Mongolia,\n\n                                               September 16, 2004.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On August 20, 2004 I was sworn in \n     as Mongolia's new Prime Minister. This election has seen \n     another peaceful transfer of political power in my country. \n     It represents Mongolians' continuing commitment to democracy \n     and human rights.\n       I have lived in the U.S. for the past several years and \n     during that time I earned degrees at the University of \n     Colorado and Harvard. I also served as a consultant to Radio \n     Free Asia in Washington, D.C. During my time in the U.S., I \n     followed your actions on promoting democracy and human rights \n     in Asia--in particular, Burma. I, like you, believe that Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy is the \n     legitimate representative of the Burmese people. The military \n     junta that is ruling Burma can only maintain their power \n     through barbaric acts of terror to instill fear in the \n     people.\n       Mongolia faces many serious economic and social challenges. \n     After our July elections, our parliament, like your Senate, \n     is a divided chamber. The Mongolian people have made their \n     electoral choices and now it is up to my government to make \n     it work. I believe the true test of any democracy is not just \n     the institutionalization of a process and policies that \n     protect individual liberties, freedom of speech, and \n     religious tolerance at home. It is how those values are \n     shared abroad. There can be no excuse made for Burma's \n     military junta. The Burmese people had an election and chose \n     to embrace freedom and democracy. I believe each country that \n     shares our values must take steps to help achieve the results \n     of the 1990 elections. I look forward to engaging in this \n     effort.\n       Despite the distance that separates our countries, our \n     shared values bring us close together.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nthat the rights of U.S. lumber producers to remedy against unfairly \ntraded imports from Canada have been improperly curtailed by a runaway \nNAFTA Chapter 19 dispute settlement panel.\n  Because of the significant impact on many of our States, today I am \njoined by Mr. Baucus, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nSmith, and Mr. Wyden for a discussion about the NAFTA Injury Panel and \nOrder of August 31, 2004.\n  On August 31, 2004, this already rogue panel ordered the U.S. \nInternational Trade Commission to reverse its earlier rulings that, in \nfact, the U.S. lumber industry is injured by imports of subsidized and \ndumped Canadian lumber. In doing so, the NAFTA panel clearly exceeded \nits authority under U.S. law.\n  As we all know, Chapter 19 panels reviewing U.S. trade cases are to \ndecide issues under U.S. law just like U.S. courts, applying the same \nlegal standards and subject to the same limitations on their \njurisdiction and authority. In fact, as it is structured, NAFTA panels \nhave less authority because they do not have the ability to issue \ninjunctions the way federal courts do.\n  As many of my colleagues know, just last year the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, interpreting Supreme Court precedent, \nstated explicitly that a Federal court cannot simply reverse an ITC \ndecision and cannot order the ITC to change its ruling from affirmative \nto negative. However, this is just what the NAFTA panel did in this \ncase--told the United States ITC to change its previous ruling. U.S. \ncourts have long determined that if some aspect of an ITC decision is \nnot adequately supported by the evidence cited by the ITC, the proper \naction by a court is to remand the case to the ITC for further \nsubstantive analysis. Yet, in the lumber case the NAFTA panel expressly \ntold the ITC it could not further analyze the facts and issues before \nit, but could only issue a new decision consistent with the NAFTA \npanel's view that the U.S. industry is not threatened with injury. This \nvery action is usurping due process.\n  In other words, the NAFTA panel has effectively tied the hands of \nU.S. courts and prevented U.S. Federal courts from acting. This is \nexactly why I voted against NAFTA when it came up for a vote years ago. \nSimply put, here we go again having an international body, full of \nindividuals who disregard U.S. law, dictating to the U.S. courts how to \ninterpret our own laws. Not on my watch. I ask the rhetorical question, \nhow can this NAFTA ruling be consistent with the requirements of the \nNAFTA agreement that Chapter 19 panels are to follow U.S. law when \nreviewing U.S. agency decisions? This ruling, without question, is a \nfundamental breach of the terms of the agreement--a breach that goes to \nthe very integrity of the NAFTA dispute settlement system itself.\n  The ITC, as it is required by the NAFTA law Congress passed, has \ncomplied with the NAFTA panel order to reverse its affirmative threat \nof injury determination. Thankfully, however, the ITC emphasized that \nthe NAFTA panel had ``violated U.S. law and exceeded its authority as \nestablished by the NAFTA [by] failing to apply the correct standard of \nreview and by substituting its own judgment for that of the \nCommission.'' The Commission further described ``the panel's decisions \nthroughout this proceeding as overstepping its authority, violating the \nNAFTA, seriously departing from fundamental rules of procedure, and \ncommitting legal error.''\n  My confidence in the NAFTA has always been shaky at best, but today \nthat confidence is completely eroded. The Commission's expressed views \non this matter are highly telling and descriptive of the NAFTA panel's \nover-reaching and exceeding of its authority. I therefore wish to enter \nin their entirety into the Record the ``Views of the Commission in \nResponse to the Panel Decision and Order of August 31, 2004'' issued by \nthe Commission on September 10, 2004.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I share the concerns of my colleague. For \nmany U.S. industries, the laws against unfair trade are the last line \nof defense. American workers and their families should be able to count \non the enforcement of U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws to \nprovide a level playing field, and they should be able to rely on the \nCongress to ensure that those laws are fully enforced. The manner in \nwhich agency decisions are affected by NAFTA panel decisions should be \nclosely scrutinized by the Senate.\n  As my colleague indicated, under the terms of the NAFTA, Chapter 19 \npanels are supposed to apply the law just as would a U.S. court. They \nare supposed to be bound by U.S. court precedents in their \ninterpretation of U.S. law. Unfortunately, it has become clear that \nsome of these panels think they do not have to abide by these rules. \nAgain, one of the most blatant examples of this problem involves the \nongoing lumber case.\n  Earlier this year, the same panel that recently ordered the ITC to \nreverse itself had questioned some of the reasoning of the ITC in its \ninjury decision and sent the case back to the ITC for further \nexplanation. My understanding is that the Federal courts issue such \nremand orders all the time. Here, however, the panel not only told the \nITC to reconsider its decision, but then gave the Commission only 7 \nbusiness days in which to complete its remand determination, instead of \nthe 60 to 90 days that a court would normally give.\n  In response to this order from the panel, the Commission requested \nadditional time, and explained that to properly address the panel's \nconcerns, the ITC would have to gather new evidence and request \nadditional comments from the parties to the case, so that all views \ncould be heard. This should have been an easy request for the panel to \ngrant, because just a few months earlier the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit had issued an opinion stating plainly that the \ndecision to reopen the record on remand rested exclusively with the \nITC. Incredibly, the NAFTA panel ignored this binding court ruling and \nforbade the Commission to consider new evidence, and again demanded a \nnew determination by the ITC in a mere 7 business days. This is another \nclear case of overreaching by a NAFTA panel that should not be \npermitted.\n\n  Continued support for free trade initiatives such as NAFTA rests upon \nthe promise of full enforcement of U.S. laws. American industries and \nworkers must be able to rely on the promises made to them by the \nCongress that unfair trade practices will not be tolerated. When NAFTA \npanels exceed their authority, confidence is lost not only in the \ndispute settlement system but in trade agreements generally. We need to \ninject credibility back into the NAFTA system by reforming Chapter 19.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I wholeheartedly concur with the concerns of my \ncolleagues regarding the far-reaching effects of NAFTA panel decisions. \nI am especially troubled by the fact that NAFTA panels often blatantly \nfail to apply the required standard of review.\n  NAFTA requires panels to apply the standard of review of the country \nimposing the duty. The panels are thus obliged to apply the same \nstandard as would the U.S. Court of International Trade--namely, to \ndetermine whether the ITC's decision was reasonable and supported by \nsubstantial evidence on the record of the case, even if there was also \nevidence supporting an alternative conclusion. The courts--and NAFTA \npanels--are not supposed to second-guess the ITC or reweigh the \nevidence considered by the ITC, but simply to ensure there is a \nreasonable basis in the record to support the Commission's conclusions. \nIn practice, however, NAFTA panels have often ignored this requirement \nand have instead substituted their judgment for that of the ITC or the \nCommerce Department.\n  This is especially problematic given that agencies review all of the \nevidence collected during a proceeding, have substantial experience \nadministering the laws, and often consult with and advise Congress in \nthe drafting of the statutes.\n  Unlike a court or a panel, the ITC has the resources--including \nindustry analysts, economists, and accountants--and the expertise \nneeded to review and analyze the often voluminous records in these \nproceedings. The Commission is therefore plainly better suited to make \ndeterminations based on the facts. As a result, U.S. law could not be \nclearer: Courts and panels are\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\nnot to second-guess an agency but are only to ensure that the agency \nfollowed the express requirements of the statute and that there is \nsubstantial evidence--``more than a scintilla''--in support of the \nagency's ultimate conclusion. While the U.S. courts follow this \nessential element of review in administrative cases, the NAFTA panels \ndo not.\n  Indeed, as the recent ITC decision referenced by my colleague makes \nclear, in the softwood lumber injury case the NAFTA panel substituted \nits judgment for that of the International Trade Commission on any \nnumber of evidentiary questions. Unfortunately, the lumber panel is \njust the latest example of a proceeding in which NAFTA panels have \nreached legally untenable results completely at odds with U.S. law and \nNAFTA requirements. We in Congress must monitor this situation very \nclosely. We cannot allow our domestic industries and their workers to \nbecome defenseless against unfairly traded imports due to flawed \ndecisions by runaway panels. A better means of dispute settlement \nwithin the NAFTA must be created, and the proper standard of review \nrequirements must be enforced.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, there is another aspect of the recent \nsoftwood lumber NAFTA panel process that deserves our attention. As you \nknow, NAFTA Chapter 19 is a unique form of international dispute \nsettlement that applies to antidumping and subsidy cases involving \nCanada and Mexico. Normally, U.S. Government decisions to impose duties \non unfairly traded goods are reviewed by the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade, a Federal court with judges appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. For dumped and \nsubsidized goods from Canada and Mexico, however, court review is often \nreplaced with review by a panel of private citizens--mostly members of \nthe bar or other private citizens who are experts in various \ncapacities, but who are not themselves U.S. jurists.\n  Chapter 19 empowers these panelists to review U.S. legal decisions \naccording to whether they are consistent with NAFTA obligations. Unlike \nany dispute settlement system in any other trade agreement to which the \nU.S. is a party, Chapter 19 also empowers these panelists to review \ncases according to whether they are consistent with U.S. law. NAFTA \ninherited this particular power from the preceding U.S.-Canada Free \nTrade Agreement. Unfortunately, as in the softwood case, this system \nhas led to panel judgments that actually overturn valid U.S. legal \ndecisions.\n  I find this state of affairs to be extremely troubling. In my view, \nChapter 19 is clearly in need of reform, and the Senate must be \nprepared to act to revise this system to prevent unjust situations. If \nwe hope to maintain confidence in, and public support for, our system \nof trade, then we have to repair the system when it doesn't work. The \nNAFTA panel in the softwood case has dealt a major blow to our faith in \nthe system. It is time we did something about it.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague that the \nintegrity of the NAFTA panel system has been put into serious doubt as \na result of the recent panel decision in the softwood lumber case. When \nNAFTA panels prevent appropriate enforcement of the U.S. trade laws, \nthe public will cease supporting our participation in NAFTA. It is \nsimply unacceptable for a NAFTA panel to dictate the outcome of an \ninvestigation to any U.S. court or agency. That is not the purpose of a \nNAFTA panel. Such authority was not granted by the U.S. Congress to the \nNAFTA, the WTO, or any other foreign organization.\n  Congress approved the NAFTA based on its understanding that effective \ntrade remedies would not be eroded. Preservation of these remedies is \nessential to the overall process of opening foreign markets to imports \nof goods and services and to prevent harm to American industry and \nagriculture. Popular support for the principles of free trade and the \nNAFTA as a whole will be weakened if the dispute settlement system is \ncontinually misused to overturn legitimate agency decisions.\n  In my view, it is essential that future NAFTA panel decisions are \ncarefully scrutinized by Congress. With respect to the seriously flawed \nNAFTA panel decision in the softwood lumber case, I believe the U.S. \nGovernment must pursue an Extraordinary Challenge Committee appeal in \norder to restore the rights of the American industry and its workers.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \nexpressing concern about the Canadian lumber NAFTA panel decision. The \nexperience in the lumber case suggests that greater safeguards may be \nneeded to prevent abuse by rogue panels. Without such reform, I fear \nCanada will continue its strategy of litigation over negotiation. \nIndeed, the softwood lumber dispute has reached a critical phase. Since \nbacking away from a tentative agreement reached in December 2003, the \nCanadian Government has pursued an even more aggressive litigation \nstrategy in an effort to insulate its unfair practices. Most recently, \nthe Canadian Government has urged the Commerce Department to act \ncontrary to U.S. law and return on a retroactive basis antidumping and \ncountervailing duties collected prior to recent Chapter 19 rulings.\n  In my view, it is imperative that the Commerce Department clearly and \nemphatically reject requests that deposits already collected be repaid \nas a consequent result of Chapter 19 panel decisions. U.S. law clearly \nfollows the generally-accepted convention that international dispute \nsettlement decisions are to be implemented prospectively only. The \nCommerce Department cannot repay deposits already made without express \nstatutory authorization. And the law as passed by the Congress is clear \nthat entries prior to any panel decisions would be ``liquidated'' in \nthe circumstances of the lumber case at the duty rates that Commerce \nDepartment established in its original countervailing duty and \nantidumping duty determinations in 2002.\n  I find the Canadian Government's current position with respect to \nrepayment of duties to be particularly remarkable considering the \nCommerce Department's treatment of this issue in the previous softwood \nlumber dispute. In 1994, the Commerce Department stated that the \nstatute implementing the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement did not \npermit it to refund deposits paid prior to the implementation date of a \npanel decision. Since the relevant statutory provisions under the NAFTA \nremain the same, the Canadian parties know that their position is wrong \nas a matter of U.S. law. Canadian parties could have appealed the 2002 \nlumber trade findings to the Court of International Trade, which might \nhave issued an injunction to protect their ability to obtain a \nretroactive refund of the deposits, but they chose the NAFTA panel \nroute knowing full well that NAFTA panels cannot issue such \ninjunctions.\n  Of course, the deposits made could always be returned as part of a \nnegotiated settlement that preserves the interests of U.S. workers and \nsawmills, as was done in 1994. But the Commerce Department is otherwise \nforbidden by law from refunding the deposits made prior to \ninternational panel rulings. I expect the Commerce Department to make \nthis clear to Canada.\n  I think it is important for each of us to encourage the stakeholders \nto come back in good faith to negotiations to resolve these cases once \nand for all. I believe there will be a window of opportunity later this \nyear and will work with all parties to encourage meaningful \nnegotiations to find a balanced solution.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I, too, rise today to share concerns about the recent \nNAFTA panel decision. Today, the Canadian share of lumber in the U.S. \nmarket is reaching record highs. Canada's practice of dumping \nsubsidized timber in our domestic market continues to wreak havoc on \nU.S. mills and jobs. My own State of Oregon has been hit especially \nhard, losing over 3000 jobs in the timber industry since 2002. For \nyears now, my colleagues and I have worked with the International Trade \nCommission, the Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to help maintain mill operations and keep jobs in our \ncountry.\n  As my colleagues have made clear today, I believe the blatant \ndisregard for U.S. law by the panel will further damage already \nsuffering U.S. timber workers.\n  Moreover, I cannot refrain from adding, as I watch jobs in the timber \nindustry continue to disappear at an\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\nalarming rate, I find recent decisions by the administration to lower \nthe duties, as a result of administrative reviews, to be particularly \negregious and out of line. These decisions have exacerbated an already \nterrible crisis, and weakened my confidence in the administration's \nwillingness to help our timber workers.\n  Simply put, I believe it is time to move toward a fix for a system \nthat currently appears to be broken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10422-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STATEMENT OF INTENTION ON S. 2796\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as our colleagues know, Senator Durbin and \nI have introduced S. 2796, pertaining to the legal treatment of \ncertification marks, collective marks, and service marks.\n  Federal law protects all four kinds of marks equally. Specifically, \n15 U.S.C. Sec. 1503 and 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1504 provide that service marks, \ncollective marks, and certification marks ``shall be entitled to the \nprotection provided'' to trademarks, except where Congress provides \notherwise by statute. However, the clarity of the Federal laws on this \npoint has been confused by a recent decision of the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in the case of Idaho Potato Commission v. M Produce \nFarm and Sales. That decision interpreted the Lanham Act as requiring \nthat certification marks should be treated differently from trademarks \nwith respect to ``no challenge'' provisions.\n  We introduced S. 2796 to underscore the policy that Congress clearly \nintended in the first place. I ask the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, is that not the case?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho is correct. Let me \nsay to all our colleagues, this bill does not change current law. Our \npurpose in drafting S. 2796 was to make it clear that, in our view, the \nSecond Circuit reached an incorrect decision in its interpretation of \nthe Lanham Act. S. 2796 would simply restate the original intent of \nCongress when we enacted the Lanham Act, and indicate our support of \nthe view that these marks are to be given equal legal treatment by the \ncourts, not the anomalous reading that the Second Circuit gave to it in \nthe Idaho Potato Commission decision.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for his clarification and hope all our \ncolleagues will join us in this effort to protect important public \npolicy interests.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for bringing up for \nconsideration legislation providing multiyear reauthorization of the \nEconomic Development Administration. EDA provides critical resources to \ncommunities experiencing significant economic distress and dislocation. \nThe partnership between the planning and development districts in my \nState of Arkansas and the EDA has been a successful one. It is my hope \nthat this partnership will continue to provide the flexibility that is \nneeded to respond to constantly changing economic conditions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is my understanding that this legislation preserves \ncurrent EDA practices and administration of the Planning Partners \nProgram for economic development districts, as currently authorized \nunder Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. This is a \ncritical program providing important continual professional and \ntechnical assistance to rural and distressed communities to assist in \ndeveloping economic strategies and implementing infrastructure \nimprovements. It is essential that the legislation maintain this \nprogram consistent with current authorization, practices and policies.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, that is correct. The EDA planning program \nis an important program which provides technical assistance to \ncommunities to develop and implement comprehensive economic development \nstrategies. As a matter of fact this bill will provide an historic \nincrease in funding for this important program and will give planning \npartners the additional resources to address local needs and improve \nthe delivery of federal economic development efforts.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the chairman for his strong leadership and \nattention to this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10422-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On August 27, 2000, Christopher Weninger, who is not gay, was walking \nhome from a party when three men approached him and one asked him for a \ncigarette. As Weninger handed the man a cigarette, another man punched \nhim in the face and called him ``queer.'' Weninger suffered a broken \nnose and eye socket. Police investigated the beating as a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10422-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10422-S10423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NINETY YEARS OF MUSICAL SUCCESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to salute the American Society \nof Composers, Authors and Publishers, better known as ASCAP, on its \nanniversary of 90 years of successful representation of America's \nsongwriters and music publishers.\n  ASCAP formally began when a group of noted songwriters and their \nsupporters gathered at the Hotel Claridge in New York City on February \n13, 1914, at a monumental event that would forever change music \nhistory. These visionaries, whose members included some of that era's \nmost active and talented songwriters, such as Irving Berlin, James \nWeldon Johnson, Jerome Kern and John Philip Sousa, began a tradition of \noutstanding public advocacy on behalf of songwriters that continues to \nthis very day.\n  Soon after its founding, a prominent member of ASCAP, Victor Herbert, \nbrought a lawsuit against Shanley's Restaurant that established the \nlegal basis for songwriters to protect their ``performing right'' in \nthe music they created. In a legal battle that took 2 years to reach \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, ASCAP finally prevailed in a unanimous opinion \nwritten by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Once their legal authority to \nprotect the musical performing right was secure, ASCAP provided its \nowner-members with several ways to be compensated for the performances \nof their copyrighted works.\n  In advancing its members' interests, ASCAP has traditionally welcomed \nthe marketing of new technologies as opportunities to expand the reach \nof their musical entertainment to new audiences. With the advent of \nradio, ASCAP began an interdependent relationship that remains one of \nits most important sources of revenue to this very day. Today, under \nthe leadership of its distinguished chairman and award winning \nsongwriter, Marilyn Bergman, ASCAP licenses over 11,500 local \ncommercial radio stations and 2,000 non-commercial radio stations and \nASCAP music is a dominant entertainment feature of our airwaves.\n  With the Internet explosion, ASCAP responded with its own \ntechnological innovations. It fielded ACE, the first interactive online \nsong database, and EZ-Seeker software for tracking Internet \nperformances. Most recently, it has developed Mediaguide which is \nprobably the world's most comprehensive and accurate broadcast tracking \nsystem. Thus, creative innovation and vigilance on behalf of its \nmembers have been an ASCAP hallmark since its formation.\n  While ASCAP has had a deep involvement with the innovative \ntelecommunications technologies and the marvels they have added to our \nlives, its institutional essence is its people. We have all been \nadmirers of many of the more renowned ASCAP members who now number in \nthe many hundreds over the years. They include such extraordinary \ntalents as: Billy Joel, Hal David, Cy Coleman, Garth Brooks, Irving \nBerlin, Prince, Lyle Lovett, Henry\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\nMancini, Marvin Hamlisch, Louis Armstrong, Arturo Sandoval, Duke \nEllington, Madonna, Jimmy Webb, Cole Porter, and, or course, the late \nJerry Garcia and his bandmates in the Grateful Dead.\n  However, as a national organization with international impact ASCAP \nactually represents an additional 185,000 individual songwriter and \nmusic publisher members, who are less well known. They are the critical \nmass of individual talents that extend into every city, town and hamlet \nin our country.\n  Its member-owners and the officers and employees who support them are \nall a part of the traditional ASCAP family. And they are especially \ndeserving of the congratulations we extend on this auspicious event. In \naddition, those millions of us who appreciate and enjoy the fruits of \ntheir creators' talents have become a part of ASCAP's vast extended \nfamily of enthusiasts.\n  So I am wishing a very happy ninetieth birthday anniversary to \nASCAP's members, officers, and employees on behalf of its huge extended \nfamily for its years of music success in America and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10423-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10423-S10428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GRANT DOLLARS AT EPA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

EPA awards both discretionary and non-discretionary \n     grants to recipients such as state, local, and tribal \n     governments, educational institutions, non-profit \n     organizations, foreign recipients, and individuals among \n     other types of recipients. The U.S. General Accounting Office \n     (GAO) completed a comprehensive report on EPA grant \n     management which it issued in August 2003, compiling ninety-\n     three GAO and EPA Inspector General reports, 1,232 reviews of \n     records of awarded grants ending in fiscal year 2002, and \n     interviews with EPA grant officials. According to the GAO \n     report, the majority of EPA grant awards are non-\n     discretionary grants awarded to government entities to fund \n     infrastructure and the implementation of federal and state \n     environmental programs. These grant funds are awarded \n     according to statutory or regulatory formulas to the \n     receiving governmental entities. The GAO reported that in \n     fiscal year 2002, the EPA awarded nearly $3.5 billion in non-\n     discretionary grants. The remaining approximately $700 \n     million in fiscal year 2002 was awarded in discretionary \n     grants in which EPA officials have the discretion to \n     determine the grant amounts and recipients. Primarily, EPA \n     awards discretionary grants to non-profit organizations, \n     universities, and governmental entities.\n       EPA grants are awarded and managed both through EPA \n     headquarters and through the ten regional EPA offices. The \n     EPA Office of Administration and Resources Management's \n     Office of Grants and Debarment within agency headquarters \n     develops agency policy for grants management. Overall the \n     program offices within EPA headquarters and the regional \n     offices employ 109 grants specialists responsible for \n     financial oversight of grant awards and over 1,800 project \n     officers responsible for providing technical and programmatic \n     oversight of grant recipients and to monitor the progress of \n     individual grants.\n\n\n                     epa grants management history\n\n       The EPA Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Management \n     and Budget (OMB), and the GAO have consistently identified \n     deficiencies in EPA grant management in numerous audits and \n     reports. The EPA has consistently identified grants \n     management as either an agency or material weakness in recent \n     annual Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act reports. As \n     recently as September 2003, the OIG again recommended that \n     the EPA again reflect that grants management is a ``material \n     weakness.''\n       In its August 2003 comprehensive report on grants \n     management, the GAO provided a condensed history of grants \n     management within the EPA. As described in the report, the \n     OIG first recommended in 1995 and subsequently provided \n     congressional testimony in July 1996 that EPA demonstrated a \n     significant weakness in grants management. This resulted in \n     EPA identifying grants management as a ``material weakness'' \n     in its 1996 Integrity Act report. In response, the EPA \n     instituted new policies for monitoring grant recipients, \n     providing grants training for project officers, and reviewing \n     grants management effectiveness. Although EPA reported in its \n     1999 Integrity Act report that weaknesses in grants \n     management had been corrected, the OIG again provided \n     congressional testimony in November 1999 where it disclosed \n     that OIG audits revealed management problems persisted \n     despite new EPA policies. The EPA continued to designate \n     grants management as an ``agency weakness'' in its 2000 \n     Integrity Act report. In 2002, the OIG and the OMB \n     recommended that EPA designate grants management as a \n     ``material weakness'' within the agency. Additionally, in its \n     August 2003 report, the GAO stated that EPA continues to \n     encounter the problems in the following areas: (1.) selecting \n     the most qualified applicants, (2.) effectively overseeing \n     grantees, (3.) measuring the environmental results of grants, \n     and (4.) effectively managing grants staff and resources. The \n     U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and \n     Environment held a series of hearings in June 2003, October \n     2003, and July 2004 concerning the continued deficiencies in \n     EPA grants management based in large part on the GAO \n     findings.\n       In the President's 2004 Budget submission, the OMB \n     identified four EPA grant programs in which it reported EPA \n     could not adequately measure the effectiveness of those \n     programs. Additionally, in the President's 2005 Budget \n     submission, the OMB evaluated a total of twenty EPA programs \n     including ten grant-based programs. Again, the OMB reported \n     that EPA exhibits weakness in measuring the effectiveness of \n     its grants programs.\n       On March 3, 2004, the Senate Environment and Pubic Works \n     Committee held its first oversight hearing into grants \n     management at the EPA. With such a troubling history in EPA \n     grants management, the testimony offered at the hearing led \n     Chairman James Inhofe to characterize the previous 10 years \n     of grant management at EPA in the following manner:\n       ``[F]or the last ten years, the story of grants management \n     is seemingly a revolving door of the EPA IG audits, GAO \n     reports, Congressional hearings, and new EPA policies in \n     response. Even with this constant cycle of criticism, \n     hearings, and new policies, the GAO reported later last year \n     that the EPA continues to demonstrate the same persistent \n     problems in grants management. These problems include a \n     general lack of oversight of the grantees, a lack of \n     oversight of the Agency personnel, a lack of any measurement \n     of environmental results, and a lack of competition in \n     awarding grants. It is imperative that Agency personnel are \n     accountable for monitoring grants--that measurable \n     environmental results are clearly demonstrated.''\n\n\n                           new epa responses\n\n       In September 2002, the EPA issued a new grant award \n     competition policy which focused on requiring competition in \n     grant awards over $75,000 with certain exceptions and created \n     the position of grant competition advocate to enforce the \n     policy and recommend changes. Additionally, the GAO reports \n     that in 1998, 1999, and in February 2002, the EPA has issued \n     oversight policies designed to increase grant baseline \n     monitoring, increase in-depth reviews, create annual \n     monitoring plans, and create a grantee compliance database.\n       In April 2003, the EPA issued its first five-year grants \n     management plan. This plan incorporates the new grants \n     competition and oversight policies establishing the following \n     principal Objectives and Activities for grants management:\n       Enhance the skills of EPA personnel involved in grants \n     management; promote competition in the award of grants; \n     leverage technology to improve program performance; \n     strengthen EPA oversight of grants; support identifying and \n     achieving environmental outcomes.\n\n\n        senate environment and public works committee oversight\n\n       At the March 3, 2004, Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee oversight hearing into grants management at the \n     EPA, Chairman Inhofe stated:\n       ``I want to announce to all of you today that this \n     Committee is going to take this oversight responsibility \n     seriously in regards to grants management. . . . I am going \n     to make a personal commitment that it is going to change this \n     time. . . . We are going to have accountability and the \n     revolving door will stop.''\n       The Committee heard testimony from the OIG, EPA Office of \n     Administration and Resources Management, GAO, and a \n     representative from Taxpayers for Common Sense. GAO and OIG \n     reiterated the much of the same themes that have \n     characterized their consistent criticisms of grant management \n     at\n\n[[Page S10424]]\n\n     the EPA. The GAO testified to: a lack of oversight of \n     grantees and EPA personnel, a lack of competition in \n     discretionary grants, and a lack of measurable environmental \n     outcomes.\n       The OIG testified to: no link between funded projects and \n     EPA mission, no assessment of probability of success, no \n     determination of the reasonableness of the costs of the \n     grant, no measurable environmental outcomes, and no \n     deliverable in grant work-plans.\n       A representative for Taxpayers for Common Sense echoed \n     similar criticisms offered by the OIG and GAO and, while \n     acknowledging EPA's new focus on improving grants management, \n     testified that EPA needs to improve: EPA personnel commitment \n     to competition in grants selection, grantee oversight, \n     ensuring grants are consistent with Agency goals, and EPA \n     staff accountability.\n       The EPA focused its testimony on the new grants management \n     plan and accomplishments under that plan detailing its five \n     main goals and evidence of its initial success. The EPA \n     testified to: new certification of grants project officers, \n     increased competition especially among non-profit grantees, \n     deployment of a new Intergrated Contracts Management System \n     automating grants mangement monitoring, and increased minimal \n     monitoring standards for all grants.\n       The hearing produced the following general findings: EPA \n     discretionary grants need a system that requires wide \n     competition for the available funds and sufficient notice of \n     the funding opportunities that may be available; EPA \n     discretionary and non-discretionary grants need to \n     demonstrate and quantify measurable environmental results; \n     and EPA administration and project officers need to ensure \n     that new policies to more closely monitor grants, ensure \n     measurable environmental results, and ensure wide \n     solicitation and competition among grants, among other goals, \n     and accomplished.\n       In addition, the hearing produced the specific finding that \n     discretionary grants in particular are often the most \n     problematic due to limited oversight from the EPA. Testimony \n     offered by the GAO revealed that oversight through such \n     safeguards as the Single Audit Act to ensure that \n     discretionary grantee expenditures are allowable costs are \n     generally not applicable to discretionary grants given the \n     grant comparatively low dollar amounts. Responding to \n     questions from Chairman Inhofe, GAO representative John \n     Stephenson testified to the following:\n       ``Senator Inhofe. Would [discretionary grants] be the most \n     difficult to monitor?\n       Mr. Stephenson. I would think so. The non-discretionary \n     grants go by formula to the States based on the need. There \n     is a little more specificity in place as to how you oversee \n     that category of grants. So I would agree that the \n     discretionary grants are probably more problematic.''\n       The OIG offered corresponding answers to similar questions \n     from Senator Inhofe testifying to the following:\n       ``Senator Inhofe. You are testifying that the EPA \n     mismanagement of only discretionary grants costs the \n     taxpayers hundred of million of dollars each year?\n       Ms. Heist. Of predominately discretionary funds, yes.\n       Senator Inhofe. Why do you focus on discretionary \n     recipients in particular?\n       Ms. Heist. In the past we found the most problem was with \n     discretionary grants. We found problems with, as has been \n     mentioned here today, competition. We found Agency managers \n     continued to use the same grantees year-after-year and there \n     has not been a lot of competition. Predominately, that is \n     where we found the problems, so we continue to focus in that \n     area.''\n       In fact, the OIG supplemented her testimony with a March 1, \n     2004, audit of a discretionary grant recipient non-profit \n     organization that received a total of $4,714,638 in five \n     selected grants from 1996 to 2004. The OIG's audit concluded \n     with the following findings:\n       ``Therefore, although EPA funds were awarded to a 501(c)(3) \n     organization, in actuality, a 501(c)(4) lobbying organization \n     performed the work and ultimately received the funds. This \n     arrangement clearly violates the Lobbying Disclosure Act \n     prohibition on a 501(c)(4) organization which engages in \n     lobbying from receiving Federal funds.\n       In summary, the [Consumer Federation of America], a \n     501(c)(4) organization: (1) performed direct lobbying of \n     Congress, and (2) received Federal funds contrary to the \n     Lobbying Disclosure Act. Consequently, all of the costs \n     claimed and paid under the agreements are statutorily \n     unallowable.''\n       The March 1, 2004 OIG audit subsequently concluded among \n     other findings, ``EPA recover all funds paid to the non-\n     profit recipient'' and ``EPA suspend work under current \n     grants or cooperative agreements not covered by the audit and \n     make no new awards until the recipient can demonstrate that \n     its financial management practices and controls over Federal \n     funds comply with all regulatory requirements.''\n       However, lack of oversight in grants to non-profit \n     organizations is not entirely new information. The GAO \n     reported in 2001 that EPA exhibited weaknesses specifically \n     in non-profit grantee oversight. In its April 2001 report \n     that GAO specifically evaluated EPA's oversight of non-profit \n     grantee costs. The GAO concluded, ``EPA's post-award grant \n     management policy provides minimal assurance that unallowable \n     costs for non-profit grantees will be identified.'' In its \n     August 2003 report, the GO again reported it found some of \n     the largest number of problems in discretionary grants to \n     non-profit organizations. In fact, the GAO reported that of \n     the grants it sampled for its report, EPA took some of the \n     most significant remedial actions to problems within the \n     individual grants against non-profit organizations.\n       Testimony received during the hearing also confirmed that \n     EPA has continued to award discretionary grants to non-profit \n     and other recipients often without preparing solicitations \n     and without competition with other potential applicants. In \n     its August 2003 EPA grants report, the GAO reported the \n     following:\n       ``The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 \n     encourages agencies to use competition in awarding grants. To \n     encourage competition, EPA issued a grants competition policy \n     in 1995. However, EPA's policy did not result in meaningful \n     competition throughout the agency, according to EPA \n     officials. Furthermore, EPA's own internal management reviews \n     and a 2001 Inspector General report found that EPA has not \n     always encouraged competition. Finally, EPA has not always \n     engaged in widespread solicitation when it could be \n     beneficial to do so. Widespread solicitation would provide \n     greater assurance that EPA receives proposals from a variety \n     of eligible and highly qualified applicants who otherwise may \n     not have known about grant opportunities. According to a 2001 \n     EPA Inspector General report, program officials indicated \n     that widespread solicitation was not necessary because `word \n     gets out' to eligible applicants. Applicants often sent their \n     proposals directly to these program officials, who funded \n     them using `uniquely qualified' as the justification for a \n     noncompetitive award. This procedure created the appearance \n     of preferential treatment by not offering the same \n     opportunities to all potential applicants. In addition, the \n     agency provided incomplete or inconsistent public information \n     on its grant programs in the Catalog of Federal Domestic \n     Assistance. Therefore, potential applicants may not have \n     been adequately informed of funding opportunities.''\n       In fact, the OIG reported in May 2001 that the lack of \n     competition and lack of solicitation in discretionary grants \n     led to the appearance of preferential treatment in awarding \n     grants and an uncertainty that grants were being awarded to \n     the most meritorious and cost-effective projects:\n       ``Without widespread solicitation [of available grants], \n     EPA is not only limiting potential applicants, but is also \n     creating the appearance of preferential treatment. \n     Furthermore, during our discussions with EPA program \n     officials we found implications of preferential treatment in \n     the selection of grantees.''\n       During the hearing, EPA acknowledged neglecting competition \n     and giving the appearance of favoritism in awarding grants as \n     EPA responded to the following question asked by Senator \n     Jeffords:\n       ``Mr. O'Connor. Senator Jeffords, with respect to the \n     competition as was noted, for years and years, our project \n     officers were accustomed to just selecting their grantee \n     which led to at least the appearance that we had favorites \n     and that we were not necessarily going out there sure that we \n     were getting the best value for the Government. That policy, \n     quite frankly, did not go over very well initially, with our \n     1,800 project officers because it does require quite a bit of \n     additional work. This was something that they had to adjust \n     to. Frankly, we set a goal of competing, I believe it was 30 \n     percent of the covered grants in our first year. I was very \n     pleased with achieving the 75 percent. But that is one of a \n     number of major mindsets that we are trying to change, and \n     will change, over the next couple of years in how we manage \n     our grants.''\n       Chairman Inhofe concluded the hearing with a closing \n     statement acknowledging that all the witnesses could agree \n     that discretionary grants oversight may be particularly \n     problematic. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, Chairman \n     Inhofe began a series of information requests to EPA. \n     Chairman Inhofe issued the first request at the close of the \n     March 2004 hearing. The request included a listing of all \n     discretionary grant recipients in fiscal year 2003, the \n     amount of the recipient, and the type of recipient for each \n     grant award. It also requested the amounts in grants those \n     recipients had received for the two previous fiscal years.\n\n\n                          subsequent oversight\n\n       Pursuant to Environment and Public Works Committee \n     oversight responsibility, Chairman Inhofe has submitted \n     subsequent information requests which have included \n     requesting project officer grant files on discretionary grant \n     recipients and interviews with the EPA project and approving \n     officers for discretionary grants. In each information \n     request, EPA has fully responded, making grant files and \n     personnel available.\n       Additionally, one of the first accomplishments from the \n     Committee's oversight has been a change in availability of \n     information on grants on the EPA Web site. At the March 2004 \n     hearing Chairman Inhofe required, ``What would be wrong with \n     putting all [grant awards] on a Web site where the public and \n     anyone interested would have access to them?''\n       Later in the hearing, Chairman Inhofe reiterated his point \n     of transparency in grant awarding stating, ``I like the idea \n     of doing something, of opening the doors, and not just having \n     a Web site where you show the various competitions coming up, \n     but also where you show the grants that are issued. . . . I \n     look forward to that.''\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\n       EPA has responded by reorganizing its Web site to provide a \n     direct link to the EPA grants from its homepage and \n     reorganized its Office of Grants and Debarment page to \n     clearly list links concerning EPA grants. However, most \n     importantly, EPA has created a new site of the most \n     comprehensive information ever provided on individual grants. \n     This new page contains information such as the awarding \n     office, total amount of the grant, purpose of the grant, and \n     awarding and monitoring personnel at EPA. This new page \n     allows users to search all awarded grants by description, \n     type of recipient, and by quarter or fiscal year all within \n     seven days of the grant award. Additionally, this page is \n     only an interim site as the EPA plans to develop a ``Grants \n     Datamart'' of new publicly accessible information through its \n     Web site by early 2005.\n       Although more publicly available information on available \n     grants, new competition for those discretionary grants and \n     full disclosure of awarded grants are a promising beginning \n     to reform of EPA grants management, individual EPA program \n     offices must enforce these new policies with necessary \n     oversight of EPA personnel and EPA grantees. However, with \n     comparatively low individual dollar amounts, discretionary \n     grants to non-profit organizations in particular may receive \n     the least oversight compared to recipients of larger dollar \n     amount grants. As referenced in previous GAO reports and \n     corroborated in the OIG recent audit of a non-profit grant \n     recipient, discretionary grants to non-profit recipients have \n     exhibited some of the highest amount of problems and have \n     required the most significant remedial actions taken by the \n     EPA.\n\n\n                     big business environmentalism\n\n       In spring 2001, the Sacramento Bee began a series of \n     articles on the operations of the national environmental \n     groups and the current actions of the modern environmental \n     movement. Those articles began characterizing the today's \n     environmental groups in the following manner:\n       ``[T]oday's groups prosper while the land does not. \n     Competition for money and members is keen. Litigation is \n     blood sport. Crisis, real or not, is a commodity. And slogans \n     and sound bites masquerade as scientific fact.''\n       The series continued by identifying the twenty \n     environmental organizations reporting the largest resources, \n     each an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) registered non-profit \n     organization, and criticizing today's environmental movement \n     for its largesse. The series highlighted such issues and \n     arguments as: the salaries paid to environmental group \n     executives, the millions of dollars in assets, or billions in \n     some cases, of environmental groups, the unprecedented focus \n     on fundraising, the marketing and advertising on agenda-based \n     science, the increasingly litigious business of today's \n     environmental groups, and the subsidizing of environmental \n     groups with federal tax dollars.\n       Continuing on the theme of environmental groups being \n     subsidized by federal taxpayers, that same publication \n     published an additional article in October 2001, specifically \n     highlighting the issue of federal tax dollars going to \n     environmental groups regularly engaged in lobbying and \n     litigating against the federal government, and how that, \n     according to federal audits, in some cases those tax dollars \n     have been misused. Interestingly, the article adds,\n       ``Just how much public money flows to environmental groups \n     has never been calculated, partly because it springs from so \n     many sources. . . . But no government agency charts the total \n     spending, identifies trends, or assesses what taxpayers are \n     getting for their money.''\n       The Washington Post published a series of articles \n     beginning May 2003 focusing on a particular non-profit \n     environmental group, The Nature Conservancy, branding the \n     organization ``Big Green'' for its status as the nation's \n     eighth largest non-profit with assets of $3 billion. The \n     series criticized The Nature Conservancy, a regular EPA \n     discretionary grant recipient, for its wide-ranging business \n     interests including drilling operations, product marketing \n     activities ranging from beef to neckties to a breakfast \n     cereal to toilet cleaners, and million-dollar land deals to \n     organization board members and supporters that has gained The \n     Nature Conservancy a U.S. Senate Finance Committee \n     investigation and subsequent audit by the IRS.\n       Earlier this year, FrontPage Magazine published a similarly \n     critical article of environmental non-profit groups titled \n     ``Environmental Activism Is In Fact Big Business,'' reporting \n     that today's more than 3,000 environmental non-profit \n     organizations collect more than $8.5 billion annually and \n     that most individually collect more than $1 million each \n     year.\n       Not all environmental organizations regularly receive EPA \n     grants or receive EPA grants at all. However, some \n     environmental groups receive millions of dollars in private \n     contributions each year and receive hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars in EPA grants each year as well. Additionally, those \n     same environmental groups are closely linked with affiliate \n     organizations which are politically involved or are closely \n     associated with other politically involved environmental \n     organizations.\n\n\n              selected epa discretion non-profit grantees\n\n       The following organizations are IRS registered 503(c)(3) \n     tax exempt non-profit entities that have regularly received \n     discretionary grant funding from the EPA. Each organization \n     has received varying amounts of EPA discretionary grants. \n     Each organization is also affiliated with an IRS registered \n     501(c)(4) or 527 political organization or is otherwise \n     involved in political activities. Unless otherwise specified, \n     the EPA reports that until it formally adopted its grants \n     competition policy in 2003, although it encouraged \n     competition, each grant was likely awarded without \n     solicitation or competition with other potential applicants.\n\n                   Natural Resources Defense Council\n\n       The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) states that \n     its purpose is to ``safeguard the Earth: its people, its \n     plants and animals and the natural systems on which all life \n     depends.'' The NRDC is represented by three organizations. \n     These organizations are the NRDC, Inc., a 501(c)(3) \n     organization; the NRDC Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization; \n     and the Environmental Accountability Fund, a section 527 \n     political organization.\n       The NRDC is consistently critical of the Bush \n     Administration's environmental record and devotes a portion \n     of its own Web site to the ``Bush Record'' which it \n     characterizes in the following manner: ``This administration, \n     in catering to industries that put America's health and \n     natural heritage at risk, threatens to do more damage to our \n     environmental protections than any other in U.S. history.'' \n     In fact, this organization is particularly politically \n     involved with a history of spending millions of dollars in \n     previous election cycles. The NRDC is also involved in this \n     year's Presidential race joining with other organizations \n     airing television and radio advertisements against President \n     Bush. The NRDC's section 527 political organization, the \n     Environmental Accountability Fund, last reports to have \n     raised nearly $1 million in the 2004 election cycle, at the \n     time of this report. The NRDC 501(c)(3) organization is also \n     nationally politically involved joining earlier this year \n     with Moveon.org, another section 527 political organization, \n     running advertisements, such as one featured earlier this \n     year in the New York Times, accusing the Bush Administration \n     of weakening regulations on drinking water and air quality \n     while at the same time soliciting contributions for the NRDC \n     501(c)(3) affiliate.\n       The NRDC, Inc. organization has reported consistent end of \n     the year annual net assets of over $70 million for the \n     previous three years, with over $80 million of end of the \n     year net assets reports in its tax filing of the year ending \n     2003. Additionally, the NRDC, Inc. reports receiving \n     increasing amounts of direct public contributions totaling \n     from $32.6 million in 1999 to over $55 million in 2003.\n       The NRDC, Inc. organization also reports spending an \n     increasing amount on direct grassroots lobbying, from \n     $264,253 in its filing for the year ending 1999 to $861,524 \n     in its filing for the year ending 2003 with a total of nearly \n     $1 million in total lobbying expenditures in 2002 alone. NRDC \n     Lobbying Disclosure Act Reports over the same 1999-2003 \n     period disclose NRDC, Inc. made these expenditures lobbying \n     Congress and the Administration, including Department of \n     Energy, the Department of the Interior and the EPA.\n       The NRDC, Inc. organization reported receiving over half a \n     million dollars annually in government grants in its IRS \n     filings for the reporting periods ending 1999 through 2003. \n     Specifically, the NRDC, Inc. organization reports it received \n     $850,903 in government grants in the period ending 1999, \n     $759,596 for 2000, $679,319 for 2001, $630,910 for 2002, and \n     $608,099 for 2003. The EPA reports that NRDC, Inc. \n     organization has received nearly $6.5 million in twenty-three \n     discretionary grants since 1993. EPA also reports that these \n     individual grants ranged in amounts from $7,500 to nearly $2 \n     million during this period. The EPA acknowledges that likely \n     all these grants were awarded without competition with any \n     other applicant. The EPW Majority Staff requested interviews \n     of EPA approving and project officers for selected grants \n     over $200,000 each. The purposes for some grants to NRDC, \n     Inc., were wide ranging. For instance, EPA reported that some \n     of the stated purposes for grants awarded to NRDC, Inc., have \n     included development of energy efficient technologies, \n     strengthening the case for smart growth, a NRDC and Ad \n     Council clean water campaign, and promoting energy efficiency \n     in Russian buildings. In some instances, approving officers \n     and project officers for those grants have since retired from \n     the EPA. However, EPW Majority Staff interviewed EPA \n     approving and project officers for one ongoing grant awarded \n     by the Office of Air and Radiation beginning in January 2002 \n     through December 2004 for a total of $1,198,993.00. The \n     grant's stated project title and description are as follows: \n     ``Development or Long-Term Adoption of Energy-Efficient \n     Products and Services, To work within the energy efficiency \n     and manufacturing community toward long term market \n     transformation of energy-efficient technologies and \n     practices.'' EPA officials stated that the grant was awarded \n     without solicitation or competition with other applicants, \n     and EPA awarded the grant pursuant to a proposal NRDC, Inc. \n     submitted to the EPA. One EPA official reported that although \n     this particular grant proposal was unsolicited, it was \n     subject to a peer review. However, upon further questioning \n     EPW Majority Staff learned that the peer review consisted of \n     the review of one other EPA official within the Climate \n     Protection Partnerships Division of the Office of Air and \n     Radiation. EPA officials reported that this grant received \n     some form of review\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\n     from several levels within the Climate Protection Division \n     from review of the technical merits of the proposal by the \n     project officers through approval by the division director. \n     EPW Majority Staff interviewed the approving officer and two \n     project officers for this grant, and all reported receiving \n     EPA grant training and receiving periodic recertification. \n     Each interviewed personnel has been employed with the EPA for \n     various tenures from two years to over twenty years. EPA \n     project officers reported that monitoring for this grant \n     consists of periodic contact by the project officer and the \n     requirement of quarterly reports from NRDC, Inc. on its \n     progress on the grant. All EPA officials interviewed were \n     aware of NRDC's regular litigation against the federal \n     government, and some were otherwise aware of NRDC's political \n     activity and criticisms of the Bush Administration's \n     environmental policies.\n\n                Children's Environmental Health Network\n\n       The Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN) \n     describes itself as a ``national multi-disciplinary \n     organization whose mission is to protect the fetus and the \n     child from environmental health hazards and promote a healthy \n     environment.'' CEHN has been a 501(c)(3) tax exempt \n     organization since 2001 and reported for the filing period \n     ending 2000,end of the year net assets of $25,324.00. \n     However, the CEHN also reports receiving a total of $545,626 \n     in direct contributions in addition to $136,729.00 in \n     government grants.\n       Since CEHN's beginnings in 2001, the EPA reports it has \n     awarded four grants to CEHN in amounts ranging from a $2,600 \n     to an ongoing grant totaling $332,304.00 for the grant term \n     of August 2002 to July 2005. As of this report, EPA has \n     awarded nearly $400,000 in grants to the CEHN. All EPA \n     approving and project officers for each of these grants are \n     still employed at the EPA, the EPW Majority Staff requested \n     interviews with each official/EPA officials confirmed that \n     the agency awarded each grant without solicitation and \n     without competition with any other potential applicant.\n       The first of the awards was a $10,000 grant awarded from \n     EPA Office of International Affairs to CEHN to distribute \n     information from the Global Forum for Action, a conference \n     sponsored by CEHN. EPA officials, however, disclosed that the \n     original proposal from CEHN requested $70,000 to pay for a \n     large part of the Global Form for Action conference that had \n     already concluded prior to CEHN's submission of its grant \n     proposal. EPA, however, agreed to provide $10,000 for \n     dissemination of information from the conference. The second \n     of the awards was a $43,615 grant awarded from EPA \n     headquarters for the purpose of developing a plan for the \n     expansion of the use of the Internet to increase information \n     regarding environmental health threats to children. EPA \n     officials monitored the grant by requiring quarterly progress \n     reports. The result of the grant was a report CEHN prepared \n     on its meetings with Internet providers and medical \n     associations. EPA officials, however, reported that a Web \n     site disseminating information on children's health has not \n     been developed subsequent to this report. Interestingly, \n     however, during this same period and thereafter, the CEHN has \n     published its own Children's Environmental Health Bush \n     Administration Report Card for 2001-2004. On April 5, 2004, \n     CEHN published its most recent report card on its own \n     Internet site which graded the Bush Administration's \n     environment record with an ``F'' on protecting children's \n     health citing sixteen areas where it claims the Bush \n     Administration is lacking in protecting children's health.\n       The third grant to CEHN was awarded from EPA Region 3 in \n     the amount of $2,600 for the purpose of training two \n     Washington, D.C. highschool students to assist with \n     environmental education in a local elementary school \n     classroom. CEHN coordinated the training for these two \n     highschool students in a there-week course. Representatives \n     from the Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, the EPA, and \n     others made presentations to the students about a variety of \n     topics including ``lead poisoning, asthma, ozone depletion, \n     global warming, the workings of a power plant, and water \n     topics.'' Although the students toured a water treatment \n     facility in conjunction with the presentations, EPA officials \n     could not confirm that the students actually toured a power \n     plant. The grant reports CEHN submitted also did not include \n     a representative from the utility industry as a presenter, \n     and EPA officials also could not confirm that the students \n     received any information from industry representatives.\n       Finally, the fourth grant EPA awarded to CEHN is the \n     largest. The EPA Office of Prevention of Pesticides and Toxic \n     Substances awarded the first installment of an ongoing grant \n     totaling $332,304.00 over the grant period August 2002 to \n     July 2005. The purpose of this grant is to increase available \n     scientific information on children's health to CEHN and other \n     non-governmental organizations. Like all other grants awarded \n     to CEHN, this grant was awarded through an unsolicited \n     proposal without competition with any other potential \n     applicants. Interestingly, the chairperson of the board of \n     directors for CEHN is the former EPA Assistant Administrator \n     for the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances during \n     the Clinton Administration from 1993 to 1999. EPA \n     officials involved in approving and monitoring this grant \n     advised EPW Majority Staff that although they personally \n     did not work closely with the former Assistant \n     Administrator, they worked for the Office of Pesticides \n     and Toxic Substances during the same period.\n\n                      Environmental Defense, Inc.\n\n       Environmental Defense describes itself as ``fighting to \n     protect human health, restore the oceans and ecosystems, and \n     curb global warming.'' Environmental Defense is represented \n     by two organizations: Environmental Defense, Inc., 501(c)(3) \n     organization, and the Environmental Defense Action fund, \n     Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization.\n       Environmental Defense, Inc. reports consistently increasing \n     amounts of end of the year net assets from approximately $33 \n     million in its tax filing for the period ending 1999 to over \n     $49 million for 2003. During that same period Environmental \n     Defense, Inc. has received increasing amounts of direct \n     public contributions, from $28.4 million in 1999 to nearly \n     $42 million in 2003. This organization also reports spending \n     varying amounts in direct and grassroots lobbying \n     expenditures for the same period, spending $528,804 for 1999, \n     $410,975 for 2000, $857,542 for 2001, $673,548 for 2002, and \n     $856,983 for 2003. Environmental Defense, Inc. reports making \n     those expenditures lobbying Congress and the Administration \n     agencies including the EPA.\n       Environmental Defense, Inc. also reports receiving varying \n     amounts of annual government grants. It reported receiving \n     $752,645 for 1999, $505,170 for 2000, $575,673 for 2001, \n     $273,116 for 2002, and $341,338 for 2003. Environmental \n     Defense, Inc. has also received over $4.6 million from the \n     EPA in discretionary grants since 1993, many, if not all, \n     awarded without competition with other potential applicants.\n\n                            The Tides Center\n\n       The Tides Center describes its organization as ``working \n     with new and emerging charitable organizations who share our \n     mission of striving for positive social change.'' This \n     organization is represented or affiliated with two other \n     organizations: the Tides Foundation, a 501(c)(3) foundation, \n     and the Tsunami Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization.\n       The Tides Center and Tides Foundation regularly grant funds \n     to what it designates as its projects. To receive funding, \n     The Tides Center's main requirement for becoming a new \n     project is that the ``project's work falls within the Tides \n     Mission of working toward progressive social change.'' Some \n     of the projects the Tides Center and Tides Foundation have \n     funded include other environmental organizations such as the \n     Environmental Working Group, the Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, and affiliates of the Sierra Club and Greenpeace.\n       The Tides Center regularly reports annual end of the year \n     net assets increasing from $21.1 million in its tax filing \n     for the period ending 1999 to $33.8 million in 2003. During \n     this same period, the Tides Center reports increasing direct \n     public contributions from $38.7 million in its 1999 filing to \n     nearly $60 million in 2003. The Tides Center reports varying \n     amounts of legally allowable direct and grassroots lobbying \n     expenditures between $22,505 in its 1999 filing to $601,885 \n     in its 2003 filing with a 2002 filing disclosing expenditures \n     of nearly $1 million.\n       The Tides Center also regularly receives several millions \n     of dollars of government grants in increasing amounts each \n     year. The Tides Center reported receiving $1,626,906 for \n     1999, $1,582,370 for 2000, $2,145,499 for 2001, $3,481,484 \n     for 2002, and $5,175,732 for 2003. Although the Tides Center \n     has received increasing amount of funding in grants, the U.S. \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Inspector \n     General audited the Tides Center as recently as September \n     2002 and recommended that HUD consider suspending grant \n     funding until the Tides Center and its project organization \n     partner in the audited grant develop and implement \n     appropriate management controls to ensure the Tides Center's \n     compliance with federal rules concerning allowable \n     expenditures for federal funding. The EPA reports that the \n     Tides Center and Tides Foundation have received nearly $2 \n     million in federal grants from the EPA alone since 1993. EPW \n     Majority Staff interviewed EPA approving and project officers \n     in four grants EPA awarded to the Tides Center. In two of the \n     selected grants, EPA made the awards without solicitation or \n     competition with other applicants. In fact, the single \n     largest grant EPA has made to the Tides Center since 1993 was \n     awarded for a term of May 2002 to December 2003 for a total \n     of $477,275. The grant was awarded for the purpose of \n     encouraging public participation in the cleanup of hazardous \n     waste at federal facilities. Although the grant was awarded \n     without solicitation or competition, EPA confirmed the \n     project officer has made on-site visits to the grantee and \n     has requested an audit of funds to ensure EPA grant funding \n     is separated from other funds used by the Tides Center. In \n     another ongoing grant to the Tides Center totaling $75,000 \n     for the purpose of developing a white paper on the markets \n     for environmental papers, EPA again confirmed this grant was \n     awarded subsequent to an unsolicited proposal and without \n     competition. In fact, in awarding funding to the Tides Center \n     in other grants based on unsolicited proposals, EPA has \n     simply recorded that the grantee has ``unique and superior \n     qualifications to perform the work.'' However, in each of \n     these previously described grants, EPA project officers \n     confirmed that prior to this particular grant oversight with \n     Tides Center, neither had any prior experience with the Tides \n     Center.\n       In two of the other two selected grants, EPA made the \n     awards with competition with one award approved by the \n     awarding office's\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\n     Assistant Administrator. The first of these ongoing grants \n     was for a total of $125,000 for a grant term of September \n     2003 to August 2006, for the purpose of ``strengthening the \n     national network of brownfield environmental justice and \n     community groups, technical assistance, training, research on \n     schools sitting on contaminated property, regional workshops, \n     and history of selected brownfields community efforts.'' The \n     grant application, however, states that the Tides Center will \n     ultimately apply for a total of $442,000 for this project. \n     The Tides Center's submitted proposal for the grant includes \n     conducting conferences, workshops, and producing fact sheets. \n     The EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response awarded \n     this grant following a review throughout the office with \n     final approval by the office Assistant Administrator. EPA \n     officials confirmed that the solicitation for this grant was \n     available for forty-five days on the agency Web site. EPA \n     received forty-four proposals and awarded twenty-one. \n     Finally, the fourth Tides Center ongoing grant in which EPW \n     Majority Staff interviewed EPA officials involved an awarded \n     amount totaling of $150,000 for a grant term of May 2004 to \n     May 2004, for the purpose of ``improving meaningful non-\n     federal stakeholder involvement in decisions concerning clean \n     up of hazardous waste at federal facilities. In this grant, \n     EPA reports that it prepared a solicitation that was \n     available for sixty days on the agency Web site and in the \n     Federal Register. EPA received a total of twenty-three \n     proposals and awarded one. Proposals were evaluated by a \n     panel comprised of EPA personnel and two additional members \n     from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of \n     Energy.\n\n                     Consumer Federation of America\n\n       The Consumer Federation of America describes its purpose as \n     to ``work to advance pro-consumer policy on a variety of \n     issues before Congress, the White House, federal and state \n     regulatory agencies, state legislatures, and the courts.'' \n     The Consumer Federation of America (CEA) was formerly \n     represented by two organizations: the Consumer Federation of \n     America Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, and the \n     Consumer Federation of America, a 501(c)(4) organization. \n     According to the CFA, currently both organizations have now \n     merged into one 501(c)(3) organization following an EPA \n     Inspector General audit completed March 1, 2004 that was \n     referenced in testimony on EPA grants management before the \n     Environment and Public Works Committee on March 3, 2004.\n       The CFA reported end of the year net assets of $609,745 for \n     its IRS filing for the period ending 2003. It also reports \n     receiving $184,110 in direct public contributions during that \n     same reporting period. CFA has regularly filed Lobbying \n     Disclosure Act reports disclosing lobbying expenditures \n     between $80,000 and $200,000 from lobbying Congress and a \n     variety of federal agencies. In fact, the EPA Inspector \n     General included in its audit of CFA that CFA had an \n     estimated total of $940,000 in direct lobbying costs from \n     1998 through 2002.\n       The CFA Foundation has also been a regular recipient of \n     grant dollars from the EPA. Since 1993, the CFA or CFA \n     Foundation has received over $8 million alone from the EPA. \n     However, during the EPW Committee grants management oversight \n     hearing held March 3, 2004, the OIG testified to the \n     following:\n       ``We have reported on EPA shortcomings in overseeing \n     assistance agreements for over ten years. A particularly \n     relevant example is a recent report in which we questioned \n     $4.7 million because the work was performed by an ineligible \n     lobbying organization. EPA awarded the cooperative agreements \n     to an associated organization but did not have any employees, \n     space, or overhead expenses. In addition, the ineligible \n     organization's financial management practices did not comply \n     with Federal regulations. The recipient did not adequately \n     identify and separate lobbying expenses in its accounting \n     records. As a result, lobbying costs may have been charged to \n     the Federal projects.''\n       The OIG included its March 1, 2004 audit of the CFA with \n     its testimony which concluded with the following summary:\n       ``In summary, the [CFA] Federation, a 501(c)(4) \n     organization: (1) performed direct lobbying of Congress, and \n     (2) received Federal funds contrary to the Lobbying \n     Disclosure Act. Consequently, all the costs claimed and \n     paid under the agreements are statutorily unallowable.''\n       EPA has advised EPW Majority Staff that it continues to \n     work to resolve this issue with CFA and to develop a response \n     to the OIG audit. EPA has also disclosed that the agency \n     offices awarding the grants to CFA that were subject to the \n     audit did not prepare solicitations for the grants nor \n     subject the grants to competition with other potential \n     applicants.\n\n                          World Wildlife Fund\n\n       The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) describes its purpose as the \n     ``conservation of nature,'' and describes its conservation \n     work as focusing on three issues: ``saving endangered \n     species, protecting endangered habitats, and addressing \n     global threats such as toxic pollution, over-fishing and \n     climate change.'' The WWF advocates for a wide variety of \n     issues, such as opposing oil and gas development in the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, strengthening the Endangered \n     Species Act, advocating for global warming legislation, and \n     arguing that the Bush Administration plans to eliminate \n     millions of acres of national forests for road building, \n     logging, and mining interests.\n       The WWF is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt non-profit organization. \n     The WWF reports increasing end of the year net assets ranging \n     from $114 million for its tax filing in the period ending \n     1998 to $146 million for 2003. During this same period the \n     WWF reports receiving an increasing amount in direct public \n     contributions from $66.6 million for 1998 to $79 million for \n     2003. The WWF also reports lobbying expenditures each year \n     from 1998 to 2003 in amounts from $121,138 to $400,548. The \n     WWF reports making these expenditures lobbying Congress and \n     the Administration, including the Department of Interior, \n     U.S. Forest Service, and the EPA.\n       The WWF is also a regular recipient of government grants \n     and reported receiving over $20 million in government grants \n     from 1998 to 2001. The WWF reported receiving government \n     grants of over $18 million in 2002 and over $16 million in \n     2003 alone. Since 1993, the WWF has received over $1.6 \n     million in EPA discretionary grants including the most recent \n     ongoing EPA grant to the WWF for $100,000. The EPA Office of \n     Research and Development (ORD) awarded this grant to the WWF \n     beginning May 2002 for the purpose of providing technical \n     assistance to governmental departments of American Samoa to \n     assess the impacts of climate change on coral reef systems. \n     EPW Majority Staff interviewed EPA approving and project \n     officers for this grant. Although this grant was awarded \n     prior the EPA's discretionary grant competition, the ORD \n     prepared a solicitation for this grant that was available \n     from July 2001 to October 2001 on the EPA Web site and in the \n     Federal Register and Commerce Business Daily. The ORD \n     received twelve proposals that were evaluated by a panel \n     consisting of representatives from the EPA, the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Harvard \n     University. EPA awarded grants to five of the twelve \n     proposals. The WWF proposal begins with the foundation that \n     global warming due to anthropogenic effects is causing damage \n     to coral reefs among other detrimental effects. The EPA \n     reported that part of the monitoring requirements WWF is to \n     meet during the term of the grant is to submit periodic \n     reports. In each grant quarterly reports prepared by WWF, the \n     WWF reports working with local governmental departments \n     sampling and conducting studies gathering information on the \n     damage to coral reefs and associated species to ultimately \n     recommend means to protect American Samoa's corral reefs. EPA \n     officials anticipate the grant will conclude in 2005. EPW \n     Majority Staff also asked EPA officers responsible for \n     monitoring the grant whether grant management was \n     sufficiently described in their job description and whether \n     it is an area in which EPA measures their job performance. \n     Interestingly, one EPA officer responded that since being \n     assigned to ORD, both aspects were true. However, the same \n     EPA officer responded that in previous assignments neither \n     aspect was true.\n\n                          Friends of the Earth\n\n       Friends of the Earth states its mission as the following: \n     ``Friends of the Earth defends the world and champions a \n     healthy and just world.'' Friends of the Earth is a group \n     critical of the Bush Administration's environmental record, \n     suggesting that political contributors have solely determined \n     the environmental agenda of the Bush Administration.\n       Friends of the Earth is represented by two organizations: \n     Friends of the Earth, a 501(c)(3) organization, and Friends \n     of the Earth Action, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization.\n       Friends of the Earth has consistently reported end of year \n     net assets between $1 million and $3 million in IRS filings \n     for periods ending in 1998 through 2003. Over the same \n     period, Friends of the Earth has reported receiving annual \n     direct public contributions from $3.5 million for 1999 to \n     $4.4 million for 2003. From 1999 to 2003, Friends of the \n     Earth also reported lobbying expenditures from $29,433 to \n     $111,849. Friends of the Earth annual lobbying reports \n     disclose these expenditures include lobbying Congress and the \n     Administration, including the EPA.\n       Since 1999, Friends of the Earth has regularly reported it \n     has received no government grants; however, it has received \n     small federal grants from the EPA from 1993 to 1999 totaling \n     about $200,000. Like many other discretionary grants, EPA \n     acknowledges that these grants likely were awarded without a \n     public solicitation and without competition with other \n     potential applicants.\n\n                       World Resources Institute\n\n       The World Resources Institute describes itself as an \n     independent non-profit organization and describes its mission \n     is to ``move human society to live in way that protect \n     Earth's environment and its capacity to provide for the needs \n     and aspirations of current and future generations.'' The \n     World Resources Institute (WRI) is represented by two \n     501(c)(3) tax exempt non-profit organization, the WRI and the \n     World Resources Institute Fund.\n       The WRI board of directors consists of thirty-two members \n     including representatives from fellow EPA grantee, the \n     Natural Resources Defense Council, and the League of \n     Conversation Voters. WRI describes its work as being, \n     ``concentrated on achieving progress toward four key goals: \n     protect Earth's living systems; increase access to \n     information; create sustainable enterprise and opportunity; \n     reverse global warming.''\n       In IRS reporting periods from 1998 to 2003, the WRI \n     regularly reports end of the year\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\n     net assets from $46 million to $57 million. During this same \n     period the WRI reported receiving varying amounts of annual \n     direct public contributions, from $8.6 million for 1998, \n     $14.3 million for 1999, $9.4 million for 2000, $15.7 million \n     for 2001, $21.7 million for 2002, and $9.3 million for 2003. \n     WRI has also reported consistently receiving millions of \n     dollars in government grants each year. WRI reported \n     receiving $3.2 million for 1998, $2.4 million for 1999, $2.9 \n     for 2000, $2.3 for 2001, $3.4 for 2002, and $2.7 for 2003. \n     The WRI is also a regular recipient of EPA grants, totaling \n     around $8,132,060 million awarded since 1993. All except \n     $575,000 of the total amount of grants awarded to WRI were \n     awarded prior to the EPA competition policy. Additionally, \n     all of the $575,000 awarded since 2003 has been awarded in \n     amounts under the competition policy threshold or were \n     incremental amounts under already awarded original grants. \n     Unless the awarding office within EPA for any of the grants \n     within the $8.1 million instituted its own competition \n     policy, EPA acknowledges that all $8.1 million was likely \n     awarded without solicitation and competition with other \n     potential recipients.\n\n                      National Wildlife Federation\n\n       The National Wildlife Federation describes itself as ``the \n     nation's largest and oldest protector of wildlife.'' The \n     National Wildlife Federation is involved in various \n     environmental issues and features a ``Take Action'' page on \n     its Web site advocating for national global warming \n     legislation and characterizing the Bush Administration as \n     ``ax[ing] protections for National Forest across the \n     country.''\n       The National Wildlife Federation is represented by two \n     organizations: the National Wildlife Federation, a 501(c)(3) \n     organization, and the National Wildlife Action, a 501(c)(4) \n     organization.\n       The National Wildlife Federation has reported varying \n     annual end of the year net assets from $33.8 million in its \n     IRS filings for the period ending 2000 to $6.7 million for \n     2003. During the same period, the National Wildlife \n     Federation reports receiving direct public contributions from \n     $34.7 million for 1999 to $37.9 million for 2003 with public \n     contributions over $40 million for 2001 and 2002. The \n     National Wildlife Federation also reports consistent lobbying \n     expenditures from $140,000 to $371,000 from 2000 through \n     2003.\n       The National Wildlife Federation has also reported \n     regularly receiving government grants each year, with \n     $265,441 for 2000, $214,811 for 2001, $244,403 for 2002, and \n     $330,941 for 2003. EPA reports that it has awarded the \n     National Wildlife Federation approximately $600,000 since \n     1994 all of which was awarded in grants which individually \n     amounted to well under the EPA's new discretionary grant \n     competition policy threshold.\n\n\n                             stappa-alapco\n\n       STAPPA-ALAPCO is the combination of the State and \n     Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, a 501(c)(3) \n     organization, and the Association of Local Air Pollution \n     Control Officials, a 501(c)(6) trade association. STAPPA-\n     ALAPCO describes itself as the ``two national associations \n     that represent air pollution control agencies in 54 states \n     and territories and over 165 major metropolitan areas across \n     the United States.''\n       STAPPA-ALAPCO receives no direct public contributions, and \n     according to the EPA, it receives all of its funding from EPA \n     through government grants. STAPPA-ALAPCO created a \n     ``Secretariat'' in 1980 and that has been receiving funding \n     through Clean Air Act grants from the EPA Office of Air and \n     Radiation since that time. These grants are exempt from the \n     EPA competition policy because of an exemption for co-\n     regulators.\n       STAPPA-ALAPCO has drawn the past criticism of Chairman \n     Inhofe for its regular Congressional testimony supporting a \n     variety of new EPA rulemakings. In his opening statement in \n     an EPW Committee hearing in July 2002 concerning \n     environmental regulations affecting military readiness, \n     Inhofe stated:\n       ``How many times has STAPPA-ALAPCO testified before \n     Congress, and how many times were they opposing the \n     streamlining of procedural paperwork. . . . These groups of \n     government bureaucrats invariably wind up testifying for \n     bigger government and opposing smaller government.\n       ``To add insult to injury, not only are the salaries of \n     these individual government employees paid with our tax \n     dollars; quite often the groups themselves receive separate, \n     additional, appropriated dollars to pay for the groups \n     themselves and the activities of these groups. As I say, \n     these activities almost invariably amount to lobbying for \n     bigger government and more expenditures of our tax dollars \n     with an emphasis not on better results but rather on more \n     procedures.''\n       Pursuant to a resolution of member states, EPA calculates \n     the individual shares of each member state and sets aside \n     funds from Clean Air Act grant allocations for a state to \n     fund STAPPA-ALAPCO. This method of EPA directly funding \n     STAPPA-ALAPCO has drawn past criticism. For instance, \n     language in the conference report for the 2001 Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and \n     Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill directed EPA to \n     withhold state and local grant funds at the national level to \n     pay for activities of programs only if such activities are \n     efforts that will benefit state and local air agencies, if \n     the activities are the responsibility of state and local air \n     agencies and if state and local air agencies have provided \n     their concurrence. A state is free to withdraw support from \n     STAPPA-ALAPCO. Additionally, a state is now also free to \n     support STAPPA-ALAPCO directly. In fact, not all states are \n     currently members of STAPPA-ALAPCO. In response to an EPW \n     Majority Staff request for the total amount of EPA grants \n     awarded to the STAPPA-ALAPCO Secretariat over the period \n     1988-2003, EPA responded with a list of five grants for a \n     total of $6,190,830.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The EPA awards over half of its annual budget each year in \n     grants. The GAO, OMB, and OIG have made various common \n     criticisms of EPA grants management, including a lack of \n     measurable environmental results, a lack of a measurable \n     probability of success from the grants, no evaluation of \n     reasonable costs in grants, and a general lack of oversight \n     of EPA personnel and grantees. Although much of EPA's grant \n     funding is provided in formula-based non-discretionary grants \n     to state and local governmental entities, several hundred \n     million dollars each year are awarded to discretionary \n     recipients. For several years, the GAO, OMB, and OIG have \n     criticized the management of these discretionary grants, in \n     particular citing that EPA has often awarded these grants \n     without widespread solicitation or competition with any other \n     potential applicants. The GAO has argued that EPA oversight \n     of discretionary grants has been particularly problematic \n     especially of non-profit recipients. The OIG has even argued \n     that this lack of competition in discretionary grants has \n     given the appearance of years of preferential treatment in \n     EPA discretionary grant awards. EPA has responded with new \n     competition and oversight policies and a five-year grants \n     management plan to cure the years of criticism of its overall \n     grants program. This preliminary report confirms some of \n     those criticisms in some individual discretionary grants and \n     highlights some promising practices within the EPA to better \n     manage and award discretionary grants.\n       However, this report also reveals the problem that EPA has \n     consistently awarded discretionary grants to non-politically \n     involved groups. These grants have been awarded in large part \n     without solicitation or competition with other applicants and \n     may have received the least oversight from EPA. The example \n     of the OIG audit of the Consumer Federation of America may be \n     a discrete situation or may simply be one example of non-\n     profit grant recipients taking advantage of past EPA grant \n     oversight to potentially use funds for unintended purposes. \n     In either case, however, EPA needs to be aware that it \n     regularly subsidizes non-profit organizations with \n     discretionary grant funding that are partisan or otherwise \n     politically active. Of all new reforms in EPA grants \n     management, reforms in discretionary grants can occur \n     immediately due to the fact they are just that--\n     discretionary. EPA should include in its new culture of grant \n     management a careful scrutiny of all the activities of \n     discretionary grant applicants to absolutely ensure grant \n     awards are being used for their intended purposes. In \n     addition, and as important as ensuring allowable costs, the \n     Administration should ensure that it is not being undermined \n     by the other activities of its grants recipients and give \n     equally careful scrutiny to the wide spectrum of political \n     activity of some of its discretionary grant recipients before \n     making awards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10428-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10428-S10429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING FAVORITE TEACHERS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

The paper trail required with this bill would serve as \na safety net if an electronic malfunction happens to occur.\n  American voters are skeptical coming into the 2004 election after the \nmuch debated recounts that took place in the 2000 election, and in \norder to put the voters at ease, we must make our voting technology \nbetter and keep every vote on record.

Mr. President, I rise to address the progress that's \nbeen made in how the Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, program \noperates. You may recall that in 2002, I worked with Senator Baucus to \nshepherd landmark TAA reforms through Congress. President Bush \nacknowledged the role of TAA as an important part of his comprehensive \ntrade agenda when he signed these reforms into law in August of that \nyear. The reform legislation made a number of changes to TAA, \nincluding, for the very first time, the addition of a new health \ncoverage tax credit, or HCTC, and a new wage insurance provision, as \nwell as a doubling of the funds available for retraining workers \ndislocated by trade. Given the number and significance of the changes \nmade to TAA, I joined Senator Baucus in asking the Government \nAccountability Office, or GAO, to study how the TAA Reform Act is being \nimplemented. Separately, we asked GAO\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\nto study how the health coverage tax credit is being implemented. The \nGAO report on TAA came out last month, and while it's clear some of the \ndetails of implementation merit further study, overall the report shows \na marked improvement in the way TAA is administered.\n  The GAO report notes that the Department of Labor has reduced its \naverage petition-processing time from 107 days in 2002 to 38 days in \n2003, and the percentage of petitions processed in 40 days or less \nincreased from 17 percent in 2002 to 62 percent in 2003. Certified \nworkers are enrolling in training services more quickly than in prior \nyears. More broadly, it is evident that the funds available under TAA \nare beginning to be administered more effectively. One of the hurdles \nthat Labor officials had to overcome was a perception, at least in some \nstates, that all TAA-eligible workers are entitled to training. \nAccording to GAO, that perception contributed to problems with managing \nTAA training funds.\n  In response, the Labor Department has encouraged, States to take \nsteps to better administer TAA funds. The Labor Department has also \nimproved the way it disburses training funds so that State officials \ncan better target the funds that are available to workers who are truly \nin need of training. These efforts are starting to pay off; in fact, \nafter the GAO report came out, we learned that thanks to improved \nadministration by the Labor Department, $28.4 million dollars was \navailable at the end of the 2004 fiscal year for supplemental \ndistribution. Last week my home State of Iowa received an additional \n$559,626 dollars in additional TAA training, job search; and relocation \nfunds. These funds will help ensure that trade-impacted Iowans will \nreceive the benefits they are entitled to under the program. The same \nis true for States across the country. I think we can all agree that it \nis good to see our taxpayer dollars being spent more wisely.\n  Unfortunately, the GAO report fails to capture the full breadth of \nthe improvements made by the Labor Department. The report States that \n19 states temporarily discontinued enrolling TAA-eligible workers in \ntraining at some point between fiscal years 2001 and 2003 because they \nlacked adequate training funds. However, GAO collected only aggregate \ndata, so it is unclear how many States temporarily discontinued \nenrollment before funding was doubled in the TAA Reform Act of 2002, \nversus after. That information would have been helpful. The report does \nnote that six States temporarily discontinued enrollment during fiscal \nyear 2004, which is quite puzzling given the fact that the TAA program \nhad funds left over at the end of the year. I think it is important to \nnote that Labor dispatched technical assistance teams to help those \nStates implement needed improvements so that workers could get access \nto training. Since there wasn't any shortfall in funds, it seems those \n6 States can work with Labor to administer the program more \neffectively. So, while Labor's progress has been impressive, there's \ncertainly more work to be done.\n\n  The wage insurance provision known as alternative TAA for older \nworkers is a brand new program, so it is not surprising that \nimplementation has not been without hiccups. But things are improving. \nAccording to the Labor Department, as of August 2004, 32 States had \nalready issued alternative TAA payments and another 11 States had the \ncapability to do so. In addition, 48 States reported that information \non the alternative TAA program is provided as part of their rapid \nresponse activities. Approved petitions for alternative TAA increased \nfrom 60 in fiscal year 2003 to 937 in fiscal year 2004. Importantly, \nsince alternative TAA went into effect in August 2003, well over 700 \nworkers have received assistance from this new program.\n  As for the health coverage tax credit, it is also a brand new \nprogram. The just-released GAO report shows that the HCTC was \nimplemented at record speed and is providing valuable health care \ncoverage to thousands of displaced workers and recipients of benefits \nfrom the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC. While the \ninitial take-up rate may not be as high as was estimated at the time \nthe TAA Reform Act was passed, even GAO noted that determining an \nactual rate of participation rate is difficult. Not all workers \ninitially identified as being eligible will meet all the requirements, \nand of those that do it is not apparent how many have access to \nhealthcare coverage via their spouse. In addition, enrollment numbers \nfor the HCTC do not reflect all of the dependents who also benefit from \nthe HCTC.\n  The Labor Department has reached out to educate the public about \nthese and other aspects of the TAA Reform Act. Labor officials \nconducted 15 training sessions with stakeholders across the country in \nfiscal years 2002 and 2003. During fiscal year 2004, six regional \nforums were held for workforce practitioners in which Labor began \nfocusing on policies and practices that integrate service delivery to \ndislocated workers in need of services. Labor administers a wide array \nof programs for trade affected workers, including both TAA and the \nWorkforce Investment Act, or WIA. In the past, these programs have been \nsplintered, leading to inconsistent service delivery. Through \ninitiatives started by the current Department of Labor, workers are now \nreceiving a wider array of services in faster time. While it is clear \nmore work remains, the GAO reports do bear witness to the progress \nthat's been made.\n  I will continue working with Senator Baucus to monitor developments \nand oversee implementation of the TAA Reform Act. We must continue to \nassess how the program can be improved. For example, there is currently \nno incentive for States to report the most accurate information \npossible. We should consider ways to improve the data that is reported, \nso the TAA program's true impact can be fully assessed. Additional \nstudy by GAO may prove helpful in this and other areas. Labor started \nits own 5-year rigorous impact evaluation of the TAA program this year, \nand that should also prove helpful. But while there is room for \nimprovement, it is also true that much has been accomplished, and I \nwant to take this opportunity to thank the hard working officials at \nthe Department of Labor for their dedication in implementing the \nsignificant changes brought about by the TAA Reform Act of 2002. I also \nthank officials at the Internal Revenue Service, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, and PBGC, along with those in State \nagencies, who have worked so hard to implement the HCTC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10430-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR MEDICINE WEEK\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Nuclear Medicine Week is the first \nweek in October every year and is an annual celebration initiated by \nthe Society of Nuclear Medicine. Each year, Nuclear Medicine Week is \ncelebrated internationally at hospitals, clinics, imaging centers, \neducational institutions, corporations, and more.\n  I am particularly proud to note that the Society of Nuclear Medicine \nis headquartered in Reston, VA.

Mr. President, the oral health of older Americans is in a \nstate of decay. Millions of vulnerable seniors are unable to access the \noral health care they need, suffer needlessly, and ultimately require \ncostly and invasive treatments that unnecessarily burden our troubled \nhealth care system.\n  Good oral health care should begin at birth as part of overall health \ncare. This important component of health care should not--and cannot--\nend at retirement. Proper dental care must be a lifetime commitment. \nUnfortunately, for far too many older Americans, oral health care is a \nluxury. Too many of our ``greatest generation'' suffer from chronic \noral pain and disease, severely limiting regular activities of daily \nliving and impeding their independence. Neglect of oral health may \nresult in the deterioration of overall physical health. Lack of access \nto care for even routine dental cleanings and exams can exacerbate \nserious and complicated overall health problems that increase with age.\n  Limited access to oral health care poses one of the greatest crises \nfor the health and well being of America's elderly. Not one older \nAmerican receives routine dental care under Medicare. Medigap, used by \nsome older Americans as a supplemental insurance to Medicare, is an \nexpensive cavity when it comes to dental coverage. Less than 20 percent \nof Americans 75 and older have any form of private dental insurance. \nUnder Medicaid, adult dental care is optional and close to 30 States \nare failing to meet even the most minimal standards of care. Millions \nsuffer, often in silence.\n  Older adults suffer from the cumulative toll of oral diseases over \ntheir lifetime. This results in extensive oral and periodontal disease. \nSurveys have shown that nursing home residents with teeth suffer \nparticularly from untreated tooth decay, while those without teeth also \nhave a variety of oral health problems. Medications often adversely \naffect oral health as well. Evidence suggests that periodontal disease \ncan complicate or is linked to diabetes, heart disease, stroke and \npneumonia.\n  Some older Americans--especially those with special needs, the frail, \nand those classified by the Social Security Administration to be aged, \nblind and disabled--are often plagued with challenging oral health \nneeds. Being disabled, medically compromised, homebound, or \ninstitutionalized increases the likelihood of serious dental problems \nand limited access to dental care. Dental care for the 1.65 million \npeople in long-term care facilities is problematic at best.\n  I would like to tell you about Marcia Ball, who lives in a nursing \nhome in Lafayette, LA. She is 64. One morning last July, she awoke to \nfind her cheek swollen up like a balloon. An untreated abscess had run \nrampant, sending her to the hospital with a raging fever and labored \nbreathing. After a surgical team drained the infection, her heart and \nlungs suddenly stopped working. She pulled through, but four days later \ndeveloped pneumonia. A member of the medical team says that the \nbacteria from untreated tooth decay entered her lungs every time she \ninhaled. She returned to her nursing home after two weeks at the \nhospital. Medicaid paid for three rounds of antibiotics, two trips to \nthe emergency room, two days in intensive care, and the remainder of \nher hospital stay. But Medicaid in Louisiana, like many other States, \nwon't pay for extractions. So she still has badly decayed teeth, but \nshe doesn't have the $60 needed to cover an extraction or insurance for \nroutine dental care.\n\n  Marcia Ball's story is not unusual, according to Dr. Greg Folse, a \ngeriatric dentist in Lafayette. Most of Dr. Folse's patients are \nkeeping their teeth as they age, but he says that over 85 percent have \nmoderate to severe gum disease and 60 percent have tooth decay. \nMedicaid dental services in Louisiana, where Dr. Folse takes his \npractice to patients in his van, are limited to dentures, which are not \nmuch use for people who still have their teeth.\n  A national report card released in September by the advocacy group \nOral Health America before a forum of the U.S. Senate Special Committee \non Aging examined seniors' access to key dental services and gave \nfailing or near failing grades to each State and gave the Nation an \noverall ``D'' grade. When it comes to caring for vulnerable \npopulations, the report said, the country is flat out failing.\n  This lack of access to oral health care is compounded by a shortage \nof skilled geriatric dental care professionals, part of a larger \nnational shortage of geriatricians described to the U.S. Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging by the Alliance for Aging Research in their report, \nMedical Never Never Land. Just finding a dentist can pose a \nconsiderable challenge for older Americans and those with a disability. \nThe good work of community health centers is limited to providing \npreventative and basic dental care to only about one-in-twelve patients \nwho are fortunate enough to have access to such a facility. In many \nStates that provide a dental benefit, reimbursement rates are too low \nto attract a sufficient number of dentists willing to treat Medicaid \npatients.\n  With scientific advances and the graying of millions of baby boomers, \nthis year the number of elderly on the planet passed the number of \nchildren for the first time. Although we have made great strides in \npromoting independence, productivity and quality of life, old age still \nbrings inadequate health care, isolation, impoverishment, abuse and \nneglect for far too many Americans.\n  Oral diseases can impact an otherwise independent, productive life, \ntriggering a downward spiral that can result in malnutrition, serious \nillness and even death.\n  In 2000, the Surgeon General's office called oral disease in this \ncountry a ``silent epidemic,'' but oral health continues to be an \nafterthought to other health care issues, and off the radar screen for \nmost national leaders. Congress has never addressed the lack of oral \nhealth coverage for older Americans, failing to place these this issue \ninto the national consciousness and addressed the issues at a national \nlevel.\n  We need new infrastructure and funding--focusing resources, creating \naccountability and changing how we think about oral health in our \ncountry, particularly as it affects vulnerable populations. We must lay \nthe foundation to address, in a meaningful and lasting way, a \ndevastating and growing problem that has been invisible for far too \nlong. We can no longer neglect these difficult issues afflicting frail \nand elderly victims.\n  This effort needs to take numerous steps to improve access to oral \nhealth care:\n  We need to ensure the provision of oral health screening, diagnostic, \nand treatment services, particularly for vulnerable individuals, and \nnursing home and long-term care residents.\n  We must eliminate the barriers requiring determination of medical \nnecessity. We must ensure that States comply with applied income laws.\n  We need to ensure greater communication among States and nursing home \nand long-term care facilities about the need for and availability of \noral health services.\n  More and more of us will enjoy longer, healthier lives with our teeth \nintact, but with this gift comes the responsibility to prevent the \nneedless suffering too often borne by our frailest citizens.\n  I appreciate the work of my fellow members and a wide array of \nexcellent groups such as Oral Health America, Special Care Dentistry, \nand the Alliance for Aging Research, and individuals like Dr. Greg \nFolse on behalf of oral health and older Americans and look forward to \ncontinued support from both sides of the aisle and in both Houses to \nmake oral health a reality for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10431-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10431-S10432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF NANCY NADEL\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Nancy \nNadel, recipient of the Delaware School Nurse of the Year award. Nancy \nhas dedicated her life to her family and to the thousands of school \nchildren whose lives she has touched.\n  Nancy was born in Wilmington on September 16, 1952. She graduated \nfrom John Dickinson High School in 1970 and received her bachelor's \ndegree in school nursing in 1974 from the University of Delaware. \nDuring college,\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\nNancy joined the U.S. Army after graduation and was assigned to \nFitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, CO. She retired as a \nLieutenant Colonel in 1996 from the United States Army Reserve. In \n1979, Nancy received her master's degree in school nursing and her \nPediatric Nurse Practitioner Certificate from the University of \nColorado.\n  Nancy returned to Delaware in 1983. Three years later, she became the \nschool nurse for the Baltz Elementary School and remained there until \n1995, when she went to Forest Oak Elementary School. At Forest Oak, she \nis known as a nonassuming person, who has a ``quiet way about doing \nwhat she does best--being a school nurse.'' She is kind to the children \nand always looking out for their best interests.\n  In 2002, Nancy started a fitness program at Forest Oaks Elementary. \nHaving been inspired by a talk on obesity at the National School Nurses \nConvention, she submitted a grant application, and was awarded $3,300 \nfrom the State of Delaware to implement her program. The program \npromotes increased physical activity and healthy nutrition in first to \nfourth graders. Nancy hopes to expand the program to also include \nstudents in kindergarten and fifth grade and to teachers and staff.\n  Nancy has also helped coordinate a bike safety program and helmet \nprogram, taught open airways classes to empower students with asthma in \nself care, collaborated with the school guidance counselor and \npsychologist to meet the emotional and educational needs of students \nand presented staff education programs in diabetes, asthma and \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\n  Nancy is a member of Sigma Theta Tau, the international nursing honor \nsociety, the National Association of School Nurses, the Delaware School \nNurses Association, DSNA, and was a member of the DSNA Continuing \nEducation Committee from 1990-1995. Nancy also serves on the Red Clay \nNurse Liaison Committee, is the computer representative for the Red \nClay School nurses, and is a member of the revision committee for the \nschool nurse technical assistance manual.\n  Nancy is married to Joe Nadel, a psychologist and teacher at Wesley \nCollege. She has four children, Katie, Carolyn, Dan, and Susan, and \nthree stepchildren, Joe, Ian and Mike. In her spare time, she \nvolunteers at Mary Mother of Hope House II by sponsoring food, linen \nand gift drives at their shelter.\n  Nancy is an amazing human being. She has been and remains deeply \ncommitted to her family, her students, and her community. She has \nhelped shape the lives of thousands in the halls of the institutions \nshe served, and in the hearts of those who have been lucky enough to \ncall her their friend. I rise today to honor and to thank Nancy for her \nselfless dedication to the betterment of others. She is a remarkable \nwoman and a testament to the community she represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10432-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEW JERSEY ALLIANCE FOR ACTION\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 30th \nanniversary of the New Jersey Alliance for Action, an organization that \nhas worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for all New \nJerseyans.\n  The New Jersey Alliance for Action is a nonprofit, nonpartisan \nconsortium of business, labor, government and academic leaders \ndedicated to creating jobs, improving the economy and protecting the \nenvironment. These goals are achieved by modernizing our State's \ninfrastructure to meet the needs of a growing New Jersey. Since its \ncreation in 1974, the New Jersey Alliance for Action has worked to \nobtain funding and secure permits for road, rail, and aviation \nimprovements, water projects, school construction, shore preservation, \nbusiness expansion and other key infrastructure initiatives. Today, it \nboasts more than 600 dedicated members and has developed a solid track \nrecord of working closely with state and local governments.\n  The Board of Trustees of the New Jersey Alliance for Action is \ncomposed of some of New Jersey's most prominent business, labor, \nprofessional and educational leaders. Through creative partnerships \nbetween the public and private sectors, the foundation addresses many \nof the pressing issues that affect the great State of New Jersey.\n  While this organization is exemplary, two men must be singled out for \ntheir vision and hard work: Richard M. Hale and Ellis S. Vieser. They \nwere responsible for creating an organization that crossed the \nboundaries, establishing an environment where the interests of New \nJersey's citizens are top priority. We owe a deep debt of gratitude for \ntheir lifetime of dedication and remarkable leadership. They embodied a \ncan-do attitude together with a sense of community. It is not difficult \nto see how the alliance has made such giant strides in such a \nrelatively short period of time.\n  I thank the members of the New Jersey Alliance for Action for \ncontinuing the work of Richard M. Hale and Ellis S. Vieser. It is their \ncommitment to the work of the alliance's founders that allows New \nJersey to shine so brightly. Congratulations on this very special \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10432-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VETERANS' HISTORY PROJECT\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly recognize \nthe progress of the Veterans' History Project and to honor Greg Latza, \nauthor of Blue Stars: A Selection of Stories from South Dakota's World \nWar II Veterans.\n  Blue Stars honors and immortalizes the incredible stories of forty-\nfour South Dakota World War II veterans. Greg's inspiration for writing \nthis book came in 1994, when as a photographer for a newspaper, he \ncovered a powerful interview of a Sioux Falls World War II veteran.\n  As World War II veterans grow older, it is important to collect their \nstories, as Greg did, before they are lost. There are 19 million war \nveterans living in the United States, and every day we lose 1,600 of \nthem. We will be able to honor their services for generations to come \nby collecting their memories for the Veterans' History Project and \npreserving them at the Library of Congress.\n  The Veterans' History Project, which Congress unanimously approved on \nOctober 27, 2000, honors our Nation's war veterans and those who served \nin support of them, by creating a legacy of recorded interviews and \nother documents chronicling veterans' wartime experiences. The project \nencompasses veterans of World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, \nOperation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  All recordings of personal histories and all documents submitted to \nthe Veterans' History Project will be archived in the National History \nCollection at the Library of Congress' American Folklife Center. These \nimportant artifacts will create a comprehensive, searchable catalog of \nveterans' stories, thus allowing current and future generations to \naccess them.\n  I congratulate Greg Latza on his efforts. Blue Stars pays a great \ntribute to South Dakota's contributions to World War II. Like the \nVeterans' History Project, it serves as an excellent example of the \nimportance of honoring and remembering America's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10432-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10432-S10433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING GUNNERY SERGEANT CLESTER LENOIR\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I honor not only a fellow \nLouisianian, but also an extraordinary Marine, Clester Lenoir. Clester \nLenoir is retiring after serving more than 20 years of service in the \nUnited States Marine Corps. He was raised in Baton Rouge, LA, where he \ngraduated from Tara High School, Baton Rouge in 1984.\n  Gunnery Sergeant's first duty station was in his home state of \nLouisiana where he served with the Fourth Marine Division in New \nOrleans. He was assigned as the Status of Resources and Training System \nNoncommissioned Officer, a staff sergeant's billet. He was tasked to \nassist and inspect various reserve units around the Nation. He excelled \nat this assignment and was awarded a Navy/Marine Corps Achievement \nmedal for his meritorious service.\n  Lenoir has served as an Administrative Assistant in the Marine Corps' \nOffice of Legislative Affairs during his last 3 years of service. That \noffice supports Members of Congress, and their committees on matters \nrelating to the Marine Corps and the security of our Nation.\n\n[[Page S10433]]\n\n  Lenoir has carried the Marine Corps' message to these hallowed halls, \nproviding Members the information necessary to determine how best to \nequip, maintain and support the United States Marine Corps and \nultimately provide and ensure our Nation's security. During this \nperiod, he has been responsible for directing, and organizing numerous \ncongressional events in the metropolitan DC area. His attention to \ndetail in making these very important events logistically successful is \nnoteworthy.\n  Lenoir has made a lasting contribution in the capability of today's \nMarine Corps and the future shape of tomorrow's Corps. His superior \nperformance of duties highlight the culmination of more than 20 years \nof dedicated and honorable Marine Corps service. He achieved five Navy/\nMarine Corps Achievement medals for his exemplary service throughout \nhis 20-year career. By his exemplary professional competence, sound \njudgment, and total dedication to duty, he has reflected great credit \nupon himself and has always upheld the highest traditions of the United \nStates Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\n  I am proud that Clester Lenoir joined the Marine Corps from the great \nstate of Louisiana, seeking to protect and serve our great Nation. He \nhas done so with great distinction. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I \nwish to extend my heartfelt thanks and gratitude. May he have many more \nyears of continuing success as he pursues other interests outside of \nthe United States Marine Corps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10433-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN MEMORY OF JUDGE RICHARD SHEPPARD ARNOLD\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on September 23, our country lost \none of its greatest jurists, and Arkansas lost one of its greatest \nnative sons, Richard Sheppard Arnold.\n  Judge Arnold was born into a legal family in 1936 in Texarkana, TX. \nHis maternal grandfather, Morris Sheppard, served in this body from \nTexas from 1913 until 1941, and his paternal grandfather, William H. \nArnold, was a circuit judge. His father, Richard Lewis Arnold, was a \nleading expert in public unitlies law. Judge Arnold graduated first in \nhis class from Yale University and Harvard Law School, and in 1960 and \n1961, he served as law clerk to one of our Nation's greatest Supreme \nCourt Justices, the late William J. Brennan. Judge Arnold served in \nprivate practice, ran for Congress, served as legislative advisor to \nboth Governor and Senator Dale Bumpers, and spent more than 25 years on \nthe Federal district and appellate benches. Since 1980, Judge Arnold \nserved on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Richard Arnold was one of our great legal writers with more than 700 \nopinions over the course of his legal career. Just this year, the \nAmerican Society of Writers on Legal Subjects awarded him its lifetime \nachievement award, only the second in its 50-year history. His more \nprominent opinions advanced civil rights and voting rights, and in \nMarch of this year, as part of a three-judge panel, his 22-page opinion \nupheld a lower court ruling releasing the Little Rock School District \nfrom more than 40 years of Federal court supervision of its \ndesegregation efforts.\n  Judge Richard Arnold was a friend to President Clinton and me and we \njoin his wife, Kay, and his two daughters, Janet and Lydia, along with \nhis brother, Judge Morris ``Buzz'' Arnold, in mourning his passing. He \nwill be remembered for his remarkable life, his unequalled brilliance, \ncharacter, common sense, deep religious faith, and devotion to the law. \nWe have lost a cherished friend, and our Nation has lost a champion of \njustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10433-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLONEL JOHN SCHORSCH\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nappreciation for the outstanding service of Colonel John Schorsch, or \n``Rusty'' as we all call him.\n  Liaison chiefs are chosen because of their expertise, their ability \nto manage personnel in a pressure-packed environment, and their \ndiscernment in making tough decisions in difficult situations. They \ngenerally have a well-rounded education, significant command \nexperience, and a long track record of effectiveness. Simply put, \nservice liaison chiefs are the best of the best.\n  Colonel Schorsch is certainly one of the best. He is graduate of the \nUnited States Military Academy and the U.S. Naval War College. He has \nbeen a platoon commander, a company commander, a battalion commander, \nand a brigade commander. Colonel Schorsch has served as an aide-de-camp \nand as the joint staff action officer and planner. Perhaps more \nimportantly, Rusty served as the Army aide to two Presidents: President \nBush and President Clinton.\n  I have traveled with Rusty many times and have greatly enjoyed the \nopportunity to get to know him. He is engaging, outgoing, and \ndisarming. His stories about life in the Army often take on epic \nproportions and can make the most dour individual break into a grin.\n  Yet what separates Colonel Schorsch from most is his character. He is \ncompletely unflappable. He is undaunted by challenges. He is relentless \nin pursuit of a goal and absolutely determined to complete an assigned \ntask. To Rusty, no detail is too small, no assignment too menial, and \nno task too trivial.\n  When things become difficult, Rusty remains undeterred. He does not \ngive in. He does not cave. Indeed, whenever he has encountered \nseemingly unsurmountable problems, Rusty's philosophy has always been \nto step it up, and hold nothing back.\n  I have watched him time and time again tackle with the equal \nefficiency the largest of problems and the smallest of details. I have \nseen him persevere and overcome obstacles. And, during these \nchallenges, he does not complain; and he does not flinch; he does not \ngive in.\n  The Army has been fortunate to have a soldier like Rusty as its \nliaison chief here in the Senate. He has demonstrated to me and to many \nother Members the caliber and quality of Army officers. I know I speak \nfor many of my fellow Members in expressing our disappointment in his \ndeparture. Yet I know that the Army has many good things planned for \nRusty and that our country will benefit from his experience elsewhere.\n  With this in mind, I sincerely appreciate Colonel Schorsch's service \nto me and the rest of the Senate. I wish him the best in the future. He \nwill surely be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10433-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING CHUCK GROTH\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Tom Daschle \nand myself, we publicly honor and recognize Chuck Groth. For more than \n30 years, Chuck Groth has been telling the story. Whether it's about \nthe trials and tribulations of farm families or the status of Federal \npolicy that will impact agriculture, more than 10,000 South Dakota farm \nfamilies have relied on Chuck's insightful presentation in their \nmonthly edition of the Union Farmer.\n  The Union Farmer is the voice of the South Dakota Farmer's Union, \ncovering the extensive interests of the organization's varied \nmembership.\n  Chuck Groth has been responsible for more than 360 editions of the \nUnion Farmer--an extraordinary record of longevity. Throughout the ups \nand downs of the industry, Chuck reported the news that captured the \ncurrent state of affairs. He helped elevate the public dialogue about \nimportant issues, and made people more aware of the plight of South \nDakota's farm and ranch families.\n  During the mid-1980s, America's farm families faced their darkest \ndays since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Chuck helped organized \nthousands of Farmer's Union members to call upon their elected \nofficials to provide assistance to rural America. The effort led to a \nhistoric act that took all 105 members of the South Dakota State \nLegislature to Washington, DC, in 1985 to lobby Congress about the \nneeds of rural America.\n  Chuck has helped organize more than 50 fly-ins to Washington, DC, \ntrips that helped keep farm policy at the forefront of the \ncongressional agenda. Agriculture needed to have its story told, and \nChuck was the wordsmith that made that possible.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Tom Daschle and myself in \nsaluting Chuck Groth for his distinguished career and commitment to our \nNation's family farmer.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10434-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAT CHRISTEN\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this evening in San Francisco, a \ngrateful community is coming together to honor one of the Nation's most \nable and respected leaders in the fight against HIV and AIDS--Pat \nChristen. For the past 15 years, Pat has served as executive director \nof the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. Tonight, she will end her tour of \nservice to spend more time with her family particularly with her two \nyoung daughters, Morgan and Madison.\n  Since 1982, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation has been at the \nforefront of the ongoing battle against HIV and AIDS. Pat was there in \nthe beginning, when a mysterious and deadly disease was taking so many \nof the San Francisco community's young people. She manned the agency's \nhotline as a volunteer, serving as an outlet and a resource for those \nfacing the disease. From this caring and compassionate beginning, Pat \nrose to become a courageous and visionary leader against HIV.\n  In San Francisco, Pat saw thousands of young people in her community \ndie needlessly because they could not obtain the proper medical care \nand support they needed in order to live and fight the disease. At the \nfoundation, she helped to shape San Francisco's response to prevention \nand treatment of AIDS. She also took the battle to Congress and had a \nvital role in the development and passage of the Federal Ryan White \nCARE Act.\n  In her familiar grassroots style, Pat and the foundation galvanized \nother like-minded organizations around the country to help develop the \nCARE Act, and to provide the muscle and hustle that was necessary to \ngalvanize action in Congress. Today, the Ryan White Act provides over \n$2 billion a year in HIV care and treatment to those most in need. It \nbrings new hope and the promise of a life of dignity for tens of \nthousands of people living with HIV in cities and communities \nthroughout the nation.\n  Under Pat's leadership, the foundation recently joined the global \nbattle against HIV and AIDS. In December 2000, the Pangaea Global AIDS \nFoundation was launched in an effort to expand HIV antiretroviral \ntreatment and care in the developing world. In just a few short years, \nPangaea has become a key strategic resource in this international \neffort, particularly in Asia and Africa.\n  In October 2003, the Government of South Africa announced an \nunprecedented program to provide HIV antiretroviral drugs to the 5 \nmillion people in that nation suffering from HIV and AIDS. Pat and \nother Pangaea staff were part of a small technical support team working \nintensively behind the scenes with the South African Government as it \nprepared its national treatment initiative. Without Pat's skillful \nleadership, it might never have happened. Pangaea is now helping to \nmake similar urgently needed relief available in Uganda and China.\n  Over the course of her career, Pat has demonstrated her willingness \nto speak out, to challenge others to become involved, to show \ncompassion and understanding when others reacted with anger and \nvindictiveness. Above all, she had an extraordinary ability to do what \nothers thought could not be done. To so many of us who admired her and \nworked with her, she became the symbol of the saying in World War II, \n``the difficult we do immediately; the impossible takes a little \nlonger.''\n  We all owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Pat for her inspiring \nleadership and her dedication to bring about the day when everyone \neverywhere with HIV will be able to live a long and productive life \nwith dignity. Pat, thank you very, very much for all you have done so \nwell across the years, and for the enormous difference you have made in \nthe lives of so many persons in our own country and throughout the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10434-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10434-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10434-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10434-S10435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:21 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1537.

A bill to improve the Child Care Access Means Parents in \nSchool Program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with Senators \nSnowe, Kennedy, Collins, Murray, Durbin, Lautenberg, Clinton and \nJohnson to introduce legislation which would supply greatly needed \nsupport to\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\ncollege students struggling to balance their roles as parents with \ntheir roles as students. The Child Care Access Means Parents in School \nAct, CCAMPIS, would increase access to, support for, and retention of \nlow-income, nontraditional students who are struggling to complete \ncollege degrees while caring for their children.\n  The typical college student is no longer an 18 year old recent high \nschool graduate. According to a 2002 study by the National Center for \nEducation Statistics, only 27 percent of undergraduates meet the \n``traditional'' undergraduate criteria of earning a high school \ndiploma, enrolling full-time, depending on parents for financial \nsupport and not working or working part-time. This means that 73 \npercent of today's students are considered nontraditional in some way. \nClearly, nontraditional students--older students with children and \nvarious job and life experiences--are filling the ranks of college \nclasses. Why? Because they recognize the importance of college to \nfuture success. It is currently estimated that a full-time worker with \na bachelor's degree earns about 60 percent more than a full-time worker \nwith only a high school diploma. This amounts to a lifetime gap in \nearnings of more than $1 million.\n  Today's nontraditional students face barriers unheard of by \ntraditional college students of earlier years. Many are parents and \nmust provide for their children while in school. Access to affordable, \nquality and convenient child care is a necessity for these students. \nBut obtaining the child care that they need is often difficult because \nof their limited income and nontraditional schedules, compounded by \ndeclining assistance for child care through other supports. Campus \nbased child care can fill the gap. It is conveniently located, \navailable during the right hours, and of high quality and lower cost. \nUnfortunately, it is unavailable at many campuses. Even when programs \ndo exist, they are often available to only a fraction of the eligible \nstudents. That is where the Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act comes in.\n  The Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act increases and expands the availability of \ncampus based child care in three ways. First, it raises the minimum \ngrant amount from $10,000 to $30,000. For most institutions of higher \neducation, $10,000 has proven too small relative to the effort to \ncomplete a Federal application. Grant offices on campuses often pass \nsmall grants over in favor of those that appear more cost effective.\n  Second, the Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act ensures that a wider range of \nstudents are able to access services. Present language defines low-\nincome students as students eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant. \nThis language excludes graduate students, international students, and \nstudents who may be low-income but make slightly more than is allowed \nto qualify for Pell grants. CCAMPIS will open eligibility for these \nadditional populations.\n  Third, the CCAMPIS Act raises the program's current authorization \nlevel from $45 million to $75 million so that we not only expand \nexisting programs, we create new ones.\n  Research demonstrates that campus based child care is of high quality \nand that it increases the educational success of both parents and \nstudents. Furthermore, recipients of campus based child care assistance \nwho are on public assistance are more likely to never return to welfare \nand to obtain jobs paying good wages.\n  Currently, there are approximately 1,850 campus based child care \nprograms but over 4,000 colleges and universities eligible to \nparticipate in the CCAMPIS program. Currently, CCAMPIS funds only 343 \nprograms in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Meanwhile, the \nnumber of nontraditional students across America is increasing. As \nthese numbers increase, the need for campus based child care will be \nincreasingly unmet.\n  This is a modest measure that will make a major difference to \nstudents. It will offer them new hope for starting and staying in \nschool. I am hopeful that it can be considered and enacted as part of \nthe Higher Education Act. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto move this important measure forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to introduce the Child Care Access \nMeans Parents in School Act of 2004. Senator Dodd and I have worked \ntogether to ensure access to quality child care, and this bill \nrepresents the next step in our shared commitment to this important \nissue. This legislation provides grants to colleges in order to provide \nchild care for low-income students.\n  Countless college students have recently returned to college. At this \ntime, we should remind ourselves that many Americans face obstacles \nthat prevent them from participating in higher education. The absence \nof affordable and accessible child care is, unfortunately, one such \nobstacle.\n  For many parents with young children, the availability of on-campus \nchild care services is central to their ability to attend college. \nCampus-based child care is conveniently located, available at the hours \nthat fit students' schedules and often available at a lower cost than \ncommunity-based child care centers. Student parents rate access to \ncampus-based child care as an important factor affecting their college \nenrollment. Unfortunately, such services are often in very short \nsupply, particularly for low-income parents who may find the cost of \nexisting services prohibitive.\n  Higher education is becoming ever more crucial to getting a job in \ntoday's global job market. The majority of new jobs require education \nbeyond high school. Getting the skills necessary to meet the demands of \ntoday's marketplace simply requires higher and higher levels of \neducational achievement. For many low-income students who are parents, \nthe availability of campus-based child care is key to their ability to \nreceive a higher education and thus achieve the American dream. Student \nparents are more likely to remain in school, and to graduate sooner and \nat a higher rate if they have campus-based child care. Child care \nservices are particularly critical for older students who choose to go \nback to school to get their degree or to improve their skills through \nadvanced education. Children placed in campus-based child care also \nreap numerous benefits, given its high quality. In fact, children in \nhigh-quality child care exhibit higher earnings as adults, higher rates \nof secondary school graduation, lower rates of teen pregnancy, and a \nreduced need for special education or costly social services.\n  Research shows that programs such as the High/Scope Perry Preschool \nProgram in Ypsilanti, Michigan and the Chicago Child-Parent Centers \ndemonstrate overwhelmingly that quality child care is a wise investment \nand is cost efficient. According to analysis of these programs the \npublic saves $7 for every $1 invested in child care. These savings \ncounted only the benefits to the public at large--in reduced costs of \ncrime, welfare and remedial education\n\n[[Page S10439]]\n\nand in taxes paid when the preschoolers became adult workers--without \neven taking into account participants' increased earnings or the \nincreased contribution to economic growth those earnings represent.\n  The Child Care Access Means Parents in School Act of 2004 will amend \ntitle IV of the Higher Education Act to help provide campus-based child \ncare to low-income parents seeking a college degree. Under the bill, \nthe Secretary of Education will award 3-year grants to institutions of \nhigher education to support or help establish a campus-based child care \nprogram serving the needs of low-income student parents. The Secretary \nwill award $75 million in grants--equal to 1 percent of total Pell \ngrant funding--based on an application submitted by the institution, \nand the grant amount will be linked to the institution's Pell grant \nfunding level. This bill ensures that a wide range of low-income \nstudents are able to access child care services.\n  Under the bill low-income students are defined as students eligible \nto receive a Federal Pell Grant, or students who would be eligible to \nreceive a Pell grant if they were not in the United States temporarily, \nand students who are from a family with an income that is less than 275 \npercent of the poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and \nBudget). Students typically qualify for Pell grants if their income is \nunder $30,000 per year and in Maine, this means approximately 17,000 \nstudents could have access to high quality child care services while \nthey earn their college degree. This bill will make a true difference \nin the lives of many low-income students who need child care to attend \nschool.\n  This bill raises the minimum CCAMPIS grant to $30,000 and authorizes \n$75 million as research has found that the existing minimum grant of \n$10,000 is often too small relative to the effort for many institutions \nto complete a federal application. We have found that grant offices on \ncampuses often pass small grants over in favor of those that are most \ncost effective.\n  Because the bill we are introducing today will help bring the \nAmerican dream within the reach of American parents who need child care \nin order to attend college, I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation which will truly make a difference in the lives \nof many American parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 2888. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nestablish a scholarship program to encourage and support students who \nhave contributed substantial public services; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senators \nEdwards, Levin and Kennedy, the Youth Service Scholarship Act. This Act \nwould authorize the Secretary of Education to award college \nscholarships of up to $5,000 a year to high school students and \nundergraduates who perform community service.\n  A recent study titled Community Service and Service Learning in U.S. \nPublic Schools reveals that 66 percent of public schools involve \nstudents in community service. This means that approximately 54,000 \npublic schools in America currently engage about 13.7 million students \nin community service each year. Other studies have shown that nearly 84 \npercent of high school students participate in volunteer activities \neither in or out of school, and two-thirds of college students have \nrecently participated in volunteer activities.\n  The Youth Service Scholarship Act is dedicated to assist low-income \nstudents who dedicate a significant portion of their time to volunteer \nservice with money for college. This Act would authorize the Secretary \nof Education to award college scholarships of up to $5,000 to high \nschool students who perform over 600 hours of community service in two \nyears. In order to be considered, high school applicants must maintain \na 2.0 grade point average, submit character recommendations, and write \nan essay on the nature of their community service. Additional money is \navailable if the student continues to participate in a significant \namount of community service once they are in college.\n  Volunteerism not only brings support and services to communities in \nneed, it provides significant benefits to the students who participate. \nResearch has shown that students who volunteer are 50 percent less \nlikely to use drugs and alcohol, or engage in destructive behavior. \nAdditionally, students who volunteer are more likely to receive good \ngrades, be philanthropic, graduate, and be interested in going to \ncollege.\n  In the 21st Century, higher education is not a luxury, it is a \nnecessity. For many of our low-income youth, finding money to pay for \ncollege is an obstacle to enrollment. This scholarship program provides \naid to motivated and inspirational youth.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Youth Service \nScholarship Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Service Scholarship \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n         Congress finds that--\n       (1) young people under 18 years of age are now our Nation's \n     most impoverished age group, with 1 of every 5 living in \n     poverty, a higher proportion than in 1968, and the percentage \n     of minority children living in poverty is about twice as \n     high;\n       (2) more than 1 of 4 families is headed by a single parent \n     and the percentage of such families has risen steadily over \n     the past few decades, rising 13 percent since 1990;\n       (3) there is a need to engage youth as active participants \n     in decisionmaking that affects their lives, including in the \n     design, development, implementation, and evaluation of youth \n     development programs at the Federal, State, and community \n     levels;\n       (4) existing outcome driven youth development strategies, \n     pioneered by community-based organizations, hold real promise \n     for promoting positive behaviors and preventing youth \n     problems;\n       (5) formal evaluations of youth development programs have \n     documented significant reductions in drug and alcohol use, \n     school misbehavior, aggressive behavior, violence, truancy, \n     high-risk sexual behavior, and smoking;\n       (6) compared to youth in the United States generally, youth \n     participating in community-based organizations are more than \n     26 percent more likely to report having received recognition \n     for good grades than youth in the United States generally and \n     nearly 20 percent more likely to rate the likelihood of their \n     going to college as very high; and\n       (7) the availability and use of Federal resources can be an \n     effective incentive to leverage broader community support to \n     enable local programs, activities, and services to provide \n     the full array of developmental core resources, remove \n     barriers to access, promote program effectiveness, and \n     facilitate coordination and collaboration within the \n     community.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n       Subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a-11 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating section 407E as section 406E; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n                 ``Chapter 4--Public Service Incentives\n\n     ``SEC. 407A.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nand extend certain programs to provide coordinated services and \nresearch with respect to children and families with HIV/AIDS; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children and \nFamily HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of 2004. This bipartisan \nlegislation will address the special needs of children and youth with \nHIV/AIDS--needs that are too often overlooked, both domestically and \ninternationally. This legislation recognizes the simple fact that when \nit comes to HIV prevention, research, care, and treatment, children and \nyouth are not just small adults. To give them a chance for a healthy \nfuture, we must ensure that their unique needs are met.\n  I want to begin by thanking my good friend Senator Bond of Missouri \nfor joining me in introducing this important legislation. Senator Bond \nhas provided crucial support for children and for children's health. \nOver the years, he has been a leader in the fight to protect children \nfrom birth defects and developmental disabilities. He has also done a \ngreat deal to ensure that our nation's children's hospitals and \ncommunity health centers have the resources they need to continue to \nprovide essential care to children and families. I am very pleased to \nwork with him to move this legislation forward.\n  Children's growing bodies are especially susceptible to the rapid \nadvancement of HIV infection. Because their immune systems are still \nimmature, the disease typically progresses more rapidly and differently \nin children than in adults. For example, children with HIV infection \nare more prone to neurological abnormalities and certain opportunistic \ninfections than adults. In addition, because children's bodies are \ngrowing and developing, HIV/AIDS can have profound effects on \nchildren's physical growth and ability to reach developmental \nmilestones such as crawling, walking and learning to talk.\n  While research has definitively shown that initiating drug treatment \nin children in a timely manner promotes normal growth and development, \nand prolongs life, treating children with HIV/AIDS presents particular \nchallenges. Appropriately formulated and dosed HIV/AIDS drugs are \nurgently needed to ensure that children receive optimal care. \nCurrently, liquid formulations that young children can swallow are not \nalways readily available. In addition, pediatric dosing and safety \ninformation for these powerful drugs is often lacking, particularly for \nyounger children. This lack of information puts children at risk; too \nmuch medication can be toxic and too little will not effectively \nsuppress the virus. Over time, under-dosing can lead to drug \nresistance, a particularly serious concern for children who will need \nto use these medications for years, if not decades.\n  Appropriate HIV/AIDS care and treatment for children and youth also \nrequires that special attention be paid to their social development \nneeds. Children and youth have unique concerns regarding disclosure and \nstigma that may be exacerbated by frequent absences from school and \nsocial activities, and the onset of sexual maturity. Working with \nschools and other social and community institutions is imperative to \npromoting a sense of normalcy. Because children are not typically \nmedical decision-makers, developing long-term care partnerships with \nparents and other caregivers is also crucial to successful care and \ntreatment. At the same time, maximizing each child's own ability to \ntake active participation in different aspects of his or her own care \ncan increase a child's sense of ownership over treatment, improving \nadherence and overall health.\n\n  By reauthorizing and expanding Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act \nthis legislation will help to ensure that the unique care and treatment \nneeds of children are addressed. This program is a lifeline for more \nthan 53,000 women, children, and youth affected by HIV/AIDS served \nannually by Title IV-funded projects. Through 91 grants in 35 states, \nthe District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Title IV \nprojects provide medical care, case management, support services, \nmental health, transportation, child care, and other crucial services \nto families affected by HIV/AIDS. Title IV is the smallest of the four \nmain titles of the Ryan White CARE Act, yet reaches the highest \nproportion of minorities.\n  Key to the success of Title IV projects is the model of ``family-\ncentered care.'' This model of care treats the whole family as the \nclient, whether several family members are infected by HIV, or just a \nparent or child. The family-centered care model is crucial to \ndeveloping strong partnerships between consumers and providers, leading \nto better health outcomes for women,\n\n[[Page S10441]]\n\nchildren, and youth. By allowing affected family members to receive \nservices, as well as the infected individuals, Title IV projects \npromote health at the family level, thereby prolonging life, improving \nquality of life, and saving money by keeping people out of the \nhospital.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the work done by the \nChildren, Youth and Family AIDS Network of Connecticut, which provides \nTitle IV services to more than 500 children, youth, women, and families \naffected by HIV/AIDS in my home state. I have heard from many of these \nindividuals about just how important these services are to their \nquality of life.\n  While recommitting the Health Resources and Services Administration \n(HRSA) to family-centered care and the unique work of Title IV, this \nlegislation will also expand the innovative strategies Title IV \nprojects have used to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. Since \n1994, when the administration of preventive drug interventions was \nshown to significantly reduce perinatal HIV transmission, the number of \nnewborns infected with HIV has decreased dramatically. Yet mother-to-\nchildren transmission does continue to occur, largely due to missed \nopportunities for identifying HIV-positive pregnant women and providing \nthe supportive services needed to ensure adherence to recommended \ntreatment regimens. We propose to fund demonstration grants to assess \nthe effectiveness of two strategies in reducing mother-to-children \ntransmission: (1) Increasing routine, voluntary HIV testing of pregnant \nwomen and (2) increasing access to prenatal care, intensive case \nmanagement, and supportive services for HIV-positive pregnant women.\n  In addition, this bill will encourage research into key care and \ntreatment questions affecting the pediatric populations. These include: \nthe long-term health effects of preventive drug regimens on HIV-exposed \nchildren; the long-term health, psycho-social, and prevention needs for \nchildren and adolescents perinatally HIV-infected; the transition to \nadulthood for HIV-infected children; and safer and more effective \ntreatment options for infants, children, and adolescents with HIV \ndisease.\n  Since history suggests that a vaccine may prove to be the most \neffective, affordable, long-term approach to stopping the spread of \nHIV, this legislation will also ensure that children are not an \nafterthought when it comes to the development of an HIV vaccine. \nCurrently, some of the populations hardest hit by the pandemic--infants \nand youth--are at risk of being left behind in the search for an \neffective vaccine. Because we cannot assume that a vaccine tested in \nadults will also be safe and effective when used in pediatric \npopulations, it will be important to ensure that promising vaccines are \ntested in infants and youth as early as is medically and ethically \nappropriate. Failure to begin planning for the inclusion of these \ngroups in clinical trials could mean significant delays in the \navailability of a pediatric HIV vaccine, at the cost of countless \nthousands of lives. This legislation will ensure that we begin now to \naddress the logistical, regulatory, medical, and ethical issues \npresented by pediatric testing of HIV vaccines so that children can \nshare in the benefits of any advances in vaccines research.\n  I want to thank several organizations for lending their expertise to \nthe development of this legislation, in particular the Elizabeth Glaser \nPediatric AIDS Foundation, the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and \nFamilies, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, all of whom support \nthis bill. I would also like to note that the AMS Vaccine Advocacy \nCoalition is endorsing this legislation. I would ask unanimous consent \nthat three letters of endorsement be printed in the Record.\n  HIV/AIDS is the single greatest health care catastrophe facing the \nworld today. We need to do much more to seek effective treatments and, \neventually, a cure for this horrible illness. This legislation is by no \nmeans sufficient to reach that goal, but it is a step towards ensuring \nthat children are not left behind as we make progress, and then when we \ndo finally eradicate HIV/AIDS once and for all, children and youth are \nable to benefit immediately. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       AIDS Alliance for Children,\n\n\n                                           Youth and Families,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2004.\n     Senator Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Subcommittee on Children and Families,\n     Senator Christopher S. Bond,\n     Subcommittee on Aging,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Bond:\n       As the national non-profit organization dedicated to women, \n     children, youth and families affected by HIV/AIDS, we would \n     like to extend our sincere gratitude for you introduction of \n     the Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of \n     2004. We greatly appreciate your leadership on this issue.\n       The Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act \n     provides many important services to some of the most \n     vulnerable populations of HIV-positive people: women, \n     children, infants, youth and male caregivers. This bill \n     reauthorizes Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act, strengthens \n     the model of family-centered care, reinforces other \n     provisions in the CARE Act serving these groups, expands \n     efforts to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT), \n     and ensures that biomedical research efforts in the fight \n     against HIV--especially the search for a preventive vaccine--\n     take into consideration the special needs of pediatric \n     populations.\n       Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act is a lifeline to more \n     than 53,000 women, children, youth, infants and male \n     caregivers served each year. Through grants to 91 \n     organizations across 35 states, the District of Columbia, \n     Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, grantees and \n     hundreds of subgrantees provide medical care, support \n     services, case management, outreach and other services to \n     thousands of families affected by HIV/AIDS. Title IV saves \n     lives by providing treatment and care, improves quality of \n     life by keeping people healthier, and saves money by reducing \n     hospitalization. Title IV projects have also led the way in \n     reducing MTCT from more than 2,000 babies born HIS-positive \n     each year to fewer than 300. It is essential this program be \n     reauthorized and expanded, and we appreciate your support.\n       In addition, biomedical research on a potential HIV vaccine \n     and other research into antiretroviral treatment, \n     psychosocial and prevention needs, and transitioning from \n     pediatric into adult health care settings are all complicated \n     research issues that must pay special attention to the needs \n     of children. Children and youth are not merely ``mini-\n     adults'' for whom the same treatment, care and prevention \n     regimens apply. In terms of both physiological and \n     psychosocial development, children and adolescents have \n     different needs than adults, and research efforts must be \n     attuned to these concerns. This bill would address those \n     issues by developing a pediatric HIV vaccination testing plan \n     and expand other research efforts relevant to infants, \n     children, and youth affected by HIV/AIDS.\n       We fully endorse this legislation, and again thank you for \n     your efforts to introduce and support it. We look forward to \n     working with our offices to promote this bill and see its \n     provisions enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ivy Turnbull,\n       President.\n     David C. Harvey,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric\n\n\n                                              AIDS Foundation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and Bond:\n       On behalf of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \n     Foundation, I would like to commend your leadership in \n     introducing the Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and \n     Care Act of 2004. We applaud your attention to the needs of \n     children with HIV/AIDS and offer our strong endorsement of \n     this bipartisan legislation.\n       The Foundation was created more than 15 years ago to help \n     children with HIV/AIDS and is now the worldwide leader in the \n     fight against pediatric AIDS and other serious and life-\n     threatening diseases affecting children. While we have made \n     great strides in caring for children with HIV/AIDS since the \n     early days of the pandemic, it is an unfortunate fact that \n     their unique needs are still too often overlooked. As we have \n     learned firsthand, children with HIV/AIDS are not small \n     adults. To give them the best possible chance for a healthy \n     future, it is essential that their specific prevention, care \n     and treatment needs are met.\n       The Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of \n     2004 will address those needs by reauthorizing Title IV of \n     the Ryan White CARE Act and expanding its focus on reaching \n     and caring for adolescents with HIV/AIDS. To further reduce \n     mother-to-child transmission of HIV, this legislation will \n     also promote routine, voluntary prenatal HIV testing and \n     intensive care management for HIV-positive pregnant women. In \n     addition, because children are at risk of being left behind \n     in the search for an effective HIV vaccine, the bill will \n     require federal agencies funding and regulating HIV vaccine\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\n     research to develop plans and guidelines for including \n     pediatric populations in clinical trials as quickly as is \n     medically and ethically appropriate. This legislation will \n     also encourage research on key remaining pediatric research \n     questions, including how to provide safer and more effective \n     treatment options for children with HIV/AIDS.\n       Thank you again for your commitment to ensuring that the \n     unique prevention, care and treatment needs of children with \n     HIV/AIDS are met. We appreciate the opportunity to join you \n     in helping children to reap the benefits of the very best \n     that science and medicine have to offer and look forward to \n     working with you toward passage of this critical legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Mark Isaac,\n\n                                     Vice President, Public Policy\n     and Communication.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition,\n\n                                    New York, NY, October 5, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bond and Dodd: On behalf of the AIDS Vaccine \n     Advocacy Coalition, I would like to express our strong \n     support for the Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and \n     Care Act of 2004. We applaud your efforts to provide \n     coordinated services and research with respect to children \n     and families with HIV/AIDS.\n       Founded in 1995, AVAC is an internationally recognized non-\n     profit organization committed to accelerating the ethical \n     development and global delivery of vaccines against HIV/AIDS. \n     We are committed to a broad, sustainable response to manage \n     the long haul from basic science, to product development, \n     through multiple clinical trials and, eventually and most \n     importantly, to a safe, efficacious, accessible and \n     affordable vaccine in use for the people and communities that \n     need it most.\n       Unless issues surrounding the testing of vaccine candidates \n     in relevant pediatric populations are addressed now, they \n     likely won't have timely access to an effective vaccine when \n     one is developed and licensed. That would not only deny young \n     people of an important HIV prevention tool, but it would \n     severely hamper global efforts to stop the AIDS pandemic.\n       We, therefore, strongly endorse your effort to enact \n     legislation that prioritizes this critical research issue and \n     calls for a plan of action to move forward. We appreciate the \n     opportunity to join you now to ensure that the research and \n     development process delivers treatment and prevention to the \n     populations that need it most and look forward to working \n     with you toward passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mitchell Warren,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, currently, more than 3,700 children and \nyouth under the age of 13 are living with HIV or AIDS in the United \nStates and of the more than 40,000 Americans newly infected with HIV \neach year, half are young people under the age of 25 years old. When we \nthink about this devastating virus we do not often associate it with \nchildren, especially infants or newborn babies, but the fact is this \ndisease does not discriminate on the basis of age. It affects children \nin very specific and very different ways than adults.\n  For instance, the medical experience of children with HIV/AIDS can \ndiffer significantly from that of adults. Because children's immune \nsystems are still immature, the disease typically progresses more \nrapidly in children than in adults and can have different \nmanifestations. For example, the majorities of children with HIV have \nneurological abnormalities and are more susceptible to certain \nopportunistic infections than adults. In addition, because children's \nbodies are growing and developing, HIV/AIDS can have profound effects \non children's physical growth and ability to reach developmental \nmilestones such as crawling, walking and learning to walk.\n  Medication for young children living with HIV/AIDS can also be very \ndifferent than that of an adult living with HIV/AIDS. For example, \nchildren of certain ages cannot swallow pills and require liquid \nformulations of life-saving HIV/AIDS drugs that are not always readily \navailable. In addition, dosing and safety information for these \npowerful drugs are often strikingly different for children and adults, \nand for younger children, this information is typically completely \nmissing. This lack of information puts children at risk by requiring \nhealth care providers to estimate correct dosing. Too much medication \ncan be toxic, and too little will not effectively suppress the virus. \nOver time, under-dosing can lead to drug resistance.\n  Children are not just small adults and their growing bodies are \nespecially susceptible to the rapid advancement of HIV infection. Early \nawareness that a child has HIV infection, combined with good care and \nsupport, can enhance survival and quality of life, which is why I am \nintroducing, with my colleague Senator Dodd, The Children Family HIV/\nAIDS Research and Care Act of 2004. This legislation will address those \nneeds of children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS by reauthorizing \nTitle IV of the Ryan White CARE Act and expanding its focus on reaching \nand caring for adolescents with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, this legislation \nwill continue to work to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, by \npromoting routine, voluntary prenatal HIV testing and intensive care \nmanagement for HIV-positive pregnant women. In addition, because \nchildren are at risk of being left behind in the search for an \neffective HIV vaccine, the bill will require federal agencies funding \nand regulating HIV vaccine research to develop plans and guidelines for \nincluding pediatric populations in clinical trials as quickly as is \nmedically and ethically appropriate. This legislation will also \nencourage research on key remaining pediatric research questions, \nincluding how to provide safer and more effective treatment options for \nchildren with HIV/AIDS.\n  For a young person living with HIV or AIDS there is no cure and there \nis no remission. It is with them at home, on the playground, in the \nclassroom, and at a Friday night sleepover. It will be with them as \nthey enter high school, go to college and get their first job. For a \nperson born with this virus it is a permanent part of their life. This \nbill will help to ensure that the needs of infants, children, and \nadolescents living with HIV/AIDS are not overlooked.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2893. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a refundable credit against income tax for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe all Americans should have \naccess to affordable, high-quality health care. Rising health care \ncosts impose a burden on families and small businesses and put coverage \nout of reach for many Americans. According to the most recent Census \nBureau findings, 45 million Americans lack health insurance; about \n200,000 of the 45 million were Alaskans. The vast majority, nearly 80 \npercent, of uninsured Alaskans in 2003-2004 were employed or members of \nworking families.\n  As part of the effort to address this problem, I have introduced \nlegislation that will increase the number of insured Americans. The \nSAVE (Securing Access, Value, and Equality) Health Care Act offers a \nsolution to the problems of accessibility, portability, and choice.\n  My plan does not just increase funding for current government \nprograms; my plan provides a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, \nand more control over your own health care and your own future.\n  The SAVE Health Care Act would provide working class Americans with a \ntax credit that they can use to purchase health insurance. The act \ntargets three-quarters of the total number of uninsured Americans by \nsetting eligibility at 350 percent of poverty, or an Alaskan's annual \nincome of $41,000 for an individual or $82,000 for a family of four.\n  To help make health coverage more affordable for low and middle-\nincome individuals and families who do not have employer-provided \ncoverage and who are not eligible for the expanded public programs, \nthis legislation would provide a refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 \nfor individuals and up to $3,000 for families, which could be advanced \non a monthly basis.\n  The SAVE Act would also cover an additional 50 percent of any health \ninsurance premiums not covered by the basic credit. This provision is \ntargeted to help those who need health insurance the most--those who \nare sick, have pre-existing health conditions, or older Americans whose \ninsurance prices are higher and who do not have access to employer-\nbased insurance.\n  A tax credit proposal without this type of additional assistance \nwould only help insure the young and the healthy because their premiums \nare\n\n[[Page S10443]]\n\nthe lowest and most within reach financially. The additional credit is \na key part of providing coverage to Americans with the greatest need.\n  The SAVE Act would allow those who have access to employer-sponsored \nplans to have up to one-half of the credit they are eligible for to \nhelp them pay for their portion of the health insurance premiums. This \ncredit amount is a balance designed to help employees afford their \nportion of employer-sponsored coverage without providing employers an \nincentive to shift more costs to their employees.\n  The SAVE Act includes a provision that would make the premiums for \nqualified high-deductible health insurance plans that coordinate with \nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs) tax-deductible. Both individuals and \ntheir employers can contribute tax free dollars to an HSA, and the \nindividual can use these dollars for qualifying out-of-pocket medical \nexpenses.\n  The SAVE Act provides small business owners a refundable tax credit \nfor contributions they make to their employees' HSAs in the amount of \n$500 per worker with family coverage and $200 per worker with \nindividual coverage. More than half of the uninsured are small business \nemployees and their families.\n  In addition to reducing the number of our nation's uninsured, this \nlegislation will create an incentive for personal savings while shaping \na health care marketplace driven by consumer choice.\n  The SAVE Act would extend and expand the State high risk pool health \ninsurance grant program that was established under the Trade Adjustment \nAct of 2002. Alaska is one of 31 States that currently operates a high \nrisk pool. I commend the work of the Alaska Comprehensive Health \nInsurance Association (ACHIA), the nonprofit organization that provides \nhealth insurance to 467 Alaska residents who would otherwise be denied \ncoverage because of medical conditions. Under this legislation, Alaska \nwill receive a portion of the $75 million allocated in this legislation \nto continue to operate our high risk pool and to continue insuring \nAlaskans that really need this program.\n  The SAVE Act would establish a grant program in which States would be \nencouraged to establish Voluntary Choice Cooperatives, or VCCs. VCCs \nessentially increase the clout of small businesses in negotiating with \ninsurers. Premiums are generally higher for small businesses because \nthey do not have as much purchasing power as large companies. This \nlimits the ability of small businesses to bargain for lower rates. They \nalso have higher administrative costs because they have fewer employees \namong whom to spread the fixed cost of a health benefits plan. \nMoreover, VCCs decrease the risk of adverse selection and spread the \ncost of health care over a broader group.\n  I believe this well-rounded approach will provide significant help \nwith the cost and availability of health insurance, and make a real \ndifference in reducing the number of uninsured Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 2894. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe coordination of Federal Government policies and activities to \nprevent obesity in childhood, to provide for State childhood obesity \nprevention and control, and to establish grant programs to prevent \nchildhood obesity within homes, schools, and communities; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor to introduce the \n``Prevention of Childhood Obesity Act''. The goal of this legislation \nis to deal more effectively with the growing health epidemic of obesity \nnow faced by millions of children today. Currently, 9,000,000 children \nhave this chronic condition, and it's putting them at high risk for \ndiabetes, high blood pressure, and other preventable diseases. In \naddition, obese children frequently grow up to become obese adults, and \nthey impose at least 11 billion dollars in medical costs on the nation \neach year.\n  Childhood obesity is the direct result of too much food and too \nlittle physical activity. One of the results is the epidemic now \nplaguing the nation. Children watch over 40,000 food advertisements on \ntelevision a year--one food commercial every minute, urging them to eat \nlarge helpings of candy, snacks, fast foods and cereal high in sugar.\n  Young students have access to vending machines that now put high-fat \nor high-sugar snacks and beverages in them. Yet they have no \nopportunity for physical activity or instruction in physical education. \nThey live in neighborhoods with instant access to fast foods, but no \nsupermarket, no outdoor produce stand, or few fruits and vegetables. \nThese same neighborhoods also have no bike paths, sidewalks, tracks for \nwalking or running, and no parks or open spaces.\n  The result is millions of children without nutritious foods, a safe \nphysical environment, that allows them to be active, and healthy \ninformation. Today, only 2 percent of the nation's children meet \nDepartment of Agriculture standards for daily intake. Less than a third \nmeet the recommended guidelines for exercise, and millions have \ndeveloped obesity.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, regular physical \nactivity and healthy eating and a positive environment for such \nbehavior are essential factors in reducing the epidemic of obesity. Our \nlegislation focuses, therefore, on coordinating federal, state, \ncommunity and school efforts to see that our children have access to a \nhealthy environment.\n  This bill appoints a federal commission to see that Federal food \npolicies promote good nutrition. Guidelines for food and physical \nactivity advertisements will be established by a summit conference of \nrepresentatives from education, industry, and health care.\n  At the State level, the bill provides grants and coordinates efforts \nby the states to implement and evaluate ways to prevent obesity. It \noffers grants for early childhood activities and school and after-\nschool programs, and for developing curricular, training educators, and \nimplementing policies to reduce poor foods, increase physical \neducation, and help communities build sidewalks, bike trails, and \ncreate parks that encourage healthy activity and sports.\n  We know that regular physical activity and healthy eating can prevent \nchildhood obesity. We need a coordinated and focused nationwide effort \nto halt this health epidemic facing millions of children, and prevent \nthe chronic diseases and unnecessary suffering that afflict millions of \nchildren today. It's time for Congress to do its part, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 2898. A bill to require the review of Government programs at least \nonce every 5 years for purposes of evaluating their performance; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Program \nAssessment and Results Act, or ``PAR Act.'' This bill is a companion \nbill to H.R. 3826 that Congressman Todd Platts, Chairman of the House \nGovernment Reform Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and Financial \nManagement, introduced on February 25, 2004.\n  The PAR Act builds upon the reforms adopted by Congress in the early \n1990s, such as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n(GPRA). This bill would increase the effectiveness, and accountability \nof the Federal Government by requiring the review of Federal programs \nat least once every five years to evaluate their performance. \nInformation obtained from these reviews would be incorporated in the \nPresident's budget requests and would assist Congress in its oversight \nand funding of Federal programs.\n  The PAR Act would strengthen the program evaluation requirements \nunder the strategic planning requirements of GPRA, the one area that \nthe Government Accountability Office (GAO) recognized as a government-\nwide deficiency under GPRA. GAO found that most agencies were \nimplementing the requirement for program evaluation merely by making \nlists of observations rather than presenting and analyzing performance \ndata.\n  To build upon the framework of reforms established by GPRA, the PAR \nAct would require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to work \nwith Federral agencies to carefully and periodically assess the \nstrengths and\n\n[[Page S10444]]\n\nweaknesses of all Federal programs. This legislation would enable \npolicy makers to compare data from different agents to determine how \ndifferent programs with similar goals are achieving their results.\n  The PAR Act would improve the accountability of Federal programs in a \nnumber of areas. Congress would be able to use this information to make \nmore informed budget decisions and conduct more effective oversight. \nFederal managers would use the information to improve the way they \nmanage programs. Moreover, taxpayers will be able to track the progress \nof these programs with more precision.\n  The ultimate result of the PAR Act will be a more effective and \nefficient government. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2898\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Program Assessment and \n     Results Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) inefficiency and ineffectiveness in Federal programs \n     undermines the confidence of the American people in the \n     Government and reduces the Federal Government's ability to \n     adequately address vital public needs;\n       (2) insufficient information on program performance \n     seriously disadvantages Federal managers in their efforts to \n     improve program efficiency and effectiveness;\n       (3) congressional policy making, spending decisions, and \n     program oversight are handicapped by insufficient attention \n     to program performance and results;\n       (4) programs performing similar or duplicative functions \n     that exist within a single agency or across multiple agencies \n     should be identified and their performance and results shared \n     among all such programs to improve their performance and \n     results;\n       (5) advocates of good government continue to seek ways to \n     improve accountability, focus on results, and integrate the \n     performance of programs with decisions about budgets;\n       (6) with the passage of the Government Performance and \n     Results Act of 1993, the Congress directed the executive \n     branch to seek improvements in the effectiveness, efficiency, \n     and accountability of Federal programs by having agencies \n     focus on program results; and\n       (7) the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n     provided a strong framework for the executive branch to \n     monitor the long-term goals and annual performance of its \n     departments and agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to improve the Government Performance and Results Act \n     of 1993 by implementing a program assessment and evaluation \n     process that attempts to determine the strengths and \n     weaknesses of Federal programs with a particular focus on the \n     results produced by individual programs;\n       (2) to use the information gathered in the assessment and \n     evaluation process to build on the groundwork laid in the \n     Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to help the \n     executive branch make informed management decisions and \n     evidence-based funding requests aimed at achieving positive \n     results; and\n       (3) to provide congressional policy makers the information \n     needed to conduct more effective oversight, to make better-\n     informed authorization decisions, and to make more evidence-\n     based spending decisions that achieve positive results for \n     the American people.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROGRAM ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Program Assessments.--Chapter 11 of \n     title 31, United States Code, as amended by the Government \n     Performance and Results Act of 1993, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1120.

Res. 447\n\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, and \n     controversial figure in American history who challenged \n     racial biases;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 \n     to parents who were former slaves;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and \n     traveled throughout the United States fighting white as well \n     as black heavyweights;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson, after being denied, on purely racial \n     grounds, the opportunity to fight two white champions was \n     granted an opportunity in 1908 by an Australian promoter to \n     fight the reigning white title-holder, Tommy Burns, whom \n     Johnson defeated to become the first African American to hold \n     the title of Heavyweight Champion of the World;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson's victory prompted a search for a \n     white boxer who could beat Johnson, a recruitment effort \n     dubbed the search for the ``great white hope'';\n       Whereas, a white former champion named Jim Jeffries left \n     retirement to fight and lose to Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada, \n     in 1910 in what was deemed the ``Battle of the Century'';\n       Whereas, rioting and aggression toward African Americans \n     resulted from Johnson's defeat of Jeffries and led to \n     racially-motivated murders of African Americans nationwide;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson's relationship with white women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many whites;\n       Whereas, between 1901 and 1910, 754 African Americans were \n     lynched, some of whom were lynched simply for being ``too \n     familiar'' with white women;\n       Whereas, in 1910 the Congress passed the Mann Act, (18 \n     U.S.C. 2421), then known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act,'' \n     which outlawed the transportation of women in interstate or \n     foreign commerce ``for the purpose of prostitution or \n     debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose'';\n       Whereas, in October, 1912, Jack Johnson became involved \n     with a white woman whose mother disapproved of their \n     relationship and sought action from the United States \n     Department of Justice, claiming that Johnson had abducted her \n     daughter;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson was arrested on October 18, 1912, by \n     Federal marshals for transporting this woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act, only to have the charges dropped when the woman refused \n     to cooperate with authorities and then married the champion;\n       Whereas, Federal authorities persisted and summoned a white \n     woman named Belle Schreiber who testified that Johnson had \n     transported her across State lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery'';\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson was eventually convicted in 1913 of \n     violating the Mann Act and sentenced to one year and a day in \n     Federal prison, but fled the country to Canada and then on to \n     various European and South American countries, before losing \n     the Heavyweight Championship title to Jess Willard in Cuba in \n     1915;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson returned to the United States in \n     July, 1920, surrendered to authorities, served nearly a year \n     in the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, and \n     fought subsequent boxing matches, but never regained the \n     Heavyweight Championship title;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson served his country during World War \n     II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating \n     in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause;\n       Whereas, Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in \n     1946;

and\n       (4) the President of the United States should grant a \n     pardon to Jack Johnson posthumously to expunge from the \n     annals of American criminal justice a racially-motivated \n     abuse of the Federal government's prosecutorial authority and \n     in recognition of Mr. Johnson's athletic and cultural \n     contributions to society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 140--URGING THE PRESIDENT TO WITHDRAW THE \n UNITED STATES FROM THE 1992 AGREEMENT ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR CIVIL \n AIRCRAFT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IMMEDIATELY FILE A CONSULTATION \nREQUEST, UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING ON RULES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING THE \n SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, ON THE MATTER \nOF INJURY TO, AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ON, THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRY \n                          OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 140\n\n       Whereas as recently as 1990, Boeing was the uncontested \n     world leader in commercial aviation, and had produced over 55 \n     percent of all the jet commercial aircraft ever produced; \n     McDonnell Douglas produced 25 percent, while Airbus accounted \n     for only 6 percent;\n       Whereas in 1992 the Agreement on Government Support for \n     Civil Aircraft was negotiated between the United States and \n     the European Community to address the near total \n     subsidization of Airbus commercial aircraft development;\n       Whereas the agreement stated that no more than 33 percent \n     of total aircraft development costs could be borne by the \n     respective governments;\n       Whereas the agreement ``recogniz[ed] that the disciplines \n     in the GATT Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft should be \n     strengthened with a view to progressively reducing the role \n     of government support'';\n       Whereas Boeing has experienced a dramatic downturn in the \n     last three years, losing thousands of employees and a \n     significant market share;\n       Whereas Airbus has continued to increase market share at a \n     time of significant turbulence in the commercial airline \n     industry as a result of continued government subsidies;\n       Whereas the European Union has not abided by the agreement \n     to phase out subsidies;\n       Whereas European Union officials have publicly reaffirmed \n     their plan to achieve global leadership in aerospace based on \n     continued subsidization, noting in ``European Aeronautics: A \n     Vision for 2020'', that ``gradual realization of our \n     ambitious vision must be facilitated by an increase in public \n     funding. European aeronautics has grown and prospered with \n     the support of public funds and this support must continue if \n     we are to achieve our objective of global leadership.'';\n       Whereas the new Airbus A380 is the most subsidized aircraft \n     ever, having received more than $6,000,000,000 in direct \n     subsidies from the European Union, including $3,700,000,000 \n     in launch aid;\n       Whereas in public statements, Airbus representatives have \n     indicated that the company may launch yet another new \n     aircraft, which may require billions of dollars of additional \n     subsidies from the European Union;\n       Whereas Airbus has achieved market parity with Boeing; \n     therefore the 1992 agreement has outlived its usefulness;\n       Whereas the parties to the 1992 agreement noted ``their \n     intention to act without prejudice to their rights and \n     obligations under the GATT and under other multilateral \n     agreements negotiated under the auspices of the GATT'';\n       Whereas on a visit to Washington State on August 13, 2004, \n     President George W. Bush said ``I've instructed U.S. Trade \n     Representative Bob Zoellick to inform European officials in \n     his September meeting that we think these subsidies are \n     unfair and that he should pursue all options to end these \n     subsidies--including bringing a WTO case, if need be'';\n       Whereas the Boeing Company has more than 150,000 employees \n     within the United States and has 26,000 suppliers in all 50 \n     States;\n       Whereas the United States Trade Representative has strongly \n     supported Boeing's efforts to seek redress in this matter and \n     has patiently and appropriately pursued bilateral dialogue \n     with the European Union in an attempt to negotiate a new \n     agreement to discipline subsidies; and\n       Whereas public statements by the United States Trade \n     Representative have made it clear that bilateral \n     consultations on the matter of ending commercial aviation \n     subsidies by the European Union have been unproductive and \n     that further talk is unlikely to resolve the serious injury \n     caused to the Boeing company: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S10446]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should direct the United States Trade \n     Representative to withdraw the United States from the \n     Agreement on Government Support for Civil Aircraft that was \n     entered into with the European Community in 1992; and\n       (2) the President should direct the United States Trade \n     Representative immediately to file a consultation request, \n     under the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the \n     Settlement of Disputes of the World Trade Organization, on \n     the matter of serious injury to the commercial aviation \n     industry of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10446-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3957.

INFORMATION SHARING.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Advisory board.--The term ``Advisory Board'' means the \n     Advisory Board on Information Sharing established under \n     subsection (i).\n       (2) Executive council.--The term ``Executive Council'' \n     means the Executive Council on Information Sharing \n     established under subsection (h).\n       (3) Homeland security information.--The term ``homeland \n     security information'' means all information, whether \n     collected, produced, or distributed by intelligence, law \n     enforcement, military, homeland security, or other activities \n     relating to--\n       (A) the existence, organization, capabilities, plans, \n     intentions, vulnerabilities,\n\n[[Page S10452]]\n\n     means of finance or material support, or activities of \n     foreign or international terrorist groups or individuals, or \n     of domestic groups or individuals involved in transnational \n     terrorism;\n       (B) threats posed by such groups or individuals to the \n     United States, United States persons, or United States \n     interests, or to those of other nations;\n       (C) communications of or by such groups or individuals; or\n       (D) groups or individuals reasonably believed to be \n     assisting or associated with such groups or individuals.\n       (4) Network.--The term ``Network'' means the Information \n     Sharing Network described under subsection (c).\n       (b) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The effective use of information, from all available \n     sources, is essential to the fight against terror and the \n     protection of our homeland. The biggest impediment to all-\n     source analysis, and to a greater likelihood of ``connecting \n     the dots'', is resistance to sharing information.\n       (2) The United States Government has access to a vast \n     amount of information, including not only traditional \n     intelligence but also other government databases, such as \n     those containing customs or immigration information. However, \n     the United States Government has a weak system for processing \n     and using the information it has.\n       (3) In the period preceding September 11, 2001, there were \n     instances of potentially helpful information that was \n     available but that no person knew to ask for; information \n     that was distributed only in compartmented channels, and \n     information that was requested but could not be shared.\n       (4) Current security requirements nurture over-\n     classification and excessive compartmentalization of \n     information among agencies. Each agency's incentive structure \n     opposes sharing, with risks, including criminal, civil, and \n     administrative sanctions, but few rewards for sharing \n     information.\n       (5) The current system, in which each intelligence agency \n     has its own security practices, requires a demonstrated \n     ``need to know'' before sharing. This approach assumes that \n     it is possible to know, in advance, who will need to use the \n     information. An outgrowth of the cold war, such a system \n     implicitly assumes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure \n     outweighs the benefits of wider sharing. Such assumptions are \n     no longer appropriate. Although counterintelligence concerns \n     are still real, the costs of not sharing information are also \n     substantial. The current ``need-to-know'' culture of \n     information protection needs to be replaced with a ``need-to-\n     share'' culture of integration.\n       (6) A new approach to the sharing of intelligence and \n     homeland security information is urgently needed. An \n     important conceptual model for a new ``trusted information \n     network'' is the Systemwide Homeland Analysis and Resource \n     Exchange (SHARE) Network proposed by a task force of leading \n     professionals assembled by the Markle Foundation and \n     described in reports issued in October 2002 and December \n     2003.\n       (7) No single agency can create a meaningful information \n     sharing system on its own. Alone, each agency can only \n     modernize stovepipes, not replace them. Presidential \n     leadership is required to bring about governmentwide change.\n       (c) Information Sharing Network.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The President shall establish a trusted \n     information network and secure information sharing \n     environment to promote sharing of intelligence and homeland \n     security information in a manner consistent with national \n     security and the protection of privacy and civil liberties, \n     and based on clearly defined and consistently applied \n     policies and procedures, and valid investigative, analytical \n     or operational requirements.\n       (2) Attributes.--The Network shall promote coordination, \n     communication and collaboration of people and information \n     among all relevant Federal departments and agencies, State, \n     tribal, and local authorities, and relevant private sector \n     entities, including owners and operators of critical \n     infrastructure, by using policy guidelines and technologies \n     that support--\n       (A) a decentralized, distributed, and coordinated \n     environment that connects existing systems where appropriate \n     and allows users to share information among agencies, between \n     levels of government, and, as appropriate, with the private \n     sector;\n       (B) the sharing of information in a form and manner that \n     facilitates its use in analysis, investigations and \n     operations;\n       (C) building upon existing systems capabilities currently \n     in use across the Government;\n       (D) utilizing industry best practices, including minimizing \n     the centralization of data and seeking to use common tools \n     and capabilities whenever possible;\n       (E) employing an information access management approach \n     that controls access to data rather than to just networks;\n       (F) facilitating the sharing of information at and across \n     all levels of security by using policy guidelines and \n     technologies that support writing information that can be \n     broadly shared;\n       (G) providing directory services for locating people and \n     information;\n       (H) incorporating protections for individuals' privacy and \n     civil liberties;\n       (I) incorporating strong mechanisms for information \n     security and privacy and civil liberties guideline \n     enforcement in order to enhance accountability and facilitate \n     oversight, including--\n       (i) multifactor authentication and access control;\n       (ii) strong encryption and data protection;\n       (iii) immutable audit capabilities;\n       (iv) automated policy enforcement;\n       (v) perpetual, automated screening for abuses of network \n     and intrusions; and\n       (vi) uniform classification and handling procedures;\n       (J) compliance with requirements of applicable law and \n     guidance with regard to the planning, design, acquisition, \n     operation, and management of information systems; and\n       (K) permitting continuous system upgrades to benefit from \n     advances in technology while preserving the integrity of \n     stored data.\n       (d) Immediate Actions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office \n     of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Executive \n     Council, shall--\n       (1) submit to the President and to Congress a description \n     of the technological, legal, and policy issues presented by \n     the creation of the Network described in subsection (c), and \n     the way in which these issues will be addressed;\n       (2) establish electronic directory services to assist in \n     locating in the Federal Government intelligence and homeland \n     security information and people with relevant knowledge about \n     intelligence and homeland security information; and\n       (3) conduct a review of relevant current Federal agency \n     capabilities, including--\n       (A) a baseline inventory of current Federal systems that \n     contain intelligence or homeland security information;\n       (B) the money currently spent to maintain those systems; \n     and\n       (C) identification of other information that should be \n     included in the Network.\n       (e) Guidelines and Requirements.--As soon as possible, but \n     in no event later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall--\n       (1) in consultation with the Executive Council--\n       (A) issue guidelines for acquiring, accessing, sharing, and \n     using information, including guidelines to ensure that \n     information is provided in its most shareable form, such as \n     by separating out data from the sources and methods by which \n     that data are obtained; and\n       (B) on classification policy and handling procedures across \n     Federal agencies, including commonly accepted processing and \n     access controls;\n       (2) in consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board established under section 211, issue \n     guidelines that--\n       (A) protect privacy and civil liberties in the development \n     and use of the Network; and\n       (B) shall be made public, unless, and only to the extent \n     that, nondisclosure is clearly necessary to protect national \n     security; and\n       (3) require the heads of Federal departments and agencies \n     to promote a culture of information sharing by--\n       (A) reducing disincentives to information sharing, \n     including overclassification of information and unnecessary \n     requirements for originator approval; and\n       (B) providing affirmative incentives for information \n     sharing, such as the incorporation of information sharing \n     performance measures into agency and managerial evaluations, \n     and employee awards for promoting innovative information \n     sharing practices.\n       (f) Enterprise Architecture and Implementation Plan.--Not \n     later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Director of Management and Budget shall submit to \n     the President and to Congress an enterprise architecture and \n     implementation plan for the Network.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 705, S. 2483.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2483) to increase, effective as of December 1, \n     2004, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-\n     connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and \n     indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled \n     veterans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on legislation which was reported, after a unanimous \naffirmative vote, by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs on July 20, \n2004, and which is the subject of my request today that the bill be \nunanimously approved by the Senate. S. 2483 would grant to nearly 3 \nmillion beneficiaries who receive certain ``cash-transfer'' payments \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, a cost-of-living \nadjustment, COLA, increase in their benefits effective with checks \nreceived on or after January 1, 2005, and thereafter.\n  An annual cost-of-living adjustment in veterans benefits is an \nimportant tool which protects veterans' cash-\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\ntransfer benefits against the corrosive effects of inflation. The \nprincipal programs affected by the adjustment that would be made by S. \n2483 would be compensation paid to disabled veterans, and dependency \nand indemnity compensation, so-called ``DIC,'' payments made to the \nsurviving spouses, minor children and other dependents of service \nmembers who died in service and to the survivors of former service \nmembers who died after service as a result of service-connected \ninjuries or disease.\n  The impact of the COLA which would be enacted here is outlined in \ndetail in Report 108-351 which accompanied the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs approval of the bill on July 20, 2004. In summary, this \nlegislation would grant to VA compensation and DIC beneficiaries the \nsame percentage increase in benefits that will be granted to recipients \nof Social Security benefits in 2005--that is, an increase equal to the \npercentage increase in the consumer price index, CPI, for fiscal year \n2004 as measured and reported by the Department of Labor's Bureau of \nLabor Statistics later this year. The President's proposed budget for \nfiscal year 2005 requested such an increase, then estimated to be 1.3 \npercent, and the Senate has already concurred with the committee's \njudgment that such an increase is appropriate with its approval earlier \nthis year of a budget resolution which assumes that such an increase \nwill be enacted and which sets aside the funds necessary to finance the \nCOLA increase envisioned by this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support enactment of this vital legislation \nand that they ``clear'' the bill for passage today. The bill still must \nclear the House of Representatives before it is presented to the \nPresident. As my colleagues fully understand, the days remaining for \nthe House to take this action are dwindling.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, as ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge my colleagues to continue to \nsupport our veterans and their families by passing H.R. 4175, the \nproposed Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2004.\n  The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act would \nincrease the rate of disability compensation for veterans with service-\nconnected disabilities and the rate of dependency and indemnity \ncompensation for surviving spouses with minor children. This bill \nrequires, effective December 1, 2004, that the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs increase the rates of compensation by the same percentage \nprovided to Social Security recipients.\n  In keeping with the commitment to care for the brave men and women \nwho have served this great Nation, we must make every effort to \ncontinue to meet their needs. This legislation ensures that veterans \nand their families will be able to adjust their incomes to keep pace \nwith inflation and is vital to the financial stability of many veterans \nand their families who are struggling with the rising costs of goods \nand services. Our veterans and their families depend on the cost-of-\nliving increase for their livelihood, therefore, it is important that \nwe swiftly move this legislation.\n  We must demonstrate our commitment to those who have already paid a \ngreat price through their selfless service to our Nation. At a time \nwhen our airmen, soldiers, sailors, and marines are in harm's way, we \nmust remember the sacrifices that those before them have made on behalf \nof this grateful Nation by providing this cost-of-living adjustment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs then be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 4175 and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration; provided that all after enacting clause \nbe stricken and the text of S. 2483 be inserted in lieu thereof; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments to title 38, United States Code, made by \n     this Act shall take effect one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to ask for \nSenate approval of a manager's amendment to S. 2484, the proposed \n``Department of Veterans Affairs Personnel Enhancement Act of 2004,'' \nand to ask for Senate approval of the bill as so amended. This \namendment was developed in consultation with, and it has been approved \nby, the ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nSenator Bob Graham.\n  I introduced S. 2484 on June 1, 2004 at the request of the \nadministration. That bill, in the form I introduced it, and as it was \namended prior to its approval by the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs on July 20, 2004, is already explained in Senate Report 108-\n357. Accordingly, I will not detail provisions of the bill that are \nalready explained in the Committee Report. Rather, I will confine this \nexplanation to highlighting how the bill as now further amended--the \n``Manager's bill''--would modify the reported bill.\n  Section 3 of the reported bill makes changes in the system used by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs--VA--to compensate its physicians \nand dentists. The managers' bill contains many changes to this section. \nSome are primarily technical in nature and are designed to assure that \nthe language of the bill actually accomplishes its intended purpose. \nThese changes would, among other things, clarify how VA physicians' and \ndentists' retirement credits will be computed during the transition \nfrom the current to the new pay system; assure that statutory language \nrequiring comparability pay increases is consistent with language in \nother Federal pay system statutes; and specify that physicians and \ndentists who work in VA headquarters will also\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\nbe eligible for pay under the new pay system.\n  Other changes made to section 3 of the reported bill are more \nsubstantive. Almost entirely, they respond to comments that were made \non the reported bill by VA officials, by VA employee representatives, \nby physician and dentist professional organizations, and by the staffs \nof interested Senators, and by the staff of the House of \nRepresentatives' Committee on Veterans' Affairs. First, there are two \nchanges that would foster more public awareness of, and input on, \ndecisions made by VA that would affect the pay of physicians and \ndentists. One change would require that the VA Secretary publish in the \nFederal Register any updates in the national ``pay bands'' he or she \nmight establish under authority of this legislation; another would \nrequire VA's Under Secretary for Health to solicit the views of \nexclusive employee representatives and physicians' and dentists' \nprofessional organizations before making recommendations to the \nSecretary on ``pay band'' modifications or other regulatory changes.\n  Second, the Managers' bill would modify the reported bill's \nrequirement that VA consult local Medical Professional Standards \nBoards--PSBs--prior to making decisions concerning the pay of \nphysicians or dentists. It would only be required that an appropriate \npanel of physicians or dentists, as applicable, be consulted since not \nall VA facilities have an appropriate PSB in place. The managers' bill \nwould also excise references to the required size of the board.\n  Third, the Managers' bill would require VA to provide a physician or \ndentist written notice of decisions made by VA concerning his or her \n``market-based'' pay. Under the reported bill, such notification was \nonly required in the event a physician's or dentist's pay were to \nincrease.\n  Fourth, the Managers' bill would create an exception to the general \nrule contained in the reported bill that a physician's or dentist's pay \nmay not be reduced during his or her tenure with VA. The managers' \namendment would permit VA to change pay--and reduce pay--if a physician \nor dentist changes his or her assignment within a medical facility or \nmoves from one VA facility to another. For example, if VA were to hire \na cardiologist at the prevailing market salary for a practicing \ncardiologist, but that physician later becomes a VA primary care \nphysician, VA would be allowed to adjust his or her pay to the primary \ncare physician level. Similarly, if a physician is hired in Manhattan \nat a Manhattan salary and later transfers to the DesMoines VA Medical \nCenter, VA would be allowed to adjust his or her pay to DesMoines \nmarket rates. In cases where the move or change in assignment is \ninvoluntary due, for example, to disciplinary action, VA would be \nrequired to afford the employee an opportunity to appeal.\n  Fifth, the reported bill included a provision which would have \nallowed VA to award ``incentive pay'' of up to $10,000 to physicians or \ndentists in recognition of outstanding contributions to the facility, \nto the care of veterans, or to the practice of medicine or dentistry. \nIt was suggested that these standards were too general. In response, \nthe managers' bill specifies that such pay--renamed ``performance \npay''--would be awarded on the basis of the physician's or dentist's \nachievement of specific goals or objectives as revealed by the \nSecretary in advance. Additionally, the managers' bill would raise the \namount payable as ``performance pay'' to $15,000 annually or 7.5 \npercent of the sum of a physician's or dentist's base and market pay, \nwhichever is lower. Inasmuch as the achievement of ``performance pay'' \nobjectives are intended to be encouraged only by the ``positive \nreinforcement'' of a prospective bonus, the managers' bill would \nprohibit VA from taking disciplinary actions against physicians or \ndentists for failing to meet goals outlined under this program.\n\n  Finally, the managers' bill, at VA's request, would make all of the \nchanges to the VA physician and dentist compensation system effective \nthe first pay period following January 1, 2006.\n  Section 4 of the reported bill authorizes alternate work schedules \nfor VA nurses. The managers' bill makes a number of technical changes, \nand two substantive changes. On the technical side, the managers' bill, \nfor example, clarifies the full-time vs. part-time status of nurses \nworking alternate schedules and specifies a requirement that VA provide \nnotice to employees whose benefits might change under a new work \nschedule. Substantively, one modification would require that VA pay \novertime to nurses on a 36/40 schedule in three instances: when work \nover 12 hours in one day is performed; when more than 40 hours are \nworked in an administrative work week; and when more than 8 hours are \nworked on a day not originally scheduled for a 12-hour shift. Each of \nthese over-time scenarios is consistent with current practice; the \nchange is made purely to ensure maintenance of the status quo. A second \nsubstantive change would express the Sense of the Congress that VA \nshould prevent work hours by nurses in excess of 12 consecutive hours \nor over 60 hours in any seven-day period, and require VA to certify to \nCongress that each VA facility has policies in place designed to \nprevent nurses from working more than these tours of duty. The patient \nsafety-related reasons for these requirements are explained in Senate \nReport 108-357.\n  Section 5 of the reported bill would have provided a pay increase for \nthe Director of Nursing Services in VA's Central Office. Due to \ndisagreements concerning the implementation of this section of the \nbill, action on this proposed pay increase is deferred.\n  The substance of Section 6 of the reported bill is unchanged. It is \nmerely renumbered in light of the removal of section 5.\n  Section 7 of the reported bill would have clarified VA authority with \nrespect to certain personnel decisions. This provision, requested by VA \nas a purely technical ``clarification'' of existing law, was subject to \nmuch discussion and debate among VA officials, Committee staff, and \nemployee representatives. It was taken by employee representatives to \nbe a ``stealth attempt'' by VA to circumvent current collective \nbargaining agreements. The Committee does not ascribe such motives to \nVA, but it has withdrawn this provision from the managers' bill.\n  Section 8 of the reported bill specified that all provisions of the \nbill would have been effective one year following the date of \nenactment. Section 3 of the managers' bill changes the effective date \napplicable to that provision to the first pay period following January \n1, 2006. The other provisions of the managers' bill would now take \neffect upon enactment of the managers' bill.\n  This legislation is the product of almost unprecedented open \nnegotiation with very senior VA officials, unions representing \nGovernment employees, professional representatives of VA physicians and \ndentists, and other interested persons. This unprecedented ``sunshine'' \nhas resulted, I think, in an exceptional bill. But for the \nextraordinary efforts of VA, union, and professional organization \nofficials to resolve their differences in good faith, this improved \nmanagers' bill could not have emerged. They and the Congressional staff \nare to be complimented. But the efforts of one person--Mr. William T. \nCahill, the Veterans Affairs Committee's Health Policy Counsel--deserve \nto be singled out for recognition. But for his steadfast and determined \nefforts to push this project through numerous impasses that had impeded \nits development, we would not have gotten to this day.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to urge swift passage of S. \n2484, which reflects a compromise agreement on a new system for \ncompensating physicians and dentists in the Department of Veterans \nAffairs' VA health care system, as well as alternative work schedules \nfor VA nurses. VA doctors and dentists have not gotten a pay adjustment \nin over a decade. All of these measures are aimed at improving VA's \nability to recruit and retain quality health care professionals. I \nwould like to highlight some of the key aspects of this legislation.\n  The compromise agreement sets forth a three-tiered system for paying \nVA physicians and dentists. The three tiers consist of base, market, \nand performance pay. The base pay element is similar to that employed \nby other Federal agencies, also known as the General Schedule GS--\nsystem. As such, increases are guaranteed for every 2 years a physician \nor dentist remains employed by VA.\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\n  The second component of the new pay system is market pay. This \nelement will be implemented by the Secretary in the form of pay bands \nthat will be determined by surveys of regional salaries in the academic \nand private sectors. Also relevant to the market pay determinations are \nfactors such as the scarcity--or abundance--of certain specialty \nphysicians, type and years of experience, and board certifications. \nFinally, the Secretary will consult with professional review panels \ncomposed of other physicians or dentists.\n  The final component is performance pay. Performance pay will be \nawarded to doctors and dentists if they meet certain goals and measures \nset forth by the Secretary. Currently, VA has extensive performance \nmeasures that it utilizes to motivate its health care providers and \nensure quality of care. This element has a maximum of $15,000 or 7.5 \npercent of the sum of the base and market pay.\n  One other major section of this agreement establishes alternative \nwork schedules for VA nurses. It is widely known that the entire \ncountry is suffering from a nursing shortage. VA anticipates that it \nwill be hit especially hard by the retirement of a significant portion \nof its nursing workforce over the next 10 years. S. 2484 allows VA to \nemploy different types of working schedules in order to attract more \nnurses to the system.\n  I am proud to have worked on this valuable piece of legislation for \nour Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the substitute amendment at the \ndesk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the amendment to the title be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid on the table en bloc, and any statements be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (2973) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended was \nagreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The bill (S. 2484), as amended, was passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       ``An Act to amend title 38, United States Code, to simplify \n     and improve pay provisions for physicians and dentists and to \n     authorize alternate work schedules and executive pay for \n     nurses, and for other purposes.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10467-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

With \nthe cooperation of all of our colleagues, we will complete this bill \ntomorrow.\n  Following completion of that bill, we will proceed to our internal \nSenate oversight reforms, and look forward to hopefully addressing that \nlate tomorrow afternoon.\n  There are a number of other issues we laid out in the course of the \nday that are underway, including the FSC/ETI jobs manufacturing bill \nand the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. So we have a lot of work \nto do in a short period of time during the remainder of this week.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10467-5", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10467-S10468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ILLUMINATION OF THE GATEWAY ARCH IN ST. LOUIS\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of legislation \nwhich I have sponsored along with Senator Bond that would authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to illuminate the gateway arch with pink \nlighting in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I want to say how \nmuch I appreciate the cooperation from both sides of the aisle on this \nimportant measure so that we can get it done and passed in time to \nhonor those who have struggled against this disease during that month \nwhich has been set aside to recognize what they have done.\n  It is amazing how many American families have been touched by this \ndisease. Speaking personally, my mother fought and eventually lost the \nbattle against breast cancer. Her struggle certainly had a profound \nimpact on me and on my family.\n  Currently, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths \nfor women in the United States. Approximately 40,000 women in this \ncountry will die from the disease in 2004, and the American Cancer \nSociety estimates that a woman in the United States has a 1 in 7 chance \nof developing invasive breast cancer during her lifetime, and this risk \nwas 1 in 11 in 1975.\n  For the past 20 years, October has been designated as Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month. Events around the world are dedicated to spreading the \nmessage of early detection so that prevention and the ongoing search \nfor a cure can continue. Throughout the month, women are reminded in \nmany ways that regular screening for breast cancer continues to be the \nmost effective way to detect this disease in its earliest stages and \ntherefore save lives.\n  Recently, I was contacted by a group of Missourians who wanted to \nhighlight the need for breast cancer awareness. They wanted to \nilluminate the arch, which is, of course, a landmark not only in \nMissouri but in the country--a landmark with both national and local \nsignificance. They wanted to illuminate it with pink lighting in order \nto commemorate Breast Cancer Awareness Month. People everywhere \nassociate the pink ribbon and the color pink as a symbol of breast \ncancer\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\nawareness and the ongoing search for the cure.\n  Lighting the arch with pink lighting will also recognize the millions \nof women who are currently battling breast cancer and those who have \nlost their lives fighting their disease.\n  The bill I introduced will give the Secretary of the Interior the \nauthority to allow for that kind of lighting of the arch one night in \nOctober. I am hopeful that women not only in Missouri but all around \nthe country and around the world will see the arch and take the message \nof that lighting to heart.\n  I am very grateful to the majority leadership and the Democratic \nleadership as well for clearing this bill. I am grateful to the Senate \nfor passing it by unanimous consent this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/05/senate-section/article/S10468-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
