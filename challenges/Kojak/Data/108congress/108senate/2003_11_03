Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration \nof the conference report to accompany the Iraq and Afghanistan \nsupplemental bill. The order that was entered into on Thursday provided \nfor the time until 5 p.m. today to be equally divided for debate. That \nconference report will be agreed to at 5. However, no rollcall vote \nwill be necessary.\n  Also under a previous consent agreement, the Senate will then debate \nthe Interior appropriations conference report.

Senators \nshould, therefore, expect a rollcall vote to occur sometime between \n5:30 and 6 today.\n  We were also able to reach an agreement for consideration of the fair \ncredit reporting bill. The chairman and ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee have been working through the amendment list in an effort to \nfacilitate its passage. I would anticipate beginning that bill either \nthis evening or first thing tomorrow morning so we can finish the fair \ncredit legislation early this week.\n  Last week I also mentioned the expiration of the Internet tax \nmoratorium. I had hoped to address an extension of that moratorium \nprior to that deadline. However, several Senators expressed their \nreservation about an agreement for that bill. At the close of last \nweek, we were able to reach a consent agreement to proceed to the bill, \nmost likely on Thursday of this week. We will also continue with the \nappropriations process as the conference reports become available.\n  Nominations remain a focus of the Senate's attention. We will \ncontinue to work toward the scheduling of those nominations on the \nexecutive calendar. Another continuing resolution will be necessary by \nthe close of business this week. Even with a short-term extension of \nthe continuing resolution, we will still push to complete the remaining \nitems at the earliest time this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13751-6", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am pleased to bring to the Senate \nthis conference report to provide supplemental funding for military and \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The Congress, specifically the Senate, asked the President not to \nrequest any funds for our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the fiscal \nyear 2004 appropriations bill. The President honored our request, and \nthat bill has already been signed into law. The funding for our efforts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan is in the conference report now before us.\n  Our men and women in uniform face life-threatening obstacles every \nday and are counting on us to provide them with the resources they need \nto get the job done. This supplemental will provide the equipment, \nfuel, ammunition and pay our forces need and deserve as they continue \ntheir tasks in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the other locations where they \ncontinue to stand in harm's way fighting the global war on terrorism. \nThey are the reason we need to approve this emergency funding.\n  One thing is very clear: As the President has said time and again: We \nwill not walk away from Iraq. We will not withdraw our forces from \nIraq; we will not leave the Iraqi people in chaos; and we will not \ncreate a vacuum for terrorist groups to fill.\n  Our Nation has always had one goal--we finish what we start, and we \nwill not fail to do so now. This appropriations bill will enable us to \nfulfill our responsibilities to our men and women in uniform and to the \npeople of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This conference report before us provides $64.7 billion for military \noperations. Included in this amount is $17.8 billion for the salaries \nand benefits of active, Guard and Reserve military personnel activated \nfor duty in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas around the world. \nTogether they continue to fight our war against terrorists and \nterrorism; $39.2 billion for operations and maintenance in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Noble \nEagle, of which $1 billion is to support coalition partners; $5.5 \nbillion for procurement, including an additional $62.1 million for \nimproved armor for humvees; $333.8 million for military research, \ndevelopment, and evaluation; and $658 million for the defense health \nprogram.\n  In addition, this conference report provides benefits to our \nreservists who are ordered to active duty by authorizing coverage of \ntheir medical and dental screening. The conferees also expanded pre-\nmobilization and post-mobilization eligibility for Tricare and made \nTricare available to reservists who are unemployed or who are not \noffered health care benefits by their civilian employer.\n  Our forces are stationed in some of the most dangerous parts of the \nworld. They face formidable enemies and serious threats. They face \nthese obstacles because they have made a commitment to our freedom; \nthey have decided that, if necessary, they will give what Lincoln \ncalled ``the last full measure of devotion'' to defend freedom. This \nCongress must meet their level of commitment by funding their mission.\n  In addition to meeting our obligations, we also support additional \nfunds to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a simple and straight-\nforward premise--security brings stability and stability fosters \ndemocracy. An Iraq and Afghanistan well on the way to economic well-\nbeing and self-governance offers the fastest way to get our military \nmen and women home. To that end, this conference report provides $21.2 \nbillion to carry out the activities of our Government in connection \nwith the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq and Afghanistan. The \nmajority of these funds, $18.4 billion, is for Iraq for security, \nrehabilitation and reconstruction, including $100 million for democracy \nbuilding activities in Iraq to support the development of a \nconstitution and national elections.\n  Other items funded include: $983 million for operating expenses for \nthe coalition provisional authority; $16.6 million for safe and secure \nfacilities for the United States Agency for International Development \nin Iraq and Afghanistan; at least $38 million for operating expenses of \nthe United States Agency for International Development for costs \nassociated with Iraq and Afghanistan; $872 million to continue \npolitical and economic development programs in Afghanistan; $170 \nmillion for Department of State narcotics control, law enforcement, \nnonproliferation, anti-terrorism and demining programs in Afghanistan; \n$287 million to continue programs and activities to build the new \nAfghan army; $50 million for peacekeeping expenses in Iraq relating to \nadditional foreign armed forces; $35 million for anti-terrorism \ntraining and equipment needs in Afghanistan. The conferees also agreed \nto provide $200 million for assistance to Liberia, $200 million for \nassistance to Jordan, and $20 million for assistance to Sudan.\n  This conference agreement does not stop at funding our obligations; \nit also provides specific mechanisms to account for how our \nappropriated money is spent. This bill creates a new position: The \nInspector General for the Coalition Provisional Authority. The IG will \nwork with Ambassador Bremer, and together they will keep track of the \nfunding allocated for Iraq's reconstruction. The IG will issue \nquarterly reports on the CPA's activities. This position ensures that \nwe will always have a clear record of who is responsible for the funds \nappropriated to CPA and how they are spent. This position gives us a \nnew tracking and record-keeping system, a comprehensive review process, \nand transparency in the allocation of funds. Most importantly, it \nensures that funds will be used efficiently to build a new and free \nIraq. We have an obligation to our total force and an obligation to the \nIraqi and Afghanistan people to finish what we started.\n  This legislation meets those obligations, and I urge the Senate to \npromptly approve it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor this morning \nwith a real sadness in my heart. Yesterday, we learned of the loss of a \nChinook helicopter in Iraq. During the course of the day, I was \ncontacted in Chicago, and then again in Springfield, with rumors that \nit involved the Illinois National Guard. The rumor was confirmed this \nmorning. The pilot of the helicopter that was shot down in Iraq was a \nmember of the Illinois Air Guard and we believe he was assigned out of \nthe Peoria Guard unit. He is one of many who have been lost in this \nconflict from the beginning.\n  What we learn every morning as we learn the news of another soldier, \nor 2, or 3, or in this case yesterday, 16, is the real cost of war. I \nhave tried to call the families of those in my home State of Illinois \nwho have lost a soldier. I have not been able to get through to all of \nthem, and it is understandable that in their sorrow and grief, many of \nthem are not taking phone calls. Those I have reached are families who \nare proud of the men and women in uniform who volunteered to serve our \nNation and then gave their lives. They thank the military, too, for the \nkind treatment their family received upon the notification of the loss \nand all of the help and consolation during the funeral ceremonies.\n  But we have to face reality. These are the real costs of war. We come \nto the floor of the Senate today to debate an appropriations bill that, \nin all honesty, is just money. The real cost of war is human lives. \nSixteen were lost in the helicopter crash over the weekend, and another \nsoldier was killed in another incident. Now we have lost more American \nservicemen in Iraq since the President declared that the major military \noperations were completed than we did during the invasion.\n  It doesn't tell the whole story, though, to just count those who lost \ntheir lives, as tragic as that may be. Many listed as wounded are \nsometimes forgotten and they never should be.\n\n[[Page S13753]]\n\nSome of the wounds these soldiers have been exposed to are serious, \ngrievous.\n  Two weeks ago, I went to Walter Reed Hospital to visit with some of \nthe returning soldiers, to meet one soldier from Ohio who lost the \nsight in one of his eyes, to meet with another soldier from my State of \nIllinois, the community of Pleasant Hill, a small farm town, who took a \nmortar round and survived. They didn't think they could take him from \nthe scene, but he managed to live long enough. He made it to Germany, \nwhere they didn't think he would survive, but he did; and he was at \nWalter Reed with his mother and father dreaming of the day when he \ncould get back to Pike County, IL, to a small farm town, his home.\n  These are the wounded of war who lose limbs, who face grievous, \nserious injuries that will haunt them for a lifetime. These are the \nreal costs of war and a reminder, too, that we stand today in Iraq, 6 \nmonths after the end of the so-called military success that the \nPresident announced, still struggling to bring stability to that \ncountry. But understand, I don't think we can cut and leave. Those of \nus who warned in the beginning that once we made this decision, we had \nto remember it is easier to get into a war than to get out of a war--we \nhave learned that in the last 6 months.\n  Our superb military forces went into Iraq and, in a matter of 3 \nweeks, took down Saddam Hussein, this dictator, and his cruelty ended. \nWe were so proud of the men and women in uniform who did that so \nquickly.\n  But then came the second phase. That, unfortunately, has not gone \nnearly as well. The United States made a serious miscalculation when it \nentered this war in Iraq, invaded that nation, without the support of \nits traditional allies. With the exception of Great Britain, the so-\ncalled coalition of the willing was a very thin coalition. There were \nmany countries offering some help, a few soldiers; but really when it \ncame down to it, this President decided to embark on a war, with the \napproval of Congress, that took us into a wartime situation unlike \nanyone has seen. The President did not follow his father's model of \nbringing the United Nations behind his effort or true global coalition, \nbut decided he would take the small coalition into the war in Iraq.\n\n  We didn't need a massive global coalition to win the military battle. \nWe knew we had the best military in the world. We still do. But after \nthe military battle, it is clear now we need allies more than ever. \nAmerica needs countries to stand beside us with their soldiers, with \ntheir resources, with their commitment to finding stability in Iraq, \nand every day, when we see these bloody headlines of American soldiers \nbeing killed, we are reminded that had this been a global coalition, a \nbroader coalition, had we moved in concert with our traditional allies, \nwhat we are facing today could have been so much different.\n  The burden of Iraq weighs heavy on the shoulders of America, and each \nday as we wake up to hear the news of more deaths of American soldiers, \nmore wounded service men and women overseas, we understand that burden, \nbut we can never understand it like the families who have suffered the \nlosses. Our heart goes out to them. They are in our thoughts and \nprayers every single moment of every day, as they should be.\n  We come to the floor today to talk about the other costs of war, the \nappropriations necessary to keep this war going. It is a massive \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. The total is \n$87,442,198,000. This, of course, represents one of the largest \nemergency supplemental bills we have considered. It represents a \ncommitment of at least $1 billion a week to sustain our troops in Iraq, \nand then a commitment beyond it to an effort to build Iraq. It would be \neasy to say reconstruct Iraq if we had destroyed it during the element \nof invasion, but that didn't occur. Most of what we are doing is \nbuilding a country that had been decimated by a dictator. We are \nproviding things that for 10 or 20 years Saddam Hussein never provided \nto his people, in the hope that we can prove to them they can move \ntoward democracy; that they can move toward a free-market system; that \nthey can have stability, perhaps be a beacon of hope for the Middle \nEast.\n  If that is the ultimate outcome, then there is some success to this \nstory, but today, in one of the darkest hours with some of the saddest \nnews, it is difficult to look at this and understand how even money is \ngoing to solve our problems.\n  I voted against this preemptive and precipitous war, but today I face \na moral dilemma. I cannot and will not support President Bush's \nunilateralist, aggressive foreign policy of preemption. It is wrong. It \nwas wrong when we voted on it in October of last year. It is wrong in \nNovember of this year. It is based on the false premise that we can \nsomehow identify our enemies even if they haven't threatened the United \nStates, even if they have not created a situation of eminent danger. It \nrelies, of course, on information and information based on \nintelligence, and what do we have to say today about our intelligence-\ngathering agencies leading up to our invasion of Iraq?\n  We said we needed to go to Iraq to stop them from obtaining nuclear \nweapons and using them against their neighbors and against us. It turns \nout now that was an empty threat. There is no evidence of nuclear \nweapons nor program in Iraq.\n  We said there was an arsenal of biological and chemical weapons, \nweapons of mass destruction, which, again, could threaten the region, \nthe people of Iraq, and the United States, and yet Dr. Kay, after more \nthan 6 months and millions of dollars and hundreds of inspectors, has \ncome up emptyhanded, cannot find a shred of evidence of these weapons \nof mass destruction.\n\n  In the President's State of the Union Address they said, oh, we have \nproof they were moving fissile material from Africa to Iraq to build \nnuclear weapons, and even the President has had to say that was not \naccurate.\n  We said as well, if you remember 9/11, you can understand why we \nneeded to invade Iraq--because al-Qaida of 9/11 and Saddam Hussein of \nIraq were linked. Even the President had to come forward and concede a \nfew weeks ago that statement is not true, either. It is true we changed \na regime. We have eliminated Saddam Hussein. But the premise of that \nwar has been challenged and has been found faulty.\n  So today we consider this supplemental appropriations bill to provide \nthe money that our men and women need to sustain the military effort in \nIraq and to come home safely. All of these funds are emergency \nspending. What that means, of course, is that we are not cutting other \nGovernment spending nor raising taxes to find the $87 billion. We are \nadding this money to America's mortgage. This is our second mortgage on \nAmerica, $87 billion--the greatest deficit in the history of the United \nStates, and it continues to grow as this administration continues to \ncall for more tax cuts for wealthy people. This, unfortunately, is part \nof our legacy.\n  One of the most difficult parts of this bill is the fact that this \nconference committee stripped out the provision the Senate added on a \nbipartisan rollcall vote. Republicans and Democrats came together and \nsaid at least $10 billion of the $20 billion to reconstruct Iraq should \ncome from the Iraqi people, from their oil reserves. Is that an \nincredible request, that this country with the second largest oil \nreserve in the world would help to pay for its own infrastructure? The \nBush administration said it was unacceptable. No loan provision will be \nput in this bill. If anyone has to borrow money to build Iraq, it will \nbe America's families, not the people of Iraq. That is a sad outcome.\n  Frankly, it means that much of what we were told by this \nadministration before the war just was not true. Paul Wolfowitz, on \nMarch 27, 2003, testifying before the House Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, said as follows:\n\n       And on rough recollection, the oil revenues of that country \n     could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of \n     the next 2 or 3 years. . . . We're dealing with a country \n     that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively \n     soon.\n\n  Assistant Secretary Wolfowitz said those words to this Congress 6 \nmonths ago. This man, who was urging America to invade Iraq and telling \nus they could pay for their own reconstruction, and where are we today? \nThe Bush administration has rejected the idea that Iraq would pay for \nthis. No, American taxpayers have to pay for it. It has to come out of \nthe Social Security trust fund. It has to come out of investments\n\n[[Page S13754]]\n\nin education and health care in America. The Bush administration \ninsists on it.\n  Listen to what Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said on the same \nday:\n\n       I don't believe the United States has the responsibility \n     for reconstruction, in a sense . . . and the funds can come \n     from those various sources I mentioned: frozen assets, oil \n     revenues and a variety of other things, including the Oil \n     for Food, which has a very substantial number of billions \n     of dollars in it.\n\n  Six months ago, those were the words of the Secretary of Defense to \nthe American people through Congress, and I quote again. He said:\n\n       I don't believe the United States has the responsibility \n     for reconstruction. . . .\n\n  How clear can we be? Yet today, face it, America, taxpayers, and \nfamilies, we are accepting an $87 billion responsibility. Instead of \nasking Iraq to borrow against its bountiful oil reserves, we are asking \nour children and grandchildren to continue to borrow to build Iraq.\n  I also want to tell you there is one thing that was done in that \nconference committee which I think was shameful--shameful: the decision \nof this conference committee to strip out a provision in the bill which \nI added on the floor of the Senate. Let me explain it.\n  Across America, men and women serving in the Guard and Reserve have \nbeen activated. Usually their activation was only for a few months but \nnow, because of the fact we are stretched thin around the world, these \nguardsmen and reservists, much like the helicopter pilot who was killed \nover the weekend from my State of Illinois, have been activated and \nasked to serve for longer and longer periods of time, causing \nextraordinary hardship to their family.\n  Some dismiss it and say they knew what they were getting into. When \nthey signed up for the Guard and Reserve, they knew they were going to \nbe activated. This is true. I won't argue with that.\n  Frankly, I ask my friends and colleagues in the Senate to at least \nshow some compassion for those and their families who have been \nactivated and, because of that activation, suffer an extraordinary \neconomic hardship.\n  Across America, dozens of States and local units of government--my \nown home State of Illinois, the city of Chicago--have decided if their \nemployees are activated in the Guard and Reserve, they will make up the \ndifference in pay so that while they are off serving their country and \nrisking their lives they can at least have peace of mind that their \npaycheck will be protected. That State government, that city government \nwill make up the difference in pay. Thank God for their charity and \ncompassion. Thank God they care enough for these men and women to make \nthat commitment, as they have repeatedly. It is not just units of \ngovernment. Private corporations have done the same thing. We applaud \nthem. We call them patriot corporations because they stand behind the \nmen and women in uniform.\n  I came to the Senate floor and I said to my colleagues, if we applaud \nthose who stand behind the men and women in uniform to make certain \nthey do not lose their pay while they are activated, can we do no less \nfor Federal employees, the employees of the U.S. Government? By a \nresounding vote of 96 to 3, this bipartisan vote on the Senate floor, \nwe said, yes, we will stand behind the Federal employees who activate.\n  How many are involved? Of the 1.2 million Guard and Reserve in \nAmerica today, 10 percent are Federal employees, 120,000. Currently \n23,000 are activated. Some do not see a cut in pay, but many see \ndramatic cuts in pay. What I asked for was the same type of justice and \ncaring from the Federal Government we asked from State and local \ngovernments.\n  We passed that amendment, and I felt good that we made this \ncommitment. Frankly, I sang the praises of the Senate and those who \nwere involved. We went to the conference committee, and on a party-line \nvote, with every Republican Senator voting no, they removed this \nprovision from the bill. Many of the Senators who just a few days \nbefore on this floor had voted for the provision to protect the pay of \nactivated Federal employees turned around, within a few days, and voted \nno. That does not set a very good example, does it? If we will not \nprovide the same kind of compensation for Federal employees as State \nand local governments do, how can we in good conscience turn to \nbusinesses and say, stand behind your guardsmen, stand behind your \nreservists; they are serving our country; they deserve your help, when \nwe turn our backs on them in this bill?\n  It was the first thing we did when we sat down in conference. It was \nthe first vote we took. It was a sad day. Unfortunately, I will have to \noffer this amendment again in the hopes that the next time around, if \nit passes on the Senate floor, the Senate conferees will stand up for \nit. They did not do that this time.\n  I also want to say we are paying a great amount of money out of our \nFederal Treasury to search for weapons of mass destruction. I cannot \ndisclose the sum because it is classified. Trust me, it is very large. \nThe Iraq Survey Group is in this so far futile search for weapons of \nmass destruction. I asked in this bill that they at least give us a \nquarterly report on what progress was being made. That was stripped out \nof the bill--no report necessary.\n  The amendment would require the special adviser to the Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency for the strategy in Iraq, Dr. David \nKay, to provide both classified and unclassified written status to \nCongress on a quarterly basis. That accountability was removed in this \nbill.\n  Another provision that was stripped out of this bill relates to \nprofiteering by corporations out to make a buck on a war. During World \nWar II, Harry Truman called war profiteering treason. President \nFranklin Roosevelt said: I do not want to see a single war millionaire \ncreated in the United States as a result of this world disaster.\n\n  But when the Appropriations Committee considered this bill, they \ndeleted an amendment by Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein, and myself to \ncriminalize war profiteering, price gouging and fraud. The same law \nthat was passed during World War II was stripped out in conference. I \ndo not understand it. I do not understand how anyone could be opposed \nto prosecuting those who want to defraud and overcharge the U.S. \nGovernment and the American taxpayers in time of war. It is unseemly \nthat this has been stripped out in light of questionable no-bid and \nsecretly bid contracts that have been let for Iraq construction.\n  Since the late 1980s, the move to privatize just about everything the \nGovernment does has led to the granting of billion-dollar contracts to \na handful of huge companies. We have heard the names: Halliburton, \nBechtel. They go on and on. With no surprise, many of them are \npolitically well connected. This amendment was eliminated. It would not \nhave hurt this conference, it would not have hurt this country to \ninclude that provision in the law as fair warning to those who would \nprofiteer during a war that we will come down on them like a ton of \nbricks. But, no, it was removed.\n  There are many elements in this bill which trouble me. There are some \nwhich deserve praise. Access to TRICARE was enhanced for members of the \nGuard and Reserve; $100 million was added to secure and destroy \nconventional munitions in Iraq, the ordnance that is being used to \nbring down our helicopters and killing our soldiers every single day; \n$500 million for recent disasters, including the California wildfires \nand Hurricane Isabel; $100 million to help Liberia recover from its \nbrutal civil war; $60 million for Afghan women and girls; and a \nmodification of language Senator Murray, Senator Landrieu, and I \noffered on the Senate floor to ensure the assistance provided for Iraq \nand Afghanistan advances the social, economic, political rights, and \nopportunities for women and girls.\n  I want to especially salute Senator Murray and Senator Landrieu. They \nhad to fight to restore this money in the conference committee. Before \nthe conference committee came together, a staffer stripped it out and \nthey restored it. It took a lot of hard work on their part, but I think \nmost of us realize women and girls in Afghanistan have been brutalized \nby the Taliban and by the previous government. Frankly, we need to \nstand behind them. I am glad this money was restored.\n  I voted reluctantly for the Iraq supplemental when the Senate passed \nit the first time for the same reason I\n\n[[Page S13755]]\n\nmentioned earlier. As much as I believe this war was begun in a wrong \nfashion, with a policy that can no longer be defended, I have to say \nthat as long as 120,000 of our best and brightest soldiers are over \nthere risking their lives every single day, we have to stand by them.\n  I believe the sensible loan provisions which Senator Dorgan from \nNorth Dakota, who is now in the Chamber, supported, as well as his \neffort to say that the Iraqis will pay for the cost of the war with \ntheir own oil were just sensible. They are what American families would \nsay, but unfortunately it is not what the Bush administration would \nsay, and those have been removed.\n  This deletion of the reservist pay provision is one which I hope we \ncan visit again. I hope next time instead of 96 to 3, we will have a \n100-to-0 vote in the Senate. Maybe that is what it takes to convince \nconferees to stay with a provision once we have adopted it in the \nSenate.\n  The American people will ultimately be the judge of our work today. \nSadly, they are the ones who are not only paying the bills and writing \nthe checks. They understand the costs of war sometimes better than \nelected officials. The families with soldiers overseas and those who \nhave seen those soldiers injured or killed understand the costs of war \nfar more than anyone on any Appropriations Committee ever could.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will take a few moments to discuss the \nIraq supplemental conference report. At the start of this process, we \nattempted to have two portions we might consider. One would be the \nmilitary, which provides almost $1 billion a week to support our \ntroops, and the second is the Iraq reconstruction fund, which is the \namount of money the American taxpayer will be asked to fund for the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  We were not successful in separating these two, and so this travels \nas one. As a result of that, I offered an amendment to provide that \nIraqi oil ought to bear the burden of Iraq reconstruction. We did not \ntarget Iraq's infrastructure. We did not target or attempt to bomb \ntheir roads, their bridges, their dams, their power structure. So the \nrequirement that the U.S. taxpayer should pay for the reconstruction of \nIraq is a requirement that does not make much sense to me.\n  Iraq, by the way, has the second largest oil reserves in the world, \nsomething people have frequently said on the Senate floor. If they have \nthe second largest oil reserves in the world and are capable of \nproducing, according to Ambassador Bremer, 3 million barrels of oil a \nday beginning next July, that is $16 billion a year in export value, \n$160 billion in 10 years. There are ample resources, by pumping oil out \nof the sands of Iraq, to pay for the reconstruction of Iraq. It ought \nto be that oil, not the burden of the American taxpayer, that pays for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq. I lost that vote on the Senate floor. The \nPresident did not support it. The majority did not support it. They \nsaid the American taxpayer must bear the burden of the reconstruction \nof Iraq. I think that is wrong. It does not make any sense to me. But, \nagain, the requirement is included with the requirement to support our \ntroops.\n  This country cannot send its sons and daughters to war and then say \nto them, oh, by the way, when you need some additional money for \nequipment and ammunition and those kinds of things, we will not provide \nthem. We have no other alternative. We have an obligation to provide \nthat which our military needs to complete this mission. We must do \nthat. So this is going to pass today. I will support it. I support \nreluctantly the provisions that have to do with the reconstruction of \nIraq for the reasons I just mentioned. It is unthinkable to me that the \nAmerican taxpayer will now be required to come up with $18.6 billion. \nThe reason it is $18.6 billion is because, with my colleague Senator \nWyden, I offered the amendment to cut $1.8 billion. The cut of $1.8 \nbillion, which was accepted by the Senate, includes cutting money to \nconstruct two new high-security prisons at $50,000 a bed, $100 million \nto restore marshes, $4 million for a nationwide telephone numbering \nsystem in Iraq, $9 million to create ZIP Codes and do a postal \narchitecture in Iraq, $10 million to modernize the business practices \nof Iraqi television and radio, $20 million for 1-month-long catch-up \nbusiness courses at $10,000 per pupil. That is more than twice as much \nas the Harvard Business School costs. You get the point. I was able to \ncut $1.8 billion, so this is $1.8 billion less than it otherwise would \nhave been, but it is $18.6 billion.\n\n  I think there is great question of whether that money will be spent \neffectively. Let me give some examples. A contract is let to provide \nair-conditioners in hundreds of public buildings. Then it goes to \nanother contractor and then a subcontractor and that which represented \nair-conditioners in that contract has now become $11 ceiling fans. Let \nme say that again. That which was air-conditioners in the contract, \nwhen installed by the subsequent subcontractor, became $11 ceiling \nfans.\n  What happened to the money? Halliburton is importing oil into the \ncountry of Iraq at $1.59 a gallon. The Iraqi oil officials say we can \nget that oil for 98 cents a gallon. So what is happening? Is the \nAmerican taxpayer getting squeezed to the tune of $300 million here? It \nlooks like it to me.\n  These are the kinds of questions that I think are very important to \nask. I am going to be chairing a hearing today at 1:30 on these issues. \nThe Democratic Policy Committee is holding a hearing on contracting in \nIraq to make sure that, if the American taxpayer has to pay for this--\nand apparently by this it does because those of us who attempted to \nmake it the burden of Iraqi oil to pay for Iraq reconstruction lost--if \nthat is the case, when you send $18.6 billion out into the wind, I am \ntelling you there is going to be a lot of waste, fraud, and abuse \nunless we set up conditions to watch it carefully.\n  This started with sole-source contracts. That is the way this \nstarted. That is not what we want to have happen in the future. So \nthere is a requirement for contracts that are bid, which is important, \nbut the question is how do you make sure there is not abuse as a result \nof this, and waste and fraud? We need to care a great deal about that. \nI do not understand. I just don't understand the circumstances here, \nwhen it is Katie bar the door if you want money for reconstruction of \nIraq. The taxpayers will ante that up. We have an unlimited supply of \nmoney.\n  That is what some say. I don't think that makes any sense. We are \ngoing to borrow money in this country so we can send that money to Iraq \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq for a whole series of things that have \ndeteriorated for 20 years in Iraq. We didn't destroy them. Then Iraq, \nincidentally, is going to pump oil out of the ground. They have liquid \ngold under that soil; the second largest reserves in the world are \nthere. Then, guess what. When Ambassador Bremer testified before the \nAppropriations Committee I asked him: Why can't we use Iraqi oil to pay \nfor Iraqi reconstruction?\n  He said: Very simple; it's because Iraq has a lot of foreign debt.\n  I said: Who does Iraq owe money to?\n  He said: Germany, France, Russia.\n  At that point I didn't know enough to respond to him. I checked after \nthe hearing and found, yes, indeed, Iraq owes money to Germany, France, \nand Russia. But that is not the biggest debt it owes. Mr. Bremer didn't \nknow, or failed to mention to me, the largest debts are to Saudi Arabia \nand Kuwait--interesting. Wouldn't it be a perversity if the American \ntaxpayers are borrowing money to ship it to Iraq to pay for \nreconstruction, and then Iraq is pumping 3 million barrels of oil a day \nbeginning July 1 and selling the oil on the open market making $16 \nmillion a year and using the money to pay Saudi Arabia on past debts?\n  It is incredible to think of the perversity of that kind of \nsituation. I don't know whether Mr. Bremer simply didn't know that Iraq \nowes large debts to the Saudis and Kuwaitis or just neglected to \nmention it. They do owe money to France, Germany, and Russia, but it is \na lesser amount of money. Most Americans have a right to take a look at \nthis and say this is a missed priority and a missed opportunity. The \nreason those of us who attempted to change the construct of this were \ndenied the opportunity to do so by a vote in the Senate was we were \ntold every\n\n[[Page S13756]]\n\nsingle dollar of this is necessary for the support of our troops, and \nthe quicker we get things back on track in Iraq, the quicker the troops \ncome home. Therefore, we were told it is necessary to reconstruct the \nZIP Code system in Iraq, number the telephone system in a different \nway, and restore marshlands.\n  That, of course, is all patently nuts. I mean only in this town would \npeople not laugh out loud at that assertion. You don't need to do that \nto provide for the safety of our troops.\n  We have a responsibility, it seems to me, to try to make sure that we \nwin this battle in Iraq. Yes, indeed, it is a battle. This weekend \nanother 16 soldiers, tragically, lost their lives. All of us are \nheartbroken about those losses. We cannot withdraw from Iraq. Some say \nlet's pull out tomorrow. We can't do that. There is not any way this \ncountry can do that. There would be a bloodbath in Iraq tomorrow if we \npulled out. So we have a responsibility to stay in Iraq at this point.\n  But what we have a responsibility to do, in my judgment, is to put \nthis back on track by making it less a U.S. occupation and more an \ninternational occupation. That means it is very important for us, as \nSecretary Rumsfeld said this weekend, to build up the security forces \nin Iraq--that is very important--and do a lot of other things so at \nsome point we can withdraw our troops. But especially we must \nunderstand that we need to get other countries to commit troops so this \nis, in fact, an international occupation in Iraq, not just a U.S. \noccupation.\n  In response to that, some would say it is an international \noccupation.\n  It is not. It is not. The overwhelming, 90 percent of the occupation \nis American. We need it to be an international occupation now and we \nneed to set the stage to do the things to allow there to be security in \nIraq, to allow the Iraqis to develop a government, and then to allow us \nto withdraw our soldiers and bring our soldiers home. We can't do that \nthis week, we can't do that this month, but our goal is to do that. In \nthe context of doing that we provided $66 million requested by the \nPentagon to keep those troops in Iraq, to provide the funds they need \nwhile they are in Iraq.\n  Attached to this is the $18.6 billion now for the reconstruction of \nIraq. I regret that is there. Although that reconstruction may well be \nnecessary in many cases, it ought not be an obligation borne by the \nAmerican taxpayer. It just should not be. Yet here in the Senate we \nvote, and when we lose a vote, we lose. I lost the vote believing this \nought to be a burden of Iraqi oil.\n  Now we will pass, today, the Iraq supplemental conference report. The \nPresident will sign it, and the funds will begin to flow for our troops \nand we will also see substantial money that begins to go in contracts \nto reconstruct Iraq.\n  This afternoon, as I indicated, I will chair a hearing that looks at \nthat, to evaluate exactly what is happening with those funds.\n  We had some sole-source contracts with Halliburton, Bechtel, and \nothers that were not bid. There was some allegation of substantial \nwaste. We will have testimony today about some very wealthy families in \nIraq who are extracting kickbacks from suppliers and from contractors \nin Iraq. We will have other questions about waste of money and waste, \nfraud, and abuse in this contracting.\n  I think all of us want the same thing. I don't think anybody would \nobject to making sure that we put a structure in place to protect the \nAmerican taxpayer against the waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  You talk about a bunch of hogs in a corn crib, I will tell you how to \nget that sound going. You just provide $18 billion out there and say to \ncompanies: Come and get a part of this and do something in Iraq. I will \nshow you the opportunity for substantial waste, fraud, and abuse. We \nought to make sure, if we are going to do this--and we are because I \nlost on this--if we are going to do this and provide $18.6 billion in \ntaxpayer funds, then let's make sure we shut down the opportunity to \nwaste this money.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum. I ask unanimous consent the quorum call be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to make special note of thanks to \nstaff of the subcommittees who worked so hard on this important \nlegislation. This bill before the Senate required the work of seven of \nthe appropriations subcommittees--Defense, Foreign Operations, Military \nConstruction, Homeland Security, Commerce-Justice-State, HUD-VA, and \nLabor-HHS. The members of our committee staff have put in long hours \nworking not only on this bill but on our other regular fiscal year 2004 \nappropriations bills. It meant working nights and most weekends of the \nlast 5 weeks.\n  I especially thank our staff director, Jim Morhard, who has \nshepherded this bill through and coordinated these subcommittees, and \ngot us to the place where we are now.\n  I especially thank Sid Ashworth, clerk of the Defense Subcommittee, \nand her counterpart on the Democratic side, Charlie Houy; and Paul \nGrove, clerk of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and his \ncounterpart, Tim Reiser. These four hammered out the compromises on the \nmajor provisions of the legislation before the Senate today. Paul Grove \ndeserves special recognition. He is a true professional who has worked \ntirelessly to help us complete action on both the supplemental and the \nfiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations appropriations bill at the same \ntime.\n\n  He worked literally around the clock yesterday and into today. I am \nnot sure he has seen his family or has gotten more than 2 or 3 hours \nsleep every night for the last 2 weeks. I am serious. He has been a \ntotally dedicated man. His efforts represent the dedication of the \nstaff of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I am very proud of these \npeople. I hope everyone in the Senate realizes how hard they have \nworked to get this bill before the Senate today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Agency Funding\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue within the \nAppropriations Committee's jurisdiction, which is the subcommittee that \nI chair, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary, and a letter sent to the committee as a result of the mark \nwhich came out of the full committee markup process funding those major \nagencies. This subcommittee has very broad jurisdiction. It is an \nexciting committee, quite honestly, of which to be chairman. It has the \nCommerce Department, it has the Justice Department, it has Judiciary, \nthe FTC, FCC, and a number of other major agencies, including State \nDepartment.\n  As a result of the allocation process, which is a process by which \nthe chairman of the full committee assigns each of the 13 subcommittees \nwithin the Appropriations Committee an amount of money they can spend \non the various agencies which they have responsibility for, which \namount is tied to the overall budget passed by the Senate, so that the \noverall budget, which I believe was $784 billion, is chopped into parts \nand each subcommittee gets a part of that budget which it then \nallocates to the various agencies for which it has responsibility.\n  As a result of that process, this subcommittee, the Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, was the only subcommittee \nwhich actually received less of an allocation. In other words, our \nnumber that we had for our agencies was less than what, first, the \nPresident requested by, I believe, $700 million, and, second, what the \nHouse had allocated to this same group of agencies by $900 million. Our \nsubcommittee, when it was assigned our number, was almost $1 billion \nbelow the amount which was available to the House subcommittee and\n\n[[Page S13757]]\n\neven more significantly below what the President had requested for \nthese agencies. That was a responsibility I was willing to accept.\n  I am happy to try to do my job around here. If my job involves being \nfiscally responsible, I am more than happy to do that. So when the \nchairman made this decision, which was a reasonable decision in light \nof the very stringent numbers he had to work with, I worked with them \nand produced a bill which met those numbers.\n\n  Our bill came out at a funding level which was significantly below \nthe House number. A number of the agencies which were impacted \nobviously were not happy about that. Most of them, however, were \nsophisticated enough to realize that in the end there was going to be a \ncompromise between our committee and the House committee and that I \nsuspect our number will move up closer to the House number and, \ntherefore, closer to the President's number.\n  Most of the other agencies were fairly responsible in their reaction \nto this, fairly reserved. For example, we received a letter from the \nJustice Department, which took many of the major cuts--not cuts but \nreductions in increases--that I had to make. This letter was a very \nmatter of fact, accurate statement of where they thought they needed \nmore money.\n  I cannot argue with their position. In fact, in many ways, if I have \nmore money as we move down the road, I will address those concerns very \naggressively: for example, in the areas of the FBI, ATF, DEA, and \ngeneral operations of the Justice Department. These were reasonable \nobjections. They disagreed with our funding levels, but the Attorney \nGeneral understood that we had a problem.\n  Then we received a letter from the State Department. Now, the State \nDepartment is supposed to be diplomatic. I believe that should be one \nof their skills. This was not a diplomatic letter. It was excessive, \ninaccurate, and inflammatory. It essentially attacked the \nAppropriations Committee and the subcommittee in terms which I thought \nwere grossly overstated and inappropriate. In it, the Department \nquestioned our commitment to national security, questioned our \ncommitment to the State Department, and then went on to raise specific \nproblems with the bill that were not dollar related, for the most part, \nbut were policy related, many of which were actually policy initiatives \nthat the State Department knew or had to know were inaccurate. They \nbased an inflammatory letter on facts which were wrong.\n  I am going to go through that letter, point by point, and address \nthose issues. I am not going to address the overall funding issue too \nmuch because this gets into my allocation, the allocation we received, \nand down the road we will be able to address that. Down the road, we \nwill be able to address that. But that was not really the essence of \nthis letter.\n\n  This letter was a very vitriolic attack on the Appropriations \nCommittee, regrettably, by the Secretary of State, signed by the \nSecretary of State, and I think it has to be responded to.\n  I am going to try to do it in a matter-of-fact way. I am not going to \nraise my language to the level he raised his because I think his level \nwas inappropriate and extraordinarily undiplomatic. But let me pursue \nthe specifics.\n  The Department's--when I say ``Department,'' I am referring, of \ncourse, to the State Department. The Department's appeal letter \ncriticizes the bill for not providing full funding for the Diplomatic \nReadiness Initiative. The Diplomatic Readiness Initiative is the State \nDepartment's plan to hire 1,158 new Foreign Service officers over 3 \nyears. The $97 million requested in fiscal year 2004 represents the \nthird and final year of funding for this unprecedented hiring surge.\n  The Department's target levels, both in terms of funding and \npersonnel, for the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative were arrived at in a \nrather arbitrary way, in our opinion. State never undertook a \ncomprehensive review to determine where and how many additional staff \nmight be needed. In fiscal year 2002, the committee asked the \nDepartment to provide justification for the requested 1,158 new hires. \nThe committee repeated that request, and the request went unanswered.\n  The committee, this year, asked the State Department to explain where \nthe 399 new Foreign Service officers, requested in fiscal year 2004, \nwould be stationed--What bureaus? What embassies?--a fairly reasonable \nrequest from the appropriations committee charged with protecting the \npocketbooks of American taxpayers. The State Department could not \nanswer the question.\n  If any internal review process had taken place to determine the \nproper personnel levels for overseas posts, the Department would have \neasily been able to tell the committee where these new FSOs would be \nplaced, but they could not.\n  The problem concerning the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative goes hand \nin hand with the issue of right-sizing. ``Right-sizing'' refers to the \nconfiguration of U.S. Government overseas personnel to the minimum \nnecessary to support national interests.\n  According to the General Accounting Office--this is not our \ncommittee--but according to a General Accounting Office report, the \nState Department ``has no comprehensive process in place for developing \nthe staffing projections that are essential to the right-sizing \nprocess.''\n  In its appeal letter, the Department states that this claim is ``no \nlonger accurate.'' But the Department's very use of the words ``no \nlonger'' is an admission it did not, in fact, have a right-sizing \nprocess in place when the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative was put \nforward.\n  In the absence of any indicators that State has undertaken right-\nsizing on its own, the committee decided to include two provisions that \nwould compel the State Department to right-size downward, hopefully, \ntwo posts in Western Europe.\n  For the sake of argument, however, let us assume that State was, in \nfact, able to justify its Diplomatic Readiness Initiative requests and \nthat it did have an effective right-sizing program in place.\n  The Department's letter claims that the bill provides only $67.4 \nmillion for the Diplomatic Hiring Initiative. That simply is not true. \nIt is not accurate, like much else in this letter. The Senate report \nclearly states that $90 million is available for the Diplomatic \nReadiness Initiative. The State Department is dissatisfied because the \ncommittee considers its request for 68 new consular officers to be part \nof the diplomatic readiness, not an add-on.\n  In fiscal year 2004, the State Department requested 68 new consular \nofficers in addition to the final tranches of 399 new Foreign Service \nOfficers. State claims the increase is necessary due to unanticipated \npersonnel needs.\n  The last-minute addition of the 68 new FTEs, at a cost of $22.6 \nmillion, confirms the committee's suspicion that the Department, in \nfact, had not undertaken any meaningful workforce planning.\n\n  The second point the Department makes here: the Department's appeal \nletter criticizes the bill for not providing any funding for the Bureau \nof Legislative Affairs, or ``H'', as it is commonly known.\n  For the sake of full disclosure, it should be noted that the Bureau \nof Legislative Affairs wrote the letter that was sent to us by the \nState Department, which I think, on its face, should explain why we \nzeroed it out. But I will go into more specifics.\n  The House bill contains language capping both the funding and the \npersonnel of that Bureau. Why would both the House and the Senate \nAppropriations Committees move to limit or, in our case, strike the \noffice's funding? The reality is that both House and Senate \nappropriators are unhappy with the performance of this office and are \nunconvinced of its necessity. There are currently 69 full-time \nequivalents at H at an annual cost of $7.7 million.\n  The Senate CJS Subcommittee works almost exclusively with the State \nDepartment's budget office, not the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. In \nthe interest of fairness to my House and Senate colleagues who might \nutilize the H Department, I would consider reducing the Bureau of \nLegislative Affairs' budget by one-quarter to account for the services \nthat are not provided to our subcommittee but for which we seem to be \npaying. And possibly the House will take the same position. That would \nallow, of course, H to be able to\n\n[[Page S13758]]\n\nwork with the authorizing committees and other Congressional offices. \nSo we are willing to adjust there.\n  But I think people can understand why, after I complete my analysis \nof this letter, this Bureau does not merit funding from the committee.\n  The Department appeal letter also criticizes the bill for not \nproviding any funding for the Office of Legal Adviser, or ``L'', as it \nis commonly known. As the letter points out, the committee certainly \ndoes not believe the State Department's legal needs should go \nuncovered. Situations will undoubtedly arise that will require a legal \nresponse from the Department of State. This is why the committee would \nlikely have moved in conference to restore at least a portion of this \noffice's funding, and we will do that.\n  The committee did not provide funding for L in fiscal year 2004 to \nmake a point as to the failures of L's performance in a number of \nareas. This office has several times overstepped its bounds.\n  The Office of Legal Adviser is responsible for providing timely legal \nadvice and support to the Secretary of State. However, L regularly \ninserts itself into the policymaking process, even to the point of \ntelling the Congress what the Congress does and does not intend by the \nlaws we pass.\n  With all due respect to the good people who work at L, Senator \nHollings and I and other members of the Appropriations Committee really \nare not interested in having State Department lawyers tell us what we \nmeant when we passed laws. This is exactly, however, what L did when \nSenator Hollings tried to pass legislation allowing Americans who were \nheld hostage during the Iranian hostage crisis to file claims for \ndamages against Iran.\n  Whether my colleagues agree or disagree with Senator Hollings' \nposition--and it has been a position of some controversy--on this \nparticular issue there can be no disagreement over the Office of Legal \nAdviser's slick lobbying tactics and outright refusal to follow the \ncongressional direction.\n  Another source of frustration is L's past attempts to withhold \ninformation from the committee. An April, 2003, Department of State \nInspector General's report described the case of a State Department \nemployee who was committing fraud against the Department. The IG report \ndid not clarify the outcome of the case, stating only that the employee \nhad been recommended for removal. As an oversight responsibility, we \ninquired as to whether the person had been removed or not. L directed \nthe Legislative Affairs Office not to provide this information to the \ncommittee on the basis that it had Privacy Act protection.\n  I believe the American people, and certainly the appropriations \ncommittee, have a right to know whether or not a person accused of \nfraud by the IG has been removed from that office.\n  The American people have a right to know whether an employee caught \nstealing their tax dollars remains on the Federal payroll. So, the \ncommittee reiterated its request. At that point, the State Department \ntold the committee what we already knew to be true: that the Privacy \nAct contains a statutory waiver for congressional committees of \njurisdiction.\n  State then told the committee it could have the information only if \nit could produce a letter of request. However, the statutory waiver \ncontains no mention of a letter. We refused to sign a letter and gave \nthe State Department a deadline to make the information available to \nthe committee. This was many months ago, and we are still waiting for \nthe information.\n  A congressional committee of jurisdiction should not be at the mercy \nof the State Department's legal department and its internal rules for \naccess to information. Such rules are obviously intended to withhold \ninformation from the American people that could potentially embarrass \nthe State Department.\n  It is regrettable that the Office of Legal Adviser can so flagrantly \ndefy the wisdom, the spirit, and the intent of a waiver for \ncongressional committees of jurisdiction.\n  The Department's appeal letter further criticizes the bill for not \nproviding funding for the Office of Brazilian/Southern Cone Affairs and \nthe Deputy Assistant Secretary for that office. There is a very \nstraightforward reason for the committee's decision not to provide \nfunding for this office.\n  In 2002, the Department decided to consolidate the Rio de Janeiro, \nBrazil, operations into leased facilities rather than construct a new \nconsulate building. This decision left the Department holding several \nproperties in Rio de Janeiro that it could not sell due to the 1991 \nBrazilian law that requires individuals and businesses to be current on \ntheir Social Security payments to the Government of Brazil before they \ncan legally transfer property title.\n  In 1996, the State Department discontinued the payment of employer \ncontributions into the Brazilian Social Security system for foreign \nservice national employees because the Department deemed the Brazilian \nSocial Security system to be fiscally unsound. The Department deemed it \nto be fiscally unsound. The Department set up its own pension system \nfor the FSNs.\n  The result of this is that the United States now owes approximately \n$10 million in arrears to the Government of Brazil. The State \nDepartment had in the past refused to pay the arrears. The committee \nsupported its decision not to do so because we had already paid that \n$10 million in two accounts to benefit these employers.\n  However, when the Department eventually needed to dispose of the \nproperty in Rio de Janeiro, it requested a reprogramming of $10 million \nto repay the arrears. The committee denied the Department's request, \nciting the principle of the matter and the fact that American taxpayers \nwere, in essence, being asked to pay twice for these FSN pensions.\n  Shortly thereafter, it was brought to the committee's attention that \ncertain officials from the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs were \ntrying to arrange a property swap with the Government of Brazil. In \nother words, the committee specifically told the Department not to pay \nback the arrears, and the Bureau sought a way around the committee's \ndenial of the funding.\n  In light of these inexcusable actions and in light of the low fiscal \nyear 2004 allocation, the committee decided that the appropriate \nfunding level for the Office of Brazilian/Southern Cone Affairs was \nzero. The bill makes it clear that even the Department of State is \naccountable for the expenditure of the American taxpayers' dollars.\n  The Department's appeal letter further criticizes the bill for not \nproviding funds for the Bureau of Oceans and International \nEnvironmental and Scientific Affairs. It is the responsibility of this \nbureau to promote U.S. interests in oceans, manage fish resources, \nprotect marine environment through treaties, and promote U.S. interests \nin the international management of fresh water, forests, hazardous \nchemicals, and the atmosphere. Why would anyone want to abolish an \noffice with such an important portfolio?\n  The answer is that OES is not really getting the job done. The people \nat OES are very skilled diplomats, but they are not using their talents \nto negotiate effective, forceful treaties on fisheries, forests, and \nthe atmosphere. They are instead burning time and talent lobbying for \nmore resources for themselves or trying to wriggle out of initiatives \nwhich Congress has asked them to undertake.\n  For the record, the bill does not abolish the OES functions, as some \nhave accused. The bill transfers all of the OES's oceans-related \nresponsibilities to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. That seems reasonable.\n  The bill does not reassign many of OES's other core functions, such \nas climate change, deforestation, et cetera. This is because the \nCommerce, Justice, State Subcommittee does not have jurisdiction over \nthe agencies responsible for these activities. It is not our place to \nsay that the EPA Administrator should negotiate climate change treaties \non behalf of the United States since the State Department can't seem to \nmanage to do it.\n\n  The committee has received quiet praise from a range of groups, from \nindustry to NGOs, on the elimination of this office. These groups share \nour frustration with the OES's inability, and sometimes unwillingness, \nto do its job in what we consider to be an effective manner and have \ncongratulated the committee on its decision to move OES functions to \nagencies that actually care about and have expertise in issues such as \nendangered turtles, lumber imports, and global climate change.\n\n[[Page S13759]]\n\n  What is the root of the committee's frustration with the OES? OES has \ncontravened statutory requirements to seek binding international \ntreaties on endangered sea turtles and shark finning. On trade issues, \nOES has consistently pressed a U.S. position that sacrifices the \nenvironmental and conservation agenda. It is important to note that \nthings were no better under prior administrations.\n  Finally, there is widespread frustration with the lack of expertise \nand institutional knowledge of the OES negotiators due to State's \npolicy of constantly rotating Foreign Service officers. Simply put, the \ncommittee got tired of being ignored by OES, and the Congress should \nalso be tired of this.\n  This year, the committee decided to take action. The action taken was \nconstructive. It reassigned these important functions to people who \nactually understand the issues and who are willing to pursue them.\n  Further, the State Department's appeal letter objects to the bill's \ninclusion of $52 million for the Center for Anti-Terrorism and Security \nTraining. The CAST facility would allow the Department to consolidate \ntraining for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Anti-Terrorism \nAssistance Program.\n  The Department requested $52 million for this project in fiscal year \n2003. The House objected, and the Department ultimately did not receive \nthe funding last year. In light of this, the committee included the $52 \nmillion in fiscal year 2004. It was assumed that if the Department had \nrequested the funds in fiscal year 2003 it would then want them to be \nincluded in the fiscal year 2004 funding. However, the Department's \nappeal letter objects to their inclusion this year.\n  The State Department's inconsistency on this matter leads one to \nseriously question the processes by which it determines its budgetary \npriorities. In my humble opinion, they do need a center where they are \nable to train their Bureau of Diplomatic Security people, who have \nexpanded radically in number over the last few years. State's \ninconsistency on this matter is hard to understand. State's complaints \nabout the decisions of this committee are rather bold, given this \ninconsistency.\n  The Department's appeal letter next objects to the bill's inclusion \nof $40 million for security enhancements for so-called soft targets. \nThese funds are intended to be used to pay for security enhancements \nsuch as guards, shatter-resistant windows, emergency warning systems, \nand bollards at staff housing and American schools overseas. I started \nthis initiative in the fiscal year 2003 budget. A total $15 million was \nincluded in that bill, along with language drawing particular attention \nto the security needs of our overseas schools. Or at least I thought \n$15 million was included in the bill.\n  The State Department has recently informed the committee that it has \nchosen to interpret this figure as $15 million over 3 years, not $15 \nmillion for each of 3 years as the committee intended. And since the \nactual funding level for the soft target initiative will fall $10 \nmillion below what was envisioned for fiscal year 2003, the fiscal year \n2004 level will have to be at least $25 million to meet the goal.\n  The Department has argued that $40 million is too much for this \nprogram. It is the committee's position that this is the right amount, \nespecially since the Department appears to be playing budget games with \nthis important initiative. It is extremely disheartening, in light of \nthe pledges given to us by leadership at the State Department, that \nthey would now try to decrease this funding to protect soft targets.\n  Some of us are personally very committed to making sure that, when \nour Foreign Service people go overseas and take their families with \nthem, we give those families reasonable protection. It appears the \nDepartment, perhaps, is not.\n  The Department's appeal letter objects to the bill's inclusion of \nlanguage limiting the number of personnel working in U.S. Embassies in \nParis, France, and Berlin, Germany. The letter states: ``This micro-\nmanagement circumvents the Department's right-sizing plan process''.\n  The bill includes caps on personnel because, as discussed earlier, \nthe Department has no right-sizing process in place. And our Embassies \nin Paris and Berlin are a living--and growing--testament to this. I \naddressed this problem of right-sizing earlier, and I will not belabor \nthe point.\n  There are a couple of factors that led the committee to choose Paris \nand Berlin as the places to begin this mandatory right-sizing. The U.S. \nEmbassy in Paris has grown so large that the post now occupies several \nannexes throughout the city in addition to the primary Embassy \nbuilding. Recently, the Department requested to utilize $25 million to \nrenovate a building into which personnel from other annexes could be \nconsolidated. As if the $25 million price tag weren't bad enough, \nshortly after State made this request the committee discovered that the \nroof of the building had collapsed. State continued to push for \napproval of the funds to renovate the dilapidated building--right up \nuntil both the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees denied \nthis request.\n\n  As far as Berlin is concerned, the committee had originally been told \nthat the new embassy building planned for the historic Pariser Platz \nsite would have to be smaller than normal, due to the small size of the \nproperty--about 1.5 acres. This is how State justified to the committee \nthe cost of purchasing and renovating an ample new consular compound in \nFrankfurt, Germany. State's rationale was--and the committee agreed--\nthat if the embassy building in Berlin had to be smaller than \nnecessary, some personnel could be transferred to what was to become a \n``regional hub'' in Frankfurt.\n  A little under a year ago, the State Department informed the \ncommittee that the Berlin building would actually be much larger than \nnormal. In fact, the new embassy building envisioned for Berlin is a \n24,000 square meter colossus, what the Department terms a ``special \nproject.'' The result is that we have an enormous ``regional hub'' \ncompound in Frankfurt and a supersized embassy building in Berlin. The \nconvoluted history of the Berlin project leads one to question whether \nthe State Department takes the concept of right-sizing seriously at \nall.\n  The Department's letter also criticizes the bill for reducing the \nfunding level of the Berlin project by $70 million. The Berlin project, \nunlike all of the other capital projects requested in fiscal year 2004, \nis not driven by security needs. The bill redirects this $70 million to \nconstruction of a new consulate building in Karachi, Pakistan. The \ndesign/construction phase for Karachi was not scheduled to begin until \nfiscal year 2005. However, given the current security situation in \nPakistan, the committee felt it should begin as soon as possible.\n  Employees of the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi have come under \nattack on four separate occasions during the last decade. On two such \noccasions, the consulate building itself was attacked. The most recent \nattack occurred in February, 2003, when a gunman opened fire on the \nlocal police assigned to the consulate. In light of this, the committee \ndecided that our consulate in Karachi was in urgent need of \nreconstruction. Shrinking the size of an already-too-large building in \nBerlin, Germany, seemed like a very reasonable price to pay for a badly \nneeded security construction project in Pakistan. It is the committee's \npolicy to address the security needs of our embassies and consulates \noverseas before constructing buildings that are desirable for \nhistorical and cultural reasons.\n  The Department's appeal letter criticizes the bill for not providing \nfull funding for the U.S. payment to the United Nations. The difference \nbetween the requested amount of $1 billion and the recommendation of \n$922 million can be explained by the committee's decision not to \nprovide the requested funds for the United States to rejoin UNESCO. \nHowever, the Department may not be aware of this, but we have had \nsignificant discussions with the White House and members of the \nadministration, and I fully expect we will be funding UNESCO.\n  Another factor contributing to the ``cut'' to this account was the \ncommittee's decision not to provide the funds for the United States \nshare of the costs of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. The House bill \ncontains a provision that would withhold funds for this U.N. body as \nwell. The U.N. Human Rights Commission is notorious because it is\n\n[[Page S13760]]\n\nchaired by Libya and boasts such members as Sudan, Cuba, and Zimbabwe. \nHuman Rights Watch this year called the U.N. Human Rights Commission: \n``An abusers club of governments hostile to human rights.''\n  The U.N. Human Rights Commission ignores the real human rights \nviolators. No resolution in the history of the commission has ever been \npassed on states such as Syria, China, Saudi Arabia or Zimbabwe. The \ncommission has not addressed gross and systematic human rights abuses \nin countries such as Bahrain, Chad, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Saudi \nArabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. The \nCommission is a platform for Israel-bashing. It has spent more time on \nIsrael than any other country. Eleven percent of its total substantive \nmeeting time has been spent on Israel alone, while 24 percent of its \ntime has been spent on all other U.N. states combined.\n  Lastly and most alarmingly, the U.N. Human Rights Commission is being \nused as a forum for the expression of values and positions that run \ncompletely counter to America's own. One member state objected to the \ninclusion of language calling cross amputation ``cruel, inhuman and \ndegrading treatment'' on the grounds that it was an offense to all \nMuslim countries. The Commission has also adopted a resolution \naffirming the legitimacy of ``all available means,'' including suicide-\nbombing, ``to resist foreign occupation and for self-determination.'' \nAt one meeting, the Libyan Chairman shouted that the U.S. war against \nterror showed that the U.S. ``despised humanity.''\n  Should we stand by as American tax dollars are allowed to flow to \nsuch an organization? The House of Representatives doesn't think so. \nThe Senate Appropriations Committee didn't think so. Apparently, the \nDepartment of State thinks so.\n  The last portion of the ``cut'' to this account is explained by the \nbill's discontinuation of funding for a number of the smaller \ninternational organizations. In the past, the committee has directed \nthe State Department to review the list of smaller international \norganizations to which the United States belongs to determine which of \nthese may no longer be worthwhile for the United States. State has not \ndone so. This year, the committee began making eliminations. The \ncommittee gave the State Department the chance to review the list \nitself, but it did not act.\n\n  The Department's appeal letter criticizes the bill for not providing \nfull funding for the U.S. share of the cost of United Nations \npeacekeeping missions. The bill provides only $483 million for \npeacekeeping while the request was $550 million. This, the State \nDepartment correctly points out, is a difference of $67 million.\n  What the Department's appeal letter does not acknowledge is that, on \nSeptember 30, 2003, the committee approved a reprogramming providing \nthat $100 million in this account would be carried forward to fiscal \nyear 2004. The result of this? State is not going to have a $67 million \nshortfall, it is going to have a $33 million windfall.\n  The State Department knew this $100 million in carryover would be \navailable when they wrote their appeal letter. They knew that the \nSenate CJS bill assumed that ample carryover funding would be \navailable. This is the most egregious part of the Department's appeal \nletter. It is an outright fabrication.\n  But let's turn to the real issues. The report accompanying the fiscal \nyear 2004 bill directs the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \nto complete its work by 2004 and the International Criminal Tribunal \nfor the Former Yugoslavia to complete its work by 2006. Both ICTY and \nICTR have been criticized for being slow and unprofessional, for having \ninadequate staff, for the passivity of their judges, and for their \ninsufficient oversight of expenditures and employees. The Department of \nState itself has criticized these tribunals for their shortcomings. For \nthese reasons, the Senate report includes language urging the U.N. to \ndevelop an exit strategy for these Tribunals.\n  The committee's disappointment in the performance of the Yugoslavia \nand Rwanda Tribunals had little to do, however, with the level of \nfunding they received (about one-third of the requested amount). This \nfunding decision had more to do with the fact that the bills for these \n2 Tribunals--that is, the amount the U.N. assesses to the United States \neach year--have been much lower than anticipated for the past few \nyears. The State Department has, for several years, budgeted about \ntwice what it really needed to pay the U.S.'s bills for the Yugoslavia \nand Rwanda Tribunals. In light of this year's low allocation, we \ndecided to hold back these funds and use them elsewhere. State recently \nestimated that the bills for fiscal year 2004 would come in at just \naround the requested level. The committee will likely adjust this level \nupwards in conference, since it is not interested in creating new U.S. \narrears without a compelling reason. But it is important to note that \nthe low Senate level for the Tribunals resulted from State's own \nbudgetary ineptitude.\n  State was quick to lash out at the committee for not providing full \nfunding for the Yugoslavia and Rwanda War Crimes Tribunals. Yet, State \nitself is withholding funds for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The \nSpecial Court is assigned the task of prosecuting those who committed \natrocities during Sierra Leone's gruesome civil war. In fiscal year \n2003, Congress appropriated $10 million for the Special Court. State \nrefused to provide the entire $10 million, in a blatant disregard of \ncongressional intent. The Chief Prosecutor for Sierra Leone has told \nthe committee that without the additional $5 million, the Special Court \nmay have to shut down as early as February.\n  The Department has criticized this bill for trimming down what, in \npast years, was a grossly inflated budget for the U.N.-run tribunals \nwhile denies the United States- and British-led tribunals its promised \nfunding. This inconsistency is worrisome.\n  The Department also objects to report language under peacekeeping \nthat directs the United Nations to develop an exit strategy for the \nU.N. Peacekeeping force in Cyprus. The reason for this language is \nsimple. It is not fair for U.S. taxpayers to have to pay for missions \nin countries that are on the cusp of joining the European Union.\n  The last two years have seen the U.S. take on tremendous new global \nresponsibilities, with Afghanistan and Iraq representing the largest. \nThe U.S. cannot afford to keep taking on new missions if its existing \nmissions never go away. The U.N. mission to Cyprus began in 1964, 39 \nyears ago. The State Department needs to use the U.S.' voice in the \nSecurity Council to ensure that U.N. peacekeeping missions are held to \nsome sort of reasonable time frame.\n  The Department also objects to the bill's failure to include language \nallowing it to carry over 15 percent of the fiscal year 2004 \npeacekeeping appropriations into fiscal year 2005. As I mentioned \nearlier, the peacekeeping bills have been coming in much lower than \nexpected. In fiscal year 2004, the Department's peacekeeping \nappropriation was $167 million above what it actually needed. Assuming \nthis trend continues, the Department's request to carry over 15 percent \nof its peacekeeping appropriations is the equivalent of an advanced \nappropriation, something which the subcommittee of which I am chairman \nhas tried to avoid. As a rule, the committee does not provide advanced \nappropriations since they take funding decisions away from the elected \nrepresentatives of the people and hand it over to the agencies. This is \nsimply a matter of policy and proper management.\n  The Department's appeal letter further criticizes the bill for not \nproviding full funding for Educational and Cultural Exchanges, but the \nDepartment's appeal letter does not tell the whole story. In fiscal \nyear 2004, the Office of Management and Budget decided to move the \nformer Soviet exchange programs, at a cost of approximately $100 \nmillion, over to the Commerce-State-Justice Subcommittee from the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee. This maneuver was intended to make \nroom for the expanded Middle East exchange programs in the Foreign \nOperations budget. This was an OMB initiative. Whether or not one \nagrees that these programs belong in Commerce-Justice-State, there were \nsimply not enough funds in the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation to \nabsorb them.\n  The committee has always generously supported the exchanges. They\n\n[[Page S13761]]\n\nare one part of the State Department's public diplomacy program that \nconsistently produces good results, but even the committee has to \nquestion whether, if the former Soviet exchanges are no longer a high \npriority area for the United States--which the administration's budget \nsignals they are not--then their funding needs to be reduced and they \nneed to be folded into an existing exchange program under Commerce-\nJustice-State. OMB and the State Department should be committed, as I \nam, to reprioritizing rather than simply adding more and programs. In \nany event, OMB should not act unilaterally, creating an impossible \nsituation for the subcommittee given its low allocation, and then, with \nthe State Department, write a letter complaining about it.\n  The Department's appeal letter further objects to language in the \nbill designed to prevent the State Department from making a \nreprogramming request more than once. The committee decided to include \nthis language after the Department requested to reprogram funding for \nthe same project five times. In this particular instance, the committee \ndenied the Department's request to utilize Commerce-Justice-State \nfunding to construct two USAID annexes. The committee's position has \nalways been that the Commerce-Justice-State Subcommittee should not \nhave to build buildings for agencies over which it does not have any \noversight. Seems reasonable to us.\n  The USAID's operating budget does not fall under the jurisdiction of \nCommerce-Justice-State and, thus, this subcommittee has no way of \nensuring that USAID is managing its funds wisely, that its requests for \nnew buildings are legitimate, and that all of the personnel it places \nin these buildings are needed in those buildings. Moreover, separating \nUSAID's building function from the oversight of its own appropriators--\nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee--allows USAID to escape \naccountability for its capital program, which is not good budgeting \nprocedure.\n  The State Department apparently has failed to grasp this concept that \nwhen the committee says no it means no.\n  The Department's appeal letter further objects to language in the \nbill requiring the Department to submit the U.N.'s budget along with \nits own budget to the committee.\n\n  The regular dues of the United States to the U.N. are paid through \nthe Commerce-Justice-State bill. In the fiscal year 2004, these dues \nwill amount to $1 billion for the U.N. regular payments and $550 \nmillion for peacekeeping, for a total of $1.5 billion of American tax \ndollars. This amount represents almost 20 percent of the entire State \nDepartment account, yet none of these funds--none of these funds--are \njustified in any meaningful way or any meaningful detail to the \ncommittee. All this bill language does is allow the committee to see \nfor what this $1.5 billion is being used.\n  The Department's appeal letter says it would be ``impractical'' for \nState to submit the U.N.'s budget to the subcommittee. I don't see why. \nFurthermore, the Department's letter states that the fact the committee \nhas requested to receive the U.N.'s budget ``suggests that the \ncommittee would intend to exercise oversight over the U.N. budget to \nthe same degree that it does over other accounts in the President's \nbudget request.'' This, of course, is preposterous and inaccurate. The \ncommittee could never exercise this kind of oversight over the U.N. \nbudget. The U.N. is an independent international organization. The \ncommittee can't make the U.N. do anything. Only the Security Council \ncan make the U.N. do something.\n  All this language does is ensure the committee is able to account for \nthe expenditures of U.S. tax dollars. The Appropriations Committee is \ngiven the responsibility by the Constitution and by the taxpayers of \nthe United States to make sure their tax dollars are being spent \neffectively and to know where their tax dollars are going. It seems \nreasonable that we should at least get an accounting from the U.N. of \nhow $1.5 billion is being spent, and that is all we are seeking.\n  The State Department's appeal letter further objects to language \nincluded in the bill that provides for an automatic transfer of funding \nin the event of a visa fee shortfall. The Department's Border Security \nProgram--essentially its consular operations--is funded exclusively \nfrom revenue generated through the Machine Readable Visa Fee Program. \nSince September 11, the number of visa applications to the United \nStates has declined dramatically. This has created a shortfall in \nexcess of $100 million in the Department's Border Security Program. \nThis has obvious national security implications.\n  The Department has been aware of this problem for more than a year \nnow. The committee has asked the Department several times to propose a \ncomprehensive solution to this problem. In the absence of a solution, \nthe committee vowed to transfer funds from the Department's main \noperating account to cover the shortfall. Consequently, the committee \nincluded language in the fiscal year 2004 bill that provides just such \na safety mechanism--an automatic transfer of funds--to ensure that \nfunding shortfalls do not disrupt the Department's critical Border \nSecurity operation.\n  For the record, the committee has still not received a proposal from \nthe State Department. The Department's current ad hoc system for \naddressing funding shortfalls in the Border Security Program is \nunacceptable. The Department leaves the committee little choice but to \ninsist that this language be carried forward in the report.\n  The Department's appeal letter objects to language included in the \nbill that would withhold funds for any U.N. peacekeeping mission that \nplaces U.S. troops under the command of a foreign national. This \nlanguage is part of a larger debate over the International Criminal \nCourt. Identical language was included in last year's Commerce-Justice-\nState conference report, which passed both the Senate and the House. \nThe House included identical language this year. Congress has spoken on \nthis matter and the matter rests as it is. Why the State Department \nwould write such an inflammatory letter now claiming that this language \nis inappropriate is beyond my understanding, especially given the \nhistory of this language.\n  The Department's appeal letter objects to the language included in \nthe report requiring the Department to demonstrate that consolidation \nof its payroll system would result in a savings for the American \ntaxpayer. What an outrageous idea that we should ask the State \nDepartment to prove that something they are planning will save money, \nand then actually have them show us how it does save money.\n  There is also report language requiring the Department to submit a \nreprogramming before it obligates any funding for payroll \nconsolidation. Last January, the Office of Management and Budget \nannounced an initiative to consolidate the Federal payroll system. It \nis estimated that this consolidation will reduce the number of agencies \nprocessing employee checks from 22 to 4, which could save the taxpayers \nup to $1 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The committee is very supportive of this initiative. However, State's \npayroll needs are very different from the payroll needs of domestic \nagencies. The State Department currently pays over 25,000 Americans \nboth domestically and overseas and over 35,000 local national employees \nin 180 different countries biweekly in local currencies.\n  The purpose of this report language is to ensure that if any payroll \nconsolidation takes place at the State Department, that State's unique \nneeds are met.\n  The committee has a right to exercise oversight over these funds. In \nfact, it is our obligation to do so, and I would think that State would \nencourage it rather than resist it.\n  The Department's appeal letter objects to report language that \nrequires the Department to move the Office of Foreign Missions out of \nthe Bureau of Diplomatic Security to the Bureau of Management. The \nOffice of Foreign Missions was created to review and control the \noperations of foreign missions in the United States and to administer \nthe benefits available to them. The Office of Foreign Missions was \noriginally invented as a stand-alone office under the Secretary of \nState. In 1996, however, the office was moved to the Bureau of \nDiplomatic Security. The person who was then the director of the office \ntook OFM with him when he was appointed head of Diplomatic Security.\n\n[[Page S13762]]\n\n  The committee's reason for including this report language is \nstraightforward. We have talked to several foreign ambassadors who say \nthe Office of Foreign Missions acts as though its primary mission is to \npolice foreign missions rather than assist them. We have even had \nforeign diplomats tell us that they feel as though the Office of \nForeign Missions treats them like ``criminals''. This is unacceptable. \nI am certain this penchant for heavyhandedness can be explained by the \nOffice of Foreign Missions' being housed in the Department's security \nbranch.\n  For the second year in a row, the committee has asked the Department \nto consider moving the office back. The language was ignored the first \ntime and hopefully we can get it to work this time.\n  The appeal letter objects to report language that directs the \nDepartment not to grant visas to any person caught trafficking in \nlooted Iraqi antiquities. It objects to that language. This language \nsays, essentially, that anyone found to be responsible for looting and \ndamaging Iraq's historical and culturally significant works is barred \nfrom receiving a U.S. visa.\n  U.S. visas are not a right. They are a privilege. Any person who \nattempts to profit from the misfortune of the Iraqi people should lose \nthis privilege. Why the State Department opposes this is beyond us. It \nis especially disconcerting that the Department objects to this \nlanguage in the context of an inflammatory letter that questions this \ncommittee's commitment to national security.\n  The appeal letter objects to report language requiring that children \nover the age of 1 be present for the adjudication of a U.S. passport. \nThis minor change in Department policy, though admittedly an \ninconvenience for passport applicants, would help prevent international \nchild abductions. Currently, State Department regulations do not \nrequire children under the age of 14 to appear personally when passport \napplications are made on their behalf. As a result, passport fraud \ninvolving the substitution of photographs of one child for another is \nregrettably common.\n  The committee included this language following a Department of State \nInspector General's report that recommended precisely this policy \nchange. By law, State Department bureaus are required to respond to the \nrecommendations contained in an Inspector General's report. On July 8, \n2003, the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs sent a memo \nto the Inspector General stating that she not only concurs with the \nIG's recommendation, but is implementing it. This is good news. But one \nwonders why State is attacking us for suggesting it in our bill.\n  Included in the appeal letter is an objection to report language \ndirecting the Department to construct a new office building in \nKingston, Jamaica, instead of utilizing an existing building for both \npost housing and embassy functions. The committee was under the \nimpression this plan also was already being implemented by the Bureau \nof Overseas Building Operations. Perhaps we could get some further \nclarification. It would have been better if the Department had engaged \nus in a constructive dialogue, rather than sending such a letter.\n  The appeal letter objects to the report language requiring the U.S. \nRepresentative to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, OECD, to submit OECD reports to the committee prior to \ntheir release. OECD already submits these reports to its member states. \nThe State Department, on behalf of the United States, is responsible \nfor approving these reports before they are released.\n\n  Last year, OECD released a report that dealt with a particular U.S. \ndomestic issue which at the time was being debated in the Congress. The \nOECD report was not intended to coincide with the congressional action \non the particular matter. However, the release of the report \nnevertheless unduly influenced congressional debate on the matter. Such \nscenarios must be prevented in the future and this is precisely what \nthis report language seeks to address.\n  The committee's position on this matter appears to have been \nsubstantiated by the recent release of an OECD report that made \nrecommendations on another politically sensitive issue currently being \ndebated by the Congress: vouchers. While in this instance the OECD \nrecommendation was in line with my own views and position, I suspect \nthe opponents of my position, or others who do not agree with the \napproach to choice and vouchers, might take issue with the OECD's \ntiming. The report language merely states the Congress too shall have \nopportunities to review the list of OECD reports before they are \nreleased. State has twice failed to exercise discretion that should \nhave led it to disapprove reports that inappropriately influenced \ncongressional action. This report language would try to prevent that \nsort of failure on their part in the future.\n  That is a fairly comprehensive response to almost every point in this \nletter, except the overall funding levels, which brings me back to the \nlanguage of the original letter. This is the language which the \nSecretary of State has directed at the Senate and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. He says in this letter, which I think I have \nresponded to in a very factual and reasonably understated way, that the \nbill passed by the full Appropriations Committee would adversely affect \nU.S. foreign policy and national security interests, undermine the \nmanagement of the Department, is unconstitutional, misstates the legal \nrequirements of the reprogramming process, and raises separation of \npowers concerns.\n  I think it is excessive when the Secretary of State and his \nDepartment wave the bloody shirt of national security at the Senate as \na way of attacking a bill they object to for policy and funding \nreasons.\n  To say that I and other members of the Appropriations Committee would \nadversely affect national security interests at a time like this is an \nattack that is highly inappropriate, certainly not diplomatic, and that \nis inconsistent with the facts. As I have pointed out, the letter State \nhas sent us is inaccurate in many areas. It is a disagreement on \npolicies which are reasonable and should have been debated in a \nreasonable context.\n  So unlike the Justice Department, which sent us a very matter-of-fact \nand I thought appropriate, thoughtful letter outlining what their \nconcerns were, and unlike the Commerce Department, which was pretty \nhappy with our bill, the State Department has decided to raise this to \na higher level of antipathy. I think it is a mistake, and I think the \nrecord will speak for itself when this letter is reviewed in the \ncontext of the facts as I have outlined them.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I certainly \nhave no problem with the Senator speaking. But we are on limited time. \nI ask that the time the Senator from Virginia is going to use apply to \nthe 3 hours that are available under the control of the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Senator Allen are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the conference report \nproviding supplemental funding for our operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I will support the conference report because I believe we cannot \nabandon\n\n[[Page S13763]]\n\neither Iraq or Afghanistan prior to ensuring that both countries are \nbecoming free, democratic, and stable societies. We are asking our men \nand women in uniform to put their lives on the line to accomplish this \nmission. Their sacrifices must not be in vain. We have an obligation to \nensure that our troops receive the resources needed to do their jobs as \nsafely and as effectively as possible. This bill will help to \naccomplish that goal.\n  Terrorists operating in Iraq are actively working with the remnants \nof Saddam Hussein's regime against the establishment of a democratic \ngovernment in Iraq. Every time a bomb explodes, we face a test, a test \nof our resolve to stay and finish the job. It is not easy to stay the \ncourse when our American troops are dying and getting wounded. But to \nwalk away from Iraq would hand these terrorists a victory. To walk away \nfrom Iraq now would abandon innocent Iraqis to yet another \nauthoritarian regime that oppresses human rights and threatens the \nentire region.\n  Three-quarters of the funding in this bill will help provide our \nsoldiers with the tools they need to get the job done as safely and \neffectively as possible. The bill includes additional personnel and \nhealth care support, much-needed protective equipment, such as body \narmor and fortified Humvees that will help keep our troops safer, and \nfunding for expanded military operations to pursue terrorists globally. \nThe bill also provides $18.6 billion to build a modern infrastructure \nfor Iraq and to strengthen security forces. Basic services are a \nfundamental building block of a modern country. As we recently \nexperienced with Hurricane Isabel, the lack of reliable electricity and \nclean water supplies can disrupt the most modern functioning of \nsocieties. That, obviously, was a very small-scale disruption compared \nto what is being experienced in present-day Iraq.\n  I agree with the administration's proposal that we must focus on \nbuilding an infrastructure. When I visited Iraq in July, I was struck \nby how little damage to the infrastructure was caused by the war. Our \nprecision targeting spared the bridges and much of the infrastructure \nof this country, but nevertheless the infrastructure is in shambles.\n  It is in shambles because of the decades of personal greed and \nneglect of Saddam Hussein. So building a modern infrastructure for Iraq \nis critical to helping this country get back on its feet as a \nfunctioning economy and a modern society.\n  Despite my support for the goal of building an infrastructure, I want \nto make very clear that I am very disappointed that the conferees \ndropped a Senate provision I offered with many of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Bayh, Ensign, Nelson, and Graham. That provision \nwould have provided for half of the money to be used for the \ninfrastructure rebuilding in the form of a long-term loan to Iraq. Both \nthe Senate and the House expressed strong bipartisan support for this \napproach. I continue to strongly believe there are ways to structure \nour reconstruction assistance that would provide the Iraqi people with \nthe assistance they need, when they need it, while lessening the long-\nterm impact on the American taxpayers.\n  We should make Iraq a partner in this rebuilding venture, not simply \nthe recipient of our goodwill. Iraq has abundant human and economic \nresources to enable it to shoulder some of the responsibility for its \nown future. It has been pointed out many times--but perhaps it bears \nrepeating--that Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world. \nThe administration has estimated that within 2 years Iraq will be \ngenerating $20 billion in annual oil revenue. With such an economic \ncapability, Iraq undoubtedly will have the financial resources to repay \nthis loan one day.\n  I recognize--I emphasize--the need for help in the short term, but \nsurely our taxpayers could be partially repaid in the long term.\n  The American people are very generous. They understand that Iraq \nneeds our help right now. But in the long term, we will be better off \nif we act in partnership with the Iraqi people, giving them a sense of \nownership in their own infrastructure by working with them, lending \nmoney to them, and by making this a shared responsibility.\n  Let me point out that the World Bank and the IMF have pledged money \nin the form of loans at the recent donors conference. Although they \nattached some conditions to the establishment of a loan program, these \ninternational financial institutions clearly believe that administering \nloans to Iraq is doable and that the country will have the capacity to \nrepay this money in the future.\n  Finally, I remain very troubled that the status of Iraq's \npreliberation foreign debt remains unclear. Saudi Arabia, France, \nGermany, and Russia should not be repaid for debts incurred by Saddam \nHussein while the United States invests billions of its own dollars in \nreclaiming the country for the Iraqi people. Indeed, if the leaders of \nthree of those nations had had their way, Iraq would still be suffering \nunder the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. The American taxpayer will \nbe justifiably furious if one dime of his money goes even indirectly to \nrepaying the debts incurred by Saddam Hussein.\n  As we go forward with the distribution of the aid provided by this \nbill, it is critical that the administration continue to vigorously \npursue an international agreement that will ensure that the holders of \nSaddam-era debt will not seek repayment. American taxpayers' money \nsimply cannot be used, even indirectly, to repay the dirty debts of a \ndictator. That was another advantage of our loan proposal. It would \nhave made it very far less likely that that could occur.\n  This is particularly important after the donors conference made \ncrystal clear that many wealthy nations, such as Saudi Arabia, France, \nand Germany, are apparently unwilling to donate any significant sums to \nthe rebuilding cause.\n  Despite my reservations, I believe this package will pave the way to \nthe day when our soldiers finally come home from Iraq. We must not \nwaiver in our mission to eliminate terrorism and bring democracy and \nstability to Iraq and to the Middle East. I hope we will continue to \nconsider ways we can achieve this goal that are fair to the American \ntaxpayers and that recognize the need for a shared partnership with the \nIraqi people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized to speak for up \nto 10 minutes with the time coming from the time previously allotted to \nSenator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed in the conference outcome \non the emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan \nSecurity and Reconstruction. I had hoped that the conferees would have \nfollowed the Senate's decision to provide one-half of the funding for \nIraqi reconstruction as a loan, which could become a grant only if 90 \npercent of Iraq's bilateral debt was forgiven. A loan would have given \nthe Iraqis a stake in the reconstruction of their own country, which is \nimportant, I believe, for them and for us.\n  Beyond that issue, I am also disappointed at the administration's \nresponse thus far to a proposal most recently made by the October \npresiding officer of the Iraqi Governing Council, Iyad Alawi, in an \nopinion piece in the New York Times on Sunday, October 19. I wrote to \nSecretary Rumsfeld on October 22 to bring Mr. Alawi's proposal that \nIraqi Army units be recalled at the mid-officer level and below to his \nattention and to ask that he consider it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Secretary Rumsfeld be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Last week I discussed the proposal with Ambassador Bremer, \nand I urged him to raise this issue with the entire Iraqi Governing \nCouncil. Last Friday, I discussed the issue further on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The conference report before us contains $3.2 billion for Iraqi \nsecurity and\n\n[[Page S13764]]\n\nlaw enforcement, and an additional $1.3 billion for justice, public \nsafety infrastructure, and civil society. Included in those amounts is \nfunding for the Iraqi police, border patrol, facilities protection \nservices, the Iraqi civil defense corps, and the New Iraqi Army. While \nI strongly support that funding, I again call upon Secretary Rumsfeld \nand Ambassador Bremer to consider reassembling the units--and I \nemphasize units--of the Iraqi Army, and I call upon them further to ask \nthe Governing Council in Iraq, which we established, for their advice \nand recommendations on the wisdom of reassembling units of the Iraqi \nArmy.\n  The security situation is too serious for us to stand on ceremony. \nThe decision of May 15 to disband the Iraqi Army may turn out to be a \nmajor mistake. The decision made on May 15 was against the advice of a \nstudy conducted under the aegis of the Department of State. It resulted \nin a significant Iraqi security force being tossed to the wind.\n  The major reason given by the Department of Defense for not \nreconstituting the Iraqi Army is that the army melted away when we \nattacked. But that happened because most of its members did not want to \nlay down their lives for Saddam Hussein. In fact, it was because Saddam \nHussein knew the Iraqi Army might not fight for him that he created his \nspecial security forces.\n  The fact that the Iraqi Army would not fight for Saddam is one of the \nreasons we should consider reconstituting it. It is surely not a reason \nfor not doing so.\n  Let me be clear, it is the units of the Iraqi Army about which I am \ntalking. The administration's response to this proposal--that they are \nalready signing up members of the Iraqi Army--is disingenuous. While \nthey are using individual members for various security functions, the \nNew Iraqi Army they are creating from scratch currently has fewer than \n1,000 members.\n  We cannot afford to transfer security functions to Iraqis at that \nslow a pace. Americans are the target of more and more deadly attacks. \nThe quicker we get the Iraqi Army back in place, the more security we \nare likely to have and the better off Iraq will be.\n  Nobody suggests that the Baathist army officers be reinstated. The \nproposal is that mid-level officers and below be called back and that \nthey be vetted to rid their number of those who committed crimes under \nthe old regime.\n  When I personally urged Ambassador Bremer last week to consider doing \nso, I further asked him to commit to taking up this issue with the \nIraqi Governing Council. His reply was ambiguous, and that will not do \nin this extremely dangerous situation.\n  Ambassador Bremer is running Iraq at this time, to the extent that \nanyone is, but that doesn't give him a monopoly on wisdom. We are not \nsmarter than everybody else in the world, particularly about other \ncountries and their traditions and cultures. We should consult with the \nIraqis who are presently carrying out governing functions.\n  In issuing Coalition Provisional Authority Regulation No. 6 last July \n13, Ambassador Bremer specifically committed to ``consult and \ncoordinate on all matters involving the temporary governance of Iraq'' \nwith the Iraqi Governing Council. He should do so urgently, and he \nshould do so visibly if we truly believe Iraq can become a democratic \nstate. The judgment of the Governing Council on this issue may not be \nunanimous, but it is relevant.\n  There is another reason to consider shifting course. Today, the Iraqi \nArmy is being paid a lot of money to do nothing--$25 million a month. \nWe know who the officers and the noncommissioned officers are and where \nthey live. Many of them are probably frustrated and angry because they \nbelieved they were serving their country by refusing to fight for \nSaddam.\n  The stubborn refusal to reconsider decisions will not do in the \ndangerous security situation we face in Iraq. Stubbornly staying the \ncourse we set when we disbanded the Iraqi Army, instead of considering \nchanging course to improve the security situation, cannot be tolerated. \nWe do not need confessions of error. What we do need is a willingness \nto try some new approaches. At the top of the list should be to \nreconsider the May 15 decision to disband the Iraqi Army and, as part \nof that process, to involve the Iraqi Governing Council in \nreconsidering that decision.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: Attached is a copy of an OP-ED piece \n     from the Sunday, October 19, 2003 edition of the New York \n     Times written by Iyad Alawi, the president of the Iraqi \n     Governing Council for the month of October.\n       This highly-significant article calls for the call up of \n     the Iraqi Army at least up to the mid-officer level, with \n     appropriate vetting by the Coalition and the Iraqi Interior \n     Ministry, as a way of more quickly relieving the burden on \n     American troops and replacing them with Iraqi soldiers who \n     have credibility and legitmacy with the Iraqi people.\n       Since it appears that, despite the adoption of a new UN \n     resolution on Iraq, there are unlikely to be large numbers of \n     additional foreign troops made available for duty with the \n     Coalition, Mr. Alawi's proposal strikes me as worthy of \n     serious consideration.\n       I would welcome an opportunity to discuss this matter with \n     you personally and, in any event, would solicit your views on \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n       Enclosure.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for up to 20 minutes, this time coming from the \ntime previously allotted to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, I come to acknowledge my ``Cambodian moment'' in the \nIraq war. I refer to the Cambodian moment that Senator Mansfield \nexperienced after years and years of opposing the war in Vietnam. He \nhad a practice of taking written memoranda time and again to both \nPresidents Johnson and Nixon, supporting the President openly on the \nfloor of the Senate, but finally at the time Cambodia was invaded under \nPresident Nixon, he could not take it any longer and spoke out.\n  He went on national TV and said: This war was a mistake from the get \ngo. The next day, he got a letter from an admirer who had just lost her \nson. She said: I just buried my son and came home and watched you on \nthis program. You said it was a mistake from the get go. Why didn't you \nspeak out sooner?\n  She said: My regret is that you did not speak out sooner or loudly \nenough for me to hear.\n  It is time we speak out, because unless we are going to put in \n100,000 or 150,000 more United States troops and get law and order in \nIraq, in Baghdad, we are going to have operation meat grinder continue, \nand it is our meat.\n  In conscience, I cannot stand silent any longer. What happens if we \nhad invaded the city of Atlanta, let's say. We had landed at Hartsfield \nAirport, and then we had gone on to an aircraft carrier and said: \nWhoopee, mission accomplished; when the truth of the matter is, two \ndivisions of Republican Guards have blended into the environs of \nAtlanta with all kind of ammunition dumps, and all they do day in and \nday out is raid the dumps, set traps, blow us up, kill more Americans, \nand we talk about schools opening and hospitals working, and that we \nhave a water system. This cannot go on. It has to stop.\n  Let me start by saying I believe, unlike most of my colleagues, that \nthe intelligence we had on Iraq was sound. We knew from the outset a \nlot about Iraq in the sense we had conquered it and we had two \noverflights, one in the north and one in the south. We had to look down \nand see in the middle of Iraq. For 10 years we knew exactly what was \ngoing on. If we had any doubts, we could check with the Israeli \nintelligence. Don't tell me Israel didn't have good intelligence on \nnuclear weapons because she went in there back in the eighties--she is \na small country and can't play games and can't wait around for the \nUnited Nations and conferences. She had to knock that facility out.\n  What else did we know about Iraq? We knew they didn't have terrorists \nthere at the time. Oh, yes, while we are\n\n[[Page S13765]]\n\ntrying to internationalize a defense effort, what we find is, our \neffort is more or less internationalizing terrorism.\n  The most ridiculous thing on the TV last night was to hear the \nPresident say foreigners are in Iraq killing our soldiers. Can you \nimagine us, thousands of miles away, talking about foreigners killing \nour soldiers? Come on. What happened was, it did not have terrorists at \nthe time we went in. They tried to connect al-Qaida to Iraq, but now \nthe President himself has acknowledged you couldn't connect al-Qaida. \nThey didn't have nuclear capability. And, of course, there was no \ndemocracy. There weren't people yearning for it, as Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Wolfowitz said, meeting us in the streets waving: Whoopee, we \nfinally got democracy.\n  Anybody who knows the history of the Mideast knows that is a bunch of \nnonsense. They don't have democracy in Iraq, in Syria, in Iran, in \nJordan, in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, in Libya--or go right around--Libya, \nin the Mideast. Where does somebody think they are going to meet us in \nthe streets and say: Whoopee for democracy?\n  I wish the distinguished Chair would pay attention to this one. What \ndid George Herbert Walker Bush, the former President, say in his book, \n``A World Transformed''?\n\n       I firmly believed that we should not march into Baghdad. . \n     . . To occupy Iraq would instantly shatter our coalition, \n     turning the whole Arab world against us and make a broken \n     tyrant into a latter day Arab hero.\n       . . . assigning young soldiers to a fruitless hunt for a \n     securely entrenched dictator and condemning them to fight in \n     what would be an unwinnable urban guerrilla war.\n\n  That is what President George Herbert Walker Bush, the President's \ndaddy, said.\n  We all knew that about Iraq. But why did we go in and why did the \nSenator from South Carolina vote for the resolution last October? Why? \nI can tell my colleagues why. On August 7, Vice President Cheney, \nspeaking in California, said of Saddam Hussein: What we know now from \nvarious sources is that he continues to pursue a nuclear weapon.\n  Then on September 8: We do know with absolute certainty that he is \nattempting to acquire the equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium \nto build a nuclear weapon.\n  Then the President of the United States himself said, in his weekly \naddress on September 14, before we voted in October: Saddam Hussein has \nthe scientists and infrastructure for a nuclear weapons program and has \nillicitly sought to purchase the equipment needed to enrich uranium for \na nuclear weapon.\n  Then on September 24, Prime Minister Blair said that the assessed \nintelligence has established beyond doubt that Saddam continues in his \nefforts to develop nuclear weapons.\n  On September 8 of last year, Condoleezza Rice said that we do not \nwant the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\n  On October 7, President Bush said: Facing clear evidence of peril, we \ncannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the \nform of a mushroom cloud.\n  Now, any reasonable, sober, mature, experienced individual listening \nto that litany knows to vote against that resolution would have been \npure folly. One has to back the President.\n  I am not on the Intelligence Committee. I was not privy to any kind \nof intelligence but I knew we had a lot of intelligence. The truth is, \nI thought the Israeli intelligence was really furnishing all of this \ninformation and that we were going in this time for our little friend \nIsrael. Instead of them being blamed, we could finish up what Desert \nStorm had left undone; namely, getting rid of Saddam and getting rid of \nnuclear at the same time.\n  I voted for the resolution. I was misled. Now we hear that this is \nnot Vietnam. I read my friends Tom Friedman and Paul Krugman. They say \nthis is not a Vietnam.\n  The heck it is not. This crowd has got historical amnesia. There is \nno education in the second kick of a mule. This was a bad mistake. We \nwere mislead. We are in there now, and I am hearing the same things \nthat the Senator heard in 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 right on \nthrough 1973.\n  At the time I was a young politician, having just come to the Senate, \nlistening to those who knew. I knew Leader Mansfield would know about \nVietnam. I knew my friend Senator Dick Russell was against the war in \nVietnam from the get-go. Now, if Senator Mansfield had spoken up, he \ncould have saved 10,000 lives. We would have followed him in the \nSenate. But he was trying to follow the mistake and the misread of \nMaddox and the Turner joy that brought about the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution.\n  There are similarities. There are the misleading statements that I \nhave just given, the litany by the President telling us all there was \nreconstituted nuclear. Here again we are in a guerilla war. It is an \nurban guerilla war, not in the bushes of Vietnam but we still again are \ntrying to win the hearts and minds.\n  We were trying to victimize Vietnam. In this one we are trying to \nIraqi Iraq. We are trying to do our best doing the same things over and \nover again. In fact, in this particular war we received the Pentagon \npapers a lot earlier. I ask unanimous consent that this article in USA \nToday entitled ``Defense Memo: A Grim Outlook,'' by Secretary Rumsfeld, \nbe printed in the Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Oct. 22, 2003]\n\n                      Defense Memo: A Grim Outlook\n\n                   (By Dave Moniz and Tom Squitieri)\n\n       Washington.--The United States has no yardstick for \n     measuring progress in the war on terrorism, has not ``yet \n     made truly bold moves'' in fighting al-Qaeda and other terror \n     groups, and is in for a ``long, hard slog'' in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, according to a memo that Defense Secretary \n     Donald Rumsfeld sent to top-ranking Defense officials last \n     week.\n       Despite upbeat statements by the Bush administration, the \n     memo to Rumsfeld's top staff reveals significant doubts about \n     progress in the struggle against terrorists. Rumsfeld says \n     that ``it is not possible'' to transform the Pentagon quickly \n     enough to effectively fight the anti-terror war and that a \n     ``new institution'' might be necessary to do that.\n       The memo, which diverges sharply from Rumsfeld's mostly \n     positive public comments, offers one of the most candid and \n     sobering assessments to date of how top administration \n     officials view the 2-year-old war on terrorism. It suggests \n     that significant work remains and raises a number of probing \n     questions but few detailed proposals.\n       ``Are we winning or losing the Global War on Terror?'' \n     Rumsfeld asks in the Oct. 16 memo, which goes on to cite \n     ``mixed results'' against al-Qaeda, ``reasonable progress'' \n     tracking down top Iraqis and ``somewhat slower progress'' in \n     apprehending Taliban leaders. ``Is our current situation such \n     that `the harder we work, the behinder we get'?'' he wrote.\n       Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita declined to comment \n     specifically on the memo, but he said Rumsfeld's style is to \n     ``ask penetrating questions'' to provoke candid discussion. \n     ``He's trying to keep a sense of urgency alive.''\n       Among Rumsfeld's observations in the two-page memo:\n       The United States is ``just getting started'' in fighting \n     the Iraq-based terror group Ansar Al-Islam.\n       The war is hugely expensive. ``The cost-benefit ratio is \n     against us! Our cost is billions against the terrorists' cost \n     of millions.''\n       Postwar stabilization efforts are very difficult. ``It is \n     pretty clear the coalition can win in Afghanistan and Iraq in \n     one way or another, but it will be a long, hard slog.''\n       The memo was sent to Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul \n     Wolfowitz; Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs; and Douglas Feith, undersecretary of Defense for \n     policy.\n       Rumsfeld asks whether the Defense Department is moving fast \n     enough to adapt to fighting terrorists and whether the United \n     States should create a private foundation to entice radical \n     Islamic schools to a ``more moderate course.'' Rumsfeld says \n     the schools, known as madrassas, may be churning out new \n     terrorists faster than the United States can kill or capture \n     them.\n       The memo is not a policy statement, but a tool for shaping \n     internal discussion. It highlights a Rumsfeld trait that \n     supporters say is one of his greatest strengths: a \n     willingness to challenge subordinates to constantly reassess \n     problems. The memo prods Rumsfeld's most senior advisers to \n     think in new ways about the war on terrorism at a time when \n     many are preoccupied with the 7-month-old war in Iraq.\n       In public, the Bush administration has been upbeat in \n     describing the war on terrorism. Attorney General John \n     Ashcroft has noted that two-thirds of al-Qaeda's leadership \n     has been captured or killed.\n       Last month, Rumsfeld told PBS that ``al-Qaeda has been put \n     under enormous pressure'' and ``their ability to function has \n     been significantly affected.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I do not know how many more similarities\n\n[[Page S13766]]\n\nwe are going to get. Iraq is Vietnam all over for the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Now we have to either put the troops in there or else get out as soon \nas we can. I take it the present plan is to Iraqi Iraq; namely, train \nup a bunch of folks together, give them high pay. They have 70-percent \nunemployment so they will all grab and get a uniform and act as if they \nare security, but that will give us a cover and face to leave and leave \nas soon as we can, unless we are going to put the troops in there and \nget law and order.\n  What we have done is come into Iraq against the military requirements \nof taking the city. We just stopped at the airport and declared mission \naccomplished, and look around and wonder and say this is part of the \nwar on terror.\n  This is not and was not a part of the war on terror. Yes, there are \nterrorists in there now, but Iraq was not a part of the war on terror. \nIt was quiet. It was not bothering anybody. They did not have al-Qaida. \nThey did not have nuclear capabilities. They were not connected in any \nway to 9/11. We went in there under a mislead.\n  We learned in World War II that no matter how well the gun was aimed, \nif the recoil is going to kill the guncrew one does not fire the gun.\n  Yes, it was a good aim to get Saddam but now look at the headline. I \nask unanimous consent to include this particular article from the \nFinancial Times, ``Al-Qaida Exploits Insecurity in Iraq to Acquire \nWeapons and Swell Its Ranks.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Oct. 16, 2003]\n\n Al-Qaeda, ``Exploits Insecurity in Iraq to Acquire Weapons and Swell \n                              Its Ranks''\n\n                           (By Peter Speigel)\n\n       Continued instability inside Iraq has given terrorist \n     groups easier access to shoulder-launched anti-aircraft \n     missiles and, potentially, chemical or biological weapons, a \n     leading think-tank reported yesterday in its annual \n     evaluation of global security issues.\n       The London-based International Institute for Strategic \n     Studies said in its newly published Military Balance survey \n     that while the invasion of Iraq might have isolated al-Qaeda \n     from potential state sponsors, it was also likely to have had \n     the effect of ``swelling its ranks and galvanishing its \n     will''.\n       ``War in Iraq has probably inflamed radical passions among \n     Muslims and thus increased al-Qaeda's recruiting power and \n     morale and, at least marginally, its operational \n     capability,'' the report states.\n       John Chipman, the IISS director, noted that David Kay, the \n     US's chief weapons inspector, had recently reported that more \n     than 100 spawling Iraqi ammunition storage sites remain \n     unexamined. The inference made by Mr. Kay was that evidence \n     of unconventional weapons could still be uncovered by \n     coalition teams inside Iraq.\n       But Mr. Chipman said the unexamined depots also raised \n     grave concerns about what arms might be available to \n     terrorist groups, said by US intelligence officials to be \n     moving into Iraq in greater numbers.\n       ``While the number of uninspected sites may be interesting \n     in terms of the struggle to find evidence of weapons of mass \n     destruction, it is even more interesting as a comment on the \n     ammunition that may be available to terrorist who can get \n     access to unguarded or poorly guarded depots,'' Mr. Chipman \n     said.\n       He added that shoulder-launched missiles were of particular \n     concern, noting that Soviet-era SA-7s and US Stinger systems \n     could fetch Dollars 5,000 (Euros 4,250, Pounds 3,000) on the \n     black market, while coalition forces in Iraq were offering \n     only Dollars 500 for those handed in to authorities.\n       ``This proliferation problem is exacerbated by the porosity \n     of Iraq's borders in the post-conflict stage, making it easy \n     for weapons to flow outside the country and into the Middle \n     East in general,'' Mr. Chipman said.\n       The IISS also argued that while it was unlikely that al-\n     Qaeda still had the capability of a ``mass-casualty attack'' \n     on US soil, its members might see a large-scale attack on US \n     forces inside Iraq as a ``feasible substitute'' while they \n     worked to reconstitute the network.\n       ``It is worth recalling that the operational cycle for \n     large and complex al-Qaeda operations can exceed the 25 \n     months that have passed since 9/11,'' Mr. Chipman said.\n       The Military Balance study found that global defense \n     spending increased 7 per cent last year in dollar terms, from \n     Dollars 786.6bn to Dollars 842.7bn, largely because of the \n     huge military build-up in the US and a stronger eruo.\n       The authors predicted another 7 per cent increase this \n     year, again citing huge Pentagon spending increases for the \n     bulk of the rise. Still, such spending levels account for \n     only 2.6. per cent of global GDP, as compared with 6.2 per \n     cent in 1985.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. We now have more \nterrorism than less terrorism. That is the fact. We have the entire \nworld turned against us. When we cannot get Mexico and Canada to go \nalong with us, we are in trouble.\n  I am hopeful the United States will win back the hearts and minds of \nthe world's people, because we were always loved, respected, and looked \nup to for leadership.\n  In this particular venture what we have done is exactly what \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush warned against. He said to watch \nout; do not go into that place. I quote again, now that my \ndistinguished friend is here. I want that particular quote to appear in \nthe Record again. He said in his book ``A World Transformed'':\n\n       I firmly believe that we should not march into Baghdad. To \n     occupy Iraq would instantly shatter our coalition, turning \n     the whole Arab world against us and make a broken tyrant into \n     a latter-day Arab hero. Assigning young soldiers to a \n     fruitless hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and \n     condemning them to fight in what would be an unwinnable urban \n     guerrilla war.\n\n  Iraq is Vietnam all over again. I know the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska revered our friend Senator Mansfield. I will never forget when \nSenator Mansfield said all Senators are equal, and when they rolled the \nSenator from Alaska on a particular matter he was concerned with, he, \nhimself--that is Leader Mansfield--got up, took the floor, and put \nAlaska's amendments up and we passed them.\n  So Senator Mansfield took some 5 years and 17 memos to Presidents \nbefore he finally changed his mind and spoke. That is exactly where I \nam today as I enter this particular debate with respect to the \nsupplemental. I would oppose the supplemental on one score, namely we \nwill not pay for it. We tell that poor GI, downtown in Baghdad, we hope \nyou don't get killed, and the reason we hope you don't get killed is \nbecause we want you to hurry back. We want you to hurry back so we can \ngive you the bill because we are not going to pay for it. We in the \nCongress, my generation, we need a tax cut so we can get reelected next \nyear. We are not going to pay for it.\n  This is the first war in the history of the United States where there \nis no sacrifice on the homefront. They all run around the mulberry bush \nhere saying ``it's not Vietnam'' and that we have to stay.\n  We either have to get in or get out. We can't stand for operation \nmeat grinder to continue day in and day out.\n  In a war on terror, I just want the administration to know that might \ndoes not make right. On the contrary, right makes might. Winning the \nhearts and minds of the world's peoples, I can tell you here and now, \nwe have to get right on our policy in the Mideast. We all back Israel, \nbut we don't back the taking over of these settlements. If you have \nbeen a conquered people--and I read where the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska went down into those areas for the first time in Israel--\nfor 35 years you have looked not only for your light and water but your \njobs up in Israel. Anybody with any get-up-and-go has gotten up and \ngone, after 35 years. You have the disenchanted. They don't have an \narmy or anything else like that. So don't be amazed. You have to play \nit with an even hand.\n  Might makes right in this terror war. We got onto this Iraqi venture, \nwhich was a bad mistake from the very beginning. There is not any \nquestion about it. If I went to a funeral this afternoon of a fallen \nsoldier in Iraq, what would I say? Did they fall there for democracy? \nThey are not going to have a democracy. It is going to be the Shiite \ndemocracy, like they have in Iran--at best. That is exactly what \nSecretary Rumsfeld said we were not going to have.\n  Was it for nuclear? No.\n  Was it for terrorists? No, they didn't have terrorists there.\n  Your son gave his life for what? As their Senator, I am embarrassed. \nIt wasn't for any of those things. Why we went in, the administration \nhas yet to tell us. They keep changing the rules and the goalposts \nevery time. But somehow, somewhere they have to really put the force in \nthere, quit trying to do it on the cheap, put the force in there and \nclean out that city, so they will quit killing them, or otherwise get \nout as fast as we can.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S13767]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the last 20 \nminutes of the time under the control of the previous order be divided \nso that Senator Byrd has 10 minutes next to last and that I have the \nlast 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, it is a sad and somber day to consider the \nconference report on the $87.5 billion supplemental appropriations for \nthe continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yesterday was the worst \nloss of American lives in any day in Iraq. Sixteen American soldiers \ndied in a helicopter brought down by a ground-launched rocket. Twenty \nothers were wounded in that horrible moment. Another U.S. soldier was \nkilled when his Humvee was ambushed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad.\n  Another convoy was attacked in Fallujah, a city west of Baghdad. One \nU.S. vehicle was destroyed and no casualties were officially reported. \nYet another attack on that city killed two American civilians and \nwounded one. In Abu Ghraib, a western suburb of Baghdad, U.S. soldiers \nand residents reportedly fought in the streets. The residents said at \nleast one American soldier had been killed, along with several Iraqis. \nThat is in one terrible day.\n  Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the families and \nfriends of those brave Americans who gave their lives in the service of \ntheir country, as those who have lost their lives before them.\n  I will support this additional funding for one primary reason, and \nthat is to win this war in Iraq, to secure lasting victory there and in \nAfghanistan, and then bring our American troops home as quickly as \npossible. That should be a goal we can all agree on, something that \nunites us all in this Chamber and as Americans. Let's do what we must \nto secure our military victory, to establish the framework for \ncontinuing success there, and then let's get our troops home as soon \nand as safe as possible.\n  Whether we agreed or disagreed with the decision to start this war, \nwe are in it now. Whether or not weapons of mass destruction are \neventually found, whether they were there before or not, whether \ninternational terrorists were there or not--none of these questions, \nnor their answers, nor the debates over them, change or will change the \nsituation we are in today, which is that 138,000 of our sons and \ndaughters are in Iraq because they were sent there. They are risking \ntheir lives. Some are fighting for their lives. Some are losing their \nlives to carry out the orders they have been given to fulfill the \nmission they have been assigned. They have done so courageously, \nheroically and, to this point, successfully. This supplemental funding \ngives their Commander in Chief almost everything he asked us for. It \ngives the military command everything they asked us for, gives the \nsoldiers everything they need to complete these assignments \nsuccessfully, to accomplish their mission victoriously, as quickly and \nefficiently and completely as possible, and we do so because they must \nsucceed.\n  Our country must succeed. We must prevail in the very difficult \ncircumstances in which we are entangled in Iraq. We must win a lasting \nvictory there militarily, economically, and socially. We must succeed \nand establish a new Iraqi government, which will be able to itself \nsucceed after we leave. We must assist and enable the Iraqi people to \nsucceed now and after we depart. We must win this war we started \nbecause the consequences of failure would be catastrophic. Failure is \nnot an option--not for our sake, not for Iraq's sake, not for the \nworld's sake. We must not lose this war.\n\n  I speak as somebody who voted against last year's congressional \nresolution that authorized the President to start this war. I thought \nit was premature a year ago last October. I thought it was \nunconstitutional. I thought it was a mistake, that it would weaken, not \nstrengthen, our national security. I said then I hoped I was wrong. \nToday I don't believe I was, but that is irrelevant to what we face \ntoday--that we are fighting a war in Iraq. The Americans and the Iraqis \nwho are supporting them there are fighting for their lives, and we must \nwin the war and secure that peace so we can leave that country with a \nvictory that will last.\n  Failure, pulling out now or at any time, followed by the collapse of \nthat country--whatever government, whatever resulting civil war or \nanarchy, or if a return to power by Saddam Hussein would occur--would \nbe a disaster for Iraq and for us. It would be devastating to our \nnational security, to our standing in the eyes of the world, to our \nability to lead that world.\n  Failure is not an option, so we must proceed and succeed. How? I have \nmy ideas. Everyone else in the Senate has his or her ideas, and House \nMembers have their ideas. Every retired general has lots of ideas. What \nmatters most is what are the ideas of the Commander in Chief. What is \nhis plan of action? What must be accomplished? What is the measure of \nour success? What is the intended timetable for reconciling and \naccomplishing them?\n  To the question he was asked at the press conference last week, would \nhe guarantee there would be less than 200,000 troops in Iraq a year \nfrom now, he replied, ``That is a trick question.'' That is not a trick \nquestion. It is essential. What is the timetable for the men and women \nserving over there, suffering over there, fighting and dying? What is \nthe timetable to bring them home with a victory accomplished? Those are \nquestions that deserve answers. They deserve truthful answers because, \nfor $87 billion, the American people--all of us--deserve to be told the \ntruth. Mr. President, $87 billion is a lot to pay for the truth. It is \nway too much to pay for partial truths or fabrications or \nmisrepresentations or outright lies.\n  This administration must tell us the truth, the whole truth, nothing \nbut the truth, the good, the bad, the ugly, and the successes and the \nnonsuccesses. If not, the credibility of those who are in command will \nsuffer. That loss of faith and trust in our leaders is something we \ncannot afford--ever--in this country, but especially not now.\n  On last Saturday, a U.S. commander said that the opposition's attacks \nare ``strategically and operationally insignificant.'' What are we \nsupposed to believe the day after the most damaging, fatality-filled \nday of the war for Americans?\n  When Democratic Senators were not allowed to travel to Iraq during \nthe last recess to see firsthand, as I was able to do with the \nPresiding Officer and a bipartisan delegation in July, when Democratic \nSenators are not allowed to see for themselves what is actually going \non in that country, then what are we supposed to believe when what we \nare told by others turns out not to be true, such as when we are told, \nas we were last August, that 95 percent of that country is now peaceful \nand is secure, and these atrocities continue day after day taking the \nlives of Americans and maiming and wounding others. Tell us the truth.\n  Secondly, it is imperative that the administration spend this $87.5 \nbillion well and spend it wisely. The President insisted that all the \nmoney for economic and social rehabilitation be grants, not loans, as a \nmajority, myself included, in the Senate would have preferred. The fact \nthey are grants is all the more reason to make sure all those dollars \ngo to get the job done as soon as possible because American troops' \nlives are depending upon it, because every day they don't come home is \na day more casualties are likely to occur.\n  Any company, any individual, any American corporation, or American \ncitizen who is taking money under those pretexts and is not putting \nthat money to its proper use is a traitor to\n\n[[Page S13768]]\n\nthis country and to the cause for which those men and women are \nfighting and risking and giving their lives.\n  The reports we have read of rampant overcharging by certain \ncompanies, egregious overcharging for the price of oil that is being \ntransported into that oil-rich country, reports of kickbacks and bribes \nnecessary to secure contracts, reports of sweetheart deals being \narranged, no-bid contracts being awarded, of people in Washington \nsetting up shop and telling those who want contracts over there that \nthe means to achieve them, not because they are well qualified, but \nbecause they have higher up connections--that would be an abomination. \nIt would be a waste of taxpayers' money. It would be a desecration of \nthe memories of the men and women who have given so much on behalf of \nour country there, and it would delay--and this is what is most \nunforgivable--it would delay the achieving of success that is necessary \nto bring our men and women home with a lasting victory achieved.\n  We must get rid of Saddam Hussein. When I was in Iraq last July, I \nwas told by a commanding general it was an urgent priority, an urgent \nnecessity to remove him and his two sons from power permanently by \nwhatever means necessary. The military of the United States is two-\nthirds of the way toward that objective. The people of Iraq must be \nassured, and every day they are not again delays our success. They must \nbe assured Saddam Hussein will not return to terrorize that country \never again.\n  Finally, we must treat our Armed Forces in Iraq as well as we \npossibly can during and in the aftermath of this war, and those \nfighting in Afghanistan as well. I am very pleased that the conferees \nincluded an amendment my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Coleman, and \nI sponsored that earmarked $55 million of this appropriation for the \ntravel costs of troops to come back to the United States, to cover \ntheir airfare to their homes and back, whereas previously they were \nbeing forced to pay that airfare themselves to get back to their \nfamilies and loved ones. Most of them, in fact, from Minnesota who are \nserving now have had their tours of duty extended from 6 months to a \nyear, after they arrived in Iraq with no recourse, no opportunity to \nmake those arrangements back home, except after the fact. So the chance \nto come home for 2 weeks is crucial for them, for their spouses, and \nfor their children.\n\n  Given the financial sacrifices many of them have incurred by virtue \nof leaving better paying jobs, sometimes losing small businesses they \nhad underway, incurring those financial hardships are such that even a \nround-trip plane ticket can be an almost prohibitive expense. It seems \nto be the least we can do and should do and, according to this bill, \nare going to do to thank them and give them a chance to connect with \ntheir families before they go back to again risk their lives in Iraq.\n  I am glad to see included an amendment that Senator Graham of Florida \nproposed, which I was also pleased to cosponsor, that will prevent the \nPentagon for charging our wounded soldiers for the cost of their meals \nand hospitalization or rehabilitation. It doesn't seem it should be \nnecessary, but given they are paying that price for their service, the \nleast we can to is feed them at our expense.\n  I am also pleased the conferees included the requirement that each \nmember of the Reserve or National Guard who is serving in Iraq on \nactive duty has to be informed in writing when their tour of duty will \nbe concluded so they and their families will know when they can count \non their return.\n  I strongly urge the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, that the period of demobilization, the time from \nwhen troops, especially those who are going to be deactivated, Guard \nmen and women, reservists, from the time they arrive back home and the \ntime when they are released to their families, homes, jobs, that time \nbe kept to an absolute minimum--days, at least a week or two, rather \nthan the weeks and months I am told typically it takes. It is important \nwe treat these men and women well for what they have given on behalf of \ntheir country so that we retain their services for future needs.\n  I support this supplemental appropriations with the regret that it is \nnecessary but the resolve that it is what we must do to achieve \nvictory. I want to be able to face our fellow citizens with the \nassurance that it is money that is needed, money that is going to be \nspent as it was appropriated, and money that is going to be spent as it \nwas intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to conclude my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I want us to walk out of that situation \nwith our heads held high--on which the hopes and dreams of the Iraqi \npopulation now depend--with the victory and success we want to achieve, \nwith the result we want to give the Iraqi people--a democratically \nelected government, a country that has hope and means for a better \nfuture and which restores this country's standing in the eyes of the \nrest of the world, the stature, the respect we have had and that we \ndeserve to have and that we must have to be the leader of this world in \nthe years ahead.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator has 60 minutes. \nThere are 58 minutes 56 seconds remaining on that 60 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, who has been yielded time by the distinguished \nminority leader. I yield the floor to her, if the Chair so recognizes \nher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been yielded 10 minutes by the \nminority leader, which I would like to use at this time.\n  I start off by first saying this is a very hard time for our country. \nClearly, for my State, the kind of horror we have seen from these \nuncontrollable fires has been just unspeakable. Finally, we are getting \nthem contained. At this point, we have lost 3,400 homes. Some 750,000 \nacres have burned. We have had 20 deaths, one of them a fireman from my \nhome county.\n  For me, the bill that is before us is a mixed bag in many ways. It \ndoes have funding for these disasters. It does have money for our \nbrave, courageous, and extraordinary heroes and, of course, I support \nall of that. What I do not support is the fact that many of the \nprovisions have been dropped that would have made a difference in our \npolicy there. We are going down a path that is bringing the American \npeople pain deep within their hearts that one just cannot even measure.\n  I have long talked about shoulder-fired missiles and what they can do \nto aircraft. We have seen that in the starkest possible way. I feel so \nmuch sadness given what is happening in my State. I am glad the \nPresident is coming there tomorrow. I am writing a letter to FEMA. I \nhave been calling Director Michael Brown, who has been very \ncompassionate, to set up disaster centers. I have been calling on him \nto work with me in encouraging the mortgage companies to be as good to \ntheir mortgage holders as Fannie Mae has been, giving them a chance to \nrecoup and getting those individual and business loans to start \nrebuilding, which we will. We will rebuild.\n  I went back to look at my own record on fire issues since maybe 5, 6, \n7 years ago. We have been urging for so many years that communities \nclose to national forests be paid special attention. So there will be \nmore time to talk about all of that.\n  Today, I wish to eulogize our young men and women who have died \nduring the war in Iraq, as well as those who have been killed during \nthis postwar period. I simply want to call attention to the \nCalifornians who have died in this conflict. We have lost 73 young \npeople in this war from California. My\n\n[[Page S13769]]\n\ncolleagues will note that there are 72 on this list behind me. We just \nlearned of the first woman from California today. That puts us up to \n73. I want to read their names. I am not going to tell my colleague \nabout each and every one of them. I am going to put that in the Record:\n  Michael Bitz, Jose Garibay, Jorge Gonzalez, Thomas Mullen Adams, Jose \nGutierrez, Randal Kent Rosacker, Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., Ryan \nBeaupre, Therrel Shane Childers, Brian Matthew Kennedy, Kendall Damon \nWatersbey, Kevin Nave, William White, Joseph Menusa, Jesus Suarez Del \nSolar, Patrick T.

Karina was onboard a Chinook \nhelicopter when it was attacked. She was assigned to B Company, 16th \nSignal Battalion, 3rd Signal Brigade, in Fort Hood, TX.\n\n  We send our deepest love and sympathy to all of these families.\n  This is what is happening in Iraq. Maybe we do not see the bodies \ncoming home but this is what is happening in Iraq. It was not supposed \nto be thus. I sit on the Foreign Relations Committee and they told us \nwe would be welcomed as liberators. They said the purpose was to get \nthe weapons of mass destruction, and the purpose was to get rid of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  If those were the purposes, it is time now to rethink what we are \ndoing there. That means, it seems to me, to admit that it is not going \nthe way the American people were promised.\n  We are told 80 percent of Iraq is safe. We have been told that by \nmany people. We have been told that by Paul Wolfowitz. We have been \ntold that by Ambassador Bremer. I am going to take them at their word--\n80 percent of Iraq is safe. Then why do we have to have only our young \npeople, with a few others sprinkled in, in those areas? What we need to \ndo is bring in the peacekeepers, if things are safe in those areas, 80 \npercent of the country. We should concentrate our force in the area of \nthe country that is so very dangerous. We should get help from the \nentire world to do that. This burden cannot keep on falling on \nAmerica's families.\n  Many reporting requirements were dropped from this bill. I asked for \na specific report detailing the extent to which U.S. military personnel \nhave been replaced by international troops or Iraqi forces in secure \nareas of Iraq--the 80 percent solution I talked about. The conference \nreport requires a report on U.S. efforts to increase the number of \ninternational troops, but basically it has dropped the portion where we \ntalk about that 80 percent of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for an additional 2 minutes from the time of the \nSenator from West Virginia and then I will conclude.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of my time to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Byrd. It has been my privilege to work \nwith the Senator on this issue. You have been around far longer than I \nhave been, but I have been around a long time.\n  I have seen Vietnam. I have seen our troops become sitting ducks. I \nhave seen it. It doesn't have to be this way. There are other ways to \ndeal with this.\n  I hope and continue to pray we will have an exit strategy that \nincludes help from the entire civilized world. We know Iraq was a haven \nfor a most brutal tyrant--one of the most brutal in all history, Saddam \nHussein. We know that. We know he is essentially gone. That is a plus. \nBut now Iraq has become a haven for the terrorists. It was not supposed \nto be thus. Doesn't it mean something when the President and his people \ntell the American people what is going to happen? Doesn't it mean \nsomething to say: You know what, we predicted this and this. It didn't \nhappen. We need a new strategy.\n  That is what I was hoping for in this bill. Everything that really \nwas leading toward that got voted down. Senator Byrd's amendments, \nSenator Kennedy's, others, the ones that were agreed to here have been \nknocked out, so we do not have the type of reporting requirements that \nwould have shown us progress.\n  Instead, we have a continuation of the status quo. I am very \nsurprised, for example, that the loan turned into a grant. I don't \nthink that is good for taxpayers.\n  I thank you for your patience. I thank my colleague. I pray and hope \nfor a new strategy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for her kind references to me, and for her \ncourage, for her foresight and vision, and for the strength she has \nshown, not only on this matter but also on many others, over the years \nI have served with her. I thank her for her friendship. I express only \nthe highest of regard for her in the difficult situation she finds her \nState in at this time, and also, Mr. President, for the position she \nhas so valiantly held on this particular bill that is before us, and \nthe subject matter of this bill, throughout the time it has come before \nthe Senate.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 44 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Iraq supplemental conference report \nbefore the Senate today has been widely described as a victory for \nPresident Bush. If hardball politics and lockstep partisanship are the \nstuff of which victory is made, then I suppose the assessments are \naccurate. But if reasoned discourse, integrity, and accountability are \nthe measures of true victory, then this package falls far short of the \nmark.\n  In the end, the President wrung virtually every important concession \nhe sought from the House-Senate conference committee. Key provisions \nthe Senate had debated extensively, voted on, and included in its \nversion of the bill--such as providing half of the Iraq reconstruction \nfunding in the form of loans instead of grants--were thrown overboard \nin the conference agreement. Senators who had made compelling arguments \non the Senate floor only days earlier to limit American taxpayers' \nliability by providing some of the Iraq reconstruction aid in the form \nof loans suddenly reversed their position in conference and bowed to \nthe power of the Presidency.\n  Before us today is a massive $87 billion supplemental appropriations \npackage that commits this Nation to a long and costly occupation and \nreconstruction of Iraq. Yet the collective wisdom of the House and \nSenate appropriations conference that produced it was little more than \na shadow play, choreographed to stifle dissent and rubberstamp the \nPresident's request.\n  Perhaps this ``take no prisoners'' approach is how the President and \nhis advisers define victory. But I fear they are fixated on the muscle \nof the politics instead of on the wisdom of the policy. The fact of the \nmatter is, when it comes to policy, the Iraq supplemental is a monument \nto failure.\n\n  Consider, for example, that before the war the President's policy \nadvisers assured the American people Iraq would largely be able to \nfinance its own reconstruction through oil revenues, seized assets, and \nincreased economic productivity. The $18 billion in this supplemental \nearmarked for the reconstruction of Iraq is testament to the fallacy of \nthat prediction. It is the American taxpayer, not the Iraqi oil \nindustry, that is being called upon to shoulder the financial burden of \nrebuilding Iraq.\n\n[[Page S13770]]\n\n  The international community on which the administration pinned such \nhope for helping in the reconstruction of Iraq has collectively ponied \nup only $13 billion, and the bulk of those pledges--$9 billion--is in \nthe form of loans or credits, not grants. But still the White House \nclaims victory for arm-twisting Congress into reversing itself on the \nquestion of loans and providing the entire $18 billion in U.S. tax \ndollars in the form of outright grants to Iraq. I readily admit that \nhow this convoluted logic can be construed as a victory for the \nPresident is beyond me.\n  But reconstruction is only part of the story. On May 1, the President \nstood on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln--strategically postured \nbeneath a banner that declared ``Mission Accomplished''--and pronounced \nthe end of major combat operations in Iraq.\n  Since that day, however, more American military personnel have been \nkilled in Iraq than were killed during the major combat phase of the \nwar. According to the Defense Department, 376 American troops have been \nkilled to date in Iraq and nearly two-thirds of those deaths, 238, have \noccurred since May 1, when the President declared that the major combat \nhad ended.\n  When President Bush uttered the unwise challenge, ``Bring 'em on,'' \non July 2, the enemy did, indeed, ``bring them on,'' and with a \nvengeance. Since the President made that comment, more than 165 \nAmerican soldiers have been killed in Iraq. As the death toll mounts, \nit has become clear that the enemy intends to keep on ``bringing 'em \non.''\n  The $66 billion in this supplemental required to continue the United \nStates military occupation of Iraq over the next year and the steadily \nrising death toll are testament to the utter hollowness of the \nPresident's declaration aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln and the careless \nbravado of his challenge to ``bring 'em on.''\n  It has been said many times on the floor of this Senate that a vote \nfor this supplemental is a vote for our troops in Iraq. The implication \nof that statement is that a vote against the supplemental is a vote \nagainst our troops. I find that twisted logic to be both irrational and \noffensive. To my mind, backing a flawed policy with a flawed \nappropriations bill hurts our troops in Iraq more than it helps them.\n  Endorsing and funding a policy that does nothing to relieve American \ntroops in Iraq is not, in my opinion, a support-the-troops measure. Our \ntroops in Iraq and elsewhere in the world have no stronger advocate \nthan Robert C. Byrd, senior Senator from the great State of West \nVirginia, where mountaineers are always free. I support our troops. I \nhave been supporting our troops for more than 50 years as a Member of \nthe Congress of the United States. I pray for the safety of our troops. \nI will continue to fight for a coherent policy that brings real help--\nnot just longer deployments and empty sloganeering--to American forces \nin Iraq.\n  The supplemental package before the Senate does nothing to \ninternationalize the occupation of Iraq, and therefore it is not a vote \nfor our troops in Iraq. We had a chance in the beginning to win \ninternational consensus on dealing with Iraq, but the administration \nwas in too big a hurry, the White House was in too big a hurry. The \nadministration squandered that opportunity when the President gave the \nback of his hand to the United Nations and preemptively invaded Iraq.\n  Under this administration's Iraq policy, endorsed in the President's \nso-called victory on this supplemental, it is American troops who are \nwalking the mean streets of Baghdad; it is American troops who are \nsuccumbing in growing numbers to a common and all too deadly cocktail \nof anti-American bombs and bullets in Iraq.\n  The terrible violence in Iraq on Sunday--the deaths of 16 soldiers \nand the downing of an American helicopter, the killing of another \nsoldier, and a bomb attack and the deaths of 2 American civilian \ncontractors in a mine explosion--is only the latest evidence that the \nadministration's lack of postwar planning for Iraq is producing an \nerratic, chaotic situation on the ground with little hope for a quick \nturnaround. We appear to be lurching from one assault on our troops to \nthe next while making little, if any, headway in stabilizing our \nimproving security in that unfortunate country.\n\n  The failure to secure the vast stockpiles of deadly conventional \nweapons in Iraq, including shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles such \nas the one that may have brought down the United States helicopter on \nSunday, is one of many mistakes the administration made that is coming \nback to haunt us today.\n  Perhaps the biggest mistake, the costliest mistake, following the \ncolossal mistake of launching a preemptive attack on Iraq, is the \nadministration's failure to have a clearly defined mission and exit \nstrategy for Iraq.\n  The President continues to insist that the United States will \npersevere in its mission in Iraq and that our resolve is unshakable. \nBut it is time, past time, for the President to tell the American \npeople exactly what that mission is, how he intends to accomplish it, \nand what his exit strategy is for the American troops in Iraq. It is \nthe American people out there--it is the American people--who will \nultimately decide how long we will stay in Iraq.\n  It is not enough for the President to maintain that the United States \nwill not be driven out of Iraq by the increasing violence against \nAmerican soldiers. He must also demonstrate leadership by presenting \nthe American people with a plan to stem the freewheeling violence in \nIraq, return the government of that country to the Iraqi people, and \npave the way for the orderly withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. \nWe do not now have such a plan, and the supplemental conference report \nbefore the Senate does not provide such a plan. The $87 billion in this \nappropriations bill provides the wherewithal for the United States to \nstay in Iraq when what we badly need is a course correction. The \nPresident owes the American people an exit strategy for Iraq. It is \ntime for the President to deliver.\n  I have great respect and affection for my fellow Senators and my \ncolleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee. No one could ask for \na finer committee chairman than Senator Ted Stevens. I have even \ngreater respect and greater affection and greater dedication to the \ninstitution of the Senate and the Constitution of the United States by \nwhich this Senate was established.\n  Every Senator upon taking office swears an oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. It is the Constitution of the \nUnited States--not the President of the United States, not a political \nparty, but the Constitution--to which all Senators swear an oath of \nloyalty before God and man. I am here to tell you that neither the \nConstitution nor the American people are well served by a process and a \nproduct that are based on blind adherence to the will of the White \nHouse and to the will of the President at the expense of congressional \nchecks and balances. It is as if, in a rush to support the President's \npolicy, this White House is prepared to put blinders on the Congress.\n  This supplemental spending bill is a case in point. One of the \nearliest amendments that was defeated on the Senate floor was the one I \noffered to hold back a portion of the reconstruction money and give the \nSenate a second chance--give the Senate a second vote--on whether to \nrelease that money. Apparently, the President and his supporters did \nnot want to give the Senate an opportunity to review the progress--or \nlack of progress--in Iraq and have a second chance to debate the wisdom \nof spending billions of taxpayers' dollars on the reconstruction \neffort.\n  Time after time the House-Senate conference committee was given the \nopportunity to restore or impose accountability on the administration \nfor the money being appropriated in the Iraq supplemental, and time \nafter time the House-Senate conference committee majority beat back \nthose measures. The conferees, for example, defeated on a party-line \nvote an amendment I offered which would have required that the head of \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq be confirmed by the Senate. \nSenate confirmation of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq \nwould have ensured that the person who is managing tens of billions of \ndollars in Iraq for the American taxpayers would be accountable to the \npublic--to the people out\n\n[[Page S13771]]\n\nthere who are watching through those electronic lenses. The current \nappointee, L. Paul Bremer III, is not. He answers to the Secretary of \nDefense and the President--not to Congress and not to the American \npeople.\n  The conferees approved a provision creating an inspector general for \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority, but I am dismayed to say that this \nindividual is not subject to Senate confirmation. I am dismayed that \nthe conferees defeated my amendment that would have required the \ninspector general to testify before Congress when invited. I am \ndismayed that the President can refuse to send Congress the results of \nthe inspector general's work. Could it be that the President's \nsupporters are afraid to hear what the inspector general might tell \nthem? Could it be that the President's supporters in Congress would \nrather blindly follow the President instead of risking reality by \nopening their eyes to what could be uncomfortable facts?\n  The conference also stripped out my amendment to the Senate bill that \nwould have required the General Accounting Office to conduct ongoing \naudits of the expenditure of taxpayer dollars for the reconstruction of \nIraq. On the Senate floor my amendment required such audits, and it was \nadopted by a vote of 97 to zero--97 to nothing. But in the House-Senate \nconference, it was blown away. It was defeated in the House-Senate \nconference by the Senate conferees on a 15-to-14 straight-line party \nvote.\n\n  Sprinkled throughout the Iraq supplemental conference report, \nprovisions euphemistically described as ``flexibilities'' give the \nPresident broad authority to take the money--your money--appropriated \nby Congress in this bill and spend it however he wishes. I tried to \neliminate or limit these flexibilities--and in a few cases succeeded--\nbut there remain billions of dollars in this measure that can be spent \nat the discretion of the President or the Secretary of Defense.\n  Although the money is appropriated by Congress, as it is required to \nbe appropriated by Congress in section 9 of article I of the \nConstitution of the United States, these so-called ``flexibilities'' \neffectively transfer the power of the purse from the legislative branch \nto the executive branch.\n  The dictionary definition of ``victory'' is simple and \nstraightforward: success, conquest, triumph. Within the constraints of \nthat simplistic definition, I suppose one could construe this package \nto be a victory for the President.\n  But I believe there is a moral undercurrent to the notion of victory \nthat is not reflected in the dictionary definition. I believe most \nAmericans equate victory more closely with what is right than with \nsimply winning. It is one thing to win, and the tactics be damned; it \nis quite another to be victorious. Victory implies doing what is right; \ndoing what is right implies morality; morality implies standards of \nconduct. I do not include arm twisting and intimidation in my \ndefinition of exemplary standards of conduct.\n  Moreover, we should not forget that not all victories are created \nequal. In 280 B.C., Pyrrhus, the ruler of Epirus in northern Greece, \ntook his formidable armies to Italy and defeated the Romans at \nHeraclea, and again at Asculum in 279 B.C., but suffered unbearably \nheavy losses. ``One more such victory and I am lost,'' he said.\n  It is to Pyrrhus that we owe the term ``pyrrhic victory,'' to \ndescribe a victory so costly as to be ruinous. This supplemental and \nthe policy which it supports, unfortunately, may prove to be a pyrrhic \nvictory for the Bush administration.\n  The conference report before the Senate today is a flawed agreement \nthat was produced by political imperative, not by reasoned policy \nconsiderations. This is not a good bill for our troops in Iraq. This is \nnot a good bill for American taxpayers. This is not a good bill for the \nmothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and husbands and wives of \nthe troops in Iraq. This is not good policy for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Victory is not always about winning. Sometimes victory is simply \nabout being right. This conference report does not reflect the right \npolicy for Iraq or the right policy for America.\n  I oppose it, and I will vote ``no'' on final passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Before doing so, may I ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Eighteen minutes 42 seconds \ntotal, including the 10 minutes to close.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto use the Democratic leader's leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we are faced with a very difficult vote this \nafternoon. There are many of us who have questioned the wisdom of our \npolicy in Iraq, dating back to October of last year, no one more \neloquently or intelligently than Chairman Byrd, and his speech today \nechoes that sentiment so well. But for me this is a question of \nproviding the resources necessary to support our soldiers, marines, \nairmen, and naval personnel in the field. Despite the questions of \npolicy, I do believe we have to render such support, but I have \nreservations about particular aspects of the bill which I would like to \naddress today.\n  During the debate on the bill, I offered two amendments. The first \nwas to increase the resources allocated to acquire uparmored Humvees. \nThese are the tactical vehicles that are armored that provide increased \nprotection against the improvised explosive devices being used \nthroughout Iraq. Particularly I was concerned about the exposure of \nsome of our National Guard forces.\n  The Presiding Officer and myself represent the State of Rhode Island. \nWe have two military police companies. The Presiding Officer supported \nme and worked with me closely in trying to craft this amendment so we \ncould increase the number of uparmored Humvees.\n  My original proposal was to increase the number in this bill by 800. \nI am very pleased to say this bill contains an additional 318 uparmored \nHumvees.\n  I thank Senator Stevens particularly because on the floor he not only \naccepted this amendment, but he did his utmost with his staff to ensure \nthese additional uparmored Humvees would be available to our troops in \nthe field. This is good news to me, but better news for the troops who \nwill use them and the families back here who each day monitor the \nnewspapers and the television and watch and hope their soldiers, their \nmilitary personnel, have every margin of safety and protection they \nneed.\n  The second amendment I offered was with respect to the end strength \nof the active U.S. Army. Unfortunately, this proposal, although it \nsucceeded on the floor of the Senate--it resisted a motion to table by \na vote of 52 to 45--was dropped in conference. I believe eliminating \nthis provision is a mistake. We do need additional troops. There are \nsome who argue very strenuously we need additional troops right now in \nIraq.\n  If one considers what has happened with the tragic loss of a Chinook \nhelicopter, with 16 soldiers killed, and others injured, the fact that \nthere are multiple, perhaps hundreds, of ammunition dumps throughout \nIraq that are unsecured most of the time and subject to looting, the \nfact we are continuing to see a stiffening resistance throughout the \nSunni triangle around Baghdad, all of that argues to many that we \nshould, in fact, increase the forces on the ground.\n  Even if you do not concur, even if you believe, as the Secretary of \nDefense says over and over again, that we have enough American troops \non the ground, if we are going to maintain such a deployment over the \nnext several years, we need additional soldiers in our Army for \nrotation, because otherwise we will wear our Army out, and the first \nsigns of that will be a diminution in the retention of our reservists \nand National Guard men and women.\n  The new threat we are facing in Iraq with shoulder-fired missiles is \na very ominous one. These are mobile, lightweight, missile systems that \ncan be operated by one person. They can be transported in a vehicle, \neasily hidden. They can be popped up, made ready to be fired within \nminutes, and then they\n\n[[Page S13772]]\n\ncan be discarded, and the individual can flee. It is a very effective \nweapon.\n  Indeed, one of the ironies of history is we supplied these types of \nweapons to the Mujahedin in Afghanistan, and they played havoc with \nSoviet helicopters, Soviet aircraft. It is one of the factors that \ncaused the Soviets to consider their efforts in Afghanistan as futile \nand to leave.\n  We have a new threat and that, I think, argues against not only new \ntactics and strategies but a reconsideration of the forces we have in \nIraq and the strength we have there. Again, I point out we have \napproximately 1 million tons of ammunition unsecured throughout Iraq. \nThere are about 100 of these sensitive sites reported by the New York \nTimes that are guarded around the clock. The rest are guarded \nintermittently. They are a source, one could infer, for some of the \nmunitions that are being used against our troops. Our convoys have been \nattacked by improvised explosive devices, by RPGs, and all of this is \nleading to the casualties we see each day. I think we should be very \nprudent and very responsible in terms of our end strength in the Army \nand our forces within Iraq. Both should be increased, I feel, and I am \nnot alone.\n\n  James Dobbins, a former Ambassador, who is one of the leading experts \non reconstruction, said, in his words:\n\n       Everyone agrees that we need more troops on the ground in \n     Iraq; they just can't agree on more of what. Conservatives \n     want more U.S. troops. Liberals want more allied troops. The \n     Pentagon wants more Iraqi troops. My view is that they're \n     probably all right: We're going to need all three.\n\n  Frankly, given the current end strength of the Army, we do not have \nenough to provide additional American forces on the ground on a \nsustainable rotation basis.\n  The Pentagon, Secretary Rumsfeld, is focusing on creating Iraqi \nsecurity forces. That is an important goal. But there seems to be some \nconfusion on the number of troops. This weekend, Secretary Rumsfeld \nstated that over 100,000 Iraqis were reporting to duty. Just a few days \nbefore that, Secretary Wolfowitz and Condoleezza Rice said it was \n80,000 or 90,000. The numbers are unclear.\n  What is also unclear is the capabilities of these troops. The Iraqi \nArmy was being trained in 8 week courses and is now being trained in \nabout 6 weeks so we can get them into the field. This raises questions \nof reliability, questions of adaptability, all of these things.\n  Many suggest that we increase our international component. Frankly, \nthe Turkish troops were apparently willing to come, but the Iraqis \nobjected. It has been reported that Portugal and Bangladesh have \ndecided against contributing troops. South Korea is delaying its \ndecision. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the burden will fall \nnot just in the next few months but in the next few years on the United \nStates forces. As a result, I do believe we need more forces.\n  We are beginning to see already the stress on our National Guard and \nReserves. Currently, more than 130,000 Guard and Reserve soldiers and \nairmen are deployed. Approximately 29,000 National Guard soldiers are \nin Iraq and Kuwait. More than 10,000 Reserve forces are in Kuwait, \nAfghanistan, and Iraq. We also have National Guard forces in Bosnia, \nKosovo, and the Sinai.\n  This is tremendous stress. We are seeing, for the first time, \nreports--although they are still preliminary--that National Guard units \nare not able to make their recruiting goals.\n  There was a report on NBC News by Jim Avila, who referred to:\n\n       New figures, released this week, show the Army National \n     Guard nearly 10,000 short of its 2003 goal of 62,000 \n     recruits.\n\n  Those are the first signs that recruiting and retention are becoming \na problem in the Reserve component. They will only be made up, I think, \nby increasing the number of Active Forces we have.\n  There is a very difficult challenge for Reserve Forces. They have a \ncareer. They have families. They are not full-time soldiers, although \nthey are excellent soldiers, they are professionals. They have taken \ntheir missions on with great skill and great patriotism. In fact, we \ncould not perform the missions of the modern military today without the \nReserve and National Guard. But they have separate careers and separate \nlives, and eventually they will have to give some credit and some \ninterest to those separate lives.\n  I believe very strongly we have to ultimately increase the end \nstrength of our military forces. I regret it is not in this \nsupplemental. I will endeavor in the future to continue to urge this \nposition. I hope someday we will have it.\n  In the meantime, I thank, again, the chairman and Senator Byrd for \ntheir efforts. Because ultimately this bill is putting resources into \nthe hands of our fighting men and women who are engaged in combat \ntoday, I will support the measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe $87 billion supplemental conference report, and I want to take a \nfew minutes to explain why I support this conference report, even \nthough I have serious misgivings about some of its provisions.\n  I support this conference report because I believe the United States \nnow has an inescapable responsibility in Iraq.\n  We must stay the course and to do that, we must provide our troops in \nthe field with the resources necessary to complete their mission. The \ndefense title of this conference report provides nearly $65 billion for \nthat purpose, including important funding to improve the safety of our \ntroops by securing Iraqi small arms caches which are the source of much \nof the munitions used to attack U.S. forces.\n  We must rebuild Iraq's infrastructure and assist in resurrecting a \nviable Iraqi economy. We must see that a stable government is put in \nplace. We must prevent civil war. And we must see to it that Iraq does \nnot become a base for terror and instability throughout the region.\n  Nothing could be more disastrous for U.S. national security than, \nafter bringing about regime change, if our nation were to turn tail and \nrun and not accomplish the mission.\n  We would send precisely the wrong message to both our friends and our \nfoes around the world.\n  If the United States were to pull out without completing the job, I \nbelieve that we would see civil war and a return of the Baathist \nregime, perhaps headed by someone as bad or worse than Saddam.\n  For many of us, the challenges that we now face in Iraq illustrate \nthe shortcomings of a doctrine of unilateral preemption and preventive \nwar.\n  When we use force against a state and seek regime change we are left \nwith an inescapable role: Nation building.\n  This conference report is not perfect. Far from it. But it is \ncritical that we do not leave the hard work of post-war reconstruction \nundone.\n  When the supplemental bill was before the Senate, I did what I could \nto see if it was possible to structure at least some of this package as \nloans--and the Senate adopted an amendment which would have made $10 \nbillion of the reconstruction loans.\n  That provision, unfortunately, was dropped in Conference over my \nobjections and those of many of my colleagues.\n  I also worked with Senator Domenici to include additional reporting \nlanguage in this bill. This amendment, which was adopted by the Senate, \nprovided Congress and the American people real oversight over what the \nadministration's plans were in Iraq and how the money in this \nsupplemental was being spent.\n  Unfortunately, many of these reporting requirements were also \nstripped out in conference.\n  I also supported efforts to include provisions in this bill so that \nthere would be greater international contributions to the \nreconstruction effort, to see if Iraqi oil could be quickly bought on-\nline to underwrite costs, to earmark some of the funds to be spent in \nIraq on domestic priorities instead, and to try to pay for this \nsupplemental by deferring the large tax cut for those Americans earning \nmore than $340,000 a year.\n  So if I had my way in putting this package together we would have \nbefore us a very different conference report.\n  Unfortunately, all these options were either debated and voted down \nby the Senate when we considered this bill earlier or, in the case of \nthe loan provision, stripped out by the Republican majority in \nconference.\n  I would also like to note a provision of this bill that strikes close \nto home\n\n[[Page S13773]]\n\nfor me and my constituents. I am pleased that the conference report \nprovides $500 million for FEMA disaster relief activities associated \nwith recently declared disasters, such as the wildfires in California. \nRepresentative Jerry Lewis and I sponsored this funding as a \ndownpayment on what we all can expect to be a costly reconstruction \neffort in southern California. We in California are resilient, and I \nhope that this funding will help us to bounce back quickly from the \ncatastrophic fires still burning in California.\n  So in the final analysis, even without the inclusion of many of the \nIraq provisions I would have liked to have seen in this bill, I have \ncome to the conclusion that the United States must step up to the plate \nand meet its obligations in Iraq. The United States must win the peace \nin Iraq.\n  The United States must also seek to repair the breach that exists \nbetween our nation and some of our friends and allies in the \ninternational community.\n  As I stated on the floor earlier when the Senate considered this \nsupplemental, it is my sincere hope that in the reconstruction of Iraq, \nthe United States can repair some of this damage by working with our \nallies, the United Nations, and the international community.\n  The United States has lost a great deal of good will throughout the \nworld in the past year due to the perception that the American attitude \nhas become ``our way or the highway.''\n  We must signal clearly and unambiguously that our attitude has \nchanged and that we welcome the full partnership of others in the \ninternational community in Iraq.\n  On balance I find that I must support this conference report. Our \nnational security and the safety and well-being of our troops demand \nit.\n  Indeed, how the United States approaches the reconstruction of Iraq \nmay well prove to be one of the greatest tests of American leadership \nsince World War II.\n  To fail in this endeavor could well escalate chaos in the Middle East \nand Gulf region, lead to civil war in Iraq, and allow Iraq to become a \nbase for terror. I believe that it is important that Congress supports \nthis conference report and that we stay the course in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the assistance in this supplemental \nappropriations bill for victims of Hurricane Isabel and the California \nwildfires is certainly much needed and justified. Both of these \ndisasters were vividly portrayed in images on television, newspapers, \nand the Internet. Those images drove home the need for help.\n  We have a strong history of providing assistance from the Federal \nGovernment to help our citizens survive and recover from natural \ndisasters. As nearly all previous disaster aid, the assistance in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill for both Hurricane Isabel and the \nCalifornia wildfires does not require a budget offset.\n  We did not tell the victims of the hurricane or the wildfires that in \ntheir time of need they had to go find money elsewhere in the Federal \nbudget. We did not tell these victims of disaster they had to give up \nsomething that they had coming to them in order to get the help they \ncritically need.\n  Last year, many States across the middle of the United States were \nsuffering from a terrible drought, and there were additional \nagricultural disasters in other parts of our country.\n  Now, drought is not as spectacular as a hurricane or a fire; that is \ntrue. The damage occurs over several months, even years, not days or \nweeks. But the financial and human losses are still acutely real--lost \nfarms and ranches as they are driven out of business. Farmers and \nranchers have to sell off cattle and other livestock. They have \ndramatically reduced crop yields or no crops at all, just as if a fire \nhad gone through. There are huge financial losses to farmers and \nranchers all over our country. There are the loss of homes, loss of \nbusinesses, impacts on local communities that may never come back. \nThere is heavy damage to the economy in the drought areas. Without \nhelp, many lives would be dramatically changed for the worse in these \ndrought-stricken areas.\n  Last year, we were told by the White House the only way we could get \nthis disaster aid for agriculture was to cut back on the farm bill we \nhad passed just several months before. For years, agricultural disaster \naid has been treated as emergency spending--because it is--and not \nneeding an offset in the budget. That is what we did for the wildfires \nin California and Hurricane Isabel that hit our Nation's Capital and \ncommunities on the east coast. We treated it as emergency spending.\n  In other words, in effect the White House said the victims of drought \nover the last couple years on farms and ranches, the victims of other \nnatural kinds of disasters in agriculture, had to finance their own \nhelp by cutting the agricultural programs so important to their \nlivelihood.\n  So in the omnibus appropriations bill last February, agricultural \ndisaster assistance was financed by cutting the farm bill. Disaster \nassistance last year was estimated at $3.1 billion. To generate an \noffset of that amount, the conservation title of the farm bill was cut \nback. The Conservation Security Program was capped and its funding \nsharply reduced to pay for that $3.1 billion.\n  It is ironic and shortsighted that the funds for agricultural natural \ndisasters would be taken from the conservation title of the farm bill. \nDrought is, of course, devastating to soil, plants, and animals. But it \nis conservation practices that help farmers and ranchers conserve and \nenhance natural resources and, in fact, lessen the potential impacts of \nfuture drought and natural disasters.\n  This support for conservation is much like the mitigation money the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency provides. When FEMA responds to a \nnatural disaster, the Agency also provides additional dollars for \nmeasures to avoid losses in future similar disasters in that State. The \nfarm bill's conservation programs likewise guard against future \ndisaster losses.\n  Taking money from the farm bill's conservation title to pay for \ndisaster assistance in the omnibus bill set a very bad precedent, one \nthat will haunt us in the future when we seek to respond to natural \ndisasters affecting agriculture. That action in the omnibus bill \nignored the way previous agricultural disaster aid had been funded as \nemergency spending. It is also exactly the opposite of the policy we \nfollow for nonagricultural disasters.\n  Fortunately, this precedent was not followed in funding relief for \nHurricane Isabel and the California wildfire victims, and it should not \nhave been. Those disasters were emergencies, and we should pay for the \nassistance by treating it as emergency spending, which we are doing in \nthis supplemental appropriations bill.\n  By the same token, farmers and ranchers should not have been forced \nto pay for their own disaster assistance earlier this year. That was an \nemergency, and it should have been funded just as disaster aid in this \nbill was funded as an emergency.\n  So, Mr. President, I did not seek in any way to hold up this \nsupplemental appropriations bill. There are many parts of it I was \nopposed to in terms of the way we are writing a blank check for some of \nthe Iraq rebuilding. And I do not mean to impede emergency funding for \nCalifornia or Maryland or Virginia or any other States that were hit by \nthese natural disasters. These are emergencies. We should respond as a \nnation to these emergencies.\n\n  The terrible precedent of taking money from the farm bill earlier \nthis year should be reversed, and the conservation funds that were \ntaken away from farmers and ranchers should be replaced. The damage to \nthe Conservation Security Program should be repaired so the program is \nmade whole, as it was enacted in the farm bill, passed by the Senate, \npassed by the House, and signed by the President. The President had \nloudly proclaimed as one of the reasons he was signing it the strong \nconservation measures in that farm bill.\n  Because of the way the money was taken out in the omnibus \nappropriations bill, as it came back to us as a conference report, \nthere was no ability for any of us to amend it or to have an up-or-down \nvote on whether or not we wanted to have emergency funding taken out of \nthe farm bill for disaster aid. But that is how it was done.\n  So, I take this time to point out the difference between how we are \npaying for the assistance for the wildfires in California and Hurricane \nIsabel here on\n\n[[Page S13774]]\n\nthe east coast and how farmers and ranchers were treated earlier this \nyear when they critically needed disaster assistance. Their disasters \nwere perhaps not as visually dramatic as the wildfires or the hurricane \nbut they nonetheless had devastating losses from disaster that had \ntaken place over months, sometimes over years.\n  Our nation's farmers and ranchers should have been treated the same \nway as the victims of the wildfires in California or the victims here \non the east coast of Hurricane Isabel. It is up to us to restore the \nfunding that was taken away, to make farmers and ranchers whole, to \nmake our conservation programs whole, and to recognize that when we \nhave emergencies, when we have disasters, regardless of whether it is \nin California or New York or Iowa or Florida, or wherever it might be, \nregardless of whether it is homeowners or businesses or communities, \nyacht basins or beach homes or whatever, farmers and ranchers ought to \nbe treated the same way with emergency funding.\n  So again, I will not do anything to hold up the bill or anything like \nthat, but I just wanted to make my point that we have to treat everyone \nthe same in this country when it comes to disasters.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, today we cast our votes with heavy \nhearts. The memory of what happened almost 48 hours ago, thousands of \nmiles away in Iraq, is still seared on our minds. What happened to our \nsixteen brave soldiers wears on us all, as do the memories of all of \nthe lives that have been lost in this conflict. Our thoughts and \nprayers go out to those family members and friends who lost a loved one \nin Iraq, and we pray for a complete recovery for all who struggle at \nthis hour.\n  Since ``Operation Iraqi Freedom'' began, we have proven yet again \nthat the men and women in our military are the best trained, equipped, \nand motivated in the world. Their service and accomplishments make \nevery American proud, and we pray for their safety and their safe \nreturn home.\n  Today, Members of Congress must uphold one of the highest \nresponsibilities we have: to support our men and women in the military \nwho risk their lives to serve their country. In this case, supporting \nour military means rejecting a policy that is clearly failing. We must \ndemand that this President change course.\n  That is why today, I vote against the President's request for $87 \nbillion for Iraq.\n  For more than a year I have argued that the United States has a \nspecial responsibility to help build a stable and prosperous Iraq that \nis at peace with itself and its neighbors. Fulfilling this \nresponsibility is not only the right thing to do for the people of \nIraq, who suffered under Saddam Hussein and now struggle with the \nconsequences of war; rebuilding Iraq will also make the Middle East \nmore stable and the American people more secure.\n  We must give our troops all the resources and help they need. I \nbelieve that we should have given the money designated for our troops \nright away--not make the support they deserve contingent on a failed \nreconstruction plan.\n  Given these failures, we cannot allow this President simply to call \non Congress to give him funding without demanding fundamental changes. \nOur troops will not be safe--and their mission will not be successful--\nas long as this administration stubbornly clings to a policy based on \npoor planning, faulty assumptions, botched diplomacy and failed \nleadership.\n  We need a new policy to win the peace in Iraq--a policy that meets \nthree core goals: to bring other countries and international \norganizations into the effort; to hand over more authority to the Iraqi \npeople with specific benchmarks; and to end the insider deals for \nIraq's reconstruction and the appearance that this war was about oil or \npaying off the President's friends.\n  We must immediately take three concrete steps:\n  First, we must take the American face off this occupation. The United \nStates should immediately transfer the oversight of Iraq civilian \nreconstruction to the United Nations. President Bush waited too long to \ngo to the United Nations to ask for help after the war. Even now, he \nremains unwilling to offer our allies a role in the oversight of Iraq \nthat they are reasonably demanding before putting more of their money \nand troops in Iraq. We have a UN Security Council resolution that \nallows others a seat at the table--but this President still refuses to \nask. The senior civilian in Iraq should answer to the United States and \nits allies on the United Nations Security Council--not Secretary \nRumsfeld.\n  We must launch a serious diplomatic effort to get more international \ntroops and resources to Iraq--an effort that will not only reduce the \nburden on our troops and American taxpayers but also transform the \nreconstruction into a genuine international mission. America's military \npresence in Iraq cannot be indefinite. As I have long argued, we should \nbegin discussions immediately to get organizations like NATO more \ninvolved, as they are today in Afghanistan. We also need to accelerate \nthe creation of Iraq's own security forces. Clearly, this \nadministration failed our troops by impulsively disbanding the Iraqi \nArmy, a move that not only left many Iraqis angry and unemployed, but \ntook away a pool of Iraqis ready to help take control of their own \nsecurity.\n  Second, with the help of the United Nations, we must outline a clear \nroadmap for the transfer of authority to the Iraqi people so that they \ncan take control over their own destiny. This includes establishing \nspecific timetables to transfer authority to the Iraqis to give them \nmore control over their economy, civilian authority, and security. To \nget this process moving, we should ask the United Nations to convene an \ninternational conference to work with the Iraqis to set priorities and \nestablish clear benchmarks for when such goals will be achieved.\n  Finally, we must put an end to the special interest feeding frenzy \nthis administration has created over Iraq's reconstruction. The \nenormous influence of corporate lobbyists in this administration, on \neverything from energy policy to health care, may dull our capacity to \nbe shocked. But it should not. Halliburton, the Vice President's former \ncompany, has already received billions of dollars in non-competitive, \nno-bid contracts.\n  The President's supporters compare the rebuilding of Iraq to the \nMarshall Plan. But after World War II, Congress established a special \ncommittee to ensure that the allocation of reconstruction grants was \nfree from war profiteering. Before billions more flow into Iraq, we \nshould set up an independent commission for the same purpose.\n  I believe that we were right to act against the threat of Saddam \nHussein. But this President's failures in Iraq are undermining many of \nthe goals we meant to accomplish by eliminating his brutal regime.\n  When democracy is threatened by tyranny, America is there to defeat \nit. It is part of our history. But when the time came for us to rebuild \nthose countries, we did so with integrity, honesty, and patience. The \nworld was by our side. Our soldiers stood with others to build roads, \nbridges, hospitals, and schools. That is how we helped Japan and \nGermany recover from World War II. That is how Bosnia and Kosovo \nrecover today. And that is what we must do for Iraq with the world at \nour side, a new plan in place, so that America is respected and \nstrong.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the final \npassage of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3289, the fiscal \nyear 2004 Iraq supplemental. I support this bill because it provides \nthe resources necessary to support our gallant troops who are working \nin Iraq and Afghanistan to rid the world of the scourge of \ninternational terrorism and to recover from Hussein's corruption.\n  This bill provides our forces with $65.7 billion to continue their \ncampaign to restore peaceful and prosperous societies in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. As our troops continue to root out the remnants of \nHussein's horrific regime and work to ensure stability in Iraq, we must \ndo no less than provide them with the most advanced technology, the \nmost reliable force protection equipment, and the best personal care \navailable. I believe that we all fundamentally agree that the funds \nrequested to support our military forces in the field must be made \navailable immediately.\n\n[[Page S13775]]\n\n  However, as we are all aware, there was considerable debate when it \ncame to the $18.6 billion this bill provides for reconstruction efforts \nin Iraq--specifically regarding whether the funds should be provided as \nloans rather than a grant. I maintained throughout the debate that some \nportion, if not all, of these reconstruction funds should be in the \nform of loans.\n  Many argued that providing loans was not feasible--that it unduly \nburdened the Iraqi people. But after considering the totality of what \nwe were talking about--that American men and women are putting \nthemselves in harm's way day in and day out in securing the liberation \nof the people of Iraq and that we are also in the process of spending \n$100 billion and more for that very same purpose, I concluded that \nasking the Iraqi people to be responsible for a portion of their \nreconstruction was only fair.\n  It remains my belief that the American people are not making a \ndistinction between the money we are spending to support our troops and \nthe additional funds being proposed to rebuild Iraq when it comes to \nthe total measure of our nation's sacrifice toward this cause. So \nasking Iraq to repay one-tenth of that $100 billion in the form of \nloans seemed eminently reasonable to me.\n  Some also argued that there was not a legitimate government in Iraq \nthat could obligate the nation to the repayment of loans. But the \ninternational community, through U.N. Security Council Resolution 1511, \nspecifically acknowledged that the Iraqi Governing Council and its \nministers are the principal bodies of the Iraqi interim administration \nwhich ``embodies the sovereignty of the State of Iraq during the \ntransitional period until an internationally recognized, representative \ngovernment is established.''\n  Finally, still others maintained that providing loans to Iraq would \nrun counter to the U.S. policy of shifting away from loans for \ndevelopment because of the ineffectiveness of such programs in the \npast. But that policy is predicated on the fact that many heavily-\nindebted, poor countries do not have the resources to both service debt \nand institute economic and social reform. Iraq, in contrast, is \ntremendously rich in resources to an extent sufficient to service this \ndebt and continue to make future investments in their own \ninfrastructure.\n\n  Therefore, after careful consideration and many discussions with my \ncolleagues and constituents, I worked to author, with Senators Bayh, \nBen Nelson, Chambliss, Ensign, Dorgan, Lindsey Graham, and Collins, an \namendment that designated $10 billion of the Iraqi reconstruction funds \nas a loan. However, we also included a ``trigger with a purpose''--\ndesigned to both encourage existing creditor countries to forgive at \nleast 90 percent of the debt owed on loans that were made to the former \nregime of Saddam Hussein, and to foster within Iraq itself a greater \nsense of responsibility toward, and a stake in, their own long-term \nrebuilding success.\n  I was heartened when, by a vote of 51-47, the Senate passed our \namendment and included it in the bill sent to conference. However, \nduring the conference, conferees decided to provide the entirety of \nreconstruction funds to Iraq as a grant rather than a loan and removed \nour amendment from the final report. I am extremely disappointed that \nconferees voted to remove the Senate provision in spite of the \nsubsequent House of Representatives vote instructing their conferees to \naccept our amendment.\n  Mr. President, I still do not believe that the provision of $10 \nbillion in loans to the Iraqi people for the reconstruction of their \nnation would have placed an undue burden on them or their economy. \nInstead, by investing these loans in Iraq, we would have acted to \nrestore their national pride and enhance their sense of responsibility \nas we worked toward the common goal of a free and stable Iraq.\n  With this bill, we are financing the restoration of a peaceful and \nprosperous society in Iraq and while I would have preferred this bill \ninclude provisions to ensure the U.S. taxpayer did not shoulder the \nburden alone, this bill includes the funds necessary to support our \ntroops in the field. We must commit the resources necessary for our \nbrave young men and women to carry out the task of making the world a \nsafer place a task they are ready for and a task they are performing \nmagnificently.\n  For that reason, I support this conference report and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when the Senate voted on this \nsupplemental bill in October, I expressed my serious reservations about \nthe overall direction of U.S. policy in Iraq and the astounding \nfinancial burden being imposed on the American people as a result of \nour misguided policies. Yet ultimately I voted in favor of the bill \nbecause I wanted to provide important resources for our troops on the \nground and because I recognize that bringing stability to Iraq is in \nour national interest.\n  At that time, I made it clear that I would not be able to support \nfuture funding for the Iraq mission if the administration failed to \ntake concrete steps to put that mission on a sounder footing.\n  Today, as we consider this conference report, my reservations have \nonly multiplied.\n  Under intense pressure from the White House, the conferees have \nstripped a reasonable and appropriate Senate provision that would have \nconverted a portion of the reconstruction grants to loans. This \nprovision, which was designed to encourage international debt \nforgiveness, did not involve any U.S. decisions about Iraq's future oil \nrevenues, rightly leaving those decisions to the Iraqi people. The \nadministration's refusal to accept this sound provision, combined with \nthe disappointing showing at the recent donors conference in Madrid, \nsuggests to me that the White House continues to set this country on an \nunsustainable course. The administration's failure to get more support \nin Madrid and continued insistence that the American people can and \nshould shoulder the lion's share of the burden reveal a failure to \ngrasp the reality of the current situation and the urgent need to \nrethink their approach.\n  I am also disappointed that the conferees chose to strip out my \namendment, which was adopted here in the Senate, to help ease some of \nthe strain that has been placed on the families of our military \npersonnel. My amendment allowed a spouse, son, daughter, or parent who \nalready qualifies for benefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act \nto use their benefits for issues arising from one additional set of \ncircumstances--the deployment of a family member. Our military \nfamilies--be they active duty, Guard, or Reserve--are coping with \ntremendous strains and a great deal of unpredictability. This Congress \nshould be working to help them, and I will continue to pursue this \nissue.\n  I am pleased that my amendment to establish an Inspector General for \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority was retained in this conference \nreport. Though some changes were made to my proposal, the heart of the \neffort survived and in some cases was strengthened, and American \ntaxpayers will now have someone watching how their dollars are spent in \nIraq. We have sorely needed vigorous accountability and transparency \nmechanisms to oversee our policy in Iraq for some time. It is my hope \nthat regular reports from the Inspector General can help the \nadministration and the Congress to clean up waste and abuse and to \nimprove our overall performance when it comes to reconstruction \nefforts.\n  Transparency is also important in our representations to the Iraqi \npeople. I am pleased that another of my amendments, which requires the \nCoalition Provisional Authority to provide regular updates on the \nstatus and use of Iraqi oil revenues in Arabic on the Internet, was \nretained. Honest and regular information is our best weapon to combat \nthose who would play to Iraqis' worst suspicions in order to harm \nAmericans.\n  I am also pleased that this conference report recognizes the \nimportance of bolstering U.S. efforts to help bring stability to \nAfghanistan, and to assist the war-torn states of Liberia and Sudan. \nWhile the administration has focused tremendous attention on Iraq, the \nglobal fight against terrorism is still our first foreign policy \npriority. Helping weak and failing states to recover is an important \npart of that effort.\n\n[[Page S13776]]\n\n  But despite these positive elements, it is extremely difficult to \nhave confidence in this conference report. Rather than listening to \ncongressional reservations, rather than hearing what Members of this \nbody had to say when we spoke about our constituents' profound sense of \nunease about our policy, those responsible for directing U.S. action in \nIraq appear to have heard nothing at all--not the voices of the \nAmerican people, not the voices of the Congress, not the voices coming \nfrom Iraq itself, where horrible violence continues to take American \nand Iraqi lives. In the days since the Senate voted on this bill, the \nadministration has failed to grasp the need for a fundamental change in \ndirection necessary to ensure that all of the resources that this bill \nprovides at taxpayer expense will be used wisely.\n   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to report on the \nbudgetary effect of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3289, \nmaking emergency supplemental appropriations for defense and for the \nreconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n   The President's supplemental appropriations request totaled $87.0 \nbillion in budget authority and $36.8 billion in outlays for FY 2004 \nfor ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the reconstruction \nof Iraq. The conference report provides $87.5 billion in budget \nauthority and $37.1 billion in outlays.\n  Most of the funds in the conference report, $83.8 billion in budget \nauthority, are designated emergencies under section 502(c) of the 2004 \nBudget Resolution. None of these emergency funds count for purposes of \nsections 302, 303, 311, and 401 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \nand sections 504 and 505 of the 2004 budget resolution.\n   The conference report also contains non-emergency spending totaling \n$3.8 billion in budget authority. Non-emergency appropriations are \nthose appropriations that were not requested by the President and not \ndeclared a contingent emergency. Non-emergency appropriations are \nscored against the appropriate subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. I will \nremind the Senate at the appropriate time about any points of order \nthat apply to subsequent bills.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       H.R. 3289, EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL FOR IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n                     [Fiscal Year 2004, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Discretionary\n                                                            spending\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal H.R. 3289, Conference Report:\n    Budget authority.................................             87,547\n    Outlays..........................................             37,103\nEmergencies in H.R. 3289, Conference Report: a\n    Budget authority.................................             83,782\n    Outlays b........................................

Not Available.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a bloody tyrant rules no longer in Iraq. A \nman who without qualm or regret murdered hundreds of thousands of his \nown citizens has been removed from power.\n  The perpetrator of one of the past century's most gruesome crimes \nagainst humanity, the use of chemical weapons on innocent Kurdish \ncivilians, no longer is free to pursue such weapons.\n  The aggressor in the Gulf War, who a decade ago invaded his neighbor, \nonly to be driven out by a mighty coalition, no longer threatens the \nvolatile region of the Middle East.\n  The record is replete with the case against Saddam Hussein. The mass \ngraves are laid open, and only now are the thousands of widows, mothers \nand orphans--victims all--able to openly grieve.\n  Who here will ever forget the image of the desperate citizens of \nBaghdad, clawing at the ground in the hopeless search for hidden \nprisons that might hold their loves ones.\n  Mass graves have been found throughout the country, the unmistakable \nmark of history's tyrants.\n  As the regime of Saddam Hussein has come to an end, the difficult \nwork has only just begun to ensure that we never again witness such \nhorrors.\n  As this legislation proves, in both Iraq and Afghanistan this will be \na costly effort in treasure and in time. But most costly of all are the \nlost lives of our men and women serving on the front line of the war \nagainst terror, whose devotion to our country may be matched in the \nhistory of the nation, but never surpassed.\n  These men and women, many just at the beginning of their adult lives, \nserve an ideal as old as the Republic. In the fight against terror, \nthey risk their lives so that we may live safe.\n  Each and every one of them are citizens, parents, spouses, and \nsomebody's child. Their sacrifice is our loss. We mourn the death of \neach of them.\n  The resources this legislation provides will move both Afghanistan \nand Iraq decisively toward stability and freedom; toward modernity and \ndemocracy.\n  We have worked long hours on this legislation, and we had some \ndifficult votes over the course of the past 4 weeks. Although I am \ncertain it is not the last debate we will have on Iraq, I am grateful \nfor the efforts of the managers on both sides, and for the cooperation \nof the Democratic leader, in getting this emergency package through.\n  In particular, I commend Senator Stevens, Senator Warner, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator McConnell for their tireless efforts to pass this \nemergency funding request.\n  Replacing the defeated regime of Saddam Hussein with a stable \ndemocratic Iraq is an essential turning point in bringing modernity and \nfreedom to a part of the world that has produced extremism and \nterrorism for decades.\n  Mr. President, yesterday's losses were the latest tragic reminder \nthat we are at war in Afghanistan and Iraq. The funds in this \nlegislation provide both direct support for our soldiers as well as an \ninvestment in creating a safer environment in those countries where \nthey serve. This legislation will make them safer and get them home \nsooner.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are deployed around \nthe world in defense of the principles of democracy and our great \nNation. Today the Senate will pass the conference report to H.R. 3289, \nthe FY04 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Iraq, Afghanistan and the \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  The conference report does not include a key provision adopted by the \nSenate which would have required $10 billion in Iraq reconstruction \nfunds to be used as a loan rather than as a grant unless 90 percent of \nforeign creditors cancel Iraqi debt. I voted for this provision because \nI believed that it would have helped to provide Iraqis with meaningful \nparticipation in the reconstruction of their country by making them \nresponsible for the funding. I am disappointed that the provision has \nbeen eliminated, but I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues to address the issue of how to appropriately respond to \ncontinued requests for Federal dollars to reconstruct Iraq.\n  Last year, as the Senate debated authorization of the use of force in \nIraq, one of my concerns was our planning of, and responsibility for, \nthe reconstruction of Iraq. Before we even engaged in this conflict, I \nasked administration officials about post-war Iraq plans. I was \nrepeatedly told that the appropriate officials were working hard to \ndevelop such plans and that details were not necessary because there \nwere too many unpredictable factors to consider. Well, here we are, 4 \nmonths after President George W. Bush declared major combat in Iraq to \nbe over. We are being told that our troops will be in Iraq for an \nextended period of time. American soldiers continue to be wounded and \nkilled almost every day. We are faced with open-ended requests for \nbillions of dollars to reconstruct Iraq.\n  There seems to be reluctance on the part of our international \ncolleagues to\n\n[[Page S13777]]\n\ncontribute and participate in the rebuilding of Iraq due to U.S. \ncontrol and authority over the reconstruction funds and plans. It is \nimperative that we recruit other countries to assist us in peacekeeping \nactivities to relieve our military members so that they can return \nhome. It is just as imperative that we allow other countries to \ncontribute to the reconstruction effort to relieve the American \ntaxpayer of what has been and will continue to be a monumental \nexpenditure of Federal funds in Iraq. The United States must be willing \nto take the necessary actions to make such international cooperation a \nreality.\n  During the Senate's consideration of President Bush's FY04 \nsupplemental request, I voted in support of S. 1689 because I believed \nthe Senate was successful in adding provisions to the legislation to \nsupport our deployed troops; increase accountability and transparency \nin post-war Iraq contracts; improve planning for post-war Iraq; and \nreduce the burden on the American Taxpayer of the costs stemming from \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble \nEagle and the global war on terrorism on the American taxpayer. While I \nam pleased to learn that the conference report retains provisions to \nsupport our troops such as the one-year demonstration program for \nenhanced TRICARE eligibility for certain National Guardsmen and \nReservists, the retroactive reimbursement for soldiers who paid for \ntheir food while being medically treated, and the continued \nauthorization for Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Pay at \nincreased rates for FY04, I am concerned that the provisions adopted \nby the Senate which were eliminated will make it more difficult for us \nto ensure appropriate oversight, accountability, and success in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and the global war on terror.\n\n  I am particularly disappointed by the conference committee's decision \nto eliminate the provision proposed by Senator Jack Reed to increase \nArmy end-strength by 10,000. I remain increasingly concerned about the \nstrain of the increased OPTEMPO on the Army. I firmly believe we need \nto increase end-strength and look forward to working with my colleagues \nand the Army to address this matter. I understand that General \nSchoomaker has directed a study of this issue and I look forward to the \nresults of this study.\n  Again, I fully support our men and women in the military. For that \nreason, I fully support the $51.4 billion for ongoing military \noperations in Iraq, $10.5 billion for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and \n$3.6 billion for homeland defense. I will work diligently with my \ncolleagues to ensure that our Armed Forces are provided with the \ntraining and equipment necessary for them to accomplish their mission \nso that they can return home safely to their families in a timely \nmanner.\n  I support the $5 billion for security training for Iraqi security \nforces. I remain concerned, however, with the amount of funding that \nhas been designated for reconstruction of Iraq, particularly since we \nhave been assured that this supplemental only represents the most \npressing reconstruction needs for the next 12 months and does not cover \nall reconstruction needs. At the same time, we have pressing domestic \nneeds including the need to fund an additional $1.3 billion for medical \ncare for veterans. We have a number of educational and social programs \nthat are in definite need of increased funding. We must be responsible \nstewards of taxpayers' money.\n  I voted in opposition to authorizing the use of military force \nagainst Iraq in October 2002. I voted this way because I believed we \nhad not yet utilized all of our options at the international level. \nHowever, once the decision to utilize military force was made, I fully \nsupported the men and women who were deployed in this effort. We are \nnow responsible to ensure that they have the equipment and resources to \nundertake their mission in the safest manner possible. Our leadership \nof the coalition forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom also makes the \nUnited States accountable for the restoration and reconstruction of \nIraq. Again, I believe we must work closely with our allies and \nneighbors in the international community for us to successfully bring \nout troops back home. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nfind a way to accomplish such a difficult challenge.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Senate-House conference \nagreement on the $87 Supplemental Appropriations bill for Iraq.\n  When the Senate voted on this legislation on October 17, I opposed it \nbecause it provided no effective conditions for genuine international \nparticipation in the reconstruction of Iraq or other important steps \nneeded to win the peace. Our troops in Iraq are doing a remarkable job \nunder enormously difficult circumstances, and I wholeheartedly support \nthem. But it is an abdication of our responsibility in Congress to \nprovide an $87 billion blank check for a failed policy.\n  The administration needs to go back to the drawing board and adopt a \nnew Iraq policy that is worthy of the sacrifices our soldiers are \nmaking--a policy that restores America as a respected member of the \nfamily of nations and make it easier, not far more difficult, to win \nthe war against terrorism.\n  The Bush administration still does not have a realistic plan for \nachieving security and democracy in Iraq and our soldiers are paying \nfor it with their lives.\n  Since the Senate originally passed this legislation 2 weeks ago, the \nsituation in Iraq has further deteriorated. Forty-four more American \nsoldiers have been killed, and more than 300 American soldiers have \nbeen wounded. The United Nations did approve a new resolution on Iraq \nthat could have become the basis for genuine international support for \nour effort, but America still stands largely alone in Iraq. We have not \nmodified our unilateral position, and other nations are unwilling to \nassist us. The United Nations has pulled all of its staff out of \nBaghdad, and international NGOs are leaving as well.\n  America comprises 85 percent of the international forces on the \nground, and we are providing the lion's share--nearly $20 billion--for \nIraq's reconstruction. On October 23, at the international donors \nconference in Madrid, the administration came up short on international \ncontributions. Of the $55 billion needed for Iraq over the next 4 \nyears, the international community pledged only $13 billion, two-thirds \nof it in loans, not grants, over 5 years.\n  Over the same period of time, the security situation has gone from \nbad to worse. On October 25, a rocket propelled grenade in Tikrit \nstruck a Black Hawk helicopter, shortly after Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Wolfowitz left the area.\n  On October 26, rockets seriously damaged the Al Rashid Hotel in \nBaghdad, where Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was staying, killing one \nsoldier and missing Mr. Wolfowitz by only one floor. That same day, the \nDeputy Mayor of Baghdad was assassinated.\n  On October 27, coordinated attacks rocked Baghdad, targeting the \nheadquarters of the International Committee for the Red Cross and \nkilling 15 people. Three police stations were also attacked. On this \none bloody day, 34 people were killed, including one American soldier, \nand another 200 were wounded.\n  Just yesterday, a Chinook helicopter was shot down over Faluja, \nkilling 16 American soldiers, and wounding 20 more.\n  Meanwhile, the administration continues to claim that things are \ngoing well. Last week, President Bush claimed the attacks were a result \nof our successes on the ground in Iraq. In an October 29 interview, \nDeputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz said, ``Our side is winning.'' \nAfter the downing of the helicopter, Ambassador Bremer said, ``the \noverall security situation'' in Iraq ``is a lot better'' than when he \narrived in May.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that things are not going well in Iraq. \nThe administration must face reality. It cannot continue to cover up \nits failures and try to sell its rosy version of events by repeating it \nwith maximum frequency and volume, and minimum regard for realities on \nthe ground.\n  I support our men and women and uniform, but I oppose the \nadministration's policy, and I urge the administration to devise a \nrealistic plan for Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of comment today\n\n[[Page S13778]]\n\nabout what the President said and what he has not said. It should be \nremembered that the President celebrated the military victory, as he \nshould have, when he declared the end of the war. It was the end of the \nwar against Iraq's military.\n  Since that time, we have been at war against terrorists--organized \nterrorists, international terrorists--in Iraq. The greatest cunning and \ndeceit and trickery the world has seen are being shown in Iraq. Very \nclearly, it is not a military force that is opposing us today. We are \ntrying to protect our soldiers and the Iraqi people from terrorists.\n  That is why this bill is so important. It combines money for our \nmilitary to continue their activities with money for the Coalition \nProvisional Authority to move forward and help Iraq to build their own \nmilitary, to build a new form of government, and to train policemen, to \ntrain people to keep the peace.\n  I must say, it is strange to me when I hear people talk about this \nadministration lying. I have been sort of restrained concerning the \npast administration and lies. But I do believe it is entirely \ninappropriate to call the Commander in Chief a liar in terms of what \nhas happened in Iraq.\n  I am one of the eight Members, as I have told the Senate before, who \ngets the same briefings that are available to the President of the \nUnited States. I guess he might have a few more than we get, but we get \nthe general intelligence briefings. I firmly believed there were \nweapons of mass destruction there in Iraq. I still believe they had the \nability to conduct chemical warfare. After all, they did it twice. They \ndid it once in Iran, and they did it once to the Kurds in their own \ncountry.\n  We continue to hear how terrible it is, what is going on as far as \nthis administration is concerned in terms of the conduct of our forces \nand our people in Iraq after the war was over. The military collapsed. \nWe have been fighting terrorists constantly now.\n  When I woke up, as I did this morning, and read the paper about the \nterrible incident of shooting down a helicopter, that was not a \nmilitary action; that was a terrorist action. We have to adjust \nourselves to the fact that this is going on all over the world. It went \non in New York. It went on here in Washington. It went on in Indonesia. \nIt went on in the Philippines. It has certainly happened in Israel for \nyears now. But it is coming home now. We are being exposed to it. Our \nforces are exposed to it. Our people, our civilians are exposed to it. \nThe U.N. forces in Iraq have been exposed to it. Hundreds and hundreds \nof Iraqis have been killed since the end of the war by their own \nterrorists.\n  It is time for us to sit back and think about what we are doing \ntoday. Today, thankfully, this bill will pass. It will pass by \nunanimous consent--not one vote against it. Yet we have had 6 hours \nattacking the President because he asked for the money. Where are the \nvoices coming from? What am I hearing? People are willing to let the \nbill pass without a vote and yet they want to criticize the President \nfor asking for this money?\n  The Senate ought to reflect and think what we are doing. We still \nhave forces there, and we are going to have forces there. I haven't \nheard one Senator say we should leave--not one. There are those here \nwho voted against going to war. There are people here who voted for it. \nBut I don't know anyone here in this Chamber who voted against the war \non terrorism. That is what we are conducting now.\n\n  I am sad to say it looks as if it is going to go on for some time. \nOut by the elevators, I was just asked by the press, do I expect \nanother supplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan. Well, this is a \nsupplemental for 2004. We are here because the Members of the Senate on \nthat side of the aisle asked me to ask the President to submit a \nseparate bill for funds for Iraq and Afghanistan. He could have \nsubmitted that money request in the regular 2004 bill. But he \naccommodated the request that I carried to the White House, and he sent \nus a separate supplemental for Iraq and for Afghanistan and the war on \nterrorism.\n  We have been on it for a long time, much longer than I ever thought \nit would take to get this passed. Very clearly, we do not expect \nanother supplemental. We probably expect a request for fiscal year 2005 \nthat will start on October 1 of next year. But clearly, we ought to get \nthings into perspective.\n  Let me quote the President:\n\n       Heavy as they are, the costs of action must be weighed \n     against the price of inaction. . . .\n\n  Which President was that? It was President Clinton, 5 years ago. He \nstated these words as he informed the American people that he was \nordering a strike of military and security targets in Iraq. He ordered \nthem in Iraq 5 years ago--in 1998. Their mission was to take out \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons sites, and he so stated. The \nformer President sent forces into Iraq to attack nuclear, biological, \nand chemical weapons sites. That decision was based on a continuing \nlack of cooperation by Saddam Hussein with the international community.\n  In the last 6 months, President Bush is enforcing measures that were \nbegun in the Clinton administration. Yet to hear people talk here about \nthe lies and deception of this administration--what were those forces \nsent into Iraq for in 1998? It was based on the same kind of reports \nthat President Bush received before he ordered this action.\n  As many in the Senate know, some more powerfully than others, wars \nand their aftermath are not easy. They are disturbing. Watching our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines die or be wounded touches a \nsadness deep inside each of us. It touches even more those of us who \nhave been in war. There is nothing like going to bed at night and \nseeing an empty bed beside you.\n  As of today, a total of 376 Americans have been killed in Iraq. \nEvents such as yesterday, where 16 young soldiers were killed when \ntheir Chinook helicopter was hit by a missile, greatly trouble all of \nus. But each of these soldiers was doing his or her duty. We extend our \ndeepest sympathy to each of their families and friends and offer our \nthoughts and prayers through this difficult time for them.\n  Some of us have lived through this time again and again: World War \nII, Korea, Vietnam, you name it. My generation has seen a lot of wars. \nIt is not an easy thing to hear any report of Americans being killed. \nBut those people were doing their duty.\n  When a person puts on the uniform of the United States and raises his \nhand, it is even more somber than the one we give here because they \nknow they are laying their life on the line. These are all volunteers. \nNot one draftee is there. Every person there volunteered to serve in \nuniform.\n\n  We--this Congress, this President, and this country--went to war \nagainst Iraq to remove the regime of Saddam Hussein and give the Iraqi \npeople a chance at a better, freer life and the region an opportunity \nfor a more peaceful coexistence.\n  That is what President Clinton started in 1998. He made the strike \nagainst those areas because he firmly believed there were nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction there. Now, these \nevents don't happen overnight. I certainly was not expecting a war that \nwould be just sort of bedsheet clean, where you go to war and come back \nwith fresh bedsheets the next night. That is not the case. These things \ndo not occur overnight. The rebuilding of that nation and the recovery \nof the Iraqi people will take time. We have to provide the Iraqi people \ntime to heal and the resources and tools to create a new nation and a \nsecure and stable environment.\n  After World War II, we occupied Germany for 4 years before we even \nhad the Marshall plan. Before the Senate today is the plan for recovery \nof Iraq in the same year, without an army of occupation per se. We are \ntrying to help them rebuild their country and take it over and provide \ntheir own transition to a new form of government. I do believe the way \nwe are doing this--by strengthening a civil society, repairing schools \nand hospitals, treating waterways, restoring electricity, and \neventually assisting them with rebuilding their oil industry--will \nallow them to become self-sufficient.\n  I remember so well when Ambassador Bremer told me the problem was \nthat one day there is a pipeline blown up and they cannot ship the oil. \nSo they go about repairing the pipeline. The next day they blow up an \nelectric power station so the pumps won't work. This is terrorism. We \nmust realize we are not facing a military enemy; we are facing \nterrorists.\n\n[[Page S13779]]\n\n  Some of my colleagues don't believe in portions of this supplemental. \nMaybe some don't believe in it at all. But not one of them will vote \nagainst it--not one of them. That is their right. Some of them voted \nagainst giving the President the authority to go to war to topple the \nevil tyrant who we all realized was there. Regardless, our men and \nwomen are there now--military, civilian, and the U.N.--and those people \nmust have our support. They need the funds in this bill for body armor, \nfor what they call uparmored Humvees, and for explosive detection \nequipment, for all sorts of detection equipment.\n  The bill provides the funds to make the lives of our troops--both \nhere and in Iraq--safer and easier. We are providing better mess halls, \nquarters, TRICARE for members of the Guard and Reserve, and it \nmaintains increases in pay for family separation allowance and imminent \ndanger pay for our troops and their families, which was voted earlier \nthis year and would have expired had we not taken action.\n  I said this earlier today and I will repeat it. It is a simple and a \nstraightforward premise, as far as I am concerned. Security brings \nstability and stability fosters democracy. An Iraq that is well on its \nway to economic well-being and self-governance is the fastest way to \nget our military men and women home.\n  We as a nation have always had one goal--I said this also earlier \ntoday--and that is to finish what we start. We will not fail to do so \nnow. This supplemental will accomplish that task. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this bill. In effect, we have all done that by agreeing to \nthe unanimous consent request that there be no form of vote.\n  The Senator from Virginia is here----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been waiting. I notice we are going \nback and forth. I ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have had a substantial number of speakers on that \nside. The Senator from Virginia called and asked me to yield time. How \nmuch time is left, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 17 minutes 40 seconds, 10 of which \nis reserved for closing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are there 20 minutes reserved for closing and 17 left \nbesides that? Who controls that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 17\\1/2\\ \nminutes, of which 10 is reserved for closing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time does Senator Byrd have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 18 \nminutes, of which 10 are reserved for closing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not object to the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia speaking. I just ask that I be recognized after him.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are glad to do that. The Senator has 18 minutes.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I \nwish to commend him, Senator Byrd, Senator Inouye, and others, and our \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont, for working on this.\n  As we debate passage of this important emergency supplemental \nspending bill, I want to pause for a moment to acknowledge the tragic \nlosses our forces in Iraq suffered this weekend. I extend my heartfelt \nsympathies to the families and loved ones of those who died and those \nwho were injured. Indeed, we must pause to remember all who have \nperished, American, coalition partners, and Iraqis military and \ncivilian, who are fighting for freedom in Iraq and around the world in \nthe Global War on Terrorism. We are fortunate as a Nation to have these \ndedicated citizens who willingly make such great sacrifices to defend \nliberty and extend the cause of freedom.\n  I rise today in support of the conference report on emergency \nsupplemental funding for Iraq and Afghanistan for Fiscal Year 2004, and \nurge my colleagues to do the same. Seldom do we have choices before us \nas fundamental as this one. Our choices are to go forward, stand still, \nor quit. Two of these choices would represent failure. There is no \nchoice--failure is not an option. We must go forward; we must stay the \ncourse and win the peace for the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, as \nwell as for our own enduring interests in the Global War on Terrorism.\n  The timeliness and importance of this support for Iraq and \nAfghanistan cannot be overstated. The stakes in Iraq and Afghanistan \nare enormous. The military victories achieved by our Armed Forces, \ntogether with their coalition partners, must be secured.\n  We have achieved extraordinary success, in a relatively short period \nin Iraq. Saddam Hussein and the threat he posed are gone; the future is \nhopeful for the Iraqi people. We must send a strong message of resolve \nto our fellow countrymen, to our troops, to our coalition partners, and \nto the rest of the world, that we will see this through to completion--\nto win the peace.\n  We have had an unprecedented amount of debate on this funding \nrequest. General John Abizaid captured the essence and urgency of this \nsupplemental request when he stated, ``We can fight the terrorists her \n[in Iraq and Afghanistan], or we can fight them at home.'' I think we \nall prefer to fight them there and get the job done.\n  In recent weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet with several \nIraqi leaders, including members of the Iraqi Governing Council and \nrecently appointed ministers. They are clearly committed to achieving \ndemocracy, security and opportunity for the Iraqi people and deserve \nour support. The ministers are technically very well qualified and \ncommitted to building a new Iraq as soon as possible. These are not \npeople who have assumed positions of responsibility through tribal \naffiliations, nepotism and greed, as has been past practice in Iraq. \nThese are highly qualified public servants--17 of 25 ministers have \nPhDs in technical fields--who have subordinated their own personal \naspirations and accepted considerable personal risk to assume positions \nof high visibility, to build a new Iraq. Many have left lucrative \ncareers, comfort and families in other countries to return to their \nhomeland and lend their skills to this endeavor. I salute their \ncourage, their patriotism and their selflessness. They are an \ninspiration to all Iraqis and they deserve our full support.\n\n  Some of our colleagues have passionately argued that some of this \nfunding should be in the form of loans, to be forgiven if other debtor \nnations reduce or forgive old loans to Iraq. I understand why some have \narrived at this conclusion, but additional debt now would be \neconomically disastrous, and send the wrong message to Iraqis and, \nindeed, the world. At some point in the not too distant future, loans \nwill be appropriate, but we must help establish those conditions now.\n  The United States will seek to convince the principal holders of \nIraqi loans--Russia, France, Germany and Saudi Arabia--to forgive some \nor all of these loans.\n  We have an opportunity before us to send a message of full commitment \nto Iraq and of a balanced, fair U.S. foreign policy in the larger \nMiddle Eastern region, by providing this reconstruction assistance to \nIraq. Less than overwhelming support will be viewed as just the \nopposite, and would be counterproductive to our larger goals and \ninterests in this important region.\n  There is a perception, I fear, that this supplemental will fully fund \nIraq's reconstruction. Nothing could be further from the truth. The \nreconstruction needs of Iraq are enormous--not because of war damage, \nbut because of three-plus decades of neglect, mismanagement and greed \nby Saddam Hussein's regime. The funds included in this supplemental \nwill only begin to address these daunting needs, but adoption of this \npackage will put the Iraqis in a much better position to help \nthemselves in the future. The Iraqi leaders I spoke with want nothing \nmore than to do just that, but they need our help for now, not with \ncrippling conditions attached.\n  When U.S. troops entered Baghdad in early April, they were, indeed, \ngreeted as liberators. The image of Iraqis celebrating in the streets--\nhelping U.S. soldiers topple a statue of Saddam Hussein--will long be \nwith us.\n  Despite the pockets of resistance in Iraq today, that feeling of \ngratitude and good will toward the United States remains. Recent \npolling found that most Iraqis believe that ousting Saddam Hussein was \nworth the hardships\n\n[[Page S13780]]\n\nthey have endured since the invasion, and two-thirds think Iraq will be \nin better condition 5 years from now than before the invasion.\n  We must build on this good will and seize this historic opportunity \nto show our overwhelming support and commitment to help build a \nthriving democracy and ally against terror in Iraq.\n  American forces and coalition partners have already done a remarkable \njob of restoring basic services, rebuilding schools and hospitals, \npreventing ethnic violence and creating an environment where \nreconstruction can succeed. Many Members of this Chamber have seen this \nwith their own eyes, and the response of most who have been to Iraq is \nconcern that the good things that are taking place in Iraq are not \nbeing fully reported to the American people.\n  This reconstruction work is being done in a difficult environment of \nharsh conditions and significant personal risk, as those who have been \nremoved from power in Iraq seek to delay their inevitable defeat, and \nas terrorists lash out at the loss of another haven. We are ever \nmindful of the risks our troops face, every day, and the sacrifices \nmade by the families and communities that support them.\n  It is imperative that we give our President and our troops the \nresources they need to complete their missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe faster the money gets to these countries, the faster conditions \nwill improve, and the faster our troops will come home. As Ambassador \nBremer stated before the Armed Services Committee last week:\n\n       Every day that goes by where we are not speeding up the \n     Iraqi Army, speeding up the civil defense corps, speeding up \n     the training of police, is a day when our soldiers, men and \n     women, are not being substituted by Iraqis. Every day that \n     Iraqis do not get electricity, do not get water, do not have \n     proper sewage, is a day when their quality of life is such \n     that they are less likely to view us as liberators, more \n     inclined to view us as occupiers, and that also increases the \n     danger to our men and women.\n\n  Lasting peace and security in Iraq will be achieved when we establish \nthe environment for a democratic, economically viable Iraq. The first \nsteps to democracy have been taken and a fledgling government is \npreparing itself to assume the responsibilities of sovereignty.\n  Let us join together in a clear message of resolve to provide the \nresources that will meet the immediate needs of the Iraqi people and \nbest serve our interest in Iraq and the larger Middle East region. I \nurge my colleagues to support the conference report and send a message \nof overwhelming support to our troops, to their families, and to the \nnewly liberated people of Iraq and Afghanistan. We must do what is \nnecessary to secure this important victory in the war on terrorism.\n  Mr. President, again, I express my tremendous commendation for the \nmanagers of this bill and, particularly, for their wisdom and insight \ninto the needs of the men and women in the Armed Forces, and the \nability to step up and get TRICARE for the Reserve and the Guard.\n  The Reserve and the Guard have performed magnificently, and not just \nin this most recent conflict in Iraq but beginning back in the days of \nBosnia, Kosovo, and all the way through. Those of us who went into \nSarajevo years ago remember that it was the National Guard planes that \nwould take us in during that period of combat and strife in the \nBalkans. Of course, they performed magnificently in connection with the \nAfghanistan campaign, and then again during the course of the campaign \nin Iraq, the freedom of the Iraqi people being their goal.\n  So I commend the leadership of the Appropriations Committee for doing \nthe TRICARE and addressing those pay provisions, which were due to \nexpire. We have been addressing that in the Armed Services Committee, \nwhere we have original jurisdiction over these matters. But the plain \nfact is that we have not reached a resolution of our conference report \nas of this time. Therefore, often the Appropriations Committee needs to \nstep forward and do these things which must be done, and done promptly. \nSo I commend our distinguished members of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Over the weekend we suffered this tremendous tragedy, the loss of the \nhelicopter with so many brave individuals on board. I and others have \nexpressed our compassion to their families, their loved ones, and to \ntheir fellow colleagues and comrades all throughout the region. Each \none of them feels the loss of one of their own when it happens--whether \nit is on the streets or in an aircraft that unfortunately comes down.\n  Those of us--many in this Chamber--who have had the opportunity to \nvisit in Iraq, and particularly Baghdad and other areas, got a clear \nperception and feeling of the extraordinary risks being undertaken \nnight and day by these young men and women not only of the Armed Forces \nof the United States but the coalition forces.\n  I am proud of the way our President stood up today before the world. \nHe stated these words, which time and time again should be considered \nby the American people as spoken from the heart of the President. \nImagine the sadness in his heart and that of the First Lady and others, \nbecause the buck stops on the President's desk.\n  When the news broke of that helicopter going down, I fully appreciate \nwhat he went through, and indeed the Secretary of Defense, this \nweekend. He addressed the Nation on three public television shows about \nthis tragedy of the loss of the helicopter. But both the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense are absolutely steadfast in their resolve to \ncontinue their role as leaders. The President said:\n\n       The enemy in Iraq believes America will run.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       That is why they are willing to kill innocent civilians, \n     relief workers, and our coalition troops.\n\n  He finished by saying: America will never run.\n  I commend both the President and Secretary of Defense. At one time, I \nwas in the Pentagon during Vietnam for some 5 years as Navy Secretary. \nI remember awakening in the night and the morning to receive those \nreports about exceptional losses, such as this one, and then often go, \nas we had planned, before the media the next day trying to interpret it \nand explain it for the American people and for the people throughout \nthe world. It is not an easy task, but our President and others in \nauthority are stepping up to it and being absolutely unflinching in \ntheir resolve, as this Senator is, to see this through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, tomorrow I hope to attend the funeral \nservice for a brave Army captain, a VMI graduate. I happened to go to \nthe neighboring school of Washington and Lee. His family called me and \ntalked with me and I talked with them. They asked if at all possible \ncould I attend. I said I would do that irrespective of what is going on \nin the Senate. The mother said to me: We feel deeply the loss of our \nson, but, Senator, I want you to come and say to me that you and others \nwill stay the course so that his life is not given in vain. I have made \nthat commitment to his family, as I will to many other families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks a letter to the editor published in the \nSaturday Washington Post by Dr. David Kay who is responsible for the \nsearch for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this letter to the editor is very worthy \nof our colleagues who, like me, are concerned about how thus far we are \nstill trying to find the weapons, if they exist, but he covers very \nwell one aspect of this, and it is deserving of the estimate. I commend \nDr. Kay for his work and his continuing effort. Part of this bill has \nthe funds necessary for him to continue this effort to resolve this \nvery puzzling mystery about the weapons of mass destruction.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my distinguished colleague and commend \nhim once again.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 1, 2003]\n\n                      The Hunt for Iraq's Weapons\n\n       The Oct. 26 front-page article ``Search in Iraq Fails to \n     Find Nuclear Threat'' is wildly off the mark. Your reporter, \n     Barton\n\n[[Page S13781]]\n\n     Gellman, bases much of his analysis on what he says was told \n     to him by an Australian brigadier, Stephen D. Meekin. Gellman \n     describes Meekin as someone ``who commands the Joint Captured \n     Materiel Exploitation Center, the largest of a half-dozen \n     units that report to [David] Kay.''\n       Meekin does not report, nor has he ever reported, to me in \n     any individual capacity or as commander of the exploitation \n     center. The work of the center did not form a part of my \n     first interim report, which was delivered last month, nor do \n     I direct what Meekin's organization does. The center's \n     mission has never involved weapons of mass destruction, nor \n     does it have any WMD expertise.\n       Gellman's description of information provided by Mahdi \n     Obeidi, chief of Iraq's pre-1991 centrifuge program, relies \n     on an unnamed ``U.S. official'' who, by the reporter's own \n     admission, read only one reporting cable. How Gellman's \n     source was able to describe reporting that covered four \n     months is a mystery to me. Furthermore, the source \n     mischaracterized our views on the reliability of Obeidi's \n     information.\n       With regard to Obeidi's move to the United States, Gellman \n     writes, ``By summer's end, under unknown circumstances, \n     Obeidi received permission to bring his family to an East \n     Coast suburb in the United States.'' The reader is left with \n     the impression that this move involved something manipulative \n     or sinister. The ``unknown circumstances'' are called Public \n     Law 110. This mechanism was created during the Cold War to \n     give the director of central intelligence the authority to \n     resettle those who help provide valuable intelligence \n     information. Nothing unusual or mysterious here.\n       When the article moves to describe the actual work of the \n     nuclear team, Gellman states that ``frustrated members of the \n     nuclear search team by late spring began calling themselves \n     the `book of the month club.' '' But he fails to note that \n     this was before the establishment of the Iraq Survey Group. \n     In fact, the team's frustration with the pace of the work is \n     what led President Bush to shift the responsibility for the \n     WMD search to the director of central intelligence and to \n     send me to Baghdad.\n       One would believe from what Gellman writes that I have sent \n     home the two leaders of my nuclear team, William Domke and \n     Jeffrey Bedell, and abandoned all attempts to determine the \n     state of Iraq's nuclear activities. Wrong again. Domke's \n     assignment had been twice extended well beyond what the \n     Department of Energy had agree to. He and Bedell were \n     replaced with a much larger contingent of experts from DOE's \n     National Labs.\n       Finally, with regard to the aluminum tubes, the tubes were \n     certainly being imported and were being used for rockets. The \n     question that continues to occupy us is whether similar \n     tubes, with higher specifications, had other uses, \n     specifically in nuclear centrifuges. Why anyone would think \n     that we should want to confiscate the thousands of aluminum \n     tubes of the lower specification is unclear. Our \n     investigation is focused on whether a nuclear centrifuge \n     program was either underway or in the planning stages, what \n     design and components were being contemplated or used in such \n     a program if it existed and the reason for the constant \n     raising of the specifications of the tubes the Iraqis were \n     importing clandestinely.\n       We have much work left to do before any conclusions can be \n     reached on the state of possible Iraqi nuclear weapons \n     program efforts. Your story gives the false impression that \n     conclusions can already be drawn.\n                                                        David Kay.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to take 7 minutes \nof the time available to the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will adopt by voice vote \nthe conference report containing $87 billion in supplemental funds for \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  Before I speak about this legislation, I want to express my deepest \ncondolences to the families and friends of those who were killed and \nwounded in the attack on a U.S. military helicopter yesterday. This \ntragedy illustrates, once again, the tremendous sacrifices of our \nsoldiers in Iraq. They are there serving their country, and while their \naccomplishments rarely make the headlines, they are also enduring daily \nhardship and tragic losses.\n  This supplemental legislation has been controversial. We all want \nIraq to become a democratic, prosperous, peaceful nation. But, we \ndiffer on the President's decision to go to war and on the way forward \nfrom here.\n  I did not support the supplemental when it was considered by the \nSenate, and was one of twelve Senators to vote against it. I discussed \nmy reasons for this decision at length in this Chamber on October 17, \n2003. My views have not changed since that date.\n  That said, I want to recognize the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, for the effort he made to get this \nsupplemental passed. During the past several days he has demonstrated \nstrength on par with one of his favorite superheroes: The Incredible \nHulk. Senator Stevens worked extremely hard, under difficult \nconditions, to accommodate a number of my priorities: Tricare for Guard \nand Reservists, humanitarian aid for Liberia, and additional assistance \nfor Afghanistan.\n  He also supported my provision to impose new criminal penalties for \nwar profiteering. Although the House Republican conferees ultimately \nrejected the new criminal penalties for war profiteering--a major \nmistake in my view--Chairman Stevens defended the Senate position on \nthis issue during conference. I am grateful to him for doing so.\n  I will have more to say on the war profiteering provision in a \nmoment, but I want to take a few moments to explain why I oppose this \nconference report.\n  I have no doubt that the world is far better off without Saddam \nHussein. But, I also feel that the administration rushed into this war \nprematurely, alienated some of our closest friends and allies, \nexaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and downplayed the \nextraordinary difficult and costly task of rebuilding Iraq. We all know \nthe confident statements made by senior administration officials, \nincluding the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, National Security \nAdviser, Director of OMB, and Administrator of USAID, that have since \nbeen disavowed, debunked, or disputed.\n\n  Some say that we should simply move on--that the differences we have \nover the war and the administration's abysmal post war planning is \nwater under the bridge. I disagree. there is no question that we have \nto work hard to succeed in Iraq. But, I cite the words of Ted Koppel, a \nwell-respected journalist with long experience, who said:\n\n       Before the Iraq war, senior officials confidently predicted \n     that US troops would be welcomed as liberators, that vast \n     quantities of weapons of mass destruction would be found, \n     that Iraqi oil income would pay for post-war reconstruction, \n     and that a successful military victory in Iraq would quickly \n     lead to implementation of the ``road map to peace'' between \n     Israelis and Palestinians. Not only were all those \n     predictions wrong but there is growing evidence that \n     officials should have know better at the time. But that was \n     then, this is now. And everyone likes to pretend that what \n     was said before the war is no longer relevant.\n\n  The decision to go to war in Iraq strikes at the very heart of our \ncredibility as a nation. It is not a partisan issue. It is an American \nissue, and I am outraged by administration officials who attacked the \npatriotism of those who have asked legitimate questions about the \ndecision to launch a unilateral, preemptive attack. I think we all wish \nthat more questions had been asked and answered before we decided to \nsend hundreds of thousands of troops to Vietnam.\n  I agree with those who say that we cannot simply walk away from Iraq. \nHowever, I am deeply troubled by the administration's partisan, take-it \nor leave-it attitude towards this supplemental. There are better \nalternatives, and the Administration should have been open to \nconsidering other approaches. I believe they could have saved the \ntaxpayers money and hastened the time when our soldiers can come home.\n  Amendments offered by Democrats on the Senate floor would have gone a \nlong way towards accomplishing these goals. They would have: put the \nSecretary of State in charge of reconstruction efforts, which has been \nthe case for every major post-conflict operation since the Marshall \nPlan; required the administration to internationalize the effort, \nformulate a viable plan to rebuild Iraq, and come up with a workable \nexit strategy; and fully paid for the reconstruction by repealing the \ntax cut on the wealthiest Americans for just one year rather than \nraiding the Social Security Trust Fund and saddling future generations \nwith even more debt.\n  Each of these amendments was defeated by the Republican leadership, \nacting in concert with the administration, on the Senate floor.\n  Instead of acknowledging problems with the current policy and making \nbold proposals to turn around the situation in Iraq, the President's \napproach\n\n[[Page S13782]]\n\ndoes little more than throw more money at the status quo. This goes to \nthe heart of my opposition to this conference report, and again, I \nrefer any who may want further details about my views to review my \nOctober 17 statement.\n\n  I want to turn to an issue that I mentioned earlier, which is the \nrefusal of House Republicans on the Appropriations Committee to include \na provision which I, along with Senators Feinstein and Durbin, included \nin the Senate version of the Supplemental conference report. This \nprovision would have created criminal penalties for war profiteers and \ncheats who try to defraud American taxpayers and cash in on the relief \nand reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n  Our men and women in uniform are risking their lies in Iraq. Our aid \nworkers and diplomats are laboring under difficult and dangerous \nconditions. This provision would have sent a message: If you cheat \nAmerican taxpayers while our men and women are dying in Iraq, you will \ngo to jail.\n  In rejecting this provision, House Republicans offered no substitute \nor willingness to compromise. They also offered, in my opinion, no real \nsubstantive arguments against this provision. More importantly, \nRepresentative Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, did not oppose this provision.\n  The partisan approach by the House Appropriators was in stark \ncontrast to the Senate position. Both Republican and Democratic Senate \nconferees consistently supported the provision, which was unanimously \naccepted during the Senate Appropriations Committee markup of the bill. \nNot a single objection was raised to this provision during Senate \nconsideration of the Supplemental.\n  Why is this provision so important? Congress is about to send about \n$70 billion dollars to a Iraq, where there is no functioning \ngovernment, too little accountability and too few financial controls. \nThis is a formula for mischief.\n  Because we are sending so much of the taxpayers' money to a place \nwithout the usual oversight and controls, I strongly believe that we \nneed an extra layer of protection to guard against waste, fraud, and \nabuse. This is what my provision would have done.\n  By creating strong criminal penalties and clarifying current \nuncertainties about jurisdiction, it would create a strong deterrent \nagainst this type of behavior.\n  As I said during the conference discussion of this provision, if one \nwarehouse is locked while another warehouse is unlocked, everyone knows \nwhich one will get robbed.\n  There are, of course, fraud statutes to protect against waste of tax \ndollars at home. But there are serious impediments, especially \njurisdictional issues, to using these statutes to prosecute these types \nof crimes in Iraq. Moreover, there are no statutes that expressly \nprohibit war profiteering.\n  The provision in the Senate bill would have addressed these issues \nand made it easier to prosecute those accused of defrauding U.S. \ntaxpayers in Iraq.\n\n  In addition, some of the penalties under existing fraud statutes are \nweak--perpetrators could walk away with little or no jail time. This \nprovision would have increased the penalties to up to 20 years in \nprison and fines of up to $1 million or twice the illegal gross profits \nof the crime.\n  We have a duty to do our best to protect every penny of the \ntaxpayers' money from waste, fraud and abuse. I believe the House \nAppropriators, by refusing to accept this provision, abdicated this \nresponsibility.\n  This is not a new idea. The United States has enacted similar laws \nafter World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. These laws were \nsuccessful, and there is a long history of case law on this issue. \nAdvocating exactly such an approach, President Roosevelt once declared \nit our duty to ensure that ``a few do not gain from the sacrifices of \nthe many.'' The provision in the Senate bill borrowed heavily from this \nsuccessful approach, especially the portions relating to war \nprofiteering.\n  Some have asked me, you are the ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, why not go through the regular process and report \na bill out of this committee?\n  We all know that criminal penalties cannot be applied retroactively. \nI wanted to have this strong deterrent against defrauding the U.S. \ntaxpayers in place on the same day that the President signed this bill \ninto law and the money goes out the door. Clearly, this is an unusual \nsituation that called for quick action to ensure that these controls \nwere in place.\n  We have missed this opportunity. But, I am hoping that in the \nbipartisan spirit of the Senate, we can come together to pass a law \nthat will minimize the damage of the House's refusal to act.\n  In the coming week, I will be introducing a free-standing bill that \nmirrors the provision in the Senate bill. I hope that the Senate will \ncontinue to do the right thing on this issue. I believe that we should \npress ahead and support its prompt passage through Congress.\n  In closing, I want to say that there has been bipartisan concern with \nthe administration's approach in Iraq. I hope the administration \nlistens to the Congress and asks the tough questions of itself. It \nshould reach out to Members of Congress and consult with experts who do \nnot necessarily agree with what the administration is doing in Iraq.\n  While we may disagree on how to get there, we all want the same \nthing: a peaceful and democratic Iraq and our troops home safely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 10 minutes 32 \nseconds. The Senator from West Virginia has 11 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could you go over that time again, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 10 minutes 32 \nseconds. The Senator from West Virginia 11 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. I was told we were going to be finished at 5.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have made my remarks. I do not need to make any \nadditional ones. I would be glad to yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Chair how the 10 minutes got lost in the last 2 \nor 3 minutes, just out of curiosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island obtained consent \nto use Leader Daschle's time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no desire to use any of my remaining time. Senator \nStevens has used his time. As far as I am concerned, we can vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we reserved the last 10 minutes for the \nSenator from West Virginia and then the last 10 minutes for me, the \nSenator from Alaska. Does the Senator wish to use his time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield, let \nme thank the distinguished Senator for his courtesy and thoughtfulness \nin reserving time for the two of us. I have the utmost respect and \naffection for the Senator from Alaska. It is characteristic of him to \nprovide that time, but I only wish to say at this time, having made my \nremarks already, having said enough on the point, I am willing to yield \nback the balance of the time the Senator from Alaska set aside for me \nand, as soon as the Senator from Alaska completes his remarks, whatever \nhe wishes to say, then we are ready to vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I previously read a portion of President \nClinton's remarks on December 16, 1998. I want to read a few more of \nthem just to close this debate. The President said at that time on \nDecember 16, 1998:\n\n       This situation presents a clear and present danger to the \n     stability of the Persian Gulf and the safety of people \n     everywhere. The international community gave Saddam one last \n     chance to resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors. \n     Saddam has failed to seize the chance. And so we had to act \n     and act now. Let me explain why. First, without a strong \n     inspection system, Iraq would be free to retain and begin to \n     rebuild its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs \n     in months, not years. Second, if Saddam can cripple the \n     weapons inspection system and get away with it, he would \n     conclude that the international community--led by the United \n     States--has simply lost its will. He will surmise that he has \n     a free rein to rebuild his arsenal of destruction, and some \n     day--make no mistake--he will use it again as he has in the \n     past.\n\n\n[[Page S13783]]\n\n\n  I am skipping a few paragraphs. He said:\n\n     . . . That is why, on the unanimous recommendation of my \n     national security team--including the vice president, the \n     Secretary of Defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, the Secretary of State and the national security adviser--I \nhave ordered a strong, sustained series of air strikes against Iraq.\n\n  He said:\n\n       So we will pursue a long-term strategy to contain Iraq and \n     its weapons of mass destruction and work toward the day when \n     Iraq has a government worthy of its people. First, we must be \n     prepared to use force again if Saddam takes threatening \n     actions, such as trying to reconstitute his weapons of mass \n     destruction or their delivery systems, threatening his \n     neighbors, challenging allied aircraft over Iraq or moving \n     against his own Kurdish citizens. The credible threat to use \n     force, and when necessary, the actual use of force, is the \n     surest way to contain Saddam's weapons of mass destruction \n     program, curtail his aggression and prevent another Gulf War.\n\n  And I go on. He said:\n\n       Heavy as they are, the cost of action must be weighed \n     against the price of inaction. If Saddam defies the world and \n     we fail to respond, we will face a far greater threat in the \n     future. Saddam will strike again at his neighbors. He will \n     make war on his own people. And mark my words, he will \n     develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and \n     he will use them.\n\n  The people who criticize the current conclusion--and listening to the \nconclusion that President Clinton made--did not complain then. We used \nairstrikes against Iraq. In fact, one of the conditions President \nClinton mentioned was continued, almost daily attacks against our \naircraft that were flying what we call continuous air patrol, the CAP, \nover Iraq. They did that for 11 years. Daily, there were threats \nagainst them.\n  I think we have acted reasonably under the circumstances, \nparticularly in view of the conclusion that was made by the President \nof the United States in 1998 that Saddam was such a threat against the \nUnited States and the international community he should be subjected to \nattack and, if he persisted, to actually use force as soon as possible. \nThat is what the President said.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the transcript of President Clinton's \nremarks explaining the Iraq strike be printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I said before and I say again, the war is \nover. The President was right when he said the war is over. The \nmilitary force is not there. We are fighting terrorism, not just in \nIraq and Afghanistan. We are also fighting it around the world, even at \nhome. How many of us have had to stand in longer lines this morning \nbecause there is a greater threat right here at home?\n  This bill is being passed because we are fighting a war against \nterrorists and terrorism everywhere. It is absolutely necessary that \nthis money get to the people who are right now at the greatest risk of \nharm, those who are trying to help Iraq recover, form a new government \nand be able to defend themselves and be able to go on to a new life, \nreally to be a new credible force in the Middle East, of people who \nform their own government and people who plan their own future.\n  I am pleased to associate myself with all those who supported what \nthe President has done. I believe it was right and I think history will \nshow it was right.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the vote.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Transcript: President Clinton Explains Iraq Strike\n\n       Clinton: Good evening.\n       Earlier today, I ordered America's armed forces to strike \n     military and security targets in Iraq. They are joined by \n     British forces. Their mission is to attack Iraq's nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons programs and its military \n     capacity to threaten its neighbors.\n       Their purpose is to protect the national interest of the \n     United States, and indeed the interests of people throughout \n     the Middle East and around the world.\n       Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his \n     neighbors or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or \n     biological weapons.\n       I want to explain why I have decided, with the unanimous \n     recommendation of my national security team, to use force in \n     Iraq; why we have acted now; and what we aim to accomplish.\n       Six weeks ago, Saddam Hussein announced that he would no \n     longer cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors \n     called UNSCOM. They are highly professional experts from \n     dozens of countries. Their job is to oversee the elimination \n     of Iraq's capability to retain, create and use weapons of \n     mass destruction, and to verify that Iraq does not attempt to \n     rebuild that capability.\n       The inspectors undertook this mission first 7.5 years ago \n     at the end of the Gulf War when Iraq agreed to declare and \n     destroy its arsenal as a condition of the ceasefire.\n       The international community had good reason to set this \n     requirement. Other countries possess weapons of mass \n     destruction and ballistic missiles. With Saddam, there is one \n     big difference: He has used them. Not once, but repeatedly. \n     Unleashing chemical weapons against Iranian troops during a \n     decade-long war. Not only against soldiers, but against \n     civilians, firing Scud missiles at the citizens of Israel, \n     Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Iran. And not only against a \n     foreign enemy, but even against his own people, gassing \n     Kurdish citizens in Northern Iraq.\n       The international community had little doubt then, and I \n     have no doubt today, that left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will \n     use these terrible weapons again.\n       The United States has patiently worked to preserve UNSCOM \n     as Iraq has sought to avoid its obligation to cooperate with \n     the inspectors. On occasion, we've had to threaten military \n     force, and Saddam has backed down.\n       Faced with Saddam's latest act of defiance in late October, \n     we built intensive diplomatic pressure on Iraq backed by \n     overwhelming military force in the region. The UN Security \n     Council voted 15 to zero to condemn Saddam's actions and to \n     demand that he immediately come into compliance.\n       Eight Arab nations--Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \n     Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman--warned that \n     Iraq alone would bear responsibility for the consequences of \n     defying the UN.\n       When Saddam still failed to comply, we prepared to act \n     militarily. It was only then at the last possible moment that \n     Iraq backed down. It pledged to the UN that it had made, and \n     I quote, a clear and unconditional decision to resume \n     cooperation with the weapons inspectors.\n       I decided then to call off the attack with our airplanes \n     already in the air because Saddam had given in to our \n     demands. I concluded then that the right thing to do was to \n     use restraint and give Saddam one last chance to prove his \n     willingness to cooperate.\n       I made it very clear at that time what unconditional \n     cooperation meant, based on existing UN resolutions and \n     Iraq's own commitments. And along with Prime Minister Blair \n     of Great Britain, I made it equally clear that if Saddam \n     failed to cooperate fully, we would be prepared to act \n     without delay, diplomacy or warning.\n       Now over the past three weeks, the UN weapons inspectors \n     have carried out their plan for testing Iraq's cooperation. \n     The testing period ended this weekend, and last night, \n     UNSCOM's chairman, Richard Butler, reported the results to UN \n     Secretary-General Annan.\n       The conclusions are stark, sobering and profoundly \n     disturbing.\n       In four out of the five categories set forth, Iraq has \n     failed to cooperate. Indeed, it actually has placed new \n     restrictions on the inspectors. Here are some of the \n     particulars.\n       Iraq repeatedly blocked UNSCOM from inspecting suspect \n     sites. For example, it shut off access to the headquarters of \n     its ruling party and said it will deny access to the party's \n     other offices, even though UN resolutions make no exception \n     for them and UNSCOM has inspected them in the past.\n       Iraq repeatedly restricted UNSCOM's ability to obtain \n     necessary evidence. For example, Iraq obstructed UNSCOM's \n     effort to photograph bombs related to its chemical weapons \n     program.\n       It tried to stop an UNSCOM biological weapons team from \n     videotaping a site and photocopying documents and prevented \n     Iraqi personnel from answering UNSCOM's questions.\n       Prior to the inspection of another site, Iraq actually \n     emptied out the building, removing not just documents but \n     even the furniture and the equipment.\n       Iraq has failed to turn over virtually all the documents \n     requested by the inspectors. Indeed, we know that Iraq \n     ordered the destruction of weapons-related documents in \n     anticipation of an UNSCOM inspection.\n       So Iraq has abused its final chance.\n       As the UNSCOM reports concludes, and again I quote, \n     ``Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made \n     in the fields of disarmament.\n       ``In light of this experience, and in the absence of full \n     cooperation by Iraq, it must regrettably be recorded again \n     that the commission is not able to conduct the work mandated \n     to it by the Security Council with respect to Iraq's \n     prohibited weapons program.''\n       In short, the inspectors are saying that even if they could \n     stay in Iraq, their work would be a sham.\n       Saddam's deception has defeated their effectiveness. \n     Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam has \n     disarmed the inspectors.\n       This situation presents a clear and present danger to the \n     stability of the Persian Gulf and the safety of people \n     everywhere. The international community gave Saddam one last \n     chance to resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors. \n     Saddam has failed to seize the chance.\n\n[[Page S13784]]\n\n       And so we had to act and act now.\n       Let me explain why.\n       First, without a strong inspection system, Iraq would be \n     free to retain and begin to rebuild its chemical, biological \n     and nuclear weapons programs in months, not years.\n       Second, if Saddam can cripple the weapons inspection system \n     and get away with it, he would conclude that the \n     international community--led by the United States--has simply \n     lost its will. He will surmise that he has free rein to \n     rebuild his arsenal of destruction, and someday--make no \n     mistake--he will use it again as he has in the past.\n       Third, in halting our air strikes in November, I gave \n     Saddam a chance, not a license. If we turn our backs on his \n     defiance, the credibility of U.S. power as a check against \n     Saddam will be destroyed. We will not only have allowed \n     Saddam to shatter the inspection system that controls his \n     weapons of mass destruction program; we also will have \n     fatally undercut the fear of force that stops Saddam from \n     acting to gain domination in the region.\n       That is why, on the unanimous recommendation of my national \n     security team--including the vice president, the secretary of \n     defense, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the \n     secretary of state and the national security adviser--I have \n     ordered a strong, sustained series of air strikes against \n     Iraq.\n       They are designed to degrade Saddam's capacity to develop \n     and deliver weapons of mass destruction, and to degrade his \n     ability to threaten his neighbors.\n       At the same time, we are delivering a powerful message to \n     Saddam. If you act recklessly, you will pay a heavy price. We \n     acted today because, in the judgment of my military advisers, \n     a swift response would provide the most surprise and the \n     least opportunity for Saddam to prepare.\n       If we had delayed for even a matter of days from Chairman \n     Butler's report, we would have given Saddam more time to \n     disperse his forces and protect his weapons.\n       Also, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins this weekend. \n     For us to initiate military action during Ramadan would be \n     profoundly offensive to the Muslim world and, therefore, \n     would damage our relations with Arab countries and the \n     progress we have made in the Middle East.\n       That is something we wanted very much to avoid without \n     giving Iraq a month's head start to prepare for potential \n     action against it.\n       Finally, our allies, including Prime Minister Tony Blair of \n     Great Britain, concurred that now is the time to strike. I \n     hope Saddam will come into cooperation with the inspection \n     system now and comply with the relevant UN Security Council \n     resolutions. But we have to be prepared that he will not, and \n     we must deal with the very real danger he poses.\n       So we will pursue a long-term strategy to contain Iraq and \n     its weapons of mass destruction and work toward the day when \n     Iraq has a government worthy of its people.\n       First, we must be prepared to use force again if Saddam \n     takes threatening actions, such as trying to reconstitute his \n     weapons of mass destruction or their delivery systems, \n     threatening his neighbors, challenging allied aircraft over \n     Iraq or moving against his own Kurdish citizens.\n       The credible threat to use force, and when necessary, the \n     actual use of force, is the surest way to contain Saddam's \n     weapons of mass destruction program, curtail his aggression \n     and prevent another Gulf War.\n       Second, so long as Iraq remains out of compliance, we will \n     work with the international community to maintain and enforce \n     economic sanctions. Sanctions have cost Saddam more than $120 \n     billion--resources that would have been used to rebuild his \n     military. The sanctions system allows Iraq to sell oil for \n     food, for medicine, for other humanitarian supplies for the \n     Iraqi people.\n       We have no quarrel with them. But without the sanctions, we \n     would see the oil-for-food program become oil-for-tanks, \n     resulting in a greater threat to Iraq's neighbors and less \n     food for its people.\n       The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, \n     he threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of his \n     region, the security of the world.\n       The best way to end that threat once and for all is with a \n     new Iraqi government--a government ready to live in peace \n     with its neighbors, a government that respects the rights of \n     its people. Bringing change in Baghdad will take time and \n     effort. We will strengthen our engagement with the full range \n     of Iraqi opposition forces and work with them effectively and \n     prudently.\n       The decision to use force is never cost-free. Whenever \n     American forces are placed in harm's way, we risk the loss of \n     life. And while our strikes are focused on Iraq's military \n     capabilities, there will be unintended Iraqi casualties.\n       Indeed, in the past, Saddam has intentionally placed Iraqi \n     civilians in harm's way in a cynical bid to sway \n     international opinion.\n       We must be prepared for these realities. At the same time, \n     Saddam should have absolutely no doubt if he lashes out at \n     his neighbors, we will respond forcefully.\n       Heavy as they are, the costs of action must be weighed \n     against the price of inaction. If Saddam defies the world and \n     we fail to respond, we will face a far greater threat in the \n     future. Saddam will strike again at his neighbors. He will \n     make war on his own people.\n       And mark my words, he will develop weapons of mass \n     destruction. He will deploy them, and he will use them.\n       Because we're acting today, if is less likely that we will \n     face these dangers in the future.\n       Let me close by addressing one other issue. Saddam Hussein \n     and the other enemies of peace may have thought that the \n     serious debate currently before the House of Representatives \n     would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to face him \n     down.\n       But once more, the United States has proven that although \n     we are never eager to use force, when we must act in \n     America's vital interests, we will do so.\n       In the century we're leaving, America has often made the \n     difference between chaos and community, fear and hope. Now, \n     in the new century, we'll have a remarkable opportunity to \n     shape a future more peaceful than the past, but only if we \n     stand strong against the enemies of peace.\n       Tonight, the United States is doing just that. May God \n     bless and protect the brave men and women who are carrying \n     out this vital mission and their families. And may God bless \n     America.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Byrd has not yielded back his time as yet, has he?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has not formally done so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I briefly say this. I voted----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not intend to use my time. I have already made my \nspeech. If I have some time, I yield whatever time he needs to the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding me the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I voted for the first gulf war. In fact, I \nwas the first Democrat to announce publicly that I would do that. I \nvoted for the second gulf war. I have no problems with having done \nthat.\n  I have the greatest respect for the senior Senator from Alaska. I \nknow what a fine chairman he is on the Appropriations Committee. But I \ndo say this: That for anyone now to say the war is over, it is not \nover. The war is going on as we speak. One need only go to the families \nof the 16 people who were killed when the helicopter was shot down just \na few hours ago.\n  Having said that, we still have a long hard row ahead of us in this \nwar in which we are engaged.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from West Virginia yield back \nall of his time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the conference report is \nadopted.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not think it should be adopted by unanimous consent. \nThat was not meant to happen. I understood there would be a voice vote. \nI hope the Chair will propound the question for the voices to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2691, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2691) making appropriations for the Department of Interior \n     and related agencies for the\n\n[[Page S13785]]\n\n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of the \n     conference.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 28, 2003.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to \nbring this conference report to the floor, along with my good friend \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. We have spent a lot of hours on this \nparticular legislation, the appropriations for the Department of the \nInterior, also some portions in here for the Department of Energy, the \nForest Service, the Indian Health Service, and several other \nindependent agencies under the Interior Subcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  Both the House and Senate bills conformed to the same 302(b) \nallocation and our conference allocation is effectively the same. This \nmeans the priorities of both bodies, as expressed in their respective \nbills, had to be pared back substantially to bring this bill to the \nrequired level. Nobody should be surprised if they think they did not \nget everything they wanted in this bill. There is an old saying, ``I \ndidn't get everything I wanted, but I wanted everything that I got.'' \nNobody did get everything they wanted, including this chairman. But I \ncan tell you the Members were treated fairly. I think the House and \nSenate had a good exchange during the course of our conference \ndiscussions.\n  That being said, this bill does a number of positive things. It has \nbeen a most difficult year. Generally speaking, we have tried to \nprotect the core operating programs of the land management agencies, \nthe Indian Health Service, and the other agencies in this bill. Where \npossible, we have provided targeted increases for high priority \nprograms such as park operations and, of course, forest health.\n  Beyond that, we have continued our efforts to attack the maintenance \nbacklog within the land management agencies: The BIA administration of \nthe school system and the Indian Health Service. In a few cases we have \ninvested in new facilities, where they are critically needed.\n  This bill also continues to fund a number of grant programs for a \nvariety of purposes, from habitat conservation to energy conservation \nto the arts and the humanities. Most of these programs have been \ncontinued at around current-year levels. Advocates of these programs \nmay be disappointed that we did not provide large increases, but the \nconstraints of our allocation simply would not allow it.\n  There is a specific issue I would like to mention briefly and that is \nthe Indian trust reform. The court recently issued an opinion in the \nCobell litigation that would compel the Department of Interior to spend \nan estimated $9 billion to $12 billion--that is with a ``b,'' billion--\nover the next 3 years, on an exhaustive historical accounting of \nindividual Indian money accounts, an accounting that may or may not \nshed light on the ultimate solution to the trust problem. If there is \none thing with which everybody involved in this issue seems to agree, \nit is that we should not spend that kind of money on an incredibly \ncumbersome accounting that will do almost nothing to benefit the Indian \npeople. What we need to be doing is fixing the trust system and \nsettling this case once and for all. The conference agreement provides \nthat there is effectively a time out, so Congress can address this \nissue in a comprehensive fashion. I sincerely hope Congress will take \nadvantage of this opportunity to act for the benefit of the Indian \npeople throughout our country.\n  Finally, I express my thanks to staffs on both sides of the aisle who \nworked so hard on getting this conference report together: Larissa \nSommer, Ginny James, Leif Fonnesbeck, Ryan Thomas, and Bruce Evans on \nmy own subcommittee on this side. On the committee of course are the \nfolks on the other side who worked so hard, and the rest of my \ncommittee staff. They have done a great piece of work bringing this \ndifficult conference to a successful conclusion. Chris Heggem and Ron \nHooper of my personal staff have also contributed a great deal to this \nbill on items that are particularly critical to my State of Montana.\n  I also want to thank Peter Keifhaber and Brooke Livingston of Senator \nDorgan's staff for their cooperation and good humor. Given that Brooke \nis to be married Saturday, I think it is safe to say she is glad to get \nthis item off the floor. We couldn't conclude it quickly enough. I am \nglad we can accommodate her on that schedule.\n  Again, I thank my good friend from North Dakota. We are neighbors. \nOur border is very porous. We always stand our ground, though, and \nthank goodness there was the Little Missouri River.\n  I yield to the ranking member of this committee, Senator Dorgan from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin where my colleague from \nMontana ended. That is, with thanks to a great deal of staff help to \nput this subcommittee bill together: Bruce Evans, Virginia James, Leif \nFonnesbeck, Ryan Thomas, Larissa Sommer on his side, and Peter \nKeifhaber and Brooke Livingston on our side.\n  This is a conference report that spends $19-plus billion on a wide \nrange of issues--the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Indian Affairs, a portion of \nthe Department of Energy, and the Forest Service. As you take a look at \nall of these issues--the National Endowment for the Humanities and \nArts, the Smithsonian Institution--this is quite a remarkable \nsubcommittee and the jurisdiction is broad and very interesting.\n  Senator Burns and I do share a common border between North Dakota and \nMontana. He is a good legislator to work with. We are friends and have \nhad a good working relationship on this conference report.\n  I am going to vote for this conference report. There is much in it \nthat represents progress, as far as I am concerned, in a range of \nareas, but I do say--and my colleague, Senator Burns, knows this--that \nI have great heartburn about the final provision in this conference \nreport that deals with Indian trust land. I will talk about that in a \nmoment. While I vigorously oppose that provision, I, nonetheless, will \nvote for the conference report.\n  Let me say that we have in a range of areas in this conference report \na backlog of work that needs to be done, whether it is dealing with the \ninfrastructure for repair and maintenance of the Park Service or the \nForest Service, the issues dealing with Indian housing, health and \neducation, and there are so many areas that it is hard to focus. We \nhave tried to have a limited amount of resources spread throughout the \nobligations here to meet unlimited wants and needs. But that is the \nprocess of trying to get a bill such as this done.\n  One of the key issues where we made some progress this year is the \narea of tribal colleges. The reason I mention that is because we have \nbeen battling for some long while dealing with a range of issues on \nIndian reservations. I mentioned previously there is a bone fide crisis \non the issues of Indian health, housing, and education. There is really \na crisis in those areas. It seems to me that one of the ways to give \npeople an opportunity and some hope for a better future is education.\n  On Indian reservations, the tribal college system has been a \nremarkable tool that has given hope to a lot of people who were not \nable to get their education but have now gone back to school to get \ntheir education through a tribal college. We have been able to increase \nthe funding for that to $48 million. That is not a large part of this \nbill. But the President recommended $38 million, which is a cut from \nlast year. We restored last year, and my colleague, Senator Burns from \nMontana, and I got this up to $48 million. It is the most sizable \nincrease we have seen in the history of this account. We have done it \nbecause it is an investment in the lives of the people who have hope \nfor a better life because of this. I appreciate the cooperation and the \nassistance of my colleague from Montana.\n  Let me also speak about the provision in the bill that is troublesome \nto me; that is, the issue of Indian trust lands. All of us understand \nthat the Indian trust situation has grown more\n\n[[Page S13786]]\n\nand more difficult. We now have a court order, as a result of the \nCobell v. Norton lawsuit, that apparently, according to experts if \nfollowed to the letter, would require us to hire accountants from Maine \nto California and about $9 billion worth of work--that is right, with a \n``b,'' $9 billion worth of work--to try to sort out what the accounts \nare in the Indian trust funds. If this is a $13 billion fund, or \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $13 billion, would the Native \nAmericans want us to begin a process in which we spend up to $9 billion \nto hire accountants and financial folks and others to sift through \nthese accounts? I think that is just nuts. That doesn't make any sense \nat all to anybody.\n\n  But what I have difficulty with is resolving this issue. We can't put \nit off. We have to resolve it. At the end of this piece of legislation, \nthe House-Senate conference, over my objections, put language in the \nconference report which effectively stays the court's September 25 \norder for as long as 14 months.\n  First, I think that is unconstitutional. I think that is a violation \nof the separation of powers. It is apparent to me, at least. The \nlanguage I am talking about that is in this conference report tells the \ncourt how to construe and apply statutes.\n  But the question of construction and application is not a function of \nthe Congress. We passed the statute but how it is construed and applied \nis not a legislative function. We don't have any business or ability, \nfor that matter, to tell the courts how to write their opinions. But I \nam afraid we are going to add another issue to the litigation because \nof what was put in this bill.\n  We know that between now and late next summer we have an obligation \nin this Congress to try to find a way to resolve this issue and head \noff the requirement to spend billions and billions of dollars doing the \naccounting necessary to sort out the Indian trust funds. Failure to do \nthat undermines the legitimate rights of Native Americans in this \ncountry to whom these funds belong.\n  We have a requirement, in my judgment, to create a solution between \nnow and the end of next summer in order to avoid in the next \nappropriations bill having to spend billions of dollars for an \naccounting of these funds. There needs to be a settlement, an \nagreement. I hope that will be the case.\n  But I think what we have done, in effect staying a court order--or \ncreating a ``timeout''--is going to add a layer of additional problems \nrather than begin to solve a problem. I regret that was put in the \nconference report.\n  Having said that, the conference report is an important piece of \nlegislation. It has taken longer than we would have hoped to get it \ndone. But it is now going to the House and to the Senate for approval \nof the conference report and will go to the President. I assume he will \nsign this conference report. I think we will have done pretty good work \nin most areas of this report.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express admiration for the \nhundreds of Nevadans who risked their lives last week to help our \nneighbors in California battle the deadly wildfires that swept that \nState. Approximately 500 people came from Nevada to California to help \nfight the fires. Firefighters from every part of the State--Las Vegas, \nHenderson and Pahrump in the south, Reno, Carson City and other \ncommunities in the north--traveled over the border to help fight the \nfires. Firefighting units from the Nevada Test Site, the naval air \nstation at Fallon, and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area were sent \nover the border to help Californians. We even sent 240 Nevada forestry \nconservation inmates who had been trained to fight fires.\n  I am very happy and proud that Nevadans responded in this way. We \nbelieve in helping our neighbors in the West. So I wasn't surprised \nthat we lent a helping hand.\n  As one firefighter told the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, the decision to \ngo to California was a no-brainer. He said:\n\n       We didn't even have to think twice about it. We wanted to \n     help our fellow firefighters.\n\n  As these Nevada firefighters began returning home over the weekend, \nthey described the gratitude of the Californians whose houses had been \nsaved. They believed they contributed to saving those homes. \nUnfortunately, they also warned that our State could be next in line \nfor devastating fires.\n  The California fires raged through forests that had been decimated by \ndrought and disease, leaving dead trees that were dry as tinder. \nSimilar conditions are present in Nevada and other Western States. That \nis why I supported the forest management act the Senate passed last \nweek.\n  We have heard the grim toll of the California fires: 20 lives loss, 1 \nfirefighter's life lost, almost 3,500 family homes destroyed, as much \nas $2 billion in damage. But these fires have also had a direct impact \non air quality and water quality. The forest management act is part of \nthe solution but it is not the whole solution.\n\n  We have to work together with State and local agencies, and with \nprivate groups, to monitor and manage the conditions in our public \nforests and rangeland. In our State, we have a great example of this \nkind of cooperation, the Eastern Nevada Landscape Coalition.\n  Hundreds of brave Nevadans did their part to control the deadly fires \nin California last week. We must all do our part to prevent similar \nfires in the future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the Interior appropriations \nconference report because it contains valuable funding for Michigan's \nparks, trails, museums, and forests. However, I have reservations about \nseveral aspects of this legislation.\n  I am disappointed that the conference report does not include the \nlanguage I offered with Senator Collins, unanimously adopted by the \nSenate, which would have directed the Department of Energy to develop \nprocedures to ensure the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is filled in a \nmanner that minimizes the cost to the taxpayer and maximizes the \noverall supply of oil in the United States. The amendment expressed the \nsense of the Senate that the Department of Energy's current procedures \nfor filling the SPR are too costly for the taxpayers and have not \nimproved our overall energy security.\n  Since early 2002, DOE has been acquiring oil for the SPR without \nregard to the price of oil. Prior to that time, DOE sought to acquire \nmore oil when the price of oil was low, and less oil when the price of \noil was high. In early 2002, however, DOE abandoned this cost-based \napproach and instead adopted the current cost-blind approach. Because \nover this period the price of oil has been very high--often over $30 \nper barrel--and the oil markets have been tight, this cost-blind \napproach has increased the costs of the program to the taxpayer and put \nfurther pressure on tight oil markets, thereby helping boost oil and \ngasoline prices to American consumers and businesses.\n  The DOE's cost-blind approach has proven to be very expensive without \nmuch benefit to energy security. DOE's staff estimates that in just 2 \nyears, 2000 and 2001, the policy now abandoned by DOE saved the \ntaxpayer approximately $175 million, and that a continuation of this \npolicy could have saved the taxpayer additional hundreds of millions of \ndollars through 2005. Economists estimate that the DOE's current policy \nhas increased the cost of crude oil by up to $1.75 per barrel of oil, \nand 5 to 7 cents per gallon of gasoline at the pump. DOE's own figures \nalso show that under the new policy overall energy security--as \ndetermined by the total amount of oil in both governmental and private \nstorage--has barely increased.\n  I am very concerned that without the direction provided in the \nSenate's version of this bill, the American consumers, businesses, and \nthe taxpayers\n\n[[Page S13787]]\n\nwill continue to pay dearly for the Department of Energy's cost-blind \napproach to acquiring oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with \nonly minimal, if any, benefit to our energy security.\n  The Department of Energy does not need new authority, however, to \nadopt sound business practices. DOE already has sufficient legislative \nauthority to improve the cost-effectiveness of the SPR program. The \nDepartment of Energy should try to better spend the taxpayers' dollars \nand improve our overall energy security. I urge the Department to \nfollow the direction unanimously adopted by the Senate and improve its \nprocedures for filling the SPR.\n  In addition, I am also concerned about a provision in the bill which \nlimits the Department of the Interior's ability to perform its legal \nand statutory responsibilities with respect to the 1994 American Indian \nTrust Management Reform Act. For several years, Native Americans have \ncome to expect that the Federal Government and, specifically, the \nDepartment of the Interior would rightfully manage and account for the \nNative-American trust fund. Unfortunately, because the U.S. Government \nhas not adequately fulfilled its obligations, Native Americans have had \nto use the judicial system to have their rights enforced. A rider on \nthis Interior Department conference report, which was not included in \nthe either the House or Senate bill, was added in conference which \nabrogates the rights of 500,000 Native Americans. The provision, which \nlegislates on an appropriations bill, sends the wrong message to Native \nAmericans that their judicial gains can be changed by an act of \nCongress, drafted in a backroom and added by a conference committee \nwhen neither House had approved the language.\n  A full and appropriate accounting of the Native-American trust fund \nis necessary to make sure that the tribes are treated fairly. To \noverturn court decisions through undebated legislation is not good \npractice, especially when the judicial proceedings are ongoing. The \ntrust fund contains approximately $176 billion while an appropriate \naccounting of the fund would cost an estimated $9 to $12 billion.\n  There are also antienvironmental provisions in this bill that I do \nnot support. Language in the conference report will roll back the \nmoratorium on offshore drilling in Bristol Bay, reduce judicial review \non Tongass timber sales, and waive National Environmental Policy Act, \nNEPA, review for expiring grazing permits.\n  Further, the conference report also drastically reduces funding for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF. Lower funding of the LWCF \nmay result in the inability to purchase and protect land needed for \nhabitat around the Great Lakes. It also could result in land being \ndeveloped which will result in more pollution flowing into the \ntributaries and the Great Lakes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, while I plan to vote for this bill \nbecause it funds a host of programs critical to our Nation and my home \nState of Washington, I rise today to voice my grave concerns over a \nprovision that would prevent the Department of Interior from conducting \na full accounting of Individual Indian Trust accounts.\n  On September 25, 2003, in the case of Cobell v. Norton, U.S. District \nJudge Royce Lamberth ordered the Department of Interior to account for \nall individual Indian assets held in trust since 1887. This accounting \nis critical if our government is to meet its federal trust \nresponsibility and reach an equitable settlement over the funds owed to \nover 300,000 American Indians.\n  My concerns over this funding limitation are threefold. First, it \nsubverts both the legislative and committee process. Last week, Indian \nAffairs Committee Chairman Campbell and Vice-Chairman Inouye introduced \nlegislation that provided a blueprint on how we can move forward on \nthis issue. As a member of the Indian Affairs Committee, I feel \nstrongly that the committee of jurisdiction should deal with this issue \nso that we can hear from the multiple stakeholders through the \ntraditional hearing and legislative drafting process.\n  Secondly, by forestalling a court order, I am very concerned that \nthis rider may violate the Constitution's separation of powers \ndoctrine. With the insertion of this provision, Congress is interfering \nwith the ability of a federal agency to comply with the ruling of a \nFederal judge. It could also be considered a takings, since Indian \naccount holders are being denied redress to secure just compensation \nfor the use of their property.\n  Finally, this provision will delay efforts to settle this lawsuit \nbecause it will remove any incentive the Interior Department might have \nto participate in good faith negotiations. I hope that its inclusion \nwill at least spur the parties to try and reach a mutually acceptable \nsettlement within the year that this rider will be in effect.\n  After a century of mismanaging Indian assets, it's time for our \nNation to keep our promises. While I share the concerns of my \ncolleagues over the potential expense of the accounting process, I \nbelieve that the cost further supports the need for a negotiated \nsettlement. That is why I am committed to working with the all affected \nstakeholders as well as the chairman and vice-chairman of the Indian \nAffairs committee to resolve this matter once and for all.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Interior \nconference report and urge its approval. While there are a number of \nimportant matters addressed through this bill, I would like to make \nparticular note for the record the absence of any limitation on the \nMemorandum of Understanding, MOU, between the State of Utah and \nDepartment of the Interior regarding the use of a process for resolving \nR.S. 2477 claims through the Federal Land Policy Management Act, FLPMA \ndisclaimer of interest authority.\n  This agreement establishes a process through which the State will \nidentify State- and county-owned roads that run across public lands and \nmeet certain criteria. The State will then apply to the Department of \nthe Interior, DOI, for disclaimers on those roads. Each application \nwill be examined and determination will be made as to whether each road \nmeets the strict standards set forth in the MOU. If the road qualifies, \nDOI will issue a recordable disclaimer of interest for that road. While \nthere had been some action in the House to prevent this process form \ngoing forward, I am pleased that effort was rejected and that, upon \napproval of the conference report and its approval by the President, \nthe State of Utah and the Department of the Interior will be free to \npursue this agreement without limitation.\n  I believe that this bill is an affirmation of the good faith effort \nthat the parties have made to resolve some of these long standing \nquestions through the MOU, and affirms limitations imposed by the \nparties themselves in the MOU. Those limitations imposed by the parties \nensure that claims in national parks, national wildlife refuges, \ncongressionally designated wilderness, and wilderness study areas will \nnot be considered through this MOU. I also believe that it is important \nthat they move forward with this process and give the counties an \nopportunity to have a local transportation system with certainty. The \nconclusion reached by the conferees, to allow this MOU to go forward, \nwill allow the parties to resolve these issues through the recordable \ndisclaimer authority as designed under FLPMA, rather than through the \ncourt system. This will bring the issue to resolution faster, provide \nfor public participation, and will be less costly to the taxpayer than \nlitigation.\n   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I regret that I must rise to speak in \nopposition to certain provisions of the conference report to the \nInterior appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2004 relating to \nlitigation now pending before the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia in a class action lawsuit entitled Cobell v. \nNorton. In the Cobell case, a class of several hundred thousand \nindividual Indians are seeking an accounting of funds held in trust for \nthem by the United States.\n   As early as 1876, a Philadelphia newspaper reported that the \ngovernment was unable to account for the funds it held in trust for \nindividual Indians and Indian tribes. Since that time, the amount of \nfunds for which the government cannot account has grown exponentially. \nThe parties to the litigation agree that more than $13 billion have \ngone into the individual Indian trust accounts, but in the aggregate, \nthe outstanding balance in those accounts\n\n[[Page S13788]]\n\ntoday is little over half a million dollars.\n   As you know, the United States acts as the trustee for thousands of \nindividual Indians who did not ask to be removed from their aboriginal \nlands, to be forcibly placed on reservations, to have their lands \nallotted against their will, or to have this trusteeship imposed on \nthem. And yet these people who have suffered great deprivation at the \nhands of the government seek not to hold the government liable for the \nloss of their funds--they seek only to have a proper accounting of the \nfunds that the United States holds in trust for them.\n   However, today, with the adoption of this conference report, the \nUnited States Government will again deal the Indians yet another blow--\nby denying them the right to seek a simple accounting in a court of law \nof the funds that are rightfully theirs. And people in Indian country \nare asking, and I think justifiably so, would the Congress single out \nany other group of Americans for such treatment?\n   The relevant language of the conference report seeks to prevent the \nprovisions of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, or \nany other statute, or any principle of common law from being construed \nor applied to require the Department of the Interior to commence or \ncontinue the conduct of an historical accounting of individual Indian \nmoney accounts until the earlier of the following shall have occurred: \nNo. 1, Congress shall have amended the American Indian Trust Fund--\nManagement Reform Act of 1994 to delineate the specific historical \naccounting obligations of the Department of the Interior with respect \nto the Individual Indian Money Trust; or No. 2, December 31, 2004.\n   We have consulted with Senate legal counsel on the language and we \nare advised that this provision is of questionable constitutionality as \nit relates to the separation of powers amongst the three branches of \ngovernment. Contrary to the principle established by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt more than 150 years ago in Marbury. v. Madison, that it is the \nexclusive task of the Judicial Branch to determine the application of \nthe law to a case, this provision of the conference report reaches into \nthe province of the Article III courts by restricting those courts in \nwhat law they may apply in the Cobell litigation.\n   On several occasions, I have joined the chairman of the Senate \nIndian Affairs Committee in urging the parties to the Cobell litigation \nto enter into negotiations that would enable them to reach a fair and \nvoluntary settlement to this litigation. I deeply regret the fact that \nthus far negotiations between the parties have not borne fruit. \nNonetheless, I remain committed to working with the administration, the \nCobell plaintiffs, and our colleagues in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives to enact legislation that will provide a process for \nreaching a fair and voluntary settlement.\n   Accordingly, I cannot support this effort to deny to our Nation's \nFirst Americans a right that is guaranteed to all other citizens of the \nUnited States, while providing them with no alternative means of \nobtaining full and fair relief.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport of the FY 2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations \nBill.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for \nbringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending bill within the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with the discretionary \nspending cap for 2004.\n  The pending bill provides $19.7 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority and $19.4 billion in discretionary outlays in FY 2004 for the \nDepartment of the Interior, the Forest Service, energy conservation and \nresearch, the Smithsonian and the National Endowment for the Arts, and \nNational Endowment for Humanities.\n  The bill is at the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget \nauthority and outlays. The bill provides $185 million or 0.9 percent \nmore in discretionary budget authority and $1.1 billion or 5.9 percent \nmore in discretionary outlays than last years bill. The bill provides \n$72 million more in discretionary budget authority and $93 million more \nin discretionary outlays than the President's budget request.\n  In addition, this bill provides $400 million in emergency funding for \nthe Forest Service and the Department of the Interior for wildland fire \nsuppression activities. These funds were requested by the President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               H.R. 2691, INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 2004.--SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                         [Fiscal Year 2004, $ millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               General\n                                                               purpose    Conservation   Mandatory      Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Budget authority.......................................       19,657             0           64       19,721\n    Outlays................................................       19,424             0           70       19,494\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.......................................       19,657             0           64       19,721\n    Outlays................................................       19,424             0           70       19,494\n2003 level:\n    Budget authority.......................................       19,472             0           64       19,536\n    Outlays................................................       18,340             0           73       18,413\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.......................................       19,555             0           64       19,619\n    Outlays................................................       19,266             0           70       19,336\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.......................................       19,627             0           64       19,691\n    Outlays................................................       19,393             0           70       19,463\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.......................................       19,625             0           64       19,689\n    Outlays................................................       19,361             0           70       19,431\n \n                                         Conference Report Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.......................................            0             0            0            0\n    Outlays................................................            0             0            0            0\n2003 level:\n    Budget authority.......................................          185             0            0          185\n    Outlays................................................        1,084             0           -3        1,081\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.......................................          102             0            0          102\n    Outlays................................................          158             0            0          158\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.......................................           30             0            0           30\n    Outlays................................................           31             0            0           31\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.......................................           32             0            0           32\n    Outlays................................................           63             0            0           63\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

To date we have spent many millions of \ndollars on accountants and lawyers, no accounting has been done, and \nnot one penny\n\n[[Page S13789]]\n\nhas been paid to an Indian account holder.\n  On September 25, the judge in the case, Judge Lamberth, issued a \ndecision that guarantees more years of litigation and, by all \nestimates, billions more dollars spent, and no end in sight to the \nlawsuit.\n  With appeals, congressional squabbling over money and further \nlawsuits aimed at securing money damages, the case is just beginning.\n  The Department claims that pennies on the dollar are owed the \nplaintiffs, but without billions more spent on accounting activity, it \ncannot say for sure how much is in the accounts.\n  Cost estimates from the Interior Department suggest that it will cost \n$10 to $12 billion to comply with Judge Lamberth's order, money that \nwill be spent year after year through fiscal year 2008 at least.\n  I believe this money is better spent on reconstituting the Indian \nland base, building a forward-looking, state-of-the-art trust \nmanagement system, and providing more dollars to Indian health care and \neducation, which we know are underfunded.\n  The plaintiffs claim more than $175 billion dollars should be in \nthese accounts, a number the Department vigorously contests.\n  Last Monday night, the Interior Appropriations Committees intervened \nin the case by adding a rider that will delay the accounting order by \nthe judge conceivably until the end of 2004. Because of the enormous \ncost of an accounting, I believe the appropriators' intervention will \nonly get worse in the future.\n  Two weeks ago, along with Senators Inouye and Domenici, I introduced \nS. 1770, the Indian Money Account Claim Satisfaction Act of 2003, to \nreach a legislated settlement of the case. A hearing was held on \nOctober 29, 2003.\n  I do not support the Cobell rider, and I want to make that clear. I \ndo support a legislated settlement to the case, and I say to those who \nhave come to the floor: If you are serious about settling this matter, \njoin me and Senators Inouye and Domenici in our efforts.\n  At the hearing on the 29th, it appears both the Department and the \nplaintiffs are willing to move ahead with mediation of this case, and I \nfully support that and will be doing everything in my power to make \nsure that happens.\n  If you are not serious, continue on the current course.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 2691, the Interior Appropriations bill of \n2004, because of the $2.5 billion for firefighting, $400 million to pay \nback Federal agencies for fire costs in 2003, and $50 million included \nfor important Montana projects.\n  These important funds will help care for Montana's public lands, \nparks and wildlife and they will help boost our state's economy.\n  This bill also provides a good step towards establishing a permanent \nfirefighting fund so Federal agencies don't have to borrow from other \naccounts to pay for firefighting costs, which halts important \nrestoration and salvage projects.\n  This fire season alone the Forest Service was forced to take $695 \nmillion from other accounts, the Department of the Interior $165 \nmillion, to fight fires after the agencies' firefighting budgets dried \nup for fiscal year 2003.\n  I must support this conference report to ensure that Montana lands \nare conserved for future generations and protected from unnecessarily \nhigh fire threats.\n  However, my support for this bill is not without reservation. The \nhistorical accounting language included in this conference report \nessentially states that the Department of Interior may not comply with \nJudge Lamberth's order without consequence for one year.\n  I am not happy about how this came about though. Riders--especially \non an issue this important--are no way to legislate. Indian trust \naccounting must be resolved in a collaborative way, in the light of day \nwhere all parties can come to the table. Eight years ago, Eloise Cobell \nstarted her battle to champion the cause for accountability of Indian \nTrust monies. Ultimately she won when Federal District Court ruled that \nthe United States government had breached its trust obligations to \nhundreds of thousands of American Indians and that the government \nshould be compelled to provide a comprehensive historical accounting. \nWhile indeed the cost of the accounting is expensive, it is crucial to \nbalance the cost with due respect for the District Court order. This \nrider now attempts to modify the court order Eloise Cobell fought so \nhard to win. Legislating away the district court decision may only \ninvite further litigation. Hopefully, there will be a meaningful \nsettlement in the interim.\n  I am committed to working together to get this resolved. And in the \ncoming days and weeks, I will be doing all I can to ensure Montana \ntribes are at the table as these talks continue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about language \nincluded in the Interior Appropriations Conference Report that I \nbelieve is unfair to Native Americans--specifically, those Native \nAmericans who have been waiting years for an accounting from the Tribal \nTrust.\n  While no tribes in Connecticut are directly impacted by this \nlanguage, many others throughout Indian Country are. In my view, the \nprovision contained in this conference report undermines the \nexpectations of all Americans who believe that the Federal Government \nshould abide by the rule of law when the Government administers Federal \nprograms and initiatives.\n  Since 1996, the Department of the Interior has been engaged in a \nlegal battle with Native Americans who want the Department to provide a \nfull accounting of money owed to Indians by the Department. The \nconflict grew out of the Department's continuous mismanagement of \nIndian oil royalties, grazing fees and the like for more than a \ncentury. As many as half a million Native Americans have been \nwrongfully denied monies that are owed to them. It appears that the \nDepartment may have squandered billions of dollars over the course of \nthe last 116 years. Money that should have gone to Indian education and \nhousing, healthcare and community development was instead wasted.\n  Recently, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the Department \nto account for all royalties owed to Native Americans. Judge Lamberth \nalso held the Secretary in contempt of court, because he believed that \nthe Department had not been completely forthcoming about how the \nDepartment was working to resolve the dispute. The contempt ruling was \noverturned on appeal; but needless to say, this conflict has been \nheated.\n  Now, this conference report arrives here before the Senate with \nlanguage that would delay a lawful judicial order rendered by Judge \nLamberth and language that would prevent Judge Lamberth from issuing \nfurther contempt orders against the Secretary, regardless of the merits \nof any such order.\n  I am told that the Senate Legal Counsel has expressed concerns about \nthe constitutionality of the new language because it essentially \nlegislates a judicial outcome by telling a Federal judge how to \ninterpret the law.\n  I am opposed to the inclusion of this provision. It is my hope that \nthe Senate will take steps to mitigate against the damage that this \nlanguage may cause.\n  Too many Native Americans have already waited too long for justice. \nRequiring them to wait longer serves no valid public policy and is \nsimply wrong.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there time still on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority still controls 24 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. If the majority is willing to yield back their time, we can \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Burns said he will yield back his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, again, I express my gratitude to all of \nthose who contributed to this appropriations bill. There are many in \nthis body, in fact too many to mention. But Senator Dorgan and I \nappreciate their cooperation. We think it is a good bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my \nobjection to a provision in the conference report the Senate just \npassed regarding management and accounting of the American Indian trust \nfund.\n  Just over a month ago, on September 25, U.S. District Court Judge \nRoyce Lamberth ordered the U.S. Department of the Interior to conduct a \nfull and accurate historical accounting of the assets held in trust by \nthe Department for hundreds of thousands of individual American Indian \naccount holders. In his ruling, Judge Lamberth charged that the \nInterior Department's handling of the Indian trust funds ``has served \nas a gold standard for mismanagement by the federal government for more \nthan a century.''\n  The trust fund language inserted into this conference report--behind \nclosed doors--would stay Judge Lamberth's decision. It would \neffectively halt the Cobell v. Norton lawsuit and further delay justice \nfor 300,000 to as many as a half-million Indian trust fund account \nholders. This provision is unconstitutional and, I believe, \nunconscionable.\n  Partly because so many Americans Indians live on remote reservations, \nnot many Americans understand what the Indian trust fund dispute is \nabout. This dispute stretches back to the 1880s, when the U.S. \ngovernment broke up large tracts of Indian land into small parcels of \n80 and 160 acres, which it allotted to individual Indians. The \ngovernment, acting as a ``trustee,'' then took control of these lands \nand established individual accounts for the land owners. The government \nwas supposed to manage the lands. Any revenues generated from oil \ndrilling, mining, grazing, timber harvesting or any other use of the \nland was to be distributed to the account holders and their heirs.\n  The government has never--never--lived up to its trust fund \nresponsibilities. The Indian trust fund has been so badly mismanaged, \nfor so long, by administrations of both political parties, that today, \nno one knows how much money the trust fund should contain. Estimates of \nhow much is owed to individual account holders range from a low of $10 \nbillion to more than $100 billion. As Tex Hall, president of the \nNational Congress of American Indians has said, ``This is the Enron of \nIndian Country.'' In fact, it may well be bigger than Enron.\n  The people who are being denied justice in this case include some of \nthe most impoverished people in all of America. More than 68,000 are \nenrolled members of South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska tribes. \nSome live in homes that are little more than shacks, with no \nelectricity and no running water. They are being denied money that is \nrightfully theirs--money they need, in many cases, to pay for basic \nnecessities.\n  The court has ordered an accounting. This rider will undermine that \norder. It will delay resolution and delay justice. What other group of \nAmericans would we dare to treat this way? I don't know of one, Mr. \nPresident. Why target American Indians? Many account holders are older \npeople, ``elders'' who have suffered extreme economic deprivation their \nentire lives. If this rider staying Judge Lamberth's ruling becomes \nlaw, as I expect it will, many of them may not live long enough to see \njustice. This is shameful.\n  When the Senate debated the Interior appropriations bill, several of \nus offered an amendment that would have strengthened accountability for \nthe Indian trust fund. Instead, unbelievably, the provision in this \nconference report would weaken accountability of the trust fund.\n  Judge Lamberth's decision directed the Secretary of the Interior to \nconduct a full and fair historical account of the trust. Such an \naccounting is the first, critical step in reaching a fair resolution to \nthe Indian trust fund dispute.\n  The mismanagement of the Indian trust fund is a national disgrace. It \nstretches back generations and, as I have said on numerous occasions, \nadministrations of both parties share the blame. In the seven years \nsince the Cobell lawsuit was filed, Congress has appropriated hundreds \nof millions of dollars on litigation-related activities. This is money \nthat is desperately needed and would have been much better spent \nfunding health and education and housing programs in Indian Country.\n  In addition to the gross injustice, there are three additional \naspects of this provision that are deeply troubling.\n  First, this rider is unconstitutional. By telling the court how it \nmust construe existing law, Congress would be violating the \nconstitutional separation of powers. In addition, by denying account \nholders a full accounting of their trust fund monies and other assets, \nthis rider constitutes a taking of property without just compensation \nor due process of law.\n  Second, there has been virtually no public debate or discussion of \nthis rider. It was drafted without any consultation with tribes, with \nplaintiffs in the Cobell Indian trust fund lawsuit or with the \nmembership of the Congressional committees of jurisdiction. This rider \nignores the government-to-government relationship between tribes and \nthe Federal Government, and is almost universally opposed in Indian \nCountry. Since any effective, long-term solution to the trust fund \nproblem must be based on government-to-government dialogue, this rider \nis likely to prove deeply counter-productive.\n\n[[Page S13791]]\n\n  Last week, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee held a hearing on a \nsettlement bill where both parties agreed to mediation. The House \nResources Committee has been holding field hearings on settlement. This \nis the way the trust fund dispute should be resolved--not in back-room \ndeals.\n  Third and finally, this provision perpetuates a shameful pattern of \nneglect of American Indians and tribes and a failure of the Federal \nGovernment to meet its legal and moral obligations to them.\n  Mr. President, there's another shameful truth about this bill--and \nthat is what is not in it.\n  Earlier this month, during Senate debate on the Interior \nappropriations bill, Democrats offered an amendment to address a \ncritical funding shortfall for the Indian Health Service--a shortfall \nso acute that Indian people are frequently turned away from IHS clinics \nand hospitals unless they are literally in danger of losing a life or \nlimb. They are denied earlier, less expensive care that might prevent \nsuch a dangerous condition in the first place.\n  We asked our Republican colleagues to restore the $292 million that \nthey had promised, during the budget debate, to support. They refused. \nThe actual shortfall in IHS clinical services is over $2.9 billion. And \nour colleagues refused to provide one-tenth of that amount in this \nbill. They refused to support one-tenth of what is needed to provide \nbasic health services to American Indians.\n  Our Republican colleagues said they agreed on the need for better \nhealth care for Indian people; they said they agreed that much of the \ncare being denied is truly essential; but they said, we simply can't \nafford to do more. Given some of the spending we've seen lately, that \nexcuse rings pretty hollow to Indian people. And it rings pretty hollow \nto me, too.\n  We spend twice as much on health care for Federal prisoners as we \nspend for American Indians. The Indian Health Service has to ration \ncare because of lack of funding. That is inexcusable.\n  Despite these deep flaws with the Indian trust fund and the Indian \nHealth Service, the Senate has approved this rider, in part because \nthis conference report contains many other programs that are urgently \nneeded. But this is not the end. This in no way absolves the Interior \nDepartment of its legal and moral obligation to restore integrity to \ntrust fund management as soon as possible. We will continue to press \nfor a full and fair accounting of all assets in the Indian trust funds. \nAnd we will continue to push for full funding of Indian health care. It \nis long past time that we keep the promises we have made to American \nIndians and tribes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \nsupport S. 150, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act.\n  As many of my colleagues have heard me say on many occasions, I \nbelieve it is important that we--and I tried to do it myself--advocate \npolicies and ideas that promote freedom and opportunity for all \nAmericans. We in the Senate must advance ideas that help create more \ninvestment, thereby creating more jobs and prosperity rather than more \nburdens from taxation and regulation.\n  This measure permanently extends the moratorium banning access taxes \nand taxes that discriminate against the Internet. It is one of my \npriorities. I know the Senator presiding shares that same philosophy \nand has been a great leader in that regard.\n  As we all know, the Internet is one of our country's greatest tools \nand symbols of innovation and individual empowerment. I look at the \ninvention of the Internet as profoundly transforming and revolutionary \nfor the dissemination of ideas and information, as important as was the \nGutenberg Press.\n  Accordingly, I think everyone in the Senate would want to help the \nInternet grow and flourish as a viable tool for education, information, \nand commerce. I stand on the side of freedom of the Internet, trusting \nfree people and free entrepreneurs--not on the side of making this \nadvancement in technology easier to tax for the tax collectors.\n  One of the great things about the Internet is that it is not limited \nby boundaries of State governments, local governments, not even limited \nby the boundary of this country. Clearly, the Internet is intrastate \ncommerce. Thus, the Federal Government, Congress, has jurisdiction in \nthe taxation and regulation of the Internet.\n  My legislation, S. 150, promotes equal access to the Internet for all \nAmericans and protects every American from harmful, regressive taxes on \nInternet access services as well as duplicative and predatory taxes on \nInternet transactions. Specifically, as reported out of the Commerce \nCommittee, S. 150 has five provisions.\n  First, it extends permanently the country's Federal prohibition of \nState and local taxation on Internet access service.\n  Second, it makes permanent the ban on all multiple and discriminatory \ntaxes relating to electronic commerce. This ensures that several \njurisdictions cannot tax the same transaction simply because the \ntransaction happens to occur over the Internet.\n  Third, my legislation repeals the so-called grandfathering provision \nover a 3-year-period.\n  Fourth, we make clear the original intent of the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct by updating the definition of Internet access to ensure the \nmoratorium applies consistently to all consumers. If we are going to \nexempt Internet access services from taxation permanently, then it \nmakes sense to do so in a manner that applies to all methods and\n\n[[Page S13792]]\n\nways a consumer might have access to the Internet, regardless of how \nthey choose to access it, whether by DSL--digital subscriber line \nconnections--by wireless connections, by cable modem service, \nsatellite, or dial-up service.\n  Fifth, and lastly, this legislation ensures that nothing prevents the \ncollection or remittance of State and Federal universal service fees.\n  The Internet tax moratorium has contributed to extending Internet \naccess to over 127 million citizens, approximately 45 percent of our \ncountry's population. Unfortunately, that moratorium expired Friday \nnight. Every day that the moratorium lapses, consumers are susceptible \nto more pestering, burdensome new taxes on Internet access services, as \nwell as taxes on e-mail, taxes on instant messages, spam filters, and \neven Web searches.\n  For every dollar in taxation--and most kids in elementary school will \nunderstand these economics--every dollar added in taxation adds to the \ncost of the Internet access. With that, you could expect to see lost \nutilization of the Internet by thousands of American families, \nespecially lower income families.\n  According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 30 percent \nof non-internet users say cost is the major reason they remain off \nline. Additionally, 43 percent of non-internet users agreed with the \nstatement, ``Internet access is too expensive.''\n  For roughly 55 percent of the American people who are still off line, \nkeeping access affordable--and that means keeping access free from \nState, local, and Federal taxation--is vital.\n  The guiding principle of this legislation is simple and clear: The \nInternet should remain as accessible as possible to all people in all \nparts of the country forever. That has been the position I have taken \non this and held since 1997 during my days as Governor of Virginia when \nI was one of only four Governors to share this position.\n  I cannot envision any time in our future where it will be desirable \nfor any government to tax access to the Internet. I cannot envision any \ninstance or event that would precipitate the justification for multiple \nor discriminatory taxes on the Internet by any government, whether \nlarge or small, local, State, or national.\n  Yet if the Senate fails to take action by the end of this week or any \nSenator votes against this legislation, such Member is in effect \nadvocating taxing the Internet.\n  There are more Americans empowered by the Internet primarily because \nthe Federal policy of the United States has consciously allowed \nInternet innovators, entrepreneurs, and consumers to remain free from \nonerous taxation.\n  As many know, Congress first enacted this moratorium with the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act in 1998 after dozens of State and local taxing \ncommissars began to impose disparate taxes on a consumer's ability to \naccess the Internet.\n  Since the last extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act in 2001, \nsome States have begun taxing the high-speed component of broadband \nInternet access services by asserting that certain portions of high-\nspeed broadband Internet access are telecommunication services rather \nthan Internet access services. The States doing this are therefore \ncircumventing the original intentions of the law.\n  Working with our chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator John \nMcCain, as well as Senator Ron Wyden and Senator John Sununu in the \nCommerce Committee, we have updated the definition of Internet access \nto ensure that all Internet access services, regardless of the \ntechnology used to deliver that service, are covered by the moratorium \nand therefore exempt from State and local taxation.\n  I want to also address for my colleagues the misleading statements \nmade regarding S. 150. I understand the proponents of higher taxes at \nthe State and local level have raised a number of concerns about this \nlegislation, indicating that we expanded the moratorium on Internet \naccess to include all telecommunication services, making tax free even \ntraditional services such as local and long-distance telephone \ncommunications. Additionally, they have raised the question whether or \nnot this bill would prohibit States from imposing property and \ncorporate income taxes on telecommunication carriers and Internet \nservice providers. The false assertions come maybe from confusion, \nmaybe from a misunderstanding, but in some cases they are \nintentionally, outright, and flat wrong statements. I am here to set \nthe record straight.\n  I want all the Members of this body to understand and be clear on the \nfacts about this legislation: S. 150 does not affect traditional voice \nor long-distance telephone services or any other communication service \nthat is not directly used to provide Internet access; S. 150 does not \naffect a State's ability to collect income, property, or other \ncorporate taxes, such as franchising fees, that are unrelated to \nInternet access.\n  The fact is S. 150 does not unnecessarily expand the moratorium on \nInternet access. Rather, the legislation clarifies the original \nintentions of the Internet Tax Freedom Act to include high-speed \nInternet access services. Only because some States and localities \nattempted to circumvent the original law by taxing portions of high-\nspeed Internet access did the definition of Internet access need to be \nupdated.\n  The impact of what the States and localities are trying to do in \ntaxing broadband has implications that particularly are harmful to \nsmall communities and rural areas. We have always advocated that we \nhave to get broadband to rural areas. Obviously, it costs a great deal \nof money. Our good colleague, Senator Conrad Burns, says out in the \ncountry there is a lot of dirt to dig between light bulbs.\n  If you are going to get broadband to rural areas, there is a great \ninvestment to get it there because you have a fewer number of customers \nto recoup your investment. In the event a tax is put on to broadband, \nit means obviously fewer people can afford it, thereby making it less \nlikely that a company is going to invest the millions and millions of \ndollars it will take to get broadband deployed or high speed deployed \nto rural areas, thereby ruining, hindering, hampering the ability of \npeople and small businesses in rural communities to get access to high-\nspeed Internet services which is vital for them getting information, \neducation, as well as conducting business.\n  The fact is, S. 150 only makes permanent the tax moratorium on \nInternet access services, which is simply the ability to get access to \nthe Internet. Once a consumer has accessed the Internet, the moratorium \ndoes not affect the services that are purchased, used, or sold over the \nInternet that would otherwise be taxable, even if those services are \nbundled together with Internet access services.\n  Proponents of Internet taxes say this bill is an unfunded mandate. \nThe fact is, the cost associated with S. 150 only affects those few \nStates and localities that were grandfathered under the original Tax \nFreedom Act of 1998. Additionally, my legislation delays the repeal of \nthe grandfathering provision for a 3-year period, ensuring that the \nmoratorium on Internet access taxes applies equally in all 50 States, \nwhile giving these few taxing States and localities additional time to \nadjust their budgets accordingly.\n  Let's realize this has been now 5 years where these States and \nlocalities have had time--5 years--to remove these Internet access \ntaxes. With my bill, S. 150, they will have, in effect, 8 years to \nrepeal these regressive taxes on Internet access.\n  I would invite them to look at the record since the enactment of the \n1998 moratorium where several States, plus the District of Columbia, \nhave in fact chosen to move away from Internet taxes.\n  For example, in 1999, Iowa enacted a law specifically exempting \nInternet access from taxation. In South Carolina, after the enactment \nof the Federal moratorium in 1998, the Governor and tax department \nissued formal announcements indicating the State would abide by the \nnational tax moratorium and would cease trying to collect taxes on \nInternet access services. Connecticut's State legislature approved a \nlaw that accelerated the phaseout of Internet access taxes in July of \n2001. Additionally, in April of 2000, Arizona enacted a law exempting \nInternet access from State and local sales tax. Finally, in 1999, the \nDistrict of Columbia also eliminated taxes on Internet access.\n\n[[Page S13793]]\n\n  Meanwhile, we do have these other States--for example, Kentucky, \nAlabama, and others--that have attempted to tax the transport of high-\nspeed broadband Internet access.\n  In summary, the fact is, by allowing the moratorium to expire, the \nSenate has opened the door for States and localities to begin imposing \nregressive taxes on Internet access services. By taxing Internet \naccess, States and localities are actually contributing to the economic \ndigital divide. The more expensive we allow the State and local tax \ncommissars to make Internet access, the less likely people are to be \nable to buy these advanced services, such as high-speed broadband \nconnections. It makes it harder for them to purchase Internet protocol \nsoftware, wireless fidelity, or WiFi devices, or many other multimedia \napplications. These applications are all made less likely to be \naffordable for many millions of Americans.\n  In a time when technology and the Internet have grown into improving \nalmost every aspect of our daily lives, and where access to the \nInternet is a necessity for Americans, it just seems to me that \nimposing new taxes on access or levying taxes that discriminate against \nthe Internet as a form of commerce will just never be sound policy for \nour country.\n  As a tool, what is great about the Internet is it breaks down \neconomic and educational barriers, leveling the playing field for \nmillions of Americans.\n  You will also hear some say: Let's just have a short extension. Let's \nhave a short extension. We do not need to make it permanent. Well, \ngoing back to the business model and understanding how businesses have \nto invest, they like to see some certainty. If you have a short \nmoratorium, there is less certainty, there is less predictability for \ninvestment, therefore, fewer job opportunities, and less likelihood \nthat broadband or high speed will get out to the smaller towns and \ncommunities in rural areas.\n  More than ever before, with our Nation's economy finally moving \nforward in the right direction, the people of this country need \nsecurity with regard to their financial future. Any additional tax \nburdens on the Internet will mean additional costs many Americans \ncannot afford, forcing the poorest in our society to reduce or even \nforego the use of the Internet as a tool for commerce, education, \ninformation, exploration, and individual responsibility and \nopportunity.\n  In a society--indeed, a world--where the quality of life and an \nindividual's opportunity for prosperity are directly related \nproportionately to one's access to and the acquisition of knowledge, we \nas a Senate must choose to close this economic digital divide rather \nthan exacerbate it by allowing States and localities to further tax the \nInternet.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 150, the Internet \nTax Nondiscrimination Act, which permanently extends the Internet \nmoratorium on access, multiple, and discriminatory taxes.\n  In sum, I ask my colleagues to be leaders, leaders who stand strong \nfor individual freedom and stand strong for opportunities for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13793-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13793-S13794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MODERN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on Universal \nService, taking testimony from Michael Powell, the Chairman of the \nFederal Communications Commission. I want to commend the committee for \nexamining issues affecting the preservation and advancement of \nuniversal service. This is a discussion that is of great interest to me \nand great importance to my State.\n  We have long sought to ensure that telephone service is available in \nrural America, through direct infrastructure programs like those of the \nRural Utilities Service, through internal telephone company cross-\nsubsidies and, more recently, through the universal service fund. The \nlow population density in so much of our Nation makes some assistance \nnecessary; the costs of wiring such areas is simply too high. Phone \nservice is simply too important to our social fabric to ignore this \nchallenge. We must keep it affordable for all Americans. That is why we \nneed universal service.\n  Access to modern telecommunications services is vital to the economy \nof my home State of South Dakota and in rural areas throughout the \nNation. It helps new businesses develop, even if they are far away from \ntheir customers or clients. Telecommuting is already allowing many of \nmy constituents to remain in, or move back to, their home towns rather \nthan having to leave in search of employment. That is a trend we need \nto encourage and build upon. But it is only possible if rural America \nhas a modern telecommunications infrastructure.\n  Universal service is vital to South Dakota. Yet universal service is \nnot just about rural America. It also supports telephone service for \nlow-income individuals throughout the country, and telecommunications \nservices and Internet access in our schools and libraries. I believe it \nis important that the country remain committed to these goals and the \nprinciple of universal service.\n  Despite its importance, the future of universal service is uncertain. \nSome question the long-term viability of the current structure, as its \nfunding base of interstate telephone revenue declines. I believe that \nwe will need to reevaluate the universal service structure and consider \ncomprehensive legislation to ensure that the program remains effective \nand affordable in the future. I am pleased that the Commerce Committee \nhas begun that process.\n  The committee includes the Senators who have been the most engaged on \nthis front. I want to commend Senator Burns for his leadership on the \nissue, along with Senator Dorgan, Senator Stevens, Chairman McCain, and \nRanking Member Hollings. I look forward to working with them to keep \nthe universal service system strong and effective.\n  Senator Gordon Smith has introduced legislation that addresses an \nimportant component of universal service, high cost funding for \nnonrural carriers. Today, I am cosponsoring that legislation, S. 1380, \nthe Rural Universal Service Equity Act of 2003, which seeks to more \nequitably distribute that portion of universal service.\n  Today, telephone companies in only eight States receive all of these \nfunds. Nonrural carriers in the rest of the country, even those in \nrural States like South Dakota, receive nothing. We should reevaluate \nthat distribution as part of universal service reform.\n  I fully appreciate that S. 1380 only addresses one small, albeit \nsignificant, portion of Universal Service. It is important to focus \nattention on the need to understand and address it.\n  That point made, I favor reforming the high cost support program for \nnon-rural companies within the context of reform of the entire system. \nTelephone service has developed in different ways throughout the \ncountry, with service provided to various degrees by the Regional Bell \nOperating Companies, independent phone companies, cooperatives, \nwireless, and competitive carriers. We should keep that in mind when we \nconsider alternative approaches and look at the system as a whole, not \njust focus on each individual component of universal service \nseparately.\n  When we do consider universal service legislation, I think the \napproach taken by S. 1380 shifting the basis of support for nonrural \ncompanies to costs at the wire center level, rather than statewide \ncosts deserves consideration as part of a broader package. Using \nstatewide costs makes it difficult for a company that serves a \nrelatively large city to obtain support for rural areas that it serves \nin the same State. That can limit its ability to invest in and \nmodernize its rural infrastructure.\n  I do want to raise a specific concern about S. 1380. In reallocating \nsome universal service funding, the bill shifts funds around, creating \nwinners and losers. I am worried that this approach pits carriers and \nregions against each other, rather than uniting in a common goal of \nprotecting universal service and the people who depend upon it for \naffordable telephone service in rural and low-income communities \nthroughout the country. We can and should fix that problem. That is \nanother reason why I think the bill should be considered within the \ncontext of broader universal service reform.\n\n[[Page S13794]]\n\n  I want to note a special problem with one potential loser under the \nbill. It shifts some funds that are currently allocated to Puerto Rico. \nPuerto Rico is not represented in this body. Without an advocate of its \nown to force attention to the Commonwealth's concerns, it is important \nthat we all carefully consider the impact legislation can have upon \nPuerto Rico and its residents. When we address universal service, we \nshould not take steps that might inadvertently reduce the availability \nand affordability of telephone and telecommunications services to the \nresidents of Puerto Rico.\n  In conclusion, I want to again thank the Commerce Committee for \nfocusing greater attention on the future of universal service. I look \nforward to working with Senators on the committee and others concerned \nabout universal service for rural residents, low-income consumers and \nour schools and libraries to lay the groundwork for legislation to \nreform and strengthen the universal service system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13794-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEALTHY FORESTS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week, we passed an amended version \nof H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests Act.\n  While this bill is not everything I hoped it would be, it is an \nimprovement over what was proposed by the President and passed by the \nHouse. The devastating fires in California and throughout the West over \nthe past few years have added great urgency to the need to remove \ndangerous fuel loads from many of our forests. We need to treat those \nhazards now, and this bill is really the only relevant legislation that \ncan pass Congress and be signed into law by the President this year. \nThat is why I voted for the bill on final passage.\n  During the floor debate, I offered an amendment to strengthen the \nunderlying bill's old-growth protections and I also voted for a number \nof other amendments. It is unfortunate that these amendments were not \naccepted because they would have reassured a greater portion of our \ncitizens of the real intent of the legislation and would have made it \nmore effective.\n  We don't have the funding we need to remove all the dangerous fuel \nloads in our forests. We should have made more funding available and \nensured more resources were focused on the wildland urban interface \nthat presents the greatest risk to property and to the lives of our \nfirefighters and citizens.\n  While the underlying bill will increase authorization levels for fuel \nreduction activities, it does not guarantee this money will be made \navailable. We should have passed Senator Bingaman's amendment that \nwould have guaranteed the funding and stopped the raiding of fuel \nreduction accounts to pay for fire suppression.\n  Likewise, the Senate bill is an improvement over the House \nlegislation in directing at least 50 percent of the work be conducted \nin the wildland urban interface, but we should have strengthened this \ndirective by passing Senator Boxer's amendment that would have raised \nwildland/urban interface work to 70 percent.\n  Lastly, the underlying bill made an earnest attempt to provide some \nprotection for old-growth stands in our national forests. \nUnfortunately, the bill leaves a couple of significant loopholes that, \nif abused by our forest managers, could threaten these ancient trees. \nThat is why I offered an amendment to close these loopholes and better \nprotect old-growth stands. Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated.\n  Now that the Senate has spoken on the overall bill, the House should \ntake up this legislation and pass it unaltered. The President should \ndrop his opposition to the increased spending associated in the bill \nand urge its quick passage by the House. The President's opposition to \nincreased spending presents a real and tangible risk to every community \nlooking to treat forests surrounding their homes, schools, and \nbusinesses.\n  If this bill is signed into law, the burden will shift to the Forest \nService and Bureau of Land Management to implement the programs in the \nmost responsible and effective manner possible.\n  Again, they will need to focus on protecting communities. It will be \nunacceptable to treat forest stands far from human population while any \ncommunity's wildland/urban interface remains untreated.\n  They need to focus on taking out of the forests the materials that \ntruly threaten to generate catastrophic wildfires. We should not see \nlarge, fire resistant trees being removed from our forests under the \nguise of ``healthy forests.'' Any old-growth stands that are treated \nneed to be treated in ways that protect their unique ecosystems.\n  Finally, in a fiscally responsible manner, the agencies need to \nmaximize the positive economic influence these fuel reduction projects \ncan have on our rural economies. This means not only hiring local \nworkers and companies to conduct the work, but also looking for \nopportunities to use the resulting material for other economic \nenterprises.\n  The bill passed by the Senate has the potential to truly work in a \nmanner nearly everyone can accept. Alteration by the House or poor \nimplementation by the agencies will only threaten our wildfire \nendangered communities.\n  I am committed to making this legislation work and stand ready to \nassist the communities in Washington State protect their families and \nhomes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13794-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On July 7 of last year, three gay friends were violently beaten by a \n21-year-old man in Tampa, FL. The man later pled guilty to charges of \naggravated battery and battery with evidence of prejudice. The victims \nwere approached in a parking garage shortly after leaving a party at \nthe Florida Aquarium, one event in a 6-day gay pride celebration. \nSadly, one of the victims had to visit the dentist more than twenty \ntimes to replace teeth lost in the beating.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13794-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13794-S13796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak as we have just \nconcluded Breast Cancer Awareness Month. During October, about 16,000 \nmore women heard the news all women dread, ``You have breast cancer.'' \nThat is over 190,000 women this year. Among women between 35 and 54 \nyears of age, no disease claims more lives. In more personal terms, an \nAmerican woman faces a one in nine chance of sitting down and hearing \nthose words from her physician. At that moment everything changes.\n  We can be thankful that more women are surviving this diagnosis. \nModern treatments and early detection are saving lives. Many of my \ncolleagues have joined with me in supporting research into better \ndiagnosis and treatment. Just last month, we learned of a new drug \ntreatment which substantially reduced the recurrence of breast cancer. \nWe have made great strides, and I am grateful to the many researchers \nwho fight long hours battling this disease. And we sometimes forget the \nmen and women who, while suffering the effects of breast cancer, have \nvolunteered in these studies, at a time when they are already going \nthrough such a struggle. We owe all of them our gratitude for the \nstrides we have made in fighting this disease.\n  Despite this progress, one in every five women diagnosed still will \nnot survive breast cancer. Modern treatments are useless without a \ndiagnosis. With early detection and treatment, death and injury can be \nso greatly reduced. I call on American women today to take the \ninitiative. Many women have been taught to do self-exams, and while \nthey can help, they are no substitute for a mammogram. I urge you now \nto ask your physician about a mammogram. Mammograms saves lives.\n  But maybe you have put it off: you can't miss work, or the kids have \nan\n\n[[Page S13795]]\n\nevent, or maybe, well, the previous mammograms were OK, so you think \nyou are probably fine. Instead, think of missing other things, such as \nyour child's graduation, those anniversaries with your spouse, or doing \nany of the things we too often take for granted, just due to making the \nvisit a bit too late.\n  When a woman receives bad news she is facing so many worries--the \nthreat to her life. She first asks, Will I survive this? Then she asks \nhow she will survive. What will they do to me? The fortunate woman has \nher loved ones, her family, her friends to stand by and support her. \nBut she needs more.\n  When the news is bad, we can make the battle easier. I have recently \nreintroduced legislation to ensure that. The Women's Health and Cancer \nRights Act of 2003, S. 1730, will provide the assurances women need.\n  No woman with breast cancer should be subjected to substandard care. \nA woman should be confident in her diagnosis and every cancer patient \ndeserves a second opinion. S. 1730 ensures that. Every woman should be \noffered treatment options, including inpatient care. Every woman should \nhave adequate time to recover. It is time to recognize that the best \njudgment comes from the expert physician working with the patient. The \nlast question a woman should have to worry about when facing breast \ncancer is whether or not her health insurance plan will pay for \nappropriate care after a mastectomy of lumpectomy, or that she won't be \nable to remain in her doctor's immediate care for as long as she needs \nto be.\n  The evidence for the need for this bill, especially when it comes to \nso-called ``drive through mastectomies,'' is more than just \nallegorical. Indeed, the facts speak for themselves. Between 1986 and \n1995, the average length of stay for a mastectomy dropped from about 6 \ndays to about 2 to 3 days.\n  Many of my colleagues have joined with me in working for better \nscreening, research, and improved treatment. This issue of treatment \nand ensuring standards of care have been introduced and discussed. We \nhave had hearings back in the 105th Congress. And in the intervening \nyears, well over a million more women faced those words, ``You have \nbreast cancer''. Women, and their loved ones, deserve more.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and work \ntowards passing it this year.\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge October as \nNational Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This gives us an opportunity to \nremember the millions of victims and their families affected by breast \ncancer. More than 6,000 individuals in North Carolina are diagnosed \neach year with breast cancer, and 1,100 of them die as a result. Across \nthe country, one in nine women will be diagnosed with breast cancer \nduring their lifetime. This is a tragedy, and we must do more to treat \nit and find a cure.\n  As Breast Cancer Awareness Month comes to a close, I want to share \nthe story of an extraordinary family in Goldsboro, who has been \nimpacted by this disease in the most devastating and tragic sense. \nWillie and Mittie Darden, are the parents of 15 children. When Mr. \nDarden passed away in 1976, Mrs. Darden, known to her friends and \nfamily as Mit, became the head of the Darden family. As you can \nimagine, family gatherings at her home are always large, loving, and \nfilled with joy.\n  Mit has always been a woman of the deepest faith. Being a life-long \nmember of Darden Chapel Free Will Baptist Church, her faith was the \nunderpinning of the strength she needed to endure the loss of two \nchildren to childhood illness. No doubt the pain was tremendous. Years \nlater this pillar of strength for her family and community would endure \nthe harshest of fates as she would lose four daughters to breast \ncancer. They were Hattie Williams, Louise Darden, Bertha Bennett, and \nAnn Bryant.\n  Hattie Williams was the mother of one daughter and had four \ngrandchildren. She spent 20 years in the Wayne County School System as \na Head Start teacher, later becoming the owner and operator of her own \nday care center. On her 50th birthday, March 24, 1993, Mrs. Williams \ninvited her family to visit her. Her family recounts that she spent the \nevening walking the halls with them as she sang and gave thanks to God \nfor her life and her family. Two days later at dawn she passed away.\n  Louise Darden, nicknamed Lou Lou, was the mother of four children and \na grandmother of four. She, too, was a Head Start teacher. Ms. Darden \nwas also an avid cook and was responsible for designing the t-shirts \nfor the family reunions. As her illness worsened, it was she who gave \nstrength and comfort to her family. She truly felt we are spiritual \nbeings going through a human experience. She transitioned this life on \nMarch 2, 1998.\n  Bertha Bennett is remembered as the life of the party to her family. \nShe spent most of her adult life in Washington, D.C., where she was a \nmother of three children and a grandmother of nine. Family members say \nthat the teachings of her parents, rooted in the church, are what \ncaused her to overcome alcohol dependency and become a devout Jehovah \nWitness. Mrs. Bennett, called Bert by her family, served as a source of \ninspiration to her family and countless friends. Her family was \nvisiting her here in Washington at a hospice when word was sent to them \nthat Ann was being moved to a hospice in Goldsboro as she, too, was \nfighting breast cancer. By the time the family returned home to North \nCarolina, they learned Bert had died. It was May 12, 2000.\n  Ann Bryant had taken over the duties as family secretary and \norganizer after the death of her sister Hattie in 1993. The mother of \nfive children and six grandchildren, Ann spent her adult life caring \nfor others as a home hospice care nurse. When eastern North Carolina \nwas hit by catastrophic floods, Ann spent considerable time making sure \nher family and friends had adequate housing. Her family says that her \nconcern for others was so great that she was working on that project \nuntil the breast cancer had claimed her, 2 days after her sister Bert \nhad passed away. It was May 14, 2000, Mother's Day.\n  On Mother's Day 2000, Mittie Coley Darden was a mother grieving yet \nagain over the loss of not one but two more daughters to breast cancer. \nAll of these women were wives, mothers, grandmothers, and friends. \nWords could not describe her anguish. Her faith sustained her though. \nShe is the rock upon which others drew strength. It is in her tragedy \nthat others in her church and community have become more aware of the \nimportance of organizations like the Susan G. Komen Foundation, where \nearly detection and awareness programs are stressed. It is the story of \nher daughters that motivates others to participate in events like the \nRace for the Cure and to give of their resources to this cause.\n  Many of those who learn of Mit Darden's daughters are touched by the \nimmense loss but are moved to action. I, too, am deeply touched and \ninspired. Very recently another of Mrs. Darden's daughter's was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. It was discovered very early through one \nof her regular screenings. Her doctors say that it was discovered in \ntime and she has already started treatment. Through it all Mit Darden \nis ever faithful and prays that others will never have to endure what \nshe has. She only wants to share what we all hope and pray for--a cure.\n  I am proud to have led several efforts in Congress with ways to help \nreach that goal and help women who are diagnosed. The bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act that passed the Senate last year allows women to \nchoose an OB/GYN as a primary care physician. The bill also requires \nhealth insurers to cover hospital stays for breast cancer treatment \nprocedures. In the 106th Congress, I joined many of my colleagues in \ncosponsoring and passing legislation that gives Federal matching \nMedicaid dollars to provide breast and cervical cancer-related \ntreatment. This law was an important step in ensuring that individuals \nsuffering from breast cancer have access to modern treatment and \ntechnology regardless of their income level.\n  On behalf of Mit Darden and her daughters, and all the women and \ntheir friends and families affected by breast cancer, we must continue \nthe fight against this disease with compassion and action. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n\n[[Page S13796]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13794-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13794-S13796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, last Thursday the Senate passed H.R. \n1904, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. I voted for the bill because \nI believe we need to take action to bring our forests back to good \nhealth, and there are some good provisions in the Senate-passed version \nof the bill. For example, the Senate version allows communities to \nprovide recommendations on reducing the threat of unnaturally intense \ncatastrophic wildfire in community wildfire protection plans.\n  In addition, two amendments that I offered were adopted by the \nSenate. The first amendment requires collaborative monitoring of the \nsocial and ecological effects of projects. Without this requirement, we \nwill never be able to rebuild trust between rural communities and the \nagencies. The second amendment encourages the Forest Service and the \nBureau of Land Management to hire local contractors for forest thinning \nprojects in order to create jobs in forest-dependent communities.\n  Even so, I continue to believe there are serious problems with this \nlegislation. Most significantly, the bill fails to tackle the main \nobstacle constraining the Forest Service from improving forest health \nwhich is the agency's harmful policy of borrowing from proactive forest \nrestoration accounts to pay for firefighting. Some of the other major \nissues raised by the Senate language include a lack of any new funding \nto reduce hazardous fuels; curtailing public participation in the \nmanagement of public lands, including the establishment of a new so-\ncalled ``pre-decisional'' review process; and lack of protection for \nNational Monuments, roadless areas and other environmentally sensitive \nareas.\n  I tried to fix these problems by offering and cosponsoring \namendments, including one to give the Forest Service new authority to \nborrow funds directly from the Treasury when firefighting costs exceed \navailable funds. Unfortunately, this amendment did not prevail. \nHowever, Senator Burns, Senator Nickles, and others offered to work \nwith me to seek solutions to the ``fire borrowing'' problem. I accept \ntheir gracious offer and look forward to addressing this issue in the \nfuture with their cooperation and assistance.\n  Other amendments that were offered by myself and others to improve \nthe bill were defeated. Nonetheless, I voted for final passage of H.R. \n1904 because the Senate version was an improvement as compared to the \none passed by the House earlier this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13796-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n\n      Water Missions' Honduras Water Supply Demonstration Project\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina.

Water Missions is \na faith-based South Carolina organization that delivers potable water \nengineering systems to towns and villages in developing countries \naround the world. I ask Senator McConnell if he is familiar with Water \nMissions International and this important demonstration project.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I am familiar with Water Missions International \nand its work to provide water to communities in developing countries. I \nam particularly familiar with their current water project in a regional \nhospital in Honduras. I recently met with Water Missions' founders, \nGeorge and Molly Greene, to discuss this important project and was \nimpressed by Water Missions International's use of low-cost, \nappropriate technology for improving drinking water supplies.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. If I may raise one more issue, I am \nconcerned that United States Agency for International Development, \nUSAID, has at times not followed report recommendations made by the \nSenate and House Appropriations Committees. Is it the manager's \nintention that USAID follow the recommendation in the report?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely. I strongly support the report language \nthat was included in Omnibus Appropriations Bill earlier this year, \nsaying that ``the managers expect the Department of State and USAID to \nfollow the recommendations in the House and Senate reports, unless \nthose recommendations are modified in the statement of the managers.'' \nI am pleased that senior USAID officials recently met with Water \nMissions to begin the partnership process in implementing this \nparticular recommendation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I thank Senator McConnell for his \nsupport of Water Missions and its inclusion as an USAID project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13796-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13796-S13801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AMENDMENTS TO VARIOUS REGULATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND \n                             ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Committee Regulations Governing Assignment, Accountability, and \nInventory Control of Equipment, as amended, by adding a new section as \nfollows:\n\n           ``De Minimis Exception for Use of Senate Equipment\n\n       Sec. 11. It is the normal and standing policy of the Senate \n     that official Senate resources may only be used in connection \n     with official business. However, in recognition of the \n     infrequent need for authorized users of official Senate \n     resources or equipment to take care of occasional personal \n     matters during normal business hours, pursuant to S. Res. 238 \n     (108th Congress, 1st Session), the de minimis use of official \n     Senate resources (i.e. computers, Internet services, cellular \n     telephones, copiers and facsimile machines and other such \n     similar devices) is hereby permitted.\n       For purposes of this policy, ``de minimis use'' is defined \n     as the incidental, unofficial use of Senate resources or \n     equipment when such use is significantly negligible in nature \n     and frequency and at nominal expense to the government. Such \n     use must also not create the appearance of impropriety. The \n     de minimis use of official resources as described herein is \n     considered to be in the interest of the Senate. The de \n     minimis uses permitted herein are only acceptable when such \n     uses are performed without measurable interference to the \n     performance of the official duties of the authorized user and \n     are in compliance with the Senate Code of Official Conduct.\n       Nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit the \n     use of Internet services or any other official resources for \n     partisan, political or campaign purposes--such use is \n     strictly prohibited under any circumstances. Nothing \n     contained herein shall be construed to permit the use of \n     official Senate resources for any commercial activity or any \n     income-generating purpose or for any other illegal activity.\n       It is the responsibility of each Senator, Committee \n     Chairman, Officer of the Senate, or administrative office \n     head to oversee the use of official Senate resources by their \n     office and to ensure that the use is consistent with the \n     requirements established by this policy as well as any other \n     applicable laws and regulations. Nothing contained in the \n     above policy shall prevent a Senator, Committee Chairman, \n     Officer of the Senate or administrative office head from \n     adopting a more restrictive de minimis use policy.''\n\n  A copy of the Committee Regulations governing Assignment, \nAccountability, and Inventory Control of Equipment, as amended, is \nincluded as Attachment F. These amended regulations shall be effective \nas of November 1, 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attachments be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Attachment A--Committee on Rules and Administration Regulations \nGoverning the Payment of Funeral Expenses of Deceased Members--Adopted \n                             July 23, 1987\n\n       In accordance with Sec. 3.(a)(1) of Senate Resolution 458, \n     agreed to October 4, 1984, funeral arrangements for deceased \n     Senators made by the Sergeant at Arms and paid from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate shall be generally limited to \n     those activities and costs associated with the \n     transportation, preparation, and disposition of the remains. \n     [Such activities and costs may include, but not be limited \n     to, the following:] Such arrangements may include ordinary \n     and necessary expenses for the following:\n       1.

Time \n     limitation on the obligation of funds is restricted to a \n     Member's six-year term of office and a Committee's biennial \n     funding period.\n\n Attachment C--Committee Regulations Governing Furniture, Accessories \n       and Special Allowances Policy for Senate Office Buildings\n\n\noperational policy--senators' special Furniture and accessory allowance\n\n       1. An amount of [$2,500] $5,000 will be allotted from \n     appropriated funds to each newly elected/re-elected Senator \n     for the purpose of furnishing a Senator's personal office, \n     reception room, and conference room.\n       2. This allowance is for the purchase of furniture and \n     furnishings which are in addition to the furnishings \n     requested from the Standard Furniture and Accessories list \n     and will be authorized at the beginning of each Senator's new \n     term of office.

Provisions will be made for Senators to purchase from \n     this special allowance furniture and accessory items which \n     are unique to their offices and/or home states.\n       4. a. Items authorized for purchase include furniture, \n     furnishings and accessory items.

The\n\n[[Page S13798]]\n\n     purchase of items of art, antiques and artifacts is not \n     provided for in this allowance. Items purchased shall not be \n     available through other means such as the Senator's Official \n     Personnel and Office Expense Account. Examples of items not \n     provided for include ashtrays, paintings, frames, \n     photographs, clocks, cut flowers, decorative flowers, vases, \n     or bookends.\n       b. Items which are exceptions to the above requirements in \n     4.a., that is, are not required to be returned to stock, but \n     which may be procured through this allowance, include \n     materials to construct draperies, upgraded carpeting, and \n     materials and labor for the custom upholstering of furniture \n     items.\n       c. The Committee on Rules and Administration, in \n     conjunction with the Architect of the Capitol, will monitor \n     requests for non-standard items to preserve the architectural \n     conformity of the Senate Office Buildings.\n       5. All furniture and accessories, whether chosen from the \n     Standard list or purchased from the Senators' Special \n     Furniture and Accessory Allowance, remain the property of the \n     Architect of the Capitol.\n       6. Furnishings secured through this allowance may be \n     returned at any time at the request of the Senator, or the \n     Senator's designated Office Head, to the Architect's \n     inventory without credit to the Senators' special allowance.\n       7. Items obtained through the special allowance may be \n     purchased, at a depreciated price, from a Senator's personal \n     funds at any time. However, furniture furnished as standard \n     furniture for Senators or Staff from the Standard Furniture \n     and Accessories list, but which has been custom upholstered \n     with materials purchased from the special allowance, is not \n     available for purchase unless the Building Superintendent has \n     declared it to be surplus.\n       8. Items purchased through the special allowance which have \n     been returned to the Architect's inventory may be obtained by \n     a Senator at the depreciated value as a charge to that \n     Senator's Special Furniture and Accessory Allowance.\n       9.

Procurement will be accomplished by \n     the issuance of a purchase order from the Architect of the \n     Capitol to the vendor. Vendors will then bill the Architect \n     of the Capitol against the purchase order, with payment \n     following approval of each invoice. Reimbursements to other \n     accounts will not be made from the special allowance \n     accounts.\n\n Attachment D--Regulations Governing Payments and Reimbursements From \n   the Senate Contingent Fund for Expenses of Senate Committees and \n                         Administrative Offices\n\n(Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration on July 23, 1987 \nas authorized by S.

In the case of any such equipment which is \n     damaged, reimbursement shall be made in an amount equal to \n     the cost of repairs to such equipment, or its current value \n     (reduced by its salvage value), whichever is less.\n       (b)(1) Except to the extent otherwise provided in this \n     section, an office head shall be responsible for promptly \n     reimbursing the Senate, through the Sergeant at Arms, for any \n     such equipment made available to him in accordance with these \n     regulations which is lost, stolen, damaged (normal wear and \n     tear excepted), or otherwise unaccounted for, except that no \n     such reimbursement shall be required for such equipment which\n       (A) is stolen, if such office head promptly reported such \n     equipment as stolen to the appropriate law enforcement agency \n     and promptly notified the Sergeant at Arms of that fact in \n     writing; or\n       (B) is damaged, if such office head reported such equipment \n     as damaged, together with a statement as to how such damage \n     occurred, to the Sergeant at Arms as soon as practicable \n     after it had been determined damaged, and, on the basis of \n     such statement and other information available to the \n     Sergeant at Arms, the Sergeant at Arms determines that such \n     office head exercised a standard of care with respect to the \n     equipment entrusted to him which a reasonably prudent and \n     careful person would be expected to exercise in the case of \n     his or her own property of a like description under like \n     circumstances and that, in spite of such care, such equipment \n     was so damaged.\n       (2) An employee to whom responsibility for equipment has \n     been delegated in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 \n     and any other individual who is not an officer or an employee \n     of the Senate but who receives or is responsible for \n     equipment received from the Senate shall be responsible for \n     reimbursing the Senate, through the Sergeant at Arms, for any \n     such equipment so assigned to such employee which is lost, \n     stolen, damaged, or otherwise unaccounted for, except that no \n     such reimbursement shall be required for such equipment which\n       (A) is stolen, if such employee or other individual \n     promptly reported such equipment as stolen to the appropriate \n     law enforcement agency and promptly notified the Sergeant at \n     Arms and, in the case of an employee, such employee's office \n     head of that fact in writing; or\n       (B) is damaged, if such employee or other individual \n     reported such equipment as damaged, together with a statement \n     as to how such damage occurred, to the Sergeant at Arms and, \n     in the case of an employee, the employee's office head as \n     soon as practicable after it has been determined damaged, \n     and, on the basis of such statement and other information \n     available to the Sergeant at Arms, the Sergeant at Arms \n     determines that such employee or other individual exercised a \n     standard of care with respect to such equipment entrusted to \n     such employee or other individual which a reasonably prudent \n     and careful person would be expected to take of his own \n     property of a like description under like circumstances and \n     that, in spite of such care, such equipment was so damaged.\n       (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of these \n     regulations, in any case in which the Sergeant at Arms is \n     unable to obtain reimbursement from any employee in \n     connection with equipment assigned to that employee by an \n     office head, such office head shall be liable for such \n     reimbursement to the extent not recovered from such employee \n     in the same manner as if such assignment had not occurred. \n     The preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of an \n     employee who fails to so reimburse the Senate and who resigns \n     or retires or otherwise leaves his employment, if such office \n     head is in compliance with subsections (e) and (f)(2) of \n     section 4 of these regulations.\n       (c) Whenever lost or stolen equipment for which \n     reimbursement has been made is found or recovered, the \n     individual from whom reimbursement was received shall notify \n     the Sergeant at Arms immediately upon its recovery and shall \n     tender the property to the appropriate office of the Senate \n     for inspection by the Sergeant at Arms. The Sergeant at Arms \n     shall:\n       (1) Accept the equipment and refund to such individual the \n     amount of reimbursement paid;\n       (2) Accept the equipment and refund to such individual an \n     amount equal to the amount of reimbursement paid less the \n     decrease in value of the equipment between the time of its \n     loss and its recovery; or\n       (3) Refuse to accept return of the equipment and not refund \n     any of the reimbursement.\n\n\n                         DETERMINATION OF VALUE\n\n       Sec. 6. Whenever necessary for the determination of an \n     amount of reimbursement under these regulations, the Sergeant \n     at Arms shall determine the current value of equipment which \n     has been lost, stolen, or is otherwise unaccounted for, and \n     the current value, salvage value, and cost of repairs of \n     equipment which has been damaged.\n\n\n             WITHHOLDING OF COMPENSATION OR OTHER PAYMENTS\n\n       Sec. 7. (a) Promptly following receipt by him of official \n     notification or reliable public information that an office \n     head is resigning or retiring from, or has left or is \n     otherwise leaving, his or her office, the Secretary of the \n     Senate shall notify the Sergeant at Arms of that fact in \n     writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Sergeant at Arms \n     shall promptly ascertain whether such office head had an \n     unfilled financial obligation to the Senate in connection \n     with any equipment covered by these regulations and shall \n     promptly notify the Secretary of the Senate of his findings. \n     In the case of an office head who has such an unfulfilled \n     financial obligation, the Secretary of the Senate shall \n     withhold from any compensation or other payments due such \n     office head such amount or amounts as may be necessary to \n     satisfy such obligation.\n       (b) In the case of any employee who is resigning or \n     retiring from or who has left or is otherwise leaving, his or \n     her employment, the Secretary of the Senate, upon receiving \n     notification in accordance with subsections (e) and (f)(2) of \n     section 4 of these regulations, shall withhold from any \n     compensation or other payments due such employee such amount \n     or amounts as may be necessary to satisfy such obligation.\n       (c) In any other case in which the Sergeant at Arms is \n     unable, after a diligent effort, to obtain from any office \n     head or employee reimbursement of any obligation to the \n     Senate pursuant to these regulations, the Sergeant at Arms \n     shall notify the Secretary of the Senate to that effect and \n     the Secretary shall withhold amounts from compensation or \n     other payments otherwise due such office head or employee \n     until such reimbursement obligation has been satisfied \n     subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (d).\n       (d) The maximum part of the compensation or other payments \n     such office head, employee, or other individual derived from \n     earnings for any work period which is subject to withholding \n     under subsection (c) shall not exceed the lesser of\n       (1) twenty-five percent of his disposable earnings for that \n     period, or\n       (2) if the work period is a workweek, the amount by which \n     his disposable earnings for that workweek exceed 30 times the \n     Federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by section 6(a)(1) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 in effect at the time \n     the earnings are payable, or, if the work period is not a \n     workweek, the amount by which his disposable earnings for \n     that period exceed 30 times the equivalent multiple of the \n     Federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by the Secretary of \n     Labor for such period pursuant to section 303 of the Consumer \n     Credit Protection Act.\n       (e) In any case in which the Sergeant at Arms is unable, \n     after a diligent effort, to obtain from any office head or \n     employee or any individual who is not an officer or employee \n     of the Senate (but who receives, or is responsible for \n     equipment received from the Senate), reimbursement due from \n     such office head or employee or individual pursuant to these \n     regulations, the Sergeant at Arms shall take all lawful \n     action to obtain such reimbursement.\n       (f) To the extent permitted by law, moneys so withheld or \n     recovered as reimbursement in connection with equipment lost, \n     stolen, damaged, or otherwise unaccounted for pursuant to \n     these regulations, or by any other lawful means, shall be \n     deposited in the United States Treasury for credit to the \n     appropriation for ``Miscellaneous Items'' under the heading \n     ``Contingent Expenses of the Senate.''\n       (g) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as \n     precluding the Sergeant at Arms from utilizing any other \n     lawful means or remedies available to him in connection with \n     the obtaining from any such office head or employee, or any \n     such former office head, employee, or other individual any \n     reimbursement due the Senate for equipment lost, stolen, \n     damaged, or otherwise unaccounted for under these \n     regulations.\n\n\n                          WAIVER AND PETITION\n\n       Sec. 8. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of these \n     regulations, in any case in which the Sergeant at Arms \n     determines that the enforcement of the provisions of these \n     regulations relating to reimbursement would create an undue \n     hardship, or would not be in the public interest, the \n     Sergeant at Arms is authorized to waive, in whole or in part,\n\n[[Page S13801]]\n\n     such reimbursement otherwise required under these \n     regulations.\n       (b) Any office head, employee, or other individual who is \n     aggrieved by any final action of the Sergeant at Arms under \n     these regulations involving the matter of reimbursement may \n     petition the Committee on Rules and Administration for a \n     review of such action. On the basis of such petition, the \n     Committee is authorized to approve, disapprove, or modify the \n     action taken by the Sergeant at Arms, and, in the case of any \n     such disapproval or modification, to direct the Sergeant at \n     Arms to take action in conformity therewith.\n\n\n    EQUIPMENT OBTAINED UNDER SECTION 506(a)(9) OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1973 (2 U.S.C. 58(a)(9))\n\n       Sec. 9. The provisions of these regulations shall apply to \n     equipment purchased, leased, or otherwise acquired by a \n     Senator with funds available under section 506(a)(9) of the \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1973 (2 U.S.C. 58(a)(9)) and \n     to equipment purchased by a committee or an officer of the \n     Senate with appropriated funds. For purposes of these \n     regulations, any equipment so acquired shall be treated as \n     having been requested from the Sergeant at Arms, and as \n     having been made available by him on the date on which it is \n     delivered and installed in the office of the Senator.\n\n\n        FORMS FOR THE DELEGATION AND TRANSFER OF ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n       Sec. 10. In the case of equipment issued, reassigned, or \n     otherwise made available on or after the effective date of \n     these regulations, delegations and transfers of \n     accountability for equipment covered by these regulations \n     shall be documented on forms, the content and format of which \n     are set forth below.\n       [Applicable forms are supplied by the Sergeant at Arms' \n     Equipment Division when making equipment assignments or \n     reassignments.]\n\n\n            DE MINIMIS EXCEPTION FOR USE OF SENATE EQUIPMENT\n\n       Sec. 11. It is the normal and standing policy of the Senate \n     that official Senate resources may only be used in connection \n     with official business. However, in recognition of the \n     infrequent need for authorized users of official Senate \n     resources or equipment to take care of occasional personal \n     matters during normal business hours, pursuant to S. Res 238 \n     (108th Congress, 1st Session), the de minimis use of official \n     Senate resources (i.e. computers, Internet services, cellular \n     telephones, copiers and facsimile machines and other such \n     similar devices) is hereby permitted.\n       For purposes of this policy, ``de minimis use'' is defined \n     as the incidental, unofficial use of Senate resources or \n     equipment when such use is significantly negligible in nature \n     and frequency and at nominal expense to the government. Such \n     use must also not create the appearance of impropriety. The \n     de minimis use of official resources as described herein is \n     considered to be in the interest of the Senate. The de \n     minimis uses permitted herein are only acceptable when such \n     uses are performed without measurable interference to the \n     performance of the official duties of the authorized user and \n     are in compliance with the Senate Code of Official Conduct.\n       Nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit the \n     use of Internet services or any other official resources for \n     partisan, political or campaign purposes--such use is \n     strictly prohibited under any circumstances. Nothing \n     contained herein shall be construed to permit the use of \n     official Senate resources for any commercial activity or any \n     income-generating purpose or for any other illegal activity.\n       It is the responsibility of each Senator, Committee \n     Chairman, Officer of the Senate, or administrative office \n     head to oversee the use of official Senate resources by their \n     office and to ensure that the use is consistent with the \n     requirements established by this policy as well as any other \n     applicable laws and regulations. Nothing contained in the \n     above policy shall prevent a Senator, Committee Chairman, \n     Officer of the Senate or administrative office head from \n     adopting a more restrictive de minimis use policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13801-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF CHARLOTTE MORELAND\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I want to honor an \nextraordinary person and one of my most dedicated staff who is retiring \nfrom service in the United States Senate, Charlotte Moreland.\n  For 19 years, Charlotte has worked in my DC office, joining my team \nduring my very first year in the Senate. And for all these years, \nCharlotte has always been an advocate for West Virginia. Starting in my \npersonal office, Charlotte moved to the Veterans Committee when I \nbecame Chairman and found herself developing a voice and sense of duty \nfor veterans in West Virginia and across our country. Over the years, \nshe listened patiently as they expressed their concerns about a \ndisability claim or health care. She took note as they told their \nstories of bravery and sacrifice. She remembered the details of their \nlives that made the difference in getting them the benefits they had \nearned. Charlotte then took those stories to help craft legislation to \nimprove benefits for all veterans.\n  She spoke eloquently on behalf of these veterans. As Charlotte often \nwould tell those around her, VA is the second largest department in the \nUnited States, right behind the Department of Defense, and I have no \ndoubt that many working for VA have heard the voice of Charlotte \nMoreland. Her voice was gentle, but firm, when urging VA to take a \nsecond look at a claim or to check their records for something they may \nhave missed initially. But I have to tell you, this same voice would \nrise a few notches and not back down to get attention for a veteran \nwhom she felt was being treated unfairly on a claim, unable to get \nmedical treatment, or to ensure that a veteran got proper recognition \nwith a headstone to pay one last respect to their service. When those \ntimes came, I often wondered how Charlotte maintained such a friendly \nworking relationship with those at VA. She always smiled at me and said \nit was because they knew her heart was in the right place.\n  For West Virginia veterans, she has been a tireless advocate. \nWhenever Charlotte saw a gap in services or an unmet need, she worked \nto fill it. Our State's four VA Medical Centers received numerous \nvisits from Charlotte, and the facilities are better because of those \nvisits. Over the years, West Virginia has expanded the number of \nveteran centers and community-based outpatient clinics so that veterans \ncan have quality services nearby. Charlotte has made a real difference \nin the lives of many veterans and their families.\n  Charlotte Moreland is retiring from my office after a distinguished \ncareer. You need look no further than the plaques and awards she has \nreceived from Veterans Service Organizations to know that she will be \nmissed. You can hear praise in the telephone calls and the compliments \nin countless letters to my office to know that she will be missed. I am \nvery proud that Charlotte Moreland has been on my staff for these many \nyears, and I wish her all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13801-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13801-S13802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            CHARLES E.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate two \nVirginians, Dr. Edward Ayers and Dr. Patty Hale, on their recent \nselection as Professors of the Year. This award, given by the Council \nfor Advancement and Support of Education, is a major accomplishment as \nonly four national awards are given out each year. Dr. Ayers was \nrecognized as Outstanding Doctoral and Research College Professor of \nthe Year, and Dr. Hale was recognized as Outstanding Master's \nUniversity and College Professor of the Year.\n  While I have not had the pleasure of meeting with these individuals \npersonally, I have reviewed their qualifications. These two \nindividuals, who have dedicated large portions of their lives to higher \nlearning and to educating tomorrow's leaders, are imminently qualified \nfor these awards. How fortunate we are in Virginia to have two such \ndistinguished professors.\n  Dr. Edward Ayers is a Professor of History and Dean of Arts and \nSciences at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. An \nexpert in Southern history, Dr. Ayers has taught for over 20 years and \nhas authored numerous books. In 2000, he was appointed to the National \nCouncil for the Humanities by President Clinton, and in 2002, he was \nnamed to the Executive Board of the National Council for History \nEducation. He has also been recognized for excellence in teaching, \nhaving received the Arthur Stocker Award for Outstanding Teaching from \nthe ODK Honor Society at U.Va. and the Outstanding Faculty Award from \nthe State Council of Higher Education in Virginia.\n  In addition, Dr. Ayers has created an innovative online program, the \nValley of the South Project, which is a digital archive that allows \npeople from around the world to explore the history of the Civil War. \nFour million people have visited the Valley of the South Project to \nexplore the issues surrounding the coming, fighting, and aftermath of \nthe Civil War. The Project has also won the critical acclaim of Dr. \nAyers' peers, garnering the James Harvey Robinson Prize from the \nAmerican Historical Association and the E-Lincoln Prize for Best \nDigital Project.\n  Dr. Patty Hale is a Professor of Nursing at Lynchburg College, in \nLynchburg, VA. At Lynchburg College, she has won several teaching \nawards, including the State Council of Higher Education Distinguished \nFaculty Achievement Award.\n  One of Dr. Hale's most successful ventures has been her collaboration \nwith four of her students on writing two directories of their \ncommunity's health and social services. These booklets have been \ndistributed free of charge to area residents and health professionals \nand have enhanced the knowledge and patronage of area health resources.\n  Her work has earned Dr. Hale great respect and honors in her \ncommunity, including the James A. Huston Excellence in Scholarship \nAward. Dr. Hale is committed to serving those less fortunate and has \ninvested countless hours in forging community relationships to help \ndisadvantaged people in her area. She and her students have started \nprograms to provide health services to residents at several area \nshelters, clinics, and neighborhood health centers, most of which serve \ninner city low-income populations.\n  I commend both Dr. Ayers and Dr. Hales for the excellence in \neducation, and am pleased to recognize them as recipients of Professors \nof the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13802-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13802-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13802-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES REFERRED ON 10/30/2003\n\n  The following bill was read the first and second times by unanimous \nconsent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 1720.

A bill to prohibit profiteering and fraud relating to \nmilitary action, relief, and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senators \nFeinstein, Durbin, and Clinton the ``War Profiteering Prevention Act of \n2003.'' This bill creates criminal penalties for war profiteers and \ncheats who would\n\n[[Page S13804]]\n\nexploit the relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq to make an extra \nbuck. Sadly, these very same provisions are missing from the final \nversion of the $87 billion spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan \nbecause House conferees refused to accept the amendment, offering no \nsubstitute and no willingness to compromise. Republican and Democratic \nSenate conferees consistently supported the provision, which had been \nunanimously accepted during Senate Appropriations Committee markup of \nthe bill.\n  There are, of course, fraud statutes to protect against waste of tax \ndollars at home. But none expressly prohibit war profiteering and none \nexpressly confer extraterritorial jurisdiction overseas. Technical \njurisdictional elements in existing laws also make their applicability \nin these unique circumstances more difficult. The Leahy-Feinstein-\nDurbin-Clinton bill would criminalize ``war profiteering''--\novercharging taxpayers for any good or service with the specific intent \nto excessively profit from the war or reconstruction efforts in Iraq. \nThe bill also prohibits fraud and false statements in any matter \ninvolving a contract or the provision of goods or services in Iraq. \nThese new crimes would be felonies, subject to criminal penalties of up \nto 20 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million or twice the \nillegal gross profits of the crime. These are strong and focused \nsanctions that are narrowly tailored to criminalize and create tough \ncriminal penalties for fraud or excessive profiteering in contracts, \nhere and abroad, related to the war or reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n  Congress is about to send billions and billions of dollars to a place \nwhere there is no functioning government, under a plan with too little \naccountability and too few financial controls. That's a formula for \nmischief. We need strong disincentives for those who would defraud \ntaxpayers. It baffles me why House members would not want to provide \nthis protection to taxpayers. Every penny of our taxpayers' money must \nbe scrupulously spent and protected from waste. The message sent by \nthis bill speaks volumes; any act taken to financially exploit the \ncrisis situation in Iraq for exorbitant personal gain is simply \nreprehensible. It demeans and cheapens the sacrifices that our military \nand civilian personnel are making in Iraq.\n  In post-war times, where U.S. taxpayers have been called upon to bear \nthe burden of reconstruction contracts--where contracts are awarded in \na system that offers little competition and even less accountability--\nconcerns about wartime profiteering are of grave concern. Historical \nefforts to stem such profiteering have been successful: Congress \nimplemented excessive-profits taxes and contract renegotiation laws \nafter both World Wars, and again after the Korean War. Advocating \nexactly such an approach, President Roosevelt once declared it our duty \nto ensure that ``a few do not gain from the sacrifices of the many.'' \nThen, as now, our government cannot in good faith ask its people to \nsacrifice for reconstruction efforts that allow so many others to \nunfairly profit.\n  There is urgency to this important measure because criminal statutes \ncannot be applied retroactively. These controls need to be in place \nnow. We can only hope that the Senate will continue to press and \nsupport its prompt passage through Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1814. A bill to transfer lands between the Secretary of \nAgriculture and the Secretary of the Interior; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill transfer the control of the Mingo Job Corps Center to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to be administered by the U.S. Forest \nService. Since its inception, the Center has served at-risk youth by \nproviding a facility where students can complete their secondary \neducation and serve the local area through community service projects. \nThe Department of Labor has expressed their plans to contract out \noperations of the Mingo Center, which is currently administered by the \nFish and Wildlife Service, an action that would greatly increase the \nchances for the permanent closure of the facility.\n  The Mingo Job Corps Center has been extremely successful in southern \nMissouri. For over 40 years, the Center has been a place for students \nto complete their education, learn a trade, and serve the community. \nThrough the Center, students master trades from auto repair to fire \nfighting, from carpentry to culinary arts, and from bricklaying to \nbusiness. The closure of the facility would mean 250 students would not \nbe able to receive their High School Diploma, GED, or learn the skills \nnecessary to earn gainful employment.\n  For over 40 years the Center has made a substantial contribution to \nthe community through service projects. Mingo students have \nparticipated in national projects such as the recovery of the space \nshuttle Columbia and fighting western forest fires. However, the main \nimpact of their activities are felt locally in southern Missouri. Each \nyear the Mingo Job Corps completes over $1 million worth of community \nand conservation projects. These projects include construction of the \nPoplar Bluff Forest Service District Office, construction of many \nPuxico School buildings, and the painting and repair of furniture at \nvarious local schools.\n  The Mingo Job Corps Training Center is truly an invaluable asset to \nthe State of Missouri that must be preserved. Last year, with the help \nof Congresswomen Jo Ann Emerson, I secured a commitment from the USDA \nto have the Forest Service assume operation of the Mingo Job Corps \nCenter. However, now it has become necessary for this transfer to be \nhandled legislatively. My legislation will ensure that the Center will \ncontinue to be a positive force that shapes the lives of our youth. Our \neconomy and the kids who depend upon this facility will remain the real \nwinners here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13804-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13804-S13805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 257--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS \n SHOULD GIVE PRIORITY TO PASSING LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE TAX RELIEF FOR \nUNITED STATES MILITARY PERSONNEL AND SHOULD OFFSET THE COST OF SUCH TAX \n RELIEF WITH LEGISLATION PREVENTING INDIVIDUALS FROM AVOIDING TAXES BY \n                  RENOUNCING UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Congress \n     expects the Department of State, the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services to \n     implement the admission of 70,000 refugees as authorized by \n     the President for fiscal year 2004.\n       (b)(1) The Secretary of State shall utilize private \n     voluntary organizations with expertise in the protection \n     needs of refugees in the processing of refugees overseas for \n     admission and resettlement to the United States, and shall \n     utilize such agencies in addition to the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees in the identification and referral \n     of refugees.\n       (2) The Secretary of State shall establish a system for \n     accepting referrals of appropriate candidates for \n     resettlement from local private, voluntary organizations and \n     work to ensure that particularly vulnerable refugee groups \n     receive special consideration for admission into the United \n     States, including--\n       (A) long-stayers in countries of first asylum;\n       (B) unaccompanied refugee minors;\n       (C) refugees outside traditional camp settings; and\n       (D) refugees in woman-headed households.\n       (3) The Secretary of State shall give special consideration \n     to--\n       (A) refugees of all nationalities who have close family \n     ties to citizens and residents of the United States; and\n       (B) other groups of refugees who are of special concern to \n     the United States.\n       (4) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees describing the steps \n     that have been taken to implement this subsection.\n       (c) Not later than September 30, 2004, if the actual \n     refugee admissions numbers do not conform with the authorized \n     ceiling on the number of refugees who may be admitted, the \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall report to \n     Congress on the--\n       (1) execution and implementation of the refugee \n     resettlement program; and\n       (2) reasons for the failure to resettle the maximum number \n     of refugees.\n\n\nannual report on international religious freedom to include information \n            on anti-semitism and other religious intolerance\n\n       Sec. 696.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) International organizations and non-governmental \n     observers, including the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, the National Democratic Institute, and \n     Human Rights Watch documented widespread government \n     manipulation of the electoral process in advance of the \n     Presidential election held in Azerbaijan on October 15, 2003.\n       (2) Such organizations and the Department of State reported \n     widespread vote falsification during the election, including \n     ballot stuffing, fraudulent additions to voter lists, and \n     irregularities with vote tallies and found that election \n     commission members from opposition parties were bullied into \n     signing falsified vote tallies.\n       (3) The Department of State issued a statement on October \n     21, 2003 concluding that the irregularities that occurred \n     during the elections ``cast doubt on the credibility of the \n     election's results''.\n       (4) Human Rights Watch reported that government forces in \n     Azerbaijan used excessive force against demonstrators \n     protesting election fraud and that such force resulted in at \n     least one death and injuries to more than 300 individuals.\n       (5) Following the elections, the Government of Azerbaijan \n     arrested more than 330 individuals, many of whom are leaders \n     and rank-and-file members of opposition parties in \n     Azerbaijan, including individuals who served as observers and \n     polling-station officials who refused to sign vote tallies \n     from polling stations that the individuals believed were \n     fraudulent.\n       (6) The national interest of the United States in promoting \n     stability in the Caucasus and Central Asia and in winning the \n     war on terrorism is best protected by maintaining \n     relationships with democracies committed to the rule of law.\n       (7) The credible reports of fraud and intimidation cast \n     serious doubt on the legitimacy of the October 15, 2003 \n     Presidential election in Azerbaijan and on the victory of \n     Ilham Aliev in such election.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President and the Secretary of State should urge \n     the Government of Azerbaijan to create an independent \n     commission, with participation from the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, \n     to investigate the fraud and intimidation surrounding the \n     October 15, 2003 election in Azerbaijan, and to hold a new \n     election if such a commission finds that a new election is \n     warranted;\n       (2) the violence that followed the election should be \n     condemned and should be investigated in a full and impartial \n     investigation;\n       (3) the perpetrators of criminal acts related to the \n     election, including Azerbaijani police, should be held \n     accountable; and\n       (4) the Government of Azerbaijan should immediately release \n     from detention all members of opposition political parties \n     who were arrested for peacefully expressing political \n     opinions.\n       (c) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n     Attorney General, shall submit a report to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on International Relations and the \n     Committee of Appropriations of the House of Representatives \n     on the investigation of the murder of United States democracy \n     worker John Alvis.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the CARE Act. The \nCARE Act is the President's initiative to strengthen the work of \ncharities in this country by providing greater incentives to give to \nnonprofits. Recent newspaper accounts have noted that charitable giving \nhas declined in the recent year. Clearly, the President is right to \nseek additional tax benefits for charitable giving.\n  I cannot improve upon the Democratic leader's own assessment at the \ntime the CARE Act was passed by the Senate, when he said this:\n\n       This legislation, the CARE Act, expands our Nation's \n     capacity to respond to the needs of its citizens who need \n     help.\n\n  These are very fine words. Unfortunately, these words are not being \ntranslated into action. The Finance Committee passed the CARE Act on \nFebruary 27 and it was passed by the full Senate on April 9. The other \nbody passed the CARE Act earlier this fall. However, the Senate has \nbeen prevented from going to conference on this important legislation. \nThe other side has repeatedly blocked efforts to take the traditional \nstep of going to conference with the House to resolve outstanding \nmatters and, in turn, then put the President's good goals into law.\n  While there have been many arguments and claims made by the other \nside about why we cannot go to conference on the CARE Act, they seem to \nhave settled now on one, that the CARE Act is not going forward because \nof concerns that Democrat conferees from the Senate will not be able to \nmeaningfully participate in this conference.\n  I think, at least in the case of any legislation coming out of the \nFinance Committee, that sort of argument is pure nonsense. There is \nnothing in the history of this specific act, the CARE Act, or my \ndealings with the other side, that would give the other side cause to \nsuggest that they have justification to be concerned they would be shut \nout.\n  The CARE Act has at all times been a bipartisan effort, beginning \nwith Senators Santorum and Lieberman as the prime sponsors of this CARE \nAct. In addition, I have worked closely with Senator Baucus on this \nmatter as well as other members of the Democratic side of the aisle. \nMany of the provisions of this bill are due to priorities and concerns \nvoiced by the minority. I think it is fair to say that, as chairman, no \none has gone further in working with and listening to the other side on \nmatters that are of concern, not only in the CARE Act but in all \nlegislation considered by the Finance Committee.\n  The relationship between Senator Baucus and I working cooperatively \nis too well known for the leadership on the other side to ignore. I \nintend that tradition of bipartisanship to continue in conference on \nthe CARE Act. In fact, let me make it very clear. I give my word at \nthis time, as at other times, that all conferees from the Senate will \nbe meaningfully participating in the conference, and I am confident we \nwill come back from conference with a bill that will enjoy similar \nstrong bipartisan support enjoyed by the CARE Act when it first passed \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S13830]]\n\n  I cannot make a stronger statement or commitment. To reject it is to \nsuggest that the Democratic leadership does not think that I and \nSenator Baucus will continue our tradition of working in a bipartisan \nspirit on this bill. I cannot believe the leadership of the other side \nharbors such a view.\n  So if that is the true reason, concern that Senate Democrats will not \nbe able to meaningfully participate, I have given my word that will not \nbe the case. So we should now be able to go forward with a conference \non the legislation that the minority leader stated, when it passed,\n\n       . . . will get meaningful aid to organizations and \n     institutions that are equipped to help those who need help \n     the most.\n\n  I am worried that even though I have addressed the stated concern, we \nwill still not see movement on the CARE Act for unspoken reasons.\n  When it comes to unspoken reasons, it is just a matter of guess, or \nmaybe responding to whispers in the hallways.\n  It has been discussed widely in the media that many people ``hate'' \nPresident Bush. I fear this hatred is being translated into stopping \nthe President's signature initiative of strengthening our charitable \narena.\n  The sad thing is that the zeal to keep the President from having a \n``win'' will mean, as well noted by the minority leader, ``fewer meals \nfor the hungry, fewer beds for the homeless, fewer safe havens for \nbattered wives and children.'' I think this is most unfortunate.\n  When I questioned President Clinton's AmeriCorps Program 10 years \nago, I did not seek to end that program. I sought to reform it and to \nmake it work the way President Clinton intended that it work. I thought \nthen that President Clinton had a right to a small program for which he \nhad campaigned so aggressively. President Bush deserves the same \ncourtesy by allowing these tax initiatives for chartable giving to go \nthrough.\n  I am also concerned that overlooked is that the CARE Act contains \nmany other provisions Members are stopping. Let us not forget that the \nCARE Act is paid for by the most sweeping efforts to stop tax shelters \nin a generation. Those who stop the CARE Act are certainly being \ncheered on by the hucksters selling tax shelters so that corporations \ncan continue to avoid fair taxation.\n  In addition, the CARE Act also now includes legislation that will \nprovide tax relief for our military as well as low-income families with \nchildren. I have never seen such hand-wringing in this Chamber as has \nbeen the case regarding the need to pass military tax relief and \nexpanded child credit for low-income families. Now that we have a \nchance to have these matters go to conference on a bill that has a real \nchance of becoming law, we are being stopped by the Democratic \nminority. I am worried that what is desired by some is an issue--not a \nsolution to the child credit for low-income families and tax relief for \nmilitary personnel.\n  Let me close by saying I have addressed the other side's stated \nconcerns. I have given my personal commitment that Democratic Members \nwill be meaningful participants in the conference on the CARE Act. If \nthat is their only reason, then I have put that to rest. If they \ncontinue to object, I fear it is for a small reason, maybe a petty \nreason, a reason that puts partisanship before the welfare of those \nmost in need. If that is the case, I can only state that I am saddened \nand certainly disappointed.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 7, the charitable giving bill. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken; that the Snowe amendment and the Grassley-Baucus amendments \nwhich are at the desk be agreed to en bloc; that the substitute \namendment which is the text of S. 476, the Senate-passed version of the \ncharitable choice bill, as amended by the Snowe and Grassley-Baucus \namendments, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nfurther, that the Senate insist upon its amendments and request a \nconference with the House; and, lastly, that the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees with the ratio of 3 to 12, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of all, \nI say to my friend that I have the greatest admiration and respect for \nthe Senator from Iowa. I don't say that lightly. No one I know of has \never questioned his ability to be a legislator in the truest sense of \nthe word.\n  Let me also say--and I speak for myself and I hope I speak for \neveryone on this side--that I don't hate President Bush. I disagree \nwith him on certain issues. I certainly don't hate him. I don't dislike \nPresident Bush. I like him. In all of our meetings, on a personal \nbasis, he has been very cordial. He seems to be a very nice man, and he \nis President of the United States; I recognize that. But on some \nissues, I disagree.\n  This matter of how we should proceed has nothing to do with the \nintegrity of the chairman of the Finance Committee. It has everything \nto do with what has happened with the Republican leadership in the \nHouse and the Senate as to what happened with the bills that need to go \nto conference. We, of course, over here are very concerned--and it is \nalmost to a point of frightening--with these nonconferences that take \nplace.\n  I object, and I will put forward my own unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7, as reported by the \nSenate Finance Committee; that there be only two amendments in order, \nwhich are at the desk; that those amendments be agreed to; that the \nact, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table without any intervening action or \ndebate.\n  I think that will move this very important piece of legislation \nforward, and we can resolve it within a matter of days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nSenator from Nevada?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill object--first of all, we have advanced this bill according to the \nrules of the Senate with the provisions that are necessary to go to \nconference. I am disappointed we don't have that opportunity to go to \nconference. This will not be our last effort to try to get to \nconference.\n  I appreciate the unanimous consent request by my friend from Nevada, \nthe assistant minority leader, because I know he is sincere in \nproceeding along the lines he would like to proceed. But I think it \ndoes suggest that there is a nervousness on the other side as to the \nrightness of my original request and that we ought to get this to \nconference.\n  The conference could be settled very quickly. We could get the bill \nback here and for charitable organizations and for military families, \nand also try to help low-income families with refundable tax credits, \nas has been the position of the Senate for a long period of time.\n  I also suggest he may be legitimately concerned about how the other \nbody handles conferences. I appreciate his understanding that I try to \nbe fair. But in the process, comity dictates that what the other body \ndoes the other body does, and we have to work within the environment of \nwhat we can control. What we can control is what the Senate does. Along \nthose lines, I have made my commitment that there be full Democrat \nparticipation, and that is about as far as I can go.\n  So I object to the unanimous consent request by the Senator from \nNevada, the assistant minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13830-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13830-S13831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1904\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with \nrespect to H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests bill, the Senate insist upon \nits amendments and request a conference with the House. I further ask \nthat the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees at a ratio of 3-2.\n\n[[Page S13831]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have had a \ndifficult time with conference committees. A perfect example is the \nvery important Medicare conference. With that matter, we have had the \nmajority say you can have two Democrats attend, but they are the only \nones. If anybody else comes into the room who should not be on the \nconference, we will terminate that session of the conference.\n  Conferences have not been as we believe they should, where you have \nDemocrats representing the minority and Republicans representing the \nmajority meeting and trying to work out issues. These matters are \nsimply resolved behind closed doors with Democrats having no input. \nRegarding the very important supplemental, which was completed and \nvoted on and passed today, Senator Stevens specifically said on the \nfloor he would have a full participation of all conferees. We did that. \nThe conference took 2 days. It was tough and grueling. We won very few \nissues, but at least we had a conference.\n  Healthy Forests is a bill I support wholeheartedly. As I indicated \nwith the votes taken by the Senate on this issue, most Democrats \nsupport this issue. But we want a conference. We are not going to get \none. What we suggest is we take our bill and merge it with the House \nbill and send it back to the House. If they don't like something, they \ncan send it back with amendments. That is what we recommend and that is \nhow we are going to stand on the issue.\n  Respectfully, I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have had forest fires raging in the \nWest for a number of years, and this year it finally hit in a big \nState--California--and destroyed the home of the chairman of the House \nArmed Services Committee. Finally, it got the attention of large \nnumbers of Americans, including Members of this body.\n  With all due respect to my friend from Nevada, the way we do \nlegislation is we appoint conferees and the House and Senate work out \ntheir differences. I hope some time before we are out of session this \nyear we will be able to follow the normal legislative procedure and \ngive the conferees a chance to reconcile the differences between the \nHouse and the Senate and move forward on this most important issue, \nbecause it is not going away. It is going to continue to be a problem \nsummer after summer.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may be recognized to respond to my \nfriend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the fires in California were disastrous. But \nwhat happened in California is not going to be changed by virtue of a \nconference. We believe if the majority really wants a bill--and I \nbelieve they do--they should take our suggestion. It is not anything \nunique. It has been done many times in the past. We have done it this \nyear; that is, just take what we have passed in the Senate and send it \nto the House. If there is something they don't like, they can send it \nback to us with an amendment. That would be my suggestion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13831-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 7\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3365.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3365) to amend title 10, United States Code, \n     and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the death \n     gratuity payable with respect to deceased members of the \n     Armed Forces and to exclude such gratuity from gross income.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are tonight adopting long overdue \nlegislation to rectify a number of inequities faced by members of our \nNation's armed services.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, these brave men and \nwomen have been called upon to make terrific sacrifices. They have left \ntheir families and friends behind for months at a time to willingly \ncast themselves into harm's way. Whether in Afghanistan, Iraq, or on \nwhatever battlefield the war against terrorism must be fought, these \ncourageous patriots have put their lives on the line to defend our \nfreedoms.\n  While I realize that we could never begin to fully repay these fine \nyoung Americans--not to mention the loved ones they leave behind--the \nSenate has an opportunity tonight to show our gratitude for their \nsacrifices.\n  The legislation before us, which the Finance Committee first \ndeveloped during the 107th Congress, will ensure that members of the \nuniformed services, the National Guard, and the foreign service are \ntreated fairly in all aspects of the tax code.\n  First, this legislation ensures that the families of military \npersonnel called into active duty are not disadvantaged under the home \nsale exclusion. Unlike most Americans, military personnel who are \ncalled to active duty or asked to relocate often lack the flexibility \nto meet residency requirements under the exclusion and are adversely \nimpacted by these rules. This legislation would suspend the residency \ntest for periods of active duty aggregating no more than 10 years.\n  We should not punish members of our military and their families who \nare asked to relocate in the name of service to their country.\n  This legislation also clarifies that dependent care benefits provided \nto families of the uniformed services will not be treated as taxable \ncompensation. The provision of affordable childcare is an important \nfunction of the military during peacetime; but it is never more \ncritical than during periods of conflict--families.\n  We must also not forget about the increasing role that Reserve and \nNational Guard members fulfill in our Nation's defense. Currently, more \nthan 157,000 reservists and National Guard are on active duty status--\nmost assisting in Operation Iraqi Freedom. We have begun to rely \nincreasingly on these service personnel to defend our borders and to \nserve and protect in other areas of the world.\n  This legislation will allow an above-the-line deduction for travel \nexpenses that these men and women incur related to training \nassignments. This provision will at least partially reimburse national \nguard members and reservists for the expenses they incur when they \ntravel for weekend drills.\n\n[[Page S13832]]\n\n  The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act also ensures that military \npersonnel serving in Secretary of Defense designated ``contingency \noperations'' receive appropriate relief from the administrative burdens \nof our tax laws during participation in those operations.\n  What's more, this legislation is completely offset. All of the \nmilitary tax fairness provisions in this legislation are fully funded \nby extending Customs user fees.\n  As we consider this legislation tonight, the men and women of our \narmed forces remain in hostile situations, battling terrorism wherever \nthat battle may lead. At the same time, their loved ones--wives, \nhusbands, parents, children--remain at home, making equally demanding \nsacrifices as they struggle to make ends meet. It is deeply regrettable \nthat Congress has delayed so long to enact this commonsense \nlegislation.\n  We must delay no longer. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation to provide the tax relief that our military personnel need \nand deserve.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment \nto the Fallen Patriots Tax Benefit Act of 2003. The bill that we \nreceived from the House includes two important provisions that the \nSenate has already approved this year. However, it does not include the \nnumerous other provisions that the Senate has passed to ensure equity \nfor military personnel. This amendment would add these important \nprovisions.\n  First, the House bill doubles the amount of the death gratuity \npayments for members of our military. Under current law, the families \nof military personnel receive a death gratuity benefit of $6,000. This \nbill would increase that amount to $12,000. The Senate included this \nprovision in the defense authorization bill that is currently in \nconference.\n  Second, the House bill ensures that these payments will not be \nsubject to taxation. Under current law, death gratuity benefits are \nexcludable from income only to the extent they were as of September 9, \n1986, which was $3,000.\n  In 1991, the benefit was increased to $6,000, but the Tax Code was \nnever adjusted to exclude the additional $3,000 from income. Because of \nthis oversight, the U.S. Government has been taxing families for the \ndeath of a family member who died in combat.\n  The House bill would make the entire $12,000 death gratuity benefit \ntax-free, and ensure that families are not hit with a tax bill during \ntheir most difficult hour. This provision was included in the Senate \npassed Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act.\n  That is what this bill does. Now let me talk about what the House \nbill does not do.\n  This bill does not include the numerous other provisions for military \npersonnel that were included in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of \n2003, which was passed by the Senate in May. These provisions are vital \nto ensuring tax equity for our active duty military and reservists.\n  Let me explain these provisions.\n  First, the House bill does not include the exclusion of gain on the \nsale of a principal residence.\n  In 1997, Congress passed legislation revising the taxation of capital \ngains on the sale of a person's principal residence.\n  The new law provides that up to $250,000--or $500,000 for a married \ncouple--is excluded on the sale of a principal residence if the \nindividual has lived in the house for at least 2 of the previous 5 \nyears.\n  However, when enacted, Congress failed to provide a special rule for \nmilitary and Foreign Service personnel who are required to move either \nwithin the U.S. or abroad.\n  Our proposal in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act would permit \nservice personnel and members of the Foreign Service to suspend the 5-\nyear period while away on assignment. That means that those years would \nnot count toward either the 2 years or the 5-year periods. Senators \nMcCain, Graham, and Lincoln proposed a bill in the last session to \ncorrect this.\n  Second, the House bill does not allow for the exclusion from taxable \nincome of amounts received under the Military Housing Assistance \nProgram. The Department of Defense provides payments to members of the \nArmed Services to offset diminution in housing values due to military \nbase realignment or closure.\n  For example, if a house near a base was worth $140,000 prior to the \nbase closure and $100,000 after the base closure, DOD may provide the \nowner with a payment to offset some, but not all, of the $40,000 \ndiminution in value. Under current law, those amounts are taxable as \ncompensation.\n  We should ensure that those men and women losing value in their homes \ndue to a Federal Government decision are not adversely affected \nfinancially.\n  The proposal in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act would provide that \npayments for this type of lost value are not includible into income.\n  Third, the House bill does not expand the combat zone filing rules to \ninclude contingency operations. Under current law, military personnel \nin a combat zone are afforded an extended period for filing tax \nreturns.\n  However, this does not apply to contingency operations. This proposal \nin the Armed Forces Taxes Fairness Act would extend the same benefits \nto military personnel assigned to contingency operations.\n  It cannot be easy trying to figure out our complicated tax system \nwhile you are overseas and protecting our nation's freedom. Those men \nand women who are sent to uphold democracy and freedom in other \ncountries are confronted with the same filing complications as combat \nzone personnel.\n  Contingency operations are just as demanding as combat zone \ndeployment, although not always in the same manner. For example, in our \ncurrent war on terrorism, this proposal would help members of our \nSpecial Forces in the Philippines supporting Operation Enduring \nFreedom. These troops are just as focused on accomplishing their \ncritical mission as our troops in the Iraqi combat zone.\n  Fourth, the House bill does not provide an above-the-line deduction \nfor overnight travel expenses of National Guard and Reserve members. \nSome reservists who travel one weekend per month and two weeks in the \nsummer for Reserve duty incur significant travel and lodging expenses.\n  For the most part, these expenses are not reimbursed. Under current \nlaw, these are deductible as itemized deductions but must exceed 2 \npercent of adjusted gross income.\n  For lower income reservists, this deduction does not provide a \nbenefit, because they do not itemize. For higher income reservists, the \n2 percent floor limits the amount of the benefit of the deductions.\n  In my home State of Montana, we have approximately 3,500 reservists--\n800 of whom travel each month across the State for their training. \nThese 800 reservists pay travel and lodging expenses out of their own \npocket.\n  Montana ranks 48th in the Nation for per capita personal income. So \nthat $200 expense for Reserve duty every month means a lot to the \nMontana reservist. Yet, they continue selflessly to provide their \nservices to our country at their own expense. For those reservists who \ntravel out of State for their training, this expense is even higher.\n  The proposal in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act would provide an \nabove the line deduction for overnight travel costs and would be \navailable for all reservists and members of the National Guard.\n  Fifth, the House bill does not expand the rules to qualify for \nmembership of veterans organizations. Currently, qualified veterans \norganizations under section 501(c)(19) of the tax code both tax-exempt \nand contributions to the organization are tax deductible.\n  In order to qualify under 501(c)(19), the organization must meet \nseveral tests. For example, 75 percent of the members must be current \nor former military, and substantially all of the other members must be \neither spouses, widows, or widowers of current or former military.\n  The proposal in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act would permit lineal \ndescendants and ancestors to qualify as eligible members of these \nimportant groups.\n  It is important that our veterans organizations continue the good \nwork that they do. But, as the organizations age, they are in danger of \nlosing tax-exempt status. The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act helps \nensure the vitality of these organizations.\n\n[[Page S13833]]\n\n  Sixth, the House bill does not clarify the tax treatment of childcare \nsubsidies. I want to ensure that parents in the military can continue \ntheir dedicated service with the knowledge that their children are well \ntaken care of.\n  The military provides extensive childcare benefits to its employees. \nEmployees at DoD-owned facilities provide childcare services while \nother areas with non-DoD owned facilities contract out their childcare.\n  When Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, we included a \nprovision stating that qualified military benefits are excluded from \nincome. It is not absolutely clear whether childcare provisions are \ncovered under this provision.\n  The proposal in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act would clarify that \nany childcare benefit provided to military personnel would be \nexcludable from income.\n  Seventh, the House bill does not allow students at the Service \nAcademies to use their education savings account funds. In contrast, \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act does permit penalty-free withdrawals \nfrom education savings accounts and qualified tuition programs made on \naccount of the attendance of the account holder or beneficiary at any \nof the Service Academies. The amount of the funds that can be withdrawn \npenalty-free is limited to the costs of advanced education in that \ncalendar year.\n  Eighth, the House does not allow the IRS to suspend the tax-exempt \nstatus of terrorist organizations. Under current law, there is no \nprocedure for the IRS to suspend the tax-exempt status of an \norganization.\n  The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act would allow the suspension of the \ntax-exempt status of an organization for any period during which the \norganization is designated or identified by Executive Order as a \nterrorist organization.\n  Ninth, the House bill does not provide tax relief for families of \nthose killed in the Space Shuttle Columbia. Current law provides for \nincome tax, estate tax, and death benefit relief to soldiers who are \nkilled in a combat zone, victims of the September 11 attacks, the \nOklahoma City bombing victims, and the victims of the anthrax attacks.\n  The crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia was heroic in every sense of \nthe word. We have a duty to those who lost their lives for the \nadvancement of science and increasing our knowledge of the world we \nlive in. The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act would make all of the above \nbenefits available to the families of the Columbia crew.\n  The tenth and final difference between the House bill before us and \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act is that the bill before us is not \noffset. In contrast, the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act is completely \noffset by strengthening the collection of taxes from people who have \nrenounced their U.S. citizenship in order to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  However, some of our colleagues in the House have objected to this \nprovision. So in the interest of enacting these important military tax \nprovisions as quickly as possible, the Senate changed the offset to a \nsimple extension of the present law customs user fees.\n  The Senate amendment to the House bill would add these very important \nnine provisions. In addition, it would add an offset that the House has \nnot opposed this offset in the past. We hope that this compromise on \nour part will allow them to pass the provisions from the Armed Forces \nTax Fairness Act that we have included in this amendment.\n  The passage of the death gratuity payments provision is an important \nfirst step. However, there are thousands of men and women in uniform \nthat are depending on us to pass the other ten provisions included in \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act.\n  Simply put, there is absolutely no excuse if Congress fails to pass \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act this year.\n  Everyday, our military men and women fight for our freedom and the \nfreedom of every American. Their sacrifices are great. Passing the \nother ten provisions included in the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act is \nnot a lot for them to ask of Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to pass the Senate amendment to the \nFallen Patriots Act of 2003.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to express my full support for the \npassage of H.R. 3365, the Fallen Patriots Tax Relief Act. Earlier this \nyear, the Senate passed S. 704, introduced by myself, Senator Warner, \nSenator McCain, Senator Allen, and Senator Ben Nelson, which would have \nincreased the death gratuity paid to the survivors of deceased members \nof our military from $6,000 to $12,000. Further, it would make this \nincrease retroactive to September 11, 2001. I am pleased that H.R. 3365 \nincorporates this legislation.\n  There is no better way to honor the memories of fallen soldiers than \nto ensure that their loved ones receive the support they deserve. The \ndeath gratuity is provided within days to the family of the \nservicemember killed while on active duty. These funds help the family \nto deal with immediate needs during this difficult time. Given the \nsacrifices of our troops currently in Iraq. I believe that this \nincrease in assistance is far past due.\n  H.R. 3365 also ensures that the death gratuity is tax free. I fully \nsupport this legislation, and believe that it sends a strong message of \nsupport to our troops. As the brave men and women of our military \ncontinue to go in harm's way in defense of our Nation, it is crucial \nthat they do so with the confidence that their families will have our \nfull support should tragedy occur.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nMcCain-Baucus-Grassley amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; \nthat the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the \ntitle amendment be agreed to; that the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, en bloc; and that any statements relating to the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2051) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The title amendment (No. 2052) was agreed to, as follows:\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to amend title 10, \n     United States Code, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     increase the death gratuity payable with respect to deceased \n     members of the Armed Forces and to exclude such gratuity from \n     gross income, to provide additional tax relief for members of \n     the Armed Forces and their families, and for other \n     purposes.''.\n\n  The bill (H.R. 3365), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13833-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13833-S13834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    GIVING PRIORITY TO PASSING TAX RELIEF LEGISLATION FOR MILITARY \n                               PERSONNEL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 257, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 257) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that Congress should give priority to passing \n     legislation to provide tax relief for United States military \n     personnel and should offset the cost of such tax relief with \n     legislation preventing individuals from avoiding taxes by \n     renouncing United States citizenship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Military Tax \nFairness Act of 2003, about $1.1 billion in tax relief for our military \nfamilies. I support this bill. We all support this bill. In fact, we \npassed this unanimously or near unanimously on a coupe of previous \noccasions. We are visiting this bill again today because the House of \nRepresentatives does not like the offset we used to pay for the bill. \nWe paid for it by taxing individuals who renounce their United States \ncitizenship in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  It is astounding to me that this bill keeps getting bounced back and \nforth between the Senate and the other body over this issue. We are \ntalking about tax relief for military families and we want Americans \nwho are exploiting tax loop holes to step up and make that relief \npossible. Most of these people have known great financial success. They \nwere blessed by the economic opportunity that our nation's liberty \ngives us and the free enterprise system which make those fortunes \npossible.\n\n[[Page S13834]]\n\nThose blessings were secured by our military personnel. Every year, the \nUnited States Treasury loses about $80 million on individuals who \ndecide that they would prefer to have their cake and eat it too. They \nwant American markets, they want American prestige, they want American \nstability, but they do not want the obligations that accrue to American \ncitizenship. All the Senate was saying is if you benefited from this \nnation's security, you should be willing to pay for it.\n  When the Senate first considered this legislation, I had hoped to \ninclude a tax credit for the private sector employers of our National \nGuard and Reserve. When our Guard and Reserves answer the call to serve \nthey leave jobs, homes, and most of all, their families behind. Many \nemployers continue to pay all or part of the salaries of those \nemployees who get called up. My legislation would provide those \npatriotic employers with a tax credit for paying up to 50 percent of \nthe salaries for their Guard and Reserve employees.\n  I understand that my legislation cannot be included in this bill. So \nI am introducing a sense of the Senate resolution to put us on record \nas supporting these employers. The resolution states that we should pay \nfor this tax credit by closing the expatriation loophole.\n  The facts are simple, and they are laid out in this resolution. Since \n2001, the President has signed tax cuts amounting to $1.75 trillion. \nToday, military families will get their first taste at direct relief. \nYet, this bill amounts to less than .1 percent of the tax relief that \nthe Government has doled out. No one could justify this to voters. So \nit's been happening behind closed doors--in conference reports, and \nparliamentary maneuvering. This resolution is a first step to putting a \nbright, hot spotlight on the truth. The leadership of the House Ways \nand Means Committee is more interested in protecting expatriate \ncorporations, than it is in providing meaningful tax benefits to the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces.\n  I am glad for what we are doing in this bill, but there is so much \nmore that can be done and should be done. Personally, I believe that a \nmilitary tax vehicle should be used to discuss military tax issues. \nHowever, the Senate cannot stand in the way of immediate relief to the \nfamilies of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice in battle. For \nthat reason, we are passing this resolution today to send a signal that \nthis imbalance must come to an end.\n  I appreciate the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee \nfor agreeing to this resolution in conjunction with the underlying \nbill. I look forward to working with them in the future on giving this \ntax relief to America's employers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 257) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 257\n\n       Whereas Congress is responsible for providing United States \n     military personnel with the equipment, supplies, and other \n     resources needed to preserve our freedom;\n       Whereas Congress is responsible for providing United States \n     military personnel with a comprehensive compensation package;\n       Whereas, since 2001, Congress has passed and the President \n     has signed legislation providing for $1,750,000,000,000 in \n     tax relief;\n       Whereas the Senate has passed legislation providing for \n     $1,100,000,000 in additional tax relief for United States \n     military personnel and their families;\n       Whereas United States citizens benefit from economic \n     opportunities which arise from the liberty protected by \n     United States military personnel;\n       Whereas the United States loses approximately $80,000,000 \n     per year in tax revenue from individuals who renounce United \n     States citizenship;\n       Whereas the Senate has unanimously passed legislation which \n     prevents individuals from avoiding taxes by renouncing United \n     States citizenship as an offset to the cost of providing tax \n     relief for the 1,400,000 active duty military personnel and \n     the 1,200,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves; and\n       Whereas Congress has asked the Comptroller General of the \n     United States to conduct a study on the total compensation \n     package provided for United States military personnel in \n     order to ensure that the unique needs of military personnel \n     are addressed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress should give priority to passing legislation to \n     provide tax relief for--\n       (A) United States military personnel, including those \n     serving in the National Guard and Reserves; and\n       (B) the employers of active duty members of the National \n     Guard and Reserves; and\n       (2) the cost of such tax relief should be offset by \n     legislation which prevents individuals from avoiding taxes by \n     renouncing United States citizenship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/03/senate-section/article/S13834-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13834-S13835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FIFTY YEARS OF OUTSTANDING SERVICE BY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S.J. Res. 22, which was \nintroduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res 22) recognizing the \n     Agricultural Research Service of the Department of \n     Agriculture for 50 years of outstanding service to the Nation \n     through agricultural research.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on November 3, 2003, the Agricultural \nResearch Service, the primary research agency in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, will celebrate its 50th anniversary. To commemorate this \nspecial anniversary, I, along with Senator Harkin, am offering a Senate \njoint resolution to recognize the important contributions the \nAgricultural Research Service provides to the agriculture community and \nto the Nation. Although ARS can trace its heritage back to early 19th \ncentury seed collection activities in the U.S. Patent Office, it was \nofficially organized on November 2, 1953, when USDA consolidated most \nof its research functions into the newly named Agricultural Research \nService. Today, ARS is a public institution that conducts agricultural \nresearch exclusively for the public good. The research is often long-\nterm and costly, and unlikely to be undertaken by the private sector. \nThe ARS discoveries and innovations touch the lives of every American \nthrough the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the environment in \nwhich we live.\n  I am very proud of the accomplishments ARS has made in my State. For \nexample, ARS established the Lower Mississippi Delta Nutrition \nIntervention Research Initiative in 1995 to improve the health of \nresidents of the Mississippi Delta through nutrition intervention \nresearch. ARS has partnered with, among others, the University of \nSouthern Mississippi in Hattiesburg and Alcorn State University in \nLorman to identify food and nutrition problems in communities and to \ndesign nutrition interventions to determine how and why people make \nfood choices, and how those choices could be improved. Another fine \nexample of the partnership between the ARS and our Mississippi \nuniversities is the Southern Horticultural Laboratory in Poplarville. \nThis ARS small fruit research facility, in cooperation with Mississippi \nState University, has led in the establishment of a vibrant blueberry \nindustry in South Mississippi and other Gulf Coast States and has now \nexpanded to include research on ornamentals and vegetables.\n  The ARS Catfish Genetics Research Unit at Stoneville, in partnership \nwith Mississippi State University, bred a new catfish variety, NWAC \n103, and released it in February 2001. This marks one of the few times \ngenetic research has improved catfish since the industry started in the \nUnited States in the late 1950s. Since then, catfish has become one of \nthe most successful aquacultural enterprises, thereby guaranteeing a \nplentiful supply of high-quality fish to consumers. Also, ARS \nscientists, in partnership with the University of Mississippi \nscientists, invented a new natural product-based algaecide for use in \ncatfish aquaculture, thus providing an alternative to synthetic \nherbicides.\n  A special ARS project in the late 1990s in Mississippi showed that \nfarm runoff is not damaging Mississippi\n\n[[Page S13835]]\n\ngroundwater. Data from the 7,320-acre Mississippi Delta Management \nSystems Evaluation Areas in Sunflower and LeFlore counties showed \ncontamination by farm chemicals is not a problem. The Mississippi Delta \nMSEA also focused on farmland erosion control and preventing sediment \nand chemical runoff into three oxbow lakes: Beasley, Thighman and Deep \nHollow. Technology being tested in the Delta MSEA not only enhances the \nhealth of the lakes, thus increasing fish and duck numbers, but may \nalso help growers reduce costs.\n  To mark its five decades of public service and, in recognition of the \nlocal and national partnerships that are the foundation of much of \ntheir research, ARS will celebrate with various events throughout the \nnext year following a kick-off celebration on November 3, 2003.\n  I commend the Agricultural Research Service on the occasion of its \n50th anniversary and look forward to many more years of its important \nservice to the Nation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 50 years ago, James Watson and Francis \nCrick were identifying the double-helix molecule of DNA. The first \nembryo transfers from donor cows to recipients were made. The Korean \nWar ended. And the Agricultural Research Service was created.\n  The creation of ARS was not the beginning of the Department of \nAgriculture's efforts in agricultural research. President Abraham \nLincoln signed the act creating the department, which included the \ncharge to ``acquire and diffuse among the people of the United States \nuseful information . . . and to procure, propagate, and distribute \namong the people new and valuable seeds and plants.'' The Department's \ncommitment to agricultural research reaches back nearly 150 years. The \nARS itself was created by Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson \nthrough a reorganization of the former Agricultural Research \nAdministration, on November 2, 1953.\n  In its 50 years of service, the ARS has discovered dozens of ways to \nprotect crops and livestock from pests and disease. It has improved the \nquality and safety of agricultural products. It has played a critical \nrole in developing nutrition standards and carrying out nutrition \nresearch. It has also developed techniques to maintain the quality of \nour soil, perhaps our greatest renewable natural resource. Its research \nhas helped farmers work more efficiently and profitably. And it has \nworked to develop ways to keep food affordable for consumers.\n  My State has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of ARS research, \nand the National Animal Disease Center at Ames, Iowa has played a vital \nrole over the years in carrying out the mission of ARS.\n  Hog cholera was one of the greatest problems faced by hog farmers in \nthis country for more than 130 years, since it was first reported in \nOhio in 1833. Outbreaks occurred frequently over the years, some \nresulting in the loss of more than one in 10 hogs in the U.S. In the \nearly 1960's, hog cholera was still costing farmers $50 million per \nyear.\n  Agricultural research at USDA on hog cholera, much of it carried out \nin Ames, IA, dates back to the 1903 discovery of the hog cholera virus. \nARS large scale studies starting in 1961 developed and tested a program \nto immunize hogs against cholera using killed virus. On the advice of \nARS, USDA regulatory officials banned interstate shipment of live virus \nor animals vaccinated with live virus. In January 1978, Secretary of \nAgriculture Bob Bergland announced that, as a result of an aggressive \ncampaign that employed the treatment techniques developed by ARS, that \nhog cholera had been entirely eradicated.\n  ARS has had many similar successes. The eradication of screwworm in \ncattle and Marek's disease in chickens has saved an untold amount of \nmoney by preventing livestock losses. It is estimated that the savings \nfrom the Marek's disease program is 44.3 times it's cost for every \ndollar spent on immunization, $44.30 is saved. For those who suggest \nthat domestic government spending does not help the economy, the work \nof ARS stands as a great example of a program that works and helps \nAmerican farmers be the best in the world.\n  So I salute the scientists of ARS for their 50 years of service to \nagriculture, and wish them 50 more. There are still many challenges to \nagriculture, and ARS will be there working to solve them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be read \nthe third time and passed, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This happens all the time. This is not \nsomething unique that we have developed, to send the bill over and have \nthem send it back with amendments. My friend from Kentucky used the \nterm it wasn't normal Senate procedure. Quite to the contrary, it is, \nMr. President.
